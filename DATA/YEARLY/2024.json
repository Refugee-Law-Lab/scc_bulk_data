The Crown appealed, arguing that the military judge failed to consider all of the evidence cumulatively and assessed the evidence on the wrong legal principles. A majority of the Court Martial Appeal Court dismissed the Crown\u2019s appeal. Justice McVeigh, in dissent, would have allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial.\nThe Crown appeals to this Court as of right.\nA majority of the Court is of the view that the appeal should be dismissed, substantially for the reasons of the majority of the Court Martial Appeal Court. The military judge\u2019s assessment of the evidence was thorough and cumulative. Reading the judgment as a whole, the military judge did not adopt a piecemeal or narrow approach to the evidence. In addition, we are not persuaded that the military judge applied the wrong legal principles. While we agree with all of the justices of the Court Martial Appeal Court that the military judge engaged in some improper speculation, we share the majority\u2019s view that these comments did not undermine the military judge\u2019s fundamental findings.\nFor her part, Justice O\u2019Bonsawin would allow the appeal for the reasons of Justice McVeigh, at paras. 39-90 and 119-26 (CanLII). Therefore, the appeal is dismissed.\nJUGEMENT\nL\u2019appel interjet\u00e9 contre l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour d\u2019appel de la cour martiale du Canada, num\u00e9ro CMAC-621, 2023 CACM 2, dat\u00e9 du 27 f\u00e9vrier 2023, a \u00e9t\u00e9 entendu le 16 janvier 2024 et la Cour a prononc\u00e9 oralement le m\u00eame jour le jugement suivant :\n[traduction] Le juge en chef \u2014 L\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 acquitt\u00e9 d\u2019agression sexuelle devant la Cour martiale. La Couronne a fait appel, plaidant que le juge militaire avait omis d\u2019effectuer une \u00e9valuation cumulative de l\u2019ensemble de la preuve et avait appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 celle-ci au regard des mauvais principes juridiques. La Cour d\u2019appel de la cour martiale a rejet\u00e9 \u00e0 la majorit\u00e9 l\u2019appel de la Couronne. La juge McVeigh, dissidente, aurait accueilli l\u2019appel et ordonn\u00e9 un nouveau proc\u00e8s.\nLa Couronne se pourvoit de plein droit devant notre Cour.\nLa Cour est majoritairement d\u2019avis que l\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9, essentiellement pour les motifs expos\u00e9s par les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel de la cour martiale.

As contemplated by the self\u2011government agreement, the VGFN adopted its own constitution, which provides for certain rights and freedoms for its citizens, rules for the organization of its government, and electoral rules and standards. Among other things, the VGFN Constitution includes a residency requirement stating that all Chief and Councillors must reside on the VGFN\u2019s settlement land, in the village of Old Crow in the traditional territory of the Vuntut Gwitchin, or relocate there within 14 days of their election.\nD, a Canadian citizen and a citizen of the VGFN, currently lives in Whitehorse, the capital of the Yukon, about 800 kilometres south of Old Crow. D wishes to stand for election as a VGFN Councillor but says she cannot move to Old Crow if elected, largely because her son requires access to medical care unavailable there. D challenged the residency requirement, asserting that it unjustifiably infringes her right to equality under s. 15(1) of the Charter. The VGFN countered that the residency requirement reflects its longstanding practice that its Chief and Councillors live on the Vuntut Gwitchin\u2019s traditional territory. The VGFN also said the Charter does not apply to it as a self\u2011governing First Nation. Alternatively, it argued that, should the Charter apply, the residency requirement does not violate D\u2019s right to equality and, even if it did, the requirement is nevertheless valid as it is shielded by s. 25 of the Charter, which the VGFN said upholds certain collective rights and freedoms of Indigenous peoples when those collective rights conflict with an individual\u2019s Charter rights. Both the trial judge and the Court of Appeal held that the Charter applies to the VGFN and to its Constitution, pursuant to s. 32(1) of the Charter, and held that if D\u2019s s. 15(1) equality right is infringed, the residency requirement is shielded by s. 25 of the Charter. D appeals on the question of the constitutional validity of the residency requirement, and the VGFN cross\u2011appeals on the question of the application of the Charter.\nHeld (Rowe J. dissenting on the cross\u2011appeal, Martin and O\u2019Bonsawin JJ. dissenting on the appeal): The appeal and the cross\u2011appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Wagner C.J. and C\u00f4t\u00e9, Kasirer and Jamal JJ.: The Charter applies to the VGFN and to its citizens like D, principally because the VGFN is a government by nature pursuant to s. 32(1) of the Charter. Furthermore, D has succeeded in showing that the residency requirement constitutes a prima facie infringement of her right to equality under s. 15(1) of the Charter. However, the residency requirement is an exercise of an \u201cother right or freedom\u201d that pertains to the Aboriginal peoples of Canada under s. 25 of the Charter. The residency requirement protects Indigenous difference \u2014 understood as interests connected to Aboriginal cultural difference, Aboriginal prior occupancy, Aboriginal prior sovereignty, or Aboriginal participation in the treaty process. D\u2019s s. 15(1) claim abrogates or derogates from this right, with which it is in irreconcilable conflict; as a result, pursuant to s. 25, D\u2019s s. 15(1) claim cannot be given effect.\nThe application of the Charter is addressed in s. 32(1), which identifies certain entities that are bound by the Charter. They include the legislature and government of each province in respect of provincial matters, as well as the federal Parliament and government in respect of federal matters, which includes territorial governments and territorial matters. Section 32(1) also explicitly contemplates that the Charter applies to other entities, including those that are controlled by government or that perform truly governmental functions. Such entities may be subject to the Charter in one of two ways, as set out in Eldridge v. British Columbia (Attorney General), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 624. First, an entity may be found to be \u201cgovernment\u201d for the purpose of s. 32(1) if it can be characterized as government by its very nature or because of the degree of governmental control exercised over it. In such a case, all the entity\u2019s activities are subject to the Charter. Second, even if an entity is not itself \u201cgovernment\u201d for s. 32(1) purposes, it will be subject to the Charter with respect to particular activities that can be ascribed to a government because they are governmental in nature. Parliament and the provinces cannot avoid their Charter obligations by conferring certain of their legislative responsibilities or powers on other entities that are not ordinarily subject to the Charter.\nIn respect of the \u201cby nature\u201d test of the first branch of the Eldridge framework, entities may be considered to be government by nature when they typically have the following features, which are neither necessary nor determinative, but which serve as useful indicia of government: (1) they are democratically elected by members of the public and accountable to their constituents; (2) they have a general taxing power that is indistinguishable from the taxing powers of Parliament or the provinces; (3) they are empowered to make, administer, and enforce laws within a defined territorial jurisdiction; and (4) they derive their existence and lawmaking authority from Parliament or the provinces, and they exercise powers that Parliament or the provinces would otherwise exercise. As for the \u201ccontrol\u201d test of the first branch, the Charter will apply to an entity upon which Parliament or the provinces confer governmental powers within their authority, if Parliament or the province in question has substantial control over the entity\u2019s activities. In such circumstances, the entity cannot be said to be operating autonomously from government within the meaning of s. 32(1) of the Charter.\nUnder the second branch of the Eldridge framework, the Court has previously recognized an entity\u2019s activities as being subject to the Charter where the entity: exercised discretion under government legislation about how to provide services; was created by statute and all of its actions at issue were taken pursuant to statutory authority; or implemented a specific government program and exercised powers of statutory compulsion. In such circumstances, an entity cannot escape Charter scrutiny merely because it is not part of government or controlled by government. Even if an entity is otherwise independent from government, the presence of a delegated statutory power of compulsion means that the entity has a coercive power of governance that is not possessed by private individuals, corporations, or organizations. It is this power that makes the Charter applicable to bodies exercising statutory authority.\nIn the instant case, the Charter applies to the VGFN Constitution\u2019s residency requirement because the VGFN is a government by nature under the first branch of the Eldridge framework. While the VGFN does not qualify as government under the \u201ccontrol\u201d test of the first branch because it is not substantially controlled by either the federal or the Yukon government, the VGFN as an Indigenous government illustrates the indicia for government by nature: the VGFN Council consists of members who are elected by eligible voters of the VGFN and are democratically accountable to their constituents, much like members of Parliament or a provincial legislature; the VGFN has general taxing powers that are materially indistinguishable from those of Parliament or the provinces; like Parliament and provincial legislatures, the VGFN is empowered to make, administer, and enforce coercive laws that are binding on VGFN citizens and on the public generally within its settlement land; and at least one source of the VGFN\u2019s lawmaking authority flows from Parliament, in that the VGFN exercises powers that Parliament otherwise would have exercised through its legislative jurisdiction.\nAdditionally, the Charter applies to the residency requirement because its enactment and enforcement by the VGFN constitutes a specific governmental activity. The residency requirement under the VGFN\u2019s Constitution was adopted at least in part under federal statutory authority (even assuming it also reflects the exercise of an inherent right to self-government). It involves the exercise of a statutory power of compulsion because it imposes legal restrictions on who may serve as a VGFN Chief or Councillor. The requirement has the force of law because it forms part of the VGFN Constitution, adopted under the VGFN\u2019s self\u2011government agreement, which was itself approved and given effect by the federal and territorial implementing legislation.\nSince the Charter applies to the VGFN\u2019s residency requirement, it must be determined whether the residency requirement unjustifiably infringes s. 15(1) of the Charter by barring D from serving on the VGFN Council unless she moves from Whitehorse to Old Crow within 14 days of her election. This issue requires a consideration of the framework for analyzing whether D\u2019s s. 15(1) Charter right, properly construed, abrogates or derogates from \u201caboriginal, treaty or other rights or freedoms that pertain to the aboriginal peoples of Canada\u201d under s. 25 of the Charter. For Indigenous communities, s. 32(1) and s. 25 of the Charter are intimately connected. While the application of individual Charter rights to a self\u2011governing Indigenous community pursuant to s. 32(1) may be thought to inhibit the pursuit of rules designed to protect minority Indigenous rights and interests, s. 25 acts as a counterweight by providing protection for collective Indigenous interests as a social and constitutional good for all Canadians. Properly understood, s. 25 allows for the assertion of individual Charter rights except where they conflict with Aboriginal rights, treaty rights, or other rights or freedoms that are shown to protect Indigenous difference.\nSection 25 must be considered in light of its purpose, with due consideration to its text, the Charter\u2019s character and larger object, and the provision\u2019s history. The purpose of s. 25 is to uphold certain collective rights and freedoms of Indigenous peoples when those collective rights conflict with an individual\u2019s Charter rights \u2014 i.e., to ensure that the designated rights and freedoms of Indigenous peoples are protected where giving effect to conflicting individual Charter rights and freedoms would diminish Indigenous difference. When an individual\u2019s Charter right would abrogate or derogate from an Aboriginal, treaty, or other right, s. 25 requires the collective Indigenous right to take precedence, even if the Charter claimant is a member of the Indigenous group concerned. This purpose aligns with the broad goals of s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 and is in step with the need to reconcile the sovereignty of the Crown with the reality that Indigenous peoples lived in North America, in distinct societies with laws, traditions, and customs, long before European contact. Section 25 echoes the aspiration to reconcile the guarantee of individual rights and freedoms in the Charter for all Canadians with the distinctive collective rights of Indigenous peoples.\nThe text of s. 25 refers to \u201caboriginal, treaty or other rights or freedoms\u201d. Aboriginal and treaty rights are protected by s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982. By including \u201cother\u201d rights and freedoms among those deserving of constitutional protection, s. 25 speaks to a wider range of rights than s. 35. It is clear from the text and purpose of s. 25 that the provision\u2019s protections are not restricted to rights with constitutional status. However, the text and purpose of s. 25 do suggest another substantive restriction: consonant with the principle of the protection of Indigenous peoples as a distinct minority, and because s. 25 was intended to protect rights associated with Indigenous difference, the \u201cother rights or freedoms\u201d in s. 25 are limited to those that protect Indigenous difference.\nThe protection of Aboriginal, treaty, and other rights in s. 25 is not, however, absolute. When a right has been shown to come within the scope of s. 25, its protections do not apply automatically. Those protections apply only if it is determined that there is irreconcilable conflict between the claimed Charter right and the s. 25 right, such that giving effect to the Charter right would undermine the Indigenous difference protected or recognized by the collective right. In any given case, the individual and collective rights referred to in s. 25 may not actually be in conflict. Some individual rights are part of Indigenous law and coexist with collective interests. In addition, s. 25 would not apply if the individual Charter right invoked conflicted with an Indigenous right that does not rest on Indigenous difference. And like s. 35 rights, the primacy afforded to the collective rights under s. 25 is subject to the equality guarantee for \u201cmale and female persons\u201d under s. 28 of the Charter and s. 35(4) of the Constitution Act, 1982.\nThere is broad consensus that s. 25 does not create new substantive rights. However, the details of s. 25\u2019s operation remain largely unsettled. The jurisprudence considers two competing views on the effect of s. 25 \u2014 first, as a \u201cshield\u201d, under which a successful invocation of s. 25 would bar a Charter claim in circumstances where applying the Charter right would abrogate or derogate from a right within the scope of s. 25; or second, as an \u201cinterpretative prism\u201d (or \u201cinterpretive prism\u201d), or rule of interpretation, under which courts would attempt to construe the relevant Charter right to give effect to it without abrogating or derogating from the identified s. 25 right. Under the latter view, if a conflict occurs, the Aboriginal, treaty, or other right would be afforded no special priority, and the question as to whether the collective Indigenous right should be upheld would be left to judicial discretion, to be determined on a case\u2011by\u2011case basis.\nThe proper approach to s. 25 includes elements drawn from both approaches. Section 25 can be said to have a shielding effect because it affords primacy to Aboriginal, treaty, or other rights. However, a right within the scope of s. 25 is only prioritized after an interpretative exercise demonstrates that there is an irreconcilable conflict between the collective right and the individual Charter right in question. While the provision will sometimes serve as a shield for Aboriginal, treaty, and other rights, to protect the collective minority interest of Indigenous peoples, an absolutist approach to s. 25 is inconsistent with a purposive approach to interpretation. It also stands in opposition to the idea that in Indigenous legal cultures, as in Canadian constitutional law, individual and collective rights are conceived as operating harmoniously.\nWith respect to the kind of conflict between the collective and individual rights concerned that must be shown for the s. 25 shield to operate, the conflict between the rights must be real and irreconcilable, such that there is no way to give effect to the individual Charter right without abrogating or derogating from the right within the scope of s. 25. The conflict cannot be hypothetical. The requirement of an irreconcilable conflict between the two rights best aligns with the purpose and text of s. 25 because if there is a way, through fair and careful interpretation, for courts to give effect to the Charter right and to the s. 25 identified right, then both rights are respected, and the conflict is averted. Determining whether there is an irreconcilable conflict between the rights at issue is an interpretive exercise. It requires courts to interpret the substance of both the Charter right and the Aboriginal, treaty, or other right at issue. This interpretive exercise must be informed by, and respectful of, Indigenous perspectives. At the same time, courts must be careful not to depart from the generous interpretation of individual Charter rights and freedoms mandated by the applicable jurisprudence.\nAs such, s. 25 does not serve as a shield whenever a right falling within its scope is at issue. Rather, when a Charter right is engaged by the exercise of an Aboriginal, treaty, or other right, courts must consider whether the two rights can be reconciled. If giving effect to the Charter right would only affect the s. 25 identified right incidentally or in a non\u2011essential manner \u2014 in the sense that it would not undermine Indigenous difference \u2014 or if the Charter right can be interpreted in a manner consistent with the Aboriginal, treaty, or other right, then it would be inappropriate to give priority to the right within the scope of s. 25. It is only when the s. 25 right is affected in a non-incidental manner, thereby creating an irreconcilable conflict between the two rights, that s. 25 will protect the Indigenous right by rendering the individual right ineffective to the extent of the conflict. In this sense, s. 25 will sometimes function as a shield, and at other times, it will have only an interpretive role.\nBecause s. 25 is directed at safeguarding Aboriginal, treaty or other rights that aim to protect Indigenous difference, the focus of s. 25 is on collective rights, irrespective of the identity of the individual or entity bringing the Charter challenge. The result is that the same analytical framework applies whether or not the Charter claimant is Indigenous, whether s. 25 is being asserted by an Indigenous group, or whether both parties are Indigenous. The s. 25 shield finds immediate application if a claimed Charter right abrogates or derogates from a collective s. 25 right, regardless of the parties involved. There is no basis in the text of s. 25 for finding that the protective shield should apply differently based on the parties\u2019 identities. There is, however, a need for great caution when the claim is brought by an Indigenous person against their own community; courts should proceed carefully to avoid unnecessarily or unwittingly imposing incompatible ideas or legal principles upon the community\u2019s distinctive Indigenous legal system.\nFinally, if s. 25 is invoked in the face of a Charter claim, courts should consider applying it at the earliest possible stage without unduly prejudicing the individual Charter challenge. Given the competing interests that must be reflected in the s. 25 framework, the earliest that s. 25 could be properly considered is once the Charter claimant has shown a prima facie breach of their Charter right. When Aboriginal, treaty, or other rights or freedoms specified in s. 25 are engaged, the limits on a competing individual Charter right need not be justified under s. 1 of the Charter. Unlike s. 1, s. 25 reflects a constitutional choice to protect the collective rights and freedoms of Indigenous peoples in Canada as a distinct minority. In keeping with a long tradition of respect for minorities, s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 provides protection for existing Aboriginal and treaty rights, while s. 25 of the Charter similarly sets forth a non\u2011derogation clause in favour of the rights of Indigenous peoples. The protection of s. 25 is allied with the strength of the promise to the Indigenous peoples of Canada in s. 35, which recognized not only the ancient occupation of land by Indigenous peoples, but also their contribution to the building of Canada, and the special commitments made to them by successive governments. Any justification under s. 1 should be required only if the court finds s. 25 inapplicable. This is so when there is no Aboriginal, treaty, or \u201cother right\u201d in play, when the \u201cother right\u201d does not engage Indigenous difference, or when there is no irreconcilable conflict between the rights. In those circumstances, the party defending the impugned action can still seek to justify the limitation under s. 1 of the Charter.\nThe framework under s. 25 therefore has four steps. First, the Charter claimant must show that the impugned conduct prima facie breaches an individual Charter right. If no prima facie case is made out, then the Charter claim fails and there is no need to proceed to s. 25. Second, the party invoking s. 25 \u2014 typically the party relying on a collective minority interest \u2014 must satisfy the court that the impugned conduct is a right, or an exercise of a right, protected under s. 25. That party bears the burden of demonstrating that the right for which it claims s. 25 protection is an Aboriginal, treaty, or other right. If the right at issue is an \u201cother right\u201d, then that same party must demonstrate the existence of the asserted right and the fact that the right protects or recognizes Indigenous difference. Third, the party invoking s. 25 must show irreconcilable conflict between the Charter right and the Aboriginal, treaty, or other right or its exercise. If the rights are irreconcilably in conflict, s. 25 will act as a shield to protect Indigenous difference. Fourth, courts must consider whether there are any applicable limits to the collective interest relied on. If s. 25 is found not to apply, the party invoking s. 25 may show that the impugned action is justified under s. 1 of the Charter.\nApplying this analysis to the present case, first, D\u2019s s. 15(1) Charter right was prima facie breached by the residency requirement, which created a distinction based on the analogous ground of non\u2011resident status in a self-governing Indigenous community, and this distinction reinforced and exacerbated D\u2019s existing disadvantage as a non\u2011resident member of the VGFN. With respect to the first step of the s. 15(1) test, D\u2019s non\u2011resident status in a self\u2011governing Indigenous community qualifies as an analogous ground. The historical and continuing disadvantage faced by Indigenous people living away from their traditional lands means that distinctions based on such a status will serve as constant markers of suspect decision making or potential discrimination. As for the second stage of the s. 15(1) analysis, the residency requirement, which draws a distinction on the basis of non\u2011resident status in a self\u2011governing Indigenous community, reinforces, perpetuates, or exacerbates D\u2019s disadvantage as a non-resident VGFN citizen.\nSecond, the VGFN has established that the residency requirement in its Constitution is an exercise of an Aboriginal, treaty, or other right under s. 25. It is an exercise of an \u201cother right\u201d, namely, the right to set criteria for membership in the VGFN\u2019s governing body. In light of the evidence and the factual findings at trial, the residency requirement is clearly an exercise of a right that protects interests associated with Indigenous difference. The right to impose residency\u2011based restrictions on the membership of its governing bodies enables Vuntut Gwitchin society to preserve the distinctive emphasis it places on its leaders\u2019 connection to the land. This is plainly a foundation for the connection between Indigenous difference and the residency requirement. Requiring VGFN leaders to reside on settlement land helps preserve the leaders\u2019 connection to the land, which is deeply rooted in the VGFN\u2019s distinctive culture and governance practices. It also bolsters the VGFN\u2019s ability to resist the outside forces that pull citizens away from its settlement land and prevents erosion of its important connection with the land. Such interests are associated with various aspects of Indigenous difference.\nThird, the VGFN has established that, properly interpreted, D\u2019s s. 15(1) right and its right within the scope of s. 25 are irreconcilably in conflict. To apply s. 15(1) would abrogate or derogate from the Vuntut Gwitchin\u2019s right to govern themselves in accordance with their own particular values and traditions and in accordance with the self\u2011government arrangements entered into with Canada and the Yukon. The Indigenous difference protected by the residency requirement is inextricably tied to the VGFN\u2019s connection to the settlement land. Permitting a Councillor to reside in Whitehorse would unacceptably diminish this connection and would undermine, in a non-incidental way, the VGFN\u2019s right to decide on the membership of its governing bodies. Giving effect to D\u2019s Charter right in such a manner would pose a real risk to the continued vitality of Indigenous difference and would abrogate or derogate from the VGFN\u2019s right, contrary to s. 25. This engages s. 25 as a protective shield, insulating the collective right from the individual Charter claim.\nFourth, while s. 25 protections may be subject to other limits, no such restrictions are relevant to this dispute. The Court of Appeal found that s. 25\u2019s protections extended to the entire residency requirement, including the 14\u2011day relocation rule, and D did not seek any relief regarding that rule, nor did she make arguments on severance. Finally, because s. 25 applies, the VGFN need not justify the residency requirement under s. 1 of the Charter.\nPer Martin and O\u2019Bonsawin JJ. (dissenting on the appeal): The appeal should be allowed, the cross\u2011appeal should be dismissed, and the residency requirement should be declared to be of no force or effect. There is agreement with the majority that the Charter applies to the impugned residency requirement, that the VGFN is a government by its very nature, and that the residency requirement infringes D\u2019s right to equality guaranteed by s. 15(1) of the Charter. There is disagreement with the majority, however, that the residency requirement falls within the ambit of s. 25 of the Charter. Rather, as it is not aimed at recognizing the special status of Indigenous collectives within the broader Canadian state, the residency requirement falls outside the ambit of s. 25 protection. Further, the residency requirement is not demonstrably justified pursuant to s. 1 of the Charter.\nThe Charter applies to governmental action taken by self-governing Indigenous nations both because they are governmental in nature and because the purpose of s. 32(1) was to extend the Charter\u2019s protections to address the power imbalance between the governed and those who govern. The purpose underlying the scope of the Charter\u2019s applicability is to address that power imbalance by subjecting governmental action to constitutional review in order to protect individual rights and freedoms. Section 32(1) captures governmental action in respect of \u201cmatters within the authority\u201d of Parliament and the provincial legislatures: any such governmental action is subject to Charter scrutiny. All orders of government are captured regardless of their connection to formal federal or provincial government structures. This broad ambit of s. 32(1) is supported by the Court\u2019s s. 32(1) jurisprudence, which has consistently affirmed the broad range of entities captured by the provision and recognized the importance of the power imbalance between the governed and those who govern to determining whether an entity is captured by s. 32(1). The broad ambit of s. 32(1) is also supported by other sections of the Constitution Act, 1982, for instance, s. 52(1) and s. 25, which provide guidance on how any particular interpretation of s. 32(1) would accord with the internal architecture of the Constitution of Canada.\nThe Charter therefore applies to Indigenous governments because they have lawmaking authority over legislative matters caught by s. 32(1). This recognition of self\u2011governing Indigenous nations as governments in their own right, and not by virtue of delegated power, falls clearly within the purpose and ambit of s. 32(1). The existing s. 32(1) jurisprudence is not directly applicable to Indigenous governments. Legal tests devised outside the distinct context of Indigenous governments should not be read as a complete answer on the scope of the Charter\u2019s applicability to self-governing Indigenous nations. The delegated authority or substantial control approaches used in the s. 32(1) jurisprudence should not be read as imposing a condition that authority be delegated by Parliament or the provincial legislatures for the Charter to apply. Consequently, delegation under s. 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867 is not required under the first branch of Eldridge when it is being applied to the unique situation of self\u2011governing Indigenous nations. It is not necessary for the impugned action to stem from authority granted by federal, provincial, or territorial legislation for it to be subject to Charter scrutiny. To interpret s. 32(1) and the Eldridge framework as being limited to situations of delegated authority would prioritize an overly textual approach to s. 32(1) and deprive Indigenous people of the Charter\u2019s protections when their rights have been infringed by their own governing bodies. This recognition of self\u2011governing Indigenous nations in their own right also upholds longstanding Indigenous practices of self\u2011governance and advances reconciliation in Canada.\nThere is agreement with the majority that the VGFN falls within the first branch of Eldridge as it is a government by nature and that, accordingly, it is subject to the Charter. There is also agreement that the VGFN\u2019s enactment of the residency requirement must attract Charter scrutiny. Indeed, the VGFN is a government by its very nature because it exercises legislative and executive powers pertaining to matters \u201cwithin the authority\u201d of Parliament and the provincial legislatures. Its structure and functions reflect its inherently governmental nature: it creates laws and makes decisions that benefit, order, and restrict the lives of its citizens. There is disagreement with the majority\u2019s notion that an essential factor for the Charter\u2019s applicability under s. 32(1) is that the source of the VGFN\u2019s lawmaking authority flows from Parliament. The VGFN is not a creature of statute, does not derive its lawmaking authority through delegation, and does not need to ground its governmental status by reference to what has been transferred from another level of government.\nSection 25 of the Charter operates as an interpretive aid to help protect the distinct collective rights Indigenous peoples possess as Aboriginal peoples of Canada by prescribing an interpretive exercise to resolve challenges posed by competing collective Indigenous rights and individual Charter rights. It plays a distinct role from other Charter provisions, operating to preserve a form of collective rights unique to Indigenous peoples while at the same time recognizing that when Indigenous governments do make distinctions between their citizens, individuals and minorities within the collective should nevertheless benefit from all the constitutionally entrenched protections of the Charter. Like other Charter provisions, s. 25 must be interpreted purposively. While on a fair textual reading, it is capable of supporting either of the competing approaches on its effect, that is, either a shield or an interpretive prism approach, based on its nature, purpose, and history, it was intended to operate as an interpretive prism.\nSection 25 furthers a particular purpose: to ensure that the introduction of a constitutionally entrenched bill of rights in Canada did not have the effect of abrogating or derogating from the unique rights held by Indigenous peoples that stem from their identity as Indigenous peoples. Legislative debates on constitutional reform shed light on its purpose. A review of the Charter drafting and negotiation process reveals a preservation of rights approach with respect to s. 25 \u2014 aimed at ensuring that the Charter would not lessen other existing rights, including unique rights held by Indigenous peoples. Earlier draft provisions of what became s. 25 suggest the government intended for the provision to protect collective Indigenous rights from being erased or excluded by the assertion of individual rights under relevant Charter sections. Three important conclusions about the purpose of s. 25 can be discerned from the provision\u2019s legislative origins. First, the inclusion of s. 25 was motivated by concerns about how the collective rights and interests of Indigenous peoples might interact with the constitutional entrenchment of individual rights \u2014 especially the right to equality under s. 15(1). Second, s. 25 was not intended to create or confer rights but rather was envisaged as an interpretive tool. Third, the provision\u2019s aim is to protect the special status of certain collective rights held by Indigenous peoples \u2014 rights that pertain uniquely to Indigenous peoples because they are Indigenous.\nMany other important principles arising from constitutional jurisprudence, from post\u20111982 constitutional engagement and from international sources support the conclusion that s. 25 operates as an interpretive prism that ensures both collective and individual rights are respected. These sources support the view that s. 25 should not be interpreted in a way that prohibits Indigenous claimants from accessing other sections of the Charter, including s. 15(1), even if the challenge is to their own communities\u2019 laws. The Court\u2019s jurisprudence has consistently affirmed that all parts of the Constitution must be read together and that there is no hierarchy among its various provisions. The 1996 Final Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples called for s. 25 to be given a flexible interpretation that takes account of the distinctive philosophies, traditions and cultural practices of Aboriginal peoples. The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which is binding on Canada, recognizes the need to protect both the collective and individual rights of Indigenous peoples and is illustrative of how one type of right cannot absolutely trump another. Further, Indigenous nations, as governments in their own right, can entrench the rights of their citizens in constitutional documents. These Indigenous legal orders form an integral part of Canadian law and Indigenous governments are not immunized from the responsibility of respecting the individual rights and freedoms articulated in the Charter, subject to the interpretive function performed by s. 25 when collective Indigenous rights are implicated.\nThere is disagreement with the majority as to the scope of protection afforded by s. 25. Rights within the scope of s. 25 are limited to those that are truly unique to Indigenous peoples because they are Indigenous. They do not extend to all matters on which Indigenous governments may act. The majority\u2019s formulation that an \u201cother\u201d right will fall within the ambit of s. 25 when the party seeking to rely on it establishes that the \u201cright protects or recognizes Indigenous difference\u201d is too broad and does not serve a meaningful filtering function at the rights recognition stage. It is not enough for a right to relate to Indigenous peoples to bring it within the scope of s. 25 or, in the context of self\u2011government, for an Indigenous nation to possess broad rights to govern its community. The focus must be on the collective right itself and whether it is unique to an Indigenous community on the basis of Indigeneity. In this context, intra\u2011group distinctions based on a personal characteristic other than Indigeneity will generally fall outside the ambit of s. 25, but s. 25 could capture laws that distinguish between Indigenous people and non\u2011Indigenous people for the purpose of protecting interests associated with Indigenous difference. This conception ensures that s. 25 does not serve to effectively create extensive Charter\u2011free zones in the context of Indigenous self\u2011government. Members of Indigenous communities must be able to challenge the actions of their own governments \u2014 they must not be denied important Charter protections which are intended to apply to every person.\nWhen s. 25 is invoked, the court must consider several issues to decide whether it applies. First, the claimant must demonstrate a breach of a Charter right or freedom. Second, the party relying on s. 25 must show that the implicated collective right or freedom at stake is an Aboriginal, treaty or other right or freedom that pertains to the Aboriginal peoples of Canada, such that it is unique to an Indigenous community on the basis of Indigeneity. Third, the court must attempt to reconcile the competing collective and individual rights where possible. Where there is a true conflict between both rights, it is at this point that a form of balancing must occur to reconcile the competing interests at play. In such cases, s. 25 directs the court to construe the individual Charter right so as not to abrogate or derogate from the right protected by s. 25. The court must assess whether giving effect to an individual Charter right would impact the collective right in more than a minor or incidental way, and whether the impugned exercise of the collective right is necessary to the maintenance of the Indigenous community\u2019s distinctive culture. Interpreting s. 25 purposively means accepting limitations on what constitutes an abrogation or derogation from a s. 25 right in order to avoid situations where an insignificant incursion on a collective right within the scope of s. 25 takes primacy over a potentially significant Charter violation. This approach incorporates a balance between collective Indigenous rights and individual Charter rights.\nIn the instant case, as the VGFN relies on s. 25 in relation to its residency requirement, the first question is whether D\u2019s right to equality guaranteed by s. 15(1) of the Charter is infringed by the VGFN\u2019s enactment of the residency requirement. There is agreement with the majority that it is. The residency requirement creates a distinction directly, on its face, based on whether a VGFN citizen lives on or off the VGFN\u2019s settlement land and that distinction is on the basis of the analogous ground of Aboriginality\u2011residence. Though the factual circumstances in this case are meaningfully distinct from those in Corbiere v. Canada (Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 203, in that the Corbiere context of off\u2011reserve members is not identical to that of VGFN citizens living outside their traditional territory, the legacy of colonialism through the Indian Act is a common thread that connects the two groups. The discrimination faced by Indigenous people living away from their communities as identified in Corbiere continues to be experienced by VGFN citizens, such that the analogous ground of Aboriginality-residence remains applicable in the instant case. The place of residence of VGFN citizens goes to the essence of their identities and, as a result, this characteristic is constructively immutable.\nFurther, the distinction created by the residency requirement is discriminatory because it denies D the benefit of serving in government, which is a form of political exclusion that bars her from a core aspect of democratic participation and the opportunity to affect decision-making processes that impact her. This benefit is denied in a discriminatory manner because the residency requirement reinforces the stereotypes that non\u2011resident VGFN citizens are less worthy and entitled because they live off their traditional territory and that to be truly Aboriginal, one has to live on the reserve or the settlement land. This at the very least perpetuates disadvantage. Requiring a non\u2011resident citizen to relocate to the settlement land to participate in community governance means requiring a person to change a constructively immutable characteristic. Such an illusory choice to move back to the settlement land is not relevant as a matter of law.\nThe second question is whether this case implicates a collective Indigenous right within the scope of s. 25. The residency requirement does not constitute the exercise of a right falling within the ambit of s. 25 because a self\u2011governing Indigenous nation\u2019s right to regulate the composition of its governing bodies cannot be said to be a unique collective right, belonging to Indigenous peoples because they are Indigenous. Rather, the residency requirement is directed at the internal regulation of the VGFN and is not aimed at recognizing the special status of Indigenous collectives within the broader Canadian state. Alternatively, even if the residency requirement did constitute the exercise of a right within the scope of s. 25, then, applying a balancing to reconcile the competing interests at play would nevertheless lead to the conclusion that s. 25 would not operate to give primacy to the residency requirement over individual Charter rights because the residency requirement would not constitute one that is necessary to the maintenance of the VGFN\u2019s distinctive culture.\nThe conclusion that s. 25 does not apply in this case does not mean that Indigenous difference is an irrelevant consideration in assessing the Charter claim. On the contrary \u2014 it has a significant role to play in the justification analysis under s. 1 of the Charter. Courts must respectfully take into account the perspective of the Indigenous community at all analytical stages. In the instant case, the residency requirement is not justified under s. 1. While it serves to advance the pressing and substantial objective of the promotion and maintenance of self\u2011governance and connection to the homelands and it is rationally connected to this objective in that it is critical and logical that elected leaders be connected to the traditional territory by being physically present on those lands, the residency requirement is not minimally impairing of D\u2019s s. 15(1) Charter right and the VGFN has not shown that the benefits of the residency requirement outweigh the negative effects of the s. 15(1) breach at issue. A minimally impairing measure must make at least some accommodation of the right to participate in community governance for non-resident citizens. There is no evidence that the VGFN has sought any meaningful alternatives to the residency requirement itself. While the residency requirement does ameliorate the effects of colonial dislocation of Vuntut Gwitchin peoples from control over their traditional territory, it also represents a significant incursion to democratic participation. It is therefore not representative of an appropriate balance between its salutary and deleterious effects.\nPer Rowe J. (dissenting on the cross\u2011appeal): D\u2019s appeal should be dismissed, the VGFN\u2019s cross\u2011appeal should be allowed and the orders of the lower courts should be set aside. On a proper application of s. 32(1) of the Charter, the VGFN\u2019s enactment of the residency requirement in its Constitution is not subject to the Charter. In light of this conclusion, it is not necessary to address arguments concerning ss. 15(1) or 25 of the Charter.\nThe scope of the Charter\u2019s application is delineated by s. 32(1) of the Charter. Section 32(1) governs who is subject to the burden of Charter rights, or, in other words, who is bound by the Charter. Relying on other bases for Charter applicability \u2014 such as s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 \u2014 is inconsistent with the jurisprudence. The text of s. 32(1), its history and place within the structure of the Constitution Act, 1982, and the jurisprudence on its purpose and scope confirm that the Charter applies only to the federal, provincial and territorial governments in respect of matters within their authority. It is a fundamental misconception to claim that the Charter applies to any entity that is a government or any activities that appear governmental, whether or not they have a connection to the federal or a provincial government.\nWith respect to the text of s. 32(1), the meaning of \u201cgovernment\u201d has been interpreted purposively so as to encompass the numerous manifestations of the federal and provincial governments, but other entities or their activities must exhibit a significant connection to one of those governments to fall within s. 32(1). The clear language used to address to whom and to what the Charter applies reflects s. 32(1)\u2019s purpose. No interpretation can be adopted that effectively rewrites s. 32(1) of the Charter, and any approach to Charter applicability under s. 32(1) cannot ignore the clear boundaries set out within the provision itself.\nThe history of s. 32(1) and its place within the structure of the Constitution Act, 1982 also confirm that the Charter \u2014 including s. 32(1) \u2014 was designed by the federal and provincial governments, for those governments, to entrench standards of constitutional behaviour that were tailored to the structures and philosophical underpinnings of federal and provincial governance. In contrast, the relationship between these governments and Indigenous peoples, and the place for Indigenous governance within contemporary Canada, were addressed separately in the Constitution Act, 1982. Most significantly, the collective rights of Indigenous peoples were given constitutional protection by means of s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982. Notably, s. 35 was placed outside of the Charter. While the Charter primarily concerned federal and provincial actors, the ultimate inclusion of s. 35 represents the culmination of a long and difficult struggle in both the political forum and the courts for the constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and treaty rights. The federal and provincial governments understood that the scope and limits of Indigenous governance would be addressed under s. 35 rather than through the Charter. As such, Indigenous internal governance does not fall within the scope of the Charter unless there exists a significant connection to the federal or a provincial government.\nAs well, the jurisprudence on the purpose and scope of s. 32(1) makes clear that only the federal and provincial governments were intended to fall within the scope of this provision. Consistent with a purposive approach to Charter interpretation, the scope of s. 32(1) must be interpreted in a manner that reflects how the federal and provincial governments take form in modern Canadian society. The jurisprudence has recognized that entities within the modern administrative state take on various forms, with varying degrees of autonomy from the federal and provincial governments in their operations. Thus, a significant connection to the federal or a provincial government is required to ensure that those governments cannot evade Charter scrutiny, including by acting through entities that are effectively extensions of those governments or by delegating the implementation of particular policies or programs to non\u2011governmental entities. If the federal and provincial governments cannot perform an activity directly without violating the Charter, they cannot evade Charter scrutiny by delegating the activity to a non\u2011governmental entity. Even if another entity is charged with performing it, the nature of the activity has not changed: it remains that of the federal or a provincial government. The non\u2011governmental entities are merely the vehicles chosen by the government for the accomplishment of what are, in essence, activities that can be ascribed to that government.\nThe Court in Eldridge set out a two\u2011branch framework to give effect to s. 32(1). Under the first branch, a court may conclude that an entity is itself \u201cgovernment\u201d for the purposes of s. 32(1) either by its very nature or by virtue of the degree of governmental control exercised over it. The level of control must be routine or regular rather than ultimate or extraordinary; this standard entails a significant connection to the federal or a provincial government. Entities found to be within the scope of s. 32(1) have been described in the jurisprudence as part of the apparatus or fabric of government; as subordinate bodies, organs, or an emanation of government; or assimilated to the government itself. In each case, the entity owed both its existence and authority to the federal or a provincial government. A significant connection to the Crown is required. If the entity itself is found to fall under s. 32(1), all of the entity\u2019s activities are subject to the Charter. Under the second branch of the framework, a court may conclude that while the entity itself cannot be equated with the federal or a provincial government, some of its particular activities can be ascribed to government, namely where the activity involves the implementation of a specific statutory scheme or a government program. In such a case, only those activities attract Charter scrutiny because they are, effectively, the activities of the federal or a provincial government under s. 32(1). A significant connection to the federal or a provincial government is also required under this branch. What is necessary is a direct and precisely\u2011defined connection between the federal or provincial government and the activity.\nIn the instant case, the various arrangements between the VGFN and the federal and\/or Yukon governments \u2014 including multiple instruments, such as the VFGN Final Agreement, a treaty protected by s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982, the VGFN Self\u2011Government Agreement, and legislation passed by Parliament and the Yukon legislature to give effect to these agreements \u2014 do not satisfy the significant connection necessary to bring the VGFN or its enactment of the residency requirement within the scope of s. 32(1). To imply that because the self\u2011government agreement in this case was authorized by federal legislation, the VGFN is somehow an emanation of federal authority, is fundamentally inconsistent with the nature, status and purpose of Indigenous self\u2011government. The idea of self-government is not that it is an authority that flows from Parliament, but rather involves Indigenous peoples exercising authority that is rightfully theirs. None of the aspects of the VGFN arrangements with the federal and Yukon governments show that either branch of the s. 32(1) framework applies. To the contrary, they reinforce that the VGFN is distinct from the Crown, including in enacting the residency requirement pursuant to its own laws, customs, and practices. To apply the Charter would amount to viewing the VGFN as an extension of either the federal or the Yukon government or its enactment of the residency requirement as ascribable to one of them. Such an understanding is not only inconsistent with the VGFN\u2019s arrangements with both governments, but is also inconsistent with the special relationship between the federal and territorial governments and the Vuntut Gwitchin. The VGFN\u2019s governance structures and internal decisions are rooted in its own legal traditions and choices and do not attract Charter scrutiny under s. 32(1).\nMoreover, imposing the Charter on the VGFN is not consistent with the objective of reconciliation and with the need to respect the ability and the right of the Vuntut Gwitchin to make decisions pursuant to their own laws, customs, and practices. This includes decisions about the adoption and amendment of protections for the rights and freedoms of VGFN citizens. The philosophical underpinnings of the Charter may not necessarily be commensurate with some Indigenous worldviews and with the structure of Indigenous governing bodies which seek to maintain traditional structures integrated with contemporary forms of government. There may be tensions between the Charter\u2019s general focus on rights and Indigenous communities\u2019 preference for a more relational, reciprocal understanding of relationships, duties, and responsibilities. And, Indigenous communities may see the balance between individual and collective rights, and between individuals and the state, differently. Even where the value systems and legal traditions of specific Indigenous communities point to the same result as the Charter, their mode of reasoning may differ. Rather than a monolithic form of rights analysis, Indigenous communities can craft protections for human rights which integrate their particular and distinct forms of Indigenous law.\nWhile Charter protections are not inherently in tension with the desires of Indigenous communities, including the VGFN, and while it should not be assumed that individual rights are necessarily in conflict with collective Indigenous governance, nor that Indigenous communities are static, it is clear that the Charter should not be imposed on Indigenous peoples. For the Charter to be unilaterally imposed through a questionable interpretation of s. 32(1) would turn the clock back to a time when Aboriginal peoples were often not given the opportunity to participate when important decisions affecting their constitutional rights were made. The VGFN\u2019s choices should not be scrutinized by transposing an instrument designed by and for the federal and provincial governments onto the Vuntut Gwitchin, who did not participate in its creation or agree to its terms. To do so would be to subject the VGFN to the sort of oversight from which it sought to remove itself.\nFinally, the VGFN never agreed to adopt the protections set out in the Charter or to apply Charter protections to its Constitution and laws. Neither the VGFN Final Agreement nor the VGFN Self\u2011Government Agreement refers to the Charter. None of their provisions suggest, much less clearly and unambiguously state, that the VGFN agreed to the applicability of the Charter. Rather, the VGFN enacted its own protections for the rights of its citizens, many of which mirror the Charter but are adjusted to its people\u2019s own laws, customs, and practices. Individual rights are respected by the VGFN and VGFN citizens are not deprived of fundamental rights; nor do they exist in a rights\u2011free zone. The VGFN\u2019s governance structures include protections for equality rights. As well, the VGFN has constitutionally entrenched rights and freedoms alongside procedures for VGFN citizens to challenge VGFN laws. Any challenge to a provision of the VGFN Constitution must be addressed pursuant to the VGFN\u2019s own internal structures and processes. Because D seeks to challenge an internal rule of the VGFN in order to participate in its governance, her claim must therefore be addressed based on the rights enshrined within the VGFN Constitution, pursuant to the VGFN\u2019s own governance structures and processes, not the Charter.\nCases Cited\nBy Kasirer and Jamal JJ.\nApplied: Godbout v.

Overview\n[1] As a self\u2011governing Indigenous community in the Yukon, the Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation (or the VGFN) has its own Constitution that provides for certain rights and freedoms for its citizens, rules for the organization of its government, as well as electoral rules and standards. At the heart of this appeal is a requirement in the VGFN Constitution that the elected Chief and Councillors reside on the settlement land of the First Nation, or relocate there within 14 days of the election. The VGFN\u2019s seat of government is based in Old Crow, a village located about 800 kilometres north of Whitehorse in the traditional territory of the Vuntut Gwitchin and constituting the VGFN\u2019s main community in its settlement land.\n[2] Cindy Dickson, a citizen of the VGFN and of Canada, lives in Whitehorse and is constrained, for personal reasons, to stay there. She wishes to stand for election as a VGFN Councillor and says the residency requirement discriminates against her as a non\u2011resident of the settlement land. She brought a petition in the Supreme Court of Yukon arguing that the requirement violates both her right to equality guaranteed under s. 15(1) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and her right to equality guaranteed by Article IV of the VGFN Constitution (in this Court, Ms. Dickson did not pursue her original challenge based on the equality guarantee in the VGFN Constitution).\n[3] Here the debate has focused on the application of the Charter to the VGFN, the ambit of Ms. Dickson\u2019s equality right under s. 15(1), and the proper interpretation of s. 25 of the Charter. The VGFN says the Charter does not apply to it as a self\u2011governing First Nation. Alternatively, should the Charter apply, the residency requirement does not violate Ms. Dickson\u2019s right to equality and, even if it did, the requirement is nevertheless valid as it is \u201cshielded\u201d by s. 25 of the Charter. Specifically, the VGFN submits that the residency requirement protects collective minority rights relating to its traditional Indigenous modes of government and leadership. As a collective Indigenous right, the provision of the VGFN Constitution cannot be abrogated or derogated from by Ms. Dickson\u2019s individual Charter right.\n[4] This appeal raises two novel issues bearing on the application of the Charter to a self\u2011governing Indigenous community. First, it invites the Court to consider whether, pursuant to s. 32(1) of the Charter, the VGFN is a government by nature or whether it is exercising a governmental activity so that Ms. Dickson\u2019s individual Charter right would apply to its residency requirement. Second, if the Charter does apply to the VGFN, the Court must determine whether s. 25 can be invoked by the VGFN to shield the residency requirement from Ms. Dickson\u2019s Charter challenge. Both the Supreme Court of Yukon and the Court of Appeal held that the Charter applied and that if Ms. Dickson\u2019s s. 15(1) equality right was infringed, the residency requirement was shielded by s. 25. Ms. Dickson appealed on the question of the constitutional validity of the residency requirement, and the VGFN cross\u2011appealed on the question of the application of the Charter.\n[5] We would dismiss Ms. Dickson\u2019s appeal. The Charter applies to the VGFN and to its citizens like Ms. Dickson, principally, but not only, because the VGFN is a government by nature. The circumstances here show that for Indigenous communities, s. 32(1) and s. 25 are intimately connected. It is true that the application of individual Charter rights to a self\u2011governing Indigenous community may be thought to inhibit the pursuit of rules designed to protect minority Indigenous rights and interests. But s. 25, by providing protection for collective Indigenous interests as a social and constitutional good for all Canadians, acts as a counterweight. Properly understood, s. 25 allows for the assertion of individual Charter rights except where they conflict with Aboriginal rights, treaty rights, or \u201cother rights or freedoms\u201d that are shown to protect Indigenous difference.\n[6] While Ms. Dickson has succeeded in showing a prima facie infringement of her right to equality under s. 15(1) of the Charter, as a non\u2011resident seeking election to the VGFN government, the VGFN has satisfied us that s. 25 protects its residency requirement from abrogation or derogation by her Charter right. Tied to ancient practices of government that connect leadership of the VGFN community to the settlement land, the residency requirement protects Indigenous difference and, pursuant to s. 25, cannot be abrogated or derogated from by Ms. Dickson\u2019s individual Charter right with which it is in irreconcilable conflict.\nII. Background\nA. The Parties\n[7] The appellant, Cindy Dickson, is a Canadian citizen and a citizen of the respondent, the VGFN, whose traditional territory is in northern Yukon. The VGFN\u2019s seat of government is in the village of Old Crow, which is located in the VGFN\u2019s settlement land. Ms. Dickson currently lives in Whitehorse, the capital of the Yukon, about 800 kilometres south of Old Crow.\n[8] Old Crow is the northernmost community in the Yukon and the most northwest in Canada. Because there are no all-season roads to Old Crow, the community is regularly accessible only by plane: it is a \u201cfly in, fly out\u201d community. About 260 VGFN citizens live in Old Crow; about 301 VGFN citizens live elsewhere, primarily in Whitehorse but also in other parts of Canada. The Vuntut Gwitchin were traditionally a nomadic people.\n[9] During her lifetime, Ms. Dickson has lived in both Whitehorse and Old Crow, in other Yukon communities, and in Victoria, British Columbia. She was born in Whitehorse, lived in Old Crow from the age of 9 to 16, and then moved back to Whitehorse to finish high school because Old Crow did not have a full high school program. She visited during the summers and still owns a cabin there. She also has family and friends in Old Crow.\nB. Ms. Dickson\u2019s Constitutional Challenge\n[10] Ms. Dickson wishes to stand for election as a VGFN Councillor \u2014 a paid full-time position. In her petition before the Supreme Court of Yukon, she asserted that her right to equality under s. 15(1) of the Charter, or in the alternative, under the equality guarantee in Article IV of the VGFN Constitution, is unjustifiably infringed by a provision of the VGFN Constitution requiring the elected Chief and Councillors to reside on the VGFN\u2019s settlement land at the time of their election or to relocate there within 14 days after their election. She says she cannot move to Old Crow largely because her son requires access to medical care unavailable there, but also because her job and her son\u2019s father are in Whitehorse.\n[11] The VGFN says the residency requirement reflects the VGFN\u2019s longstanding practice that its Chief and Councillors live on its traditional territory. As the trial judge found, the Vuntut Gwitchin have governed themselves according to their traditional practices since well before Confederation. From time immemorial, all VGFN Chiefs and Councillors have lived on the VGFN\u2019s traditional territory. In the last 30 years, they have always lived in Old Crow. Under funding arrangements with the federal and Yukon governments, most programs and services administered by the VGFN government are for VGFN citizens living on the VGFN\u2019s settlement land.\nC. Legal Framework for VGFN Self\u2011Government and the Residency Requirement\n[12] Ms. Dickson\u2019s challenge to the residency requirement arises in the context of the legal framework established by the modern land claim treaty process and self\u2011government agreements among the VGFN and the federal and Yukon governments. That framework involves an \u201cumbrella agreement\u201d negotiated with all 14 of the Yukon First Nations, as well as specific modern treaties and self\u2011government agreements with 11 individual First Nations, including the VGFN, which have been approved and given effect by federal and territorial legislation.\n[13] Ms. Dickson\u2019s challenge also arises in the context of the legal framework of self\u2011government cultivated by the Vuntut Gwitchin since time immemorial. Many aspects of that framework are reflected in the VGFN Constitution. The residency requirement is said to be grounded in the culture, law, and values of the Vuntut Gwitchin, and to be an expression of their longstanding land-based governance system.\n(1) The Umbrella Agreement\n[14] In 1993, after 20 years of negotiation, representatives of all Yukon First Nations and the federal and Yukon governments concluded an \u201cumbrella agreement\u201d to establish a framework for modern comprehensive land claims agreements in the Yukon. The umbrella agreement contemplated specific agreements between the federal government, the Yukon government, and individual First Nations that would be constitutionally protected as treaties under s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982.\n[15] The umbrella agreement has been described as a \u201cmonumental achievement\u201d (Beckman v. Little Salmon\/Carmacks First Nation, 2010 SCC 53, [2010] 3 S.C.R. 103, at para. 2). It established a framework for Indigenous self\u2011government and the management of land and resources by Yukon First Nations. Under treaties concluded after \u201clengthy negotiations between well-resourced and sophisticated parties\u201d, the Yukon First Nations \u201csurrendered their Aboriginal rights in almost 484,000 square kilometres, roughly the size of Spain, in exchange for defined treaty rights in respect of land tenure and a quantum of settlement land (41,595 square kilometres), access to Crown lands, fish and wildlife harvesting, heritage resources, financial compensation, and participation in the management of public resources\u201d (para. 9).\n[16] The umbrella agreement has also been called a \u201cmodel for reconciliation\u201d (First Nation of Nacho Nyak Dun v. Yukon, 2017 SCC 58, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 576, at para. 10). The 11 specific treaties negotiated under this agreement promote reconciliation \u201cnot only by addressing grievances over the land claims but by creating the legal basis to foster a positive long-term relationship\u201d between Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities and by placing that relationship \u201cin the mainstream legal system with its advantages of continuity, transparency, and predictability\u201d (Beckman, at paras. 10 and 12). The Yukon treaties are modern treaties with a \u201csui generis nature\u201d that \u201cset out in precise terms a co-operative governance relationship\u201d (First Nation of Nacho Nyak Dun, at para. 33).\n(2) The VGFN Final Agreement\n[17] In 1993, the VGFN and the federal and Yukon governments concluded the Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation Final Agreement, a land claim agreement under the framework of the umbrella agreement. The Final Agreement provides for the negotiation of a self\u2011government agreement addressing a host of the VGFN\u2019s self\u2011government powers \u201cin conformity with the Constitution of Canada\u201d (s. 24.1.2). It also states that any self\u2011government agreement \u201cshall not affect\u201d the rights of VGFN persons \u201cas Canadian citizens\u201d and, unless otherwise provided under a self\u2011government agreement or legislation enacted thereunder, \u201ctheir entitlement to all of the services, benefits and protections of other citizens applicable from time to time\u201d (s. 24.1.3). Among other things, the Final Agreement provides that, in order to be tax exempt under s. 149(1) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.), the VGFN would be conferred the status of a \u201cmunicipality or public body performing the functions of government or a municipal corporation\u201d (s. 24.8.1). Absent agreement to the contrary, the VGFN is restricted \u201cto the provision of government or other public services\u201d, and is not permitted to engage in commercial activities (s. 24.8.2).\n[18] Like the other Yukon First Nations land claim agreements, the VGFN\u2019s Final Agreement has been approved and given effect by federal and territorial legislation. It has also been given the status of a treaty under s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 (see Yukon First Nations Land Claims Settlement Act, S.C. 1994, c. 34, s. 6(1); An Act Approving Yukon Land Claim Final Agreements, R.S.Y. 2002, c. 240, s. 2). The federal legislation provides that the Indian Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-5, no longer applies to the VGFN settlement land, but otherwise federal and territorial laws generally continue to apply to the VGFN and its settlement land (Yukon First Nations Land Claims Settlement Act, ss. 12 and 13).\n(3) The VGFN Self\u2011Government Agreement, the Self\u2011Government Legislation, and the VGFN Constitution\n(a) The VGFN\u2019s Self\u2011Government Agreement\n[19] As contemplated by the Final Agreement, the VGFN and the federal and Yukon governments concluded the Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation Self-Government Agreement (1993), which states that the VGFN \u201cshall have\u201d self-government powers, including, among other things, the power to adopt a VGFN Constitution (s. 10.0), legislative powers (s. 13.0), and taxation powers (s. 14.0).\n[20] As required by the Final Agreement, the Self-Government Agreement \u201cshall not affect the rights of [VGFN] Citizens as Canadian citizens\u201d, and, unless otherwise provided pursuant to the Self\u2011Government Agreement or a law enacted by the VGFN, \u201cthe entitlement of [VGFN] Citizens to all of the benefits, services, and protections of other Canadian citizens applicable from time to time\u201d (s. 3.6).\n[21] The Self\u2011Government Agreement, unlike the Final Agreement, does not have the status of a treaty under s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 (Final Agreement, at s. 24.12.1). Even so, this does not preclude the VGFN from later acquiring constitutional protection for self-government under future constitutional amendments, if agreed to by the VGFN and the federal government (Final Agreement, at s. 24.12.2).\n[22] The VGFN says that the Final Agreement and the Self\u2011Government Agreement are silent regarding the application of the Charter, and that during the negotiations it opposed provisions that would have applied the Charter to VGFN self-government. The VGFN\u2019s position is that the \u201cVGFN did not agree the Charter would apply. Instead, [it] enacted [its] own Constitution, which provides protection for individual rights of VGFN Citizens within contemporary VGFN self-governance\u201d (R.F., at para. 3).\n(b) The Self\u2011Government Legislation\n[23] The VGFN\u2019s Self\u2011Government Agreement has been approved and given effect by federal and territorial legislation (Yukon First Nations Self-Government Act, S.C. 1994, c. 35; First Nations (Yukon) Self-government Act, R.S.Y. 2002, c. 90). The Yukon legislation approves the various self-government agreements and gives them \u201cthe force of law\u201d (s. 2). The federal legislation regulates the exercise of self\u2011government powers by Yukon First Nations in greater detail:\n\u2022 Yukon First Nation self-government agreements are to be \u201cin accordance with the Constitution of Canada\u201d (preamble).\n\u2022 Each of the Yukon First Nations is \u201ca legal entity having the capacity, rights, powers and privileges of a natural person\u201d (s. 7). Further, each Yukon First Nation \u201csucceeds to the rights, titles, interests, obligations, assets and liabilities of its predecessor band [which was constituted as a band under the Indian Act] and that band ceases to exist\u201d (ss. 2, 6(1) and Sch. I).\n\u2022 The constitution of a Yukon First Nation \u201cshall\u201d, among other matters, \u201cin a manner consistent with its self-government agreement, provide for . . . the governing bodies of the first nation and their composition, membership, powers, duties and procedures\u201d and \u201cthe recognition and protection of the rights and freedoms of citizens\u201d (s. 8(1)(b) and (d)).\n\u2022 Federal and territorial laws apply to Yukon First Nations (s. 16), except for the Indian Act, which no longer applies to Yukon First Nations, other than to register First Nation citizens as \u201cIndians\u201d (s. 17(1)).\n\u2022 The federal legislation prescribes rules and procedures for a Yukon First Nation\u2019s exercise of lawmaking authority. Yukon First Nations must maintain a register of laws and adopt procedures for the registration of laws, and the federal legislation stipulates rules for the commencement and proof of laws (s. 10). The federal legislation also lists the specific legislative powers that Yukon First Nations may exercise (s. 11 and Sch. III).\n\u2022 Each Yukon First Nation is deemed to be \u201ca public body performing a function of government in Canada\u201d in order to be tax exempt under s. 149(1)(c) of the Income Tax Act (s. 18(1)).\n\u2022 For greater certainty, the Yukon First Nation settlement lands are stated to \u201cremain lands reserved for the Indians within the meaning of class 24 of section 91 of the Constitution Act, 1867\u201d (s. 22(4)).\n(c) The VGFN Constitution\n[24] In accordance with the federal legislation, the VGFN Constitution details how the VGFN is governed, and it is stated to be the supreme law of the VGFN, subject only to the VGFN\u2019s Self-Government Agreement (Article II(3)). The VGFN Constitution states that \u201c[t]he seat of government for the Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation shall be located within Settlement Land\u201d (Article II(2)). As noted above, the Self\u2011Government Agreement decrees that it \u201cshall not affect the rights of [VGFN] Citizens as Canadian citizens\u201d (s. 3.6.1).\n[25] The rights and freedoms set out in the VGFN Constitution are themselves \u201csubject only to such reasonable limits as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic Vuntut Gwitchin society\u201d (Article IV(1)). The VGFN Constitution guarantees certain rights of VGFN citizens (Article IV), including the right of individuals to be equal before and under the laws of the VGFN and the right to the equal protection and benefit of VGFN law without discrimination (Article IV(7)). The Constitution states that every VGFN citizen \u201chas the right to make political choices, to participate in political activities, and to express a view on any public issue\u201d (Article IV(3)). The Constitution also outlines the organization of the VGFN government (Article V), and establishes an elected Council to govern the VGFN consisting of one Chief and four Councillors (Article VIII).\n[26] Under the VGFN Constitution, a VGFN citizen who seeks to run for the position of Chief or Councillor must be 18 years or older and have no indictable offence convictions for five years before the election (Article XI(1)). Candidates for office must also meet the residency requirement \u2014 they must reside on the VGFN\u2019s settlement land or relocate there \u201cwithin 14 days after election day\u201d (Article XI(2)). This is the provision challenged by Ms. Dickson.\n[27] The validity of a VGFN law (including the VGFN Constitution) may be challenged in the Yukon Supreme Court until the VGFN establishes its own court (Article II(5)). To date, no VGFN court has been established.\nIII. Judicial History\nA. Supreme Court of Yukon, 2020 YKSC 22, 461 C.R.R. (2d) 230 (Veale C.J.)\n[28] The trial judge rejected Ms. Dickson\u2019s constitutional challenge to the residency requirement in the VGFN Constitution. He accepted that the Charter applies to the residency requirement, but ruled that the requirement does not infringe s. 15(1) of the Charter, except for the 14-day relocation rule, which he would have severed. In the alternative, the trial judge ruled that even if the residency requirement infringes s. 15(1) of the Charter, s. 25 of the Charter acts as a shield to prevent Charter rights, such as Ms. Dickson\u2019s rights under s. 15(1), from abrogating or derogating from the exercise of self-government rights by the VGFN.\n[29] The trial judge accepted that \u201cnothing in the VGFN Final Agreement or VGFN Self-Government Agreement explicitly states that the Charter does not apply to the VGFN Government\u201d (para. 118). He noted that the Final Agreement and the Self-Government Agreement \u201cdo not expressly refer to the application of the Charter\u201d (para. 110). He added that s. 24.1.2 of the Final Agreement provided that the self-government agreement to be negotiated was to be \u201cin conformity with the Constitution of Canada\u201d, which includes the Charter (para. 110).\n[30] The trial judge held that the Charter applies to the residency requirement of the VGFN Constitution, whether the residency requirement is viewed as an exercise of an inherent right of self-government or as an \u201cexercise of the VGFN Self-Government Agreement implemented by federal and territorial legislation\u201d (para. 130). He stated that \u201c[b]oth are parts of Canada\u2019s constitutional fabric\u201d (para. 130). The trial judge also held that \u201c[t]he VGFN government, Constitution and laws are part of Canada\u2019s constitutional fabric\u201d (para. 131). In his view, the Charter applies to the VGFN government, Constitution, and laws, and the \u201crights of VGFN citizens as Canadian citizens includes the exercise of their rights and freedoms guaranteed in the Charter\u201d (para. 131). The VGFN acts as a government and performs government activities, and is thus subject to the Charter (para. 131).\n[31] The trial judge rejected Ms. Dickson\u2019s challenge to the residency requirement under s. 15(1) of the Charter, and did not address her alternative argument under the equality guarantee of the VGFN Constitution. He ruled that it is not discriminatory to require a salaried lawmaker to reside on the settlement land that will be the focus of the legislative function of Chief and Council (para. 156). Even so, he accepted that the 14-day relocation rule creates a disadvantage and could result in arbitrary disenfranchisement, contrary to s. 15(1) of the Charter, and cannot be justified under s. 1 of the Charter (paras. 162-65). He severed this aspect of the residency requirement, but suspended the declaration of invalidity for 18 months to allow the VGFN time to review the matter before the next election date (paras. 166\u201171).\n[32] In the alternative, the trial judge added that if the residency requirement breaches s. 15(1) of the Charter even with the words \u201cwithin 14 days after election day\u201d severed, then s. 25 of the Charter \u201cshields\u201d the VGFN\u2019s right to adopt the requirement as part of the VGFN Constitution. In his view, Ms. Dickson\u2019s right to be elected but continue to reside in Whitehorse, some 800 kilometres away from the VGFN\u2019s settlement land, would abrogate or derogate from or impair the residency requirement, which the VGFN has constitutionalized as a self-governing First Nation (para. 210).\nB. Court of Appeal of Yukon, 2021 YKCA 5, 495 C.R.R. (2d) 98 (Bauman C.J. and Newbury J.A., Frankel J.A. Dissenting in Part)\n[33] Ms. Dickson appealed the trial judge\u2019s ruling on the basis that he erred in concluding that only the 14-day relocation rule infringes s. 15(1) of the Charter, and in the alternative, that s. 25 of the Charter shields any infringement. The VGFN cross-appealed the trial judge\u2019s rulings that the Charter applies to the VGFN and its Constitution, and that the relocation rule infringes s. 15(1) of the Charter.\n[34] A majority of the Yukon Court of Appeal allowed Ms. Dickson\u2019s appeal and allowed the VGFN\u2019s cross-appeal, concluding that the residency requirement (including the 14-day relocation rule) does not infringe the Charter. The court accepted that the Charter applies to the residency requirement and ruled that the residency requirement as a whole infringes s. 15(1) of the Charter, but held that s. 25 of the Charter shields the residency requirement from abrogation or derogation by individual Charter rights. Justice Frankel wrote a partial dissent concerning the precise disposition of the appeal and whether the court should make declarations, but those issues are not before this Court. He agreed with the majority reasons that Ms. Dickson\u2019s Charter challenge to the residency requirement should fail. He also agreed with the majority\u2019s conclusion to set aside the trial judgment and dismiss the petition. He disagreed that the court\u2019s order should contain declarations. He would have dismissed Ms. Dickson\u2019s appeal, allowed the VGFN\u2019s cross\u2011appeal, and refrained from making the declarations set out in the majority\u2019s disposition.\n[35] Although the trial judge\u2019s order had stated that the Charter applies to the VGFN\u2019s \u201cGovernment, Constitution and laws\u201d, the Court of Appeal narrowed the issue to whether the Charter applies to the residency requirement specifically (paras. 74 and 83). With respect to whether the Final Agreement and Self-Government Agreement expressly addressed the application of the Charter to the VGFN, the Court of Appeal noted that \u201cjust as the VGFN negotiators did not wish to acknowledge the Charter as binding on them, the negotiators for Canada could not be seen to agree to any \u2018Charter-free zone\u2019, given the Charter\u2019s status as the \u2018supreme law\u2019 of Canada\u201d (para. 97). The court stated that the Final Agreement and Self-Government Agreement support the view that the Charter applies to the residency requirement, and that all VGFN citizens \u201cremain entitled to their rights under the Charter in the same way as other citizens of Canada\u201d (para. 97).\n[36] The Court of Appeal accepted that the Charter applies to the residency requirement, whether the source of the VGFN\u2019s authority to impose it is the VGFN\u2019s inherent right of self-government or the VGFN\u2019s Final Agreement and Self\u2011Government Agreement as ratified by federal and territorial legislation. On either basis, the court held, the VGFN is \u201cby its very nature\u201d exercising governmental powers under s. 32(1) of the Charter, such that the Charter applies (para. 98).\n[37] The Court of Appeal concluded that the residency requirement infringes s. 15(1) of the Charter by requiring Ms. Dickson to choose between the right to seek office and the right to remain in Whitehorse (paras. 110 and 112). However, it held the residency requirement is \u201cshielded\u201d, in its entirety, by s. 25 of the Charter (paras. 149 and 158). As the court explained, \u201cto apply s. 15(1) would indeed derogate from the Vuntut Gwitchin\u2019s rights to govern themselves\u201d in accordance with their values, traditions, and self-government arrangements (para. 149). As a result, the court ruled that the residency requirement, including the 14\u2011day relocation rule, was valid. The court also noted that although Ms. Dickson had pursued her claim under the Charter, she \u201cmay elect hereafter to pursue a similar claim under the VGFN Constitution\u201d (para. 157), which she had pleaded in the alternative in her petition but which the trial judge did not address.\nIV. Relevant Constitutional Provisions\n[38] The relevant provisions of the Charter and the VGFN Constitution read as follows:\nCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\n1 The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.\n15 (1) Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability\n25 The guarantee in this Charter of certain rights and freedoms shall not be construed so as to abrogate or derogate from any aboriginal, treaty or other rights or freedoms that pertain to the aboriginal peoples of Canada including\n(a) any rights or freedoms that have been recognized by the Royal Proclamation of October 7, 1763; and\n(b) any rights or freedoms that now exist by way of land claims agreements or may be so acquired.\n32 (1) This Charter applies\n(a) to the Parliament and government of Canada in respect of all matters within the authority of Parliament including all matters relating to the Yukon Territory and Northwest Territories; and\n(b) to the legislature and government of each province in respect of all matters within the authority of the legislature of each province.\nVuntut Gwitchin First Nation Constitution\nARTICLE II \u2014 VUNTUT GWITCHIN FIRST NATION AUTHORITY\/LOCATION\n2. The seat of government for the Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation shall be located within Settlement Land as advised by the General Assembly.\n3. This Constitution is the supreme law of the Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation, subject only to the:\n(a) Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation Self-Government Agreement; and\n(b) rights and freedoms set out in this Constitution.\nARTICLE XI \u2014 TERMS OF OFFICE AND QUALIFICATIONS\n1. Any person desiring to run for Chief or Councillor must meet the following qualifications:\n(a) Be 18 years or older;\n(b) Be ordinarily resident in Canada;\n(c) No indictable offence convictions for 5 years preceding the election; and\n(d) Be a [VGFN] Citizen.\n2. If an eligible candidate for Chief or Councillor does not reside on Settlement Land during the election and wins their desired seat they must relocate to Settlement Land within 14 days after election day.\nV. Issues\n[39] This appeal raises two issues. The first issue is whether the Charter applies to the VGFN\u2019s residency requirement. If the Charter applies, the second issue is whether the residency requirement unjustifiably infringes s. 15(1) of the Charter by barring Ms. Dickson from serving on the VGFN Council unless she moves from Whitehorse to Old Crow within 14 days of her election to the VGFN Council. The second issue requires the Court to consider the framework for analyzing whether Ms. Dickson\u2019s s. 15(1) Charter right, properly construed, abrogates or derogates from an Aboriginal, treaty, or other right or freedom pertaining to the Aboriginal peoples of Canada under s. 25 of the Charter, as well as the consequences that follow if it does, and those that follow if it does not.\nVI. Analysis\nA. Does the Charter Apply to the VGFN\u2019s Residency Requirement?\n(1) Section 32(1) of the Charter: General Principles\n[40] The application of the Charter is addressed, in particular, in s. 32(1):\n32 (1) This Charter applies\n(a) to the Parliament and government of Canada in respect of all matters within the authority of Parliament including all matters relating to the Yukon Territory and Northwest Territories; and\n(b) to the legislature and government of each province in respect of all matters within the authority of the legislature of each province.\n[41] Section 32(1) identifies certain entities that are bound by the Charter. They include the legislature and government of each province in respect of provincial matters, as well as the federal Parliament and government in respect of federal matters, which include territorial governments and territorial matters. As a result, under s. 32(1), the Charter applies broadly to the legislative, executive, and administrative branches of government in respect of all matters within their authority (Greater Vancouver Transportation Authority v. Canadian Federation of Students \u2014 British Columbia Component, 2009 SCC 31, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 295, at para. 14; RWDSU v. Dolphin Delivery Ltd., [1986] 2 S.C.R. 573, at p. 598).\n[42] Section 32(1) also explicitly contemplates that the Charter applies to entities other than Parliament, the provincial legislatures, and the federal, provincial, or territorial governments. This is because s. 32(1) applies to \u201cmatters within the authority\u201d of \u201cthe particular legislative body that created them\u201d, which includes \u201centities that are controlled by government or that perform truly governmental functions\u201d (Godbout v. Longueuil (City), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 844, at para. 48).\n[43] As a result, all exercises of governmental authority by Parliament or the provincial legislatures under the Constitution Act, 1867 are subject to the Charter. The words \u201cwithin the authority of Parliament\u201d and \u201cwithin the authority of the legislature of each province\u201d in s. 32(1)(a) and (b) refer to \u201cthe division of powers in ss. 91 and 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867\u201d (Operation Dismantle Inc. v. The Queen, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 441, at pp. 463\u201164, per Wilson J., and at p. 455, per Dickson J. (as he then was) for the majority). As noted by Professors Peter W. Hogg and Wade K. Wright, the phrase \u201c\u2018in respect of all matters within the authority of\u2019 . . . limits the application of the Charter to laws within the distribution-of-powers authority of the Parliament or the Legislature\u201d (Constitutional Law of Canada (5th ed. Supp.), at \u00a7 15:2; see also H. Brun, G. Tremblay and E. Brouillet, Droit constitutionnel (6th ed. 2014), at pp. 971 et seq.).\n[44] The objective of the broad wording employed in s. 32(1) of the Charter is to prevent Parliament, the legislatures, and the federal, provincial, and territorial governments from avoiding their Charter obligations by conferring certain of their legislative responsibilities or powers on other entities that are not ordinarily subject to the Charter (Eldridge v. British Columbia (Attorney General), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 624, at para. 42; Godbout, at para. 48; Greater Vancouver Transportation Authority, at paras. 14 and 22).\n[45] Section 32(1) of the Charter, as the entry point for the Charter\u2019s application, must be interpreted in a manner that is flexible, purposive, and generous, rather than technical, narrow, or legalistic. Such an approach serves to secure for individuals and relevant collective minorities the full benefit of the Charter\u2019s protections and to constrain government action inconsistent with those protections (R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., [1985] 1 S.C.R. 295, at p. 344; Hunter v. Southam Inc., [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145, at p. 156; Hogg and Wright, at \u00a7\u00a7 36:18-36:20). The words of s. 32(1) signal that \u201cthe Charter is confined to government action\u201d and is \u201cessentially an instrument for checking the powers of government over the individual\u201d (McKinney v. University of Guelph, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 229, at p. 261).\n(2) Indigenous Self-Government and the Charter\n[46] Before considering whether the Charter applies to the VGFN\u2019s residency requirement, it is useful to review the historical and policy context for Indigenous self-government in Canada, including under the Charlottetown Accord of 1992, the federal government\u2019s \u201cInherent Right Policy\u201d since 1995, and the final Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples published in 1996. It is also useful to review how courts have consistently applied the Charter to Indigenous governments.\n[47] As a preliminary matter, we note that although this Court has yet to recognize an inherent right to Indigenous self-government as an Aboriginal right protected under s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 (see R. v. Pamajewon, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 821, at para. 24; Delgamuukw v. British Columbia, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 1010, at para. 171), an inherent right to Indigenous self-government has now been affirmed on the international plane by Article 4 of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, U.N. Doc. A\/RES\/61\/295, October 2, 2007. In 2016, the Canadian government supported the Declaration and committed to adopt and implement it in accordance with the Canadian Constitution. Recent federal legislation has affirmed the Declaration as \u201ca universal international human rights instrument with application in Canadian law\u201d and provides \u201ca framework for the Government of Canada\u2019s implementation of the Declaration\u201d (United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act, S.C. 2021, c. 14 (\u201cUNDRIP Act\u201d), s. 4). For example, the Declaration has been implemented specifically in respect of the provision of Indigenous child and family services under the Act respecting First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis children, youth and families, S.C. 2019, c. 24 (see Reference re An Act respecting First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis children, youth and families, 2024 SCC 5).\n(a) The Charlottetown Accord of 1992\n[48] Section 32(1) of the Charter does not expressly provide that the Charter applies to Indigenous governments. However, the Draft Legal Text of the Charlottetown Accord of 1992 had proposed to amend s. 32 of the Charter to recognize, in s. 32(1)(c), that the Charter applies \u201cto all legislative bodies and governments of the Aboriginal peoples of Canada in respect of all matters within the authority of their respective legislative bodies\u201d (p. 36). It had also proposed to add a new s. 35.1 of the Constitution Act, 1982 to provide in part that \u201c[t]he Aboriginal peoples of Canada have the inherent right of self-government within Canada\u201d (p. 37). The Accord was approved by the federal, provincial, and territorial governments and by the Assembly of First Nations, Inuit Tapirisat of Canada, Native Council of Canada, and M\u00e9tis National Council, but was not ratified because it did not receive the support of a majority of Canadians in a national referendum (see Hogg and Wright, \u00a7\u00a7 4:3 and 28:42). Even so, it is noteworthy that these proposed constitutional amendments saw the inherent right to self-government as compatible with the obligation of Indigenous governments to comply with the Charter.\n(b) Federal Government Policy Since 1995\n[49] Despite the failure of the Charlottetown Accord, since 1995 the federal government\u2019s policy, first articulated under its \u201cInherent Right Policy\u201d, has been that Indigenous peoples in Canada have an inherent right to self-government guaranteed under s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982, but also that the Charter applies to Indigenous governments. The policy recognizes the historical fact that Indigenous peoples were living in self-governing communities before Europeans arrived, and seeks to ensure that Indigenous governments, like other governments in Canada, comply with the Charter. The federal government sees these two policy objectives as compatible. As the Government of Canada explained in its \u201cInherent Right Policy\u201d:\nThe Government is committed to the principle that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms should bind all governments in Canada, so that Aboriginal peoples and non-Aboriginal Canadians alike may continue to enjoy equally the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Charter. Self-government agreements, including treaties, will, therefore, have to provide that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms applies to Aboriginal governments and institutions in relation to all matters within their respective jurisdictions and authorities.\nThe Charter itself already contains a provision (section 25) directing that it must be interpreted in a manner that respects Aboriginal and treaty rights, which would include, under the federal approach, the inherent right. The Charter is thus designed to ensure a sensitive balance between individual rights and freedoms, and the unique values and traditions of Aboriginal peoples in Canada.\n(Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada, The Government of Canada\u2019s Approach to Implementation of the Inherent Right and the Negotiation of Aboriginal Self-Government, last updated March 1, 2023 (online); see also Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada, General Briefing Note on Canada\u2019s Self-government and Comprehensive Land Claims Policies and the Status of Negotiations, last updated August 16, 2016 (online).)\n[50] Since 1995, the federal government has negotiated many self-government agreements with Indigenous communities across Canada, which have recognized that the Charter, the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6, and the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, continue to apply to Indigenous peoples (Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada, Self-government, last updated August 25, 2020 (online); see, e.g., the Tsawwassen First Nation Final Agreement (2007), c. 2, s. 9, which provides that the Charter applies to the Tsawwassen government in respect of all matters within its authority; Nisga\u2019a Final Agreement (1999), c. 2, s. 9; Maa-nulth First Nations Final Agreement (2009), s. 1.3.2). The federal government has also affirmed that self-government agreements negotiated before 1995 will, as a general principle, \u201ccontinue to operate according to their existing terms\u201d (The Government of Canada\u2019s Approach to Implementation of the Inherent Right and the Negotiation of Aboriginal Self-Government). This includes the Self-Government Agreement with the VGFN.\n(c) The Legal Policy Debate About Applying the Charter to Indigenous Governments\n[51] Shortly after the failure to ratify the 1992 Charlottetown Accord, the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples extensively studied whether the Charter should apply to Indigenous governments exercising inherent self-government powers. The Royal Commission concluded that the Charter applies, but in accordance with s. 25, it should be \u201cgiven a flexible interpretation that takes account of the distinctive philosophies, traditions and cultural practices of Aboriginal peoples\u201d (Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (\u201cRCAP Final Report\u201d), vol. 2, Restructuring the Relationship (1996), at p. 234). We will return later to the Royal Commission\u2019s perspective on the intimate connection between ss. 32 and 25 of the Charter. That perspective takes a broad view of the application of the Charter to Indigenous governments under s. 32(1), but also interprets the Charter under s. 25 with sensitivity to the collective rights of Indigenous peoples, to protect what the Royal Commission referred to as their \u201cdistinctive philosophies, traditions and cultural practices\u201d \u2014 or what Professor Patrick Macklem has encapsulated in the term \u201c[I]ndigenous difference\u201d (Indigenous Difference and the Constitution of Canada (2001)). As we explain below, s. 25 was included in the Charter as a protection for the distinctive minority rights of Indigenous peoples that might be abrogated or derogated from by the application of individual Charter rights.\n[52] The RCAP Final Report, published in 1996, described two approaches to addressing whether the Charter applies to Indigenous governments exercising inherent self-government powers. The first approach claims that Indigenous governments should be bound by the Charter as a matter of basic constitutional principle, because \u201cit would be highly anomalous if Canadian citizens enjoyed the protection of the Charter in their relations with every government in Canada except for Aboriginal governments\u201d (vol. 2, at p. 227). This approach does not see the Charter as necessarily inconsistent with Indigenous values, because the Charter itself is \u201cmodelled on international standards with universal application\u201d (p. 228).\n[53] The second approach described by the RCAP Final Report asserts that Indigenous governments should not be bound by the Charter, because Indigenous peoples did not \u201cconsen[t] to the application of the Charter in a binding constitutional instrument, such as a self-government treaty with the Crown\u201d (vol. 2, at p. 228). It also claims that \u201csome Charter provisions reflect individualistic values that are antithetical to many Aboriginal cultures, which place greater emphasis on the responsibilities of individuals to their communities\u201d (p. 230). This approach claims that applying the Charter to Indigenous governments \u201ccould hamper and even stifle the efforts of Aboriginal nations to revive and strengthen their cultures and traditions\u201d and \u201cmight operate as the unwitting servant of the forces of assimilation and domination\u201d (p. 230).\n[54] After studying these issues extensively, the Royal Commission settled on an intermediate approach embodying three basic principles. First, all Canadians \u2014 Indigenous and non-Indigenous alike \u2014 are \u201centitled to enjoy the protection of the Charter\u2019s general provisions in their relations with governments in Canada, no matter where in Canada the people are located or which governments are involved\u201d (p. 230). Second, Indigenous governments \u201coccupy the same basic position relative to the Charter as the federal and provincial governments\u201d (p. 230). And third, the Charter should apply to Indigenous governments and be \u201cinterpreted in a manner that allows considerable scope for distinctive Aboriginal philosophical outlooks, cultures and traditions\u201d, based on the \u201cinterpretive rule . . . found in section 25 of the Charter\u201d (p. 230).\n[55] The Royal Commission\u2019s final recommendation was thus that the Charter applies to Indigenous governments, but under s. 25, the Charter must be interpreted flexibly to account for the distinctive philosophies, traditions, and cultural practices of Indigenous peoples (RCAP Final Report, vol. 2, at p. 234; see also Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, Partners in Confederation: Aboriginal Peoples, Self-Government, and the Constitution (1993), at pp. 39-41; Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, Bridging the Cultural Divide: A Report on Aboriginal People and Criminal Justice in Canada (1996), at pp. 262-64).\n[56] The debate on whether the Charter should apply to Indigenous governments is complex and has generated a rich academic literature on both sides of the issue, some of which the Royal Commission drew on in reaching its conclusions and making its recommendations (see, e.g., B. Slattery, \u201cFirst Nations and the Constitution: A Question of Trust\u201d (1992), 71 Can. Bar Rev. 261; J.

Stud. 279).\n(d) Courts Have Consistently Applied the Charter to Indigenous Governments\n[57] Against this policy backdrop, courts at all levels have recognized that the Charter applies to Indian band councils exercising governmental powers under the Indian Act, because such powers have a statutory foundation and are delegated by Parliament (see, e.g., Corbiere v. Canada (Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 203; Taypotat v. Taypotat, 2013 FCA 192, 365 D.L.R.

Thunderchild First Nation, 2020 FC 1065, 96 Admin. L.R. (6th) 233, at para. 16; Horse Lake First Nation v. Horseman, 2003 ABQB 152, 223 D.L.R. (4th) 184, at paras. 14-29; see also G. R\u00e9gimbald and D. Newman, The Law of the Canadian Constitution (2nd ed. 2017), at \u00a718.17; J. Woodward, Aboriginal Law in Canada (loose-leaf), at \u00a7 6:6; Brun, Tremblay and Brouillet, at p. 972; M. Buist, Halsbury\u2019s Laws of Canada \u2014 Aboriginal (2020 Reissue), at pp. 110-11).\n[58] Courts have also recognized that the Charter applies to Indigenous governments operating under legislation outside the framework of the Indian Act (see, e.g., Chisasibi Band v. Napash, 2014 QCCQ 10367, [2015] 1 C.N.L.R. 16, at paras. 49-106).\n[59] We now turn to consider in greater detail the legal framework for applying s. 32(1) of the Charter, before applying that framework to the VGFN\u2019s residency requirement.\n(3) The Eldridge Framework for Applying Section 32(1) of the Charter\n[60] A significant body of case law has addressed when the Charter applies under s. 32(1). The jurisprudence has been described as \u201cboth fluid and complex\u201d (A. K. Lokan and M. Fenrick, Constitutional Litigation in Canada (loose-leaf), at \u00a7 2:21), and as raising the \u201cvery vexed question\u201d of what is \u201cgovernment\u201d under s. 32(1) (G. J. Kennedy, The Charter of Rights in Litigation: Direction from the Supreme Court of Canada (loose-leaf), at \u00a7 2:2).\n[61] More than a quarter century ago, La Forest J. for the Court in Eldridge distilled the jurisprudence and clarified the law. He held that an entity may be subject to the Charter in one of two ways. First, an entity may be found to be \u201cgovernment\u201d for the purpose of s. 32(1) if it can be characterized as government by its very nature or because of the degree of governmental control exercised over it. In such a case, all the entity\u2019s activities are subject to the Charter. Second, even if an entity is not itself \u201cgovernment\u201d for s. 32(1) purposes, it will be subject to the Charter with respect to particular activities that can be ascribed to government because they are \u201c\u2018governmental\u2019 in nature\u201d (para. 44; see also Greater Vancouver Transportation Authority, at para. 16; Lokan and Fenrick, at \u00a7\u00a7 2:21-2:23; R\u00e9gimbald and Newman, at \u00a718.15).\n[62] It is instructive to consider how this Court has applied the two branches of the Eldridge framework.\n(a) First Branch: Government \u201cby Nature\u201d or \u201cControl\u201d\n[63] In Godbout, decided shortly after Eldridge, the Court had to decide whether a municipal residency requirement for employees infringed the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms, R.S.Q., c. C-12, or the Canadian Charter. The majority decided the case under the Quebec Charter, while a minority did so under the Canadian Charter. Speaking for the minority, La Forest J. (with the concurrence of L\u2019Heureux\u2011Dub\u00e9 J. and McLachlin J., as she then was) stated that municipalities are governments by nature, and thus bound by the Canadian Charter, even though they are \u201cinstitutionally distinct from the provincial governments that create them\u201d (para. 50). He highlighted that municipal councils (1) are democratically elected by members of the public and accountable to their constituents, like Parliament and provincial legislatures; (2) have a general taxing power that is indistinguishable from the taxing powers of Parliament or the provinces; (3) are empowered to make, administer, and enforce laws within a defined territorial jurisdiction, which is a \u201cquintessentially governmental function\u201d (para. 51 (emphasis deleted), citing McKinney, at p. 270); and (4) derive their existence and lawmaking authority from the provinces and exercise powers that the province would otherwise exercise (para. 51). Justice La Forest reasoned that \u201c[s]ince the Canadian Charter clearly applies to the provincial legislatures and governments, it must . . . also apply to entities upon which they confer governmental powers within their authority. Otherwise, provinces could . . . simply avoid the application of the Charter by devolving powers on municipal bodies\u201d (para. 51).\n[64] Later, in Greater Vancouver Transportation Authority, Deschamps J. for the Court held that two transit authorities that prohibited political advertising on public transit vehicles were \u201cgovernments\u201d and were subject to the Charter under the control test of the first branch of Eldridge. She found that the province of British Columbia had substantial control over the transit authorities\u2019 activities. One transit authority was a statutory body designated by legislation as an \u201cagent of the government\u201d; its board of directors was appointed by the Lieutenant Governor in Council; and its affairs and operations could be managed by regulations (para. 17). As a result, this transit authority could not \u201cbe said to be operating autonomously from the provincial government\u201d (para. 17). The other transit authority was similarly an \u201capparatus of government\u201d, because it was statutorily controlled by a district government, which itself was \u201cgovernment\u201d within the meaning of s. 32(1) of the Charter (para. 18). Further, as Deschamps J. noted, the second transit authority had been created to devolve provincial responsibilities for public transit into the hands of local governments, triggering the principle that \u201ca government should not be able to shirk its Charter obligations by simply conferring its powers on another entity\u201d (para. 22). She held that this devolution of provincial responsibilities for public transit could not \u201cbe viewed as having created a \u2018Charter-free\u2019 zone for the public transit\u201d (para. 22). As a result, both transit authorities were subject to the Charter.\n(b) Second Branch: \u201cGovernmental Activity\u201d\n[65] Eldridge itself is an example of the second branch of the Eldridge framework, under which the Charter applies to a non-governmental entity in respect of governmental activities it performs. Justice La Forest for the Court held that a hospital\u2019s failure to provide sign language interpretation to persons receiving medical services under provincial legislation was subject to review under the Charter. In deciding not to provide sign language interpretation, the hospital had exercised discretion under provincial legislation about how to provide medically necessary services (paras. 19 and 51). The hospital\u2019s decision was thus \u201cnot simply a matter of internal hospital management\u201d, but rather was \u201cintimately connected to the medical service delivery system instituted by the legislation\u201d (para. 51). As a result, La Forest J. ruled that the hospital was subject to the Charter in exercising discretion to provide medical services under legislation.\n[66] Similarly, in Blencoe v. British Columbia (Human Rights Commission), 2000 SCC 44, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 307, Bastarache J. for a majority of the Court held that the British Columbia Human Rights Commission was subject to the Charter for its delay in processing a human rights complaint. Although the Commission was \u201cautonomous or independent from government\u201d, it had been created by statute and \u201call of its actions\u201d were \u201ctaken pursuant to statutory authority\u201d (paras. 34\u201135). The Commission\u2019s conduct could not escape Charter scrutiny \u201cmerely because it is not part of government or controlled by government\u201d (para. 37). Justice Bastarache concluded that the Commission was bound by the Charter because it was \u201cboth implementing a specific government program and exercising powers of statutory compulsion\u201d (para. 37).\n[67] Professors Hogg and Wright have explained why action taken under statutory authority involving a power of compulsion is a relevant factor when considering the application of the Charter. They note that even if an entity is otherwise independent of the federal and provincial governments, the presence of a delegated statutory power of compulsion means that the entity has a \u201ccoercive power of governance\u201d that is not possessed by private individuals, corporations, or organizations (\u00a7 37:8). As they explain, \u201cit is the exercise of a power of compulsion that makes the Charter applicable to bodies exercising statutory authority\u201d (\u00a7 37:8). We agree.\n[68] As Professors Hogg and Wright note, the presence of a delegated statutory power of compulsion helps explain the Court\u2019s decision that the Charter applied to the Human Rights Commission in Blencoe, as well as its earlier decisions that the Charter applied to an arbitrator exercising powers conferred by statute (Slaight Communications Inc. v. Davidson, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1038); a municipal by-law made under statutory authority that prohibited postering on public property (Ramsden v. Peterborough (City), [1993] 2 S.C.R.1084); the rules of a law society restricting entry to the legal profession by out-of-province law firms (Black v. Law Society of Alberta, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 591); and the terms of an insurance policy stipulated by statute (Miron v. Trudel, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 418). See also Brun, Tremblay and Brouillet, at pp. 972-73 ([translation] \u201cThe word \u2018government\u2019 in section 32 receives a functional interpretation . . . . The Canadian Charter therefore applies to all paragovernmental authorities in the public administration when they perform a government function, that is, when they exercise public authority under the law, by unilaterally compelling human behaviour\u201d).\n(c) Summary\n[69] To summarize, the Charter applies broadly to the legislative, executive, and administrative branches of government. The Charter applies to Parliament, the provincial legislatures, and the federal, provincial, and territorial governments in respect of all matters within the legislative authority of Parliament and the provinces, which includes entities not specifically listed under s. 32(1). Entities subject to the Charter cannot avoid their Charter obligations by conferring certain of their legislative responsibilities or powers on other entities that are not ordinarily subject to the Charter.\n[70] An entity may be subject to the Charter in one of two ways. An entity may be government by its very nature or because the federal or a provincial government exercises substantial control over it, in which case all the entity\u2019s activities are subject to the Charter. Alternatively, even if an entity is not part of government, it will be subject to the Charter in respect of governmental activities it performs.\n(4) Application of Section 32(1) to This Case\n[71] We now apply these principles to the VGFN\u2019s residency requirement.\n[72] The Supreme Court of Yukon held that the Charter applies to the VGFN\u2019s residency requirement under the Eldridge framework because the VGFN is \u201ceither \u2018government\u2019 [by nature] or [is] exercising inherently \u2018government\u2019 activities\u201d (para. 130). This was so whether the residency requirement is viewed as an exercise of an inherent self-government right or an exercise of the Self-Government Agreement implemented by federal and territorial legislation (para. 130).\n[73] The Court of Appeal similarly held that the VGFN Council was \u201cby its very nature\u201d exercising \u201cgovernmental\u201d powers, whether the source of its authority was an inherent right of self-government or federal or territorial legislation (para. 98). Elsewhere in its reasons, the Court of Appeal seemed to qualify the breadth of this conclusion, stressing that it was dealing only with the residency requirement and not with whether the Charter applies to the VGFN generally (paras. 74 and 83). But if (as the Court of Appeal accepted) the VGFN is government by nature, it follows that the Charter applies to all its activities, not just its enactment and enforcement of the residency requirement (Eldridge, at para. 44; Greater Vancouver Transportation Authority, at para. 16). Respectfully, and as the intervener the Attorney General of Canada submits, at times the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision reflected \u201ca blurring of the lines between the two branches\u201d of Eldridge (I.F., at para. 17).\n[74] The parties and interveners before this Court presented a full spectrum of views on whether the Charter applies to the residency requirement on the basis that the VGFN is \u201cgovernment by nature\u201d. There was also no consensus among those representing the interests of Indigenous peoples on whether the Charter applies to Indigenous governments. Some Indigenous organizations urged that the Charter applies (or should apply) to Indigenous governments generally, claiming that this is essential to protect the rights and equal citizenship of Indigenous people and to ensure that vulnerable Indigenous individuals (such as off-reserve or remote members of First Nations or Indigenous women) are not discriminated against by their own Indigenous governments (see I.F., Congress of Aboriginal Peoples, at paras. 5-15; I.F., Band Members Alliance and Advocacy Association of Canada, at paras. 10-29). Other Indigenous organizations opposed this view, asserting that the Charter does not apply to the exercise of an inherent self-government right unless an Indigenous people expressly consents to this (see I.F., Teslin Tlingit Council, at paras. 2 and 16-29; I.F., Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations, at paras. 13-17; I.F., M\u00e9tis Nation of Ontario and M\u00e9tis Nation of Alberta, at paras. 14-21).\n[75] In what follows, we address this issue by applying the framework this Court established in Eldridge for determining when the Charter applies under s. 32(1).\n(a) The Charter Applies to the Residency Requirement Because the VGFN Is \u201cGovernment\u201d by Nature\n[76] In our view, the VGFN does not qualify as government under the \u201ccontrol\u201d test of the first branch of Eldridge, because the VGFN is not substantially controlled by either the federal or the Yukon government. Through the Self-Government Agreement, the VGFN exercises self-government powers \u201cby and for the first nation\u201d (Yukon First Nations Self-Government Act, s. 2, \u201cself-government agreement\u201d). The VGFN is \u201cinstitutionally distinct\u201d from the federal and territorial governments (Godbout, at para. 50). Its essential function is to advance the interests of the Vuntut Gwitchin in accordance with their \u201ctraditional decision-making structures\u201d and \u201cto support and promote\u201d their \u201ccontemporary and evolving political institutions and processes\u201d (Self-Government Agreement, preamble). To this end, the Self-Government Agreement provides that the VGFN \u201cshall have the exclusive power to enact laws\u201d in relation to an agreed upon list of matters, including the administration of the VGFN\u2019s \u201caffairs and operation and internal management\u201d (Self-Government Agreement, s. 13.1). As a result, the VGFN operates autonomously from, and is not substantially controlled by, either the federal or the Yukon government.\n[77] On the other hand, in our view the Charter applies to the VGFN\u2019s residency requirement under its Constitution because the VGFN is \u201cgovernment\u201d by nature. Recall that in Godbout, La Forest J. stated that although there can be no a priori list of factors that determines whether an entity performs \u201cgovernmental\u201d functions (para. 49), an entity may be considered to be government by nature when it has four features (para. 51). The four features are neither necessary nor determinative for an entity to be found to be government by nature but serve as useful indicia of government (para. 51):\n1. The entity has a council that is \u201cdemocratically elected by members of the general public and [is] accountable to [its] constituents in a manner analogous to that in which Parliament and the provincial legislatures are accountable to the electorates they represent\u201d.\n2. It has \u201ca general taxing power that, for the purposes of determining whether [it] can rightfully be described as \u2018government\u2019, is indistinguishable from the taxing powers of Parliament or the provinces\u201d.\n3. Importantly, it is empowered to make, administer, and enforce coercive laws binding on the public within a defined territorial jurisdiction, which is a quintessentially governmental function.\n4. Most significantly, it derives its existence and lawmaking authority from the federal or provincial government; that is, it exercises powers conferred by Parliament or by a provincial legislature, powers and functions that the federal or provincial government would otherwise have to perform itself.\n[78] We agree with the submissions of Ms. Dickson and several government and Indigenous interveners that the VGFN as an Indigenous government illustrates indicia for \u201cgovernment by nature\u201d identified by this Court in Godbout, and thus the Charter applies to the VGFN\u2019s residency requirement (R.F. on cross-appeal, at para. 34; I.F., A.G. Canada, at paras. 18-19; I.F., A.G. Quebec, at para. 6; I.F., A.G. Alberta, at para. 7; I.F., Congress of Aboriginal Peoples, at paras. 6-7; I.F., Band Members Alliance and Advocacy Association of Canada, at paras. 14-21).\n[79] First, the VGFN Council consists of members who are elected by eligible voters of the VGFN and are democratically accountable to their constituents, much like members of Parliament or a provincial legislature (VGFN Constitution, Article VIII). If elected, members swear or affirm loyalty to the VGFN and obedience to the VGFN Constitution as a \u201csacred responsibility of government\u201d (Sch. II).\n[80] Second, the VGFN has general taxing powers that are materially indistinguishable from those of Parliament or the provinces. The VGFN has status as \u201ca municipality or public body performing the functions of government or a municipal corporation\u201d under the Income Tax Act (Final Agreement, s. 24.8.1). This status is contingent on the VGFN restricting its activities \u201cto the provision of government or other public services\u201d (s. 24.8.2; see also Self-Government Agreement, ss. 14.0 (Taxation) and 15.0 (Taxation Status); Yukon First Nations Self-Government Act, s. 18).\n[81] Third, like Parliament and provincial legislatures, the VGFN is empowered to make, administer, and enforce coercive laws that are binding on VGFN citizens and on the public generally within its settlement land (Self-Government Agreement, s. 13.0; Yukon First Nations Self-Government Act, ss. 9 to 12). To quote La Forest J. in Godbout, this is a \u201cquintessentially governmental function\u201d (para. 51 (emphasis deleted), citing McKinney, at p. 270).\n[82] Fourth, although (as the trial judge found) the Vuntut Gwitchin have been self-governing since time immemorial, and even if the VGFN has lawmaking authority under an inherent right to self-government, the VGFN is also recognized as a legal entity under the federal implementing legislation. To that extent, it derives at least some of its lawmaking authority under federal law. In other words, at least one source of the VGFN\u2019s lawmaking authority flows from Parliament, in that the VGFN exercises powers that Parliament otherwise would have exercised through its legislative jurisdiction under s. 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867. This of course is not to suggest that Indigenous self\u2011government is necessarily an emanation of federal authority. Parliament can, as here, be a source of the self\u2011government authority, and it is this fact that triggers the application of the Charter in this case.\n[83] In the first place, the federal legislation recognizes the VGFN as \u201ca legal entity having the capacity, rights, powers and privileges of a natural person\u201d (Yukon First Nations Self-Government Act, s. 7). It also states that the VGFN succeeds to the \u201crights, titles, interests, obligations, assets and liabilities\u201d of the predecessor Vuntut Gwitchin Tribal Council that was constituted as a band under the Indian Act, and which henceforth is deemed to \u201cceas[e] to exist\u201d (ss. 2, 6(1) and Sch. I). In highlighting this, we distinguish the VGFN as a legal entity recognized under federal legislation, and the Vuntut Gwitchin as an Indigenous people who do not rely on federal legislation to exercise self-government powers that the trial judge found they have exercised since time immemorial. In our view, in the present context it is sufficient for the VGFN to be recognized as a legal entity and to derive a source of its lawmaking authority from federal legislation, without necessarily deriving all of its lawmaking authority, or its existence, from federal legislation. In Godbout, La Forest J. spoke of municipalities deriving their \u201cexistence\u201d from federal or provincial legislation, but this was because municipalities are entirely creatures of statute, whereas self-governing Indigenous governments manifestly are not. In short, Parliament can recognize the existence of an Indigenous government to which it confers some part of its lawmaking authority under s. 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867, without creating that Indigenous government and without necessarily being the only source of its lawmaking authority.\n[84] In the second place, even if the VGFN has an inherent power of self-government that is not derived from federal legislation, it is undeniable that the VGFN also exercises powers conferred by Parliament under s. 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867 that would otherwise be performed by the federal or territorial government, as indeed they were before the Self-Government Agreement was implemented by federal legislation. The VGFN exercises legislative powers that both the federal government and the VGFN have agreed shall be exercised by the VGFN under the Self-Government Agreement, as approved by the federal and territorial implementing legislation. The federal Yukon First Nations Self-Government Act is an exercise of Parliament\u2019s legislative authority under s. 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867 to enact laws in relation to \u201cIndians, and Lands reserved for the Indians\u201d. The legislation imposes rules agreed to by the VGFN, which pertain to the exercise of the VGFN\u2019s self-government powers, and which find their source at least in part under the Constitution Act, 1867, even if they also arise from the Vuntut Gwitchin\u2019s inherent self-government authority.\n[85] It is also significant that the federal legislation expressly provides that lands transferred to a Yukon First Nation in accordance with a self-government agreement \u201cremain lands reserved for the Indians within the meaning of class 24 of section 91 of the Constitution Act, 1867\u201d (s. 22(4)). This reflects the reality that Parliament has not abandoned its legislative jurisdiction in relation to the transferred lands, even though the VGFN exercises self-government powers under the Self-Government Agreement. Indeed, as this Court stated in R. v. Sparrow, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1075, Parliament\u2019s \u201cpower\u201d to legislate under s. 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867 must be \u201creconciled\u201d with its \u201cduty\u201d to Indigenous peoples under s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 (p. 1109). Parliament cannot abandon its constitutional duty to Indigenous peoples. Parliament\u2019s \u201cpower\u201d to legislate under s. 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867 and its \u201cduty\u201d to Indigenous peoples under s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 both subsist even after entering into a self-government agreement with an Indigenous people.\n[86] In addition, whatever the source of the VGFN\u2019s self-government powers \u2014 whether it is an inherent right, federal legislation, or both \u2014 it is undeniable that the federal Yukon First Nations Self-Government Act also regulates the exercise of the VGFN\u2019s self-government powers and makes them binding against third parties. In short, all the VGFN\u2019s self-government powers under the Self-Government Agreement and implemented by the federal and territorial self-government legislation must be exercised in accordance with that legislation. In our view, this constitutes sufficient involvement by Parliament to trigger the application of the Charter.\n[87] Although not determinative, it bears noting that the view that the Charter applies to the VGFN\u2019s exercise of self-government powers was also expressed by the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, the Hon. Ron Irwin, at the second reading of the federal self-government legislation before the House of Commons. He stated that \u201c[t]he principles embodied in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Constitution of Canada as a whole will continue to apply\u201d (House of Commons Debates, vol. 133, No. 76, 1st Sess., 35th Parl., June 1, 1994, at p. 4716). He added that \u201cFirst Nation constitutions will also provide protections for the rights and freedoms of First Nation citizens\u201d (p. 4716). Thus, in the Minister\u2019s view, the citizens of self-governing First Nations would be entitled to invoke Charter rights alongside their rights under First Nations constitutions, just as Ms. Dickson did in this case. This Court has recognized that, while Hansard evidence has frailties, it may \u201cplay a limited role in the interpretation of legislation\u201d (Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 35). In our view, the Minister\u2019s statement before the House of Commons lends some support to the view that Parliament intended the exercise of self\u2011government powers under the federal Yukon First Nations Self-Government Act to be subject to the Charter.\n[88] We hasten to say that in concluding that the VGFN engages each of the four illustrative indicia identified by this Court in Godbout for an entity that is government by nature, we do not of course suggest that an Indigenous government such as the VGFN exercising self-government powers is similar to a municipality. Unlike municipalities, which have no independent constitutional status, are entirely creatures of statute, and exercise only those powers conferred by legislation, Indigenous peoples are expressly recognized under the Constitution Act, 1867 (s. 91(24)), the Charter (s. 25), and the Constitution Act, 1982 (ss. 35 and 35.1). Indigenous peoples pre\u2011existed the arrival of European settlers and the founding of Canada as a country; they do not depend on federal, provincial, or territorial legislation to exist as autonomous self\u2011governing peoples.\n[89] Our reasoning and conclusion that the Charter applies to the VGFN\u2019s residency requirement are also supported by the analysis of Peter W. Hogg and Mary Ellen Turpel in their important paper \u201cImplementing Aboriginal Self-Government: Constitutional and Jurisdictional Issues\u201d, originally prepared for the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (later published at 74 Can. Bar Rev. 187). Professors Hogg and Turpel argued it was \u201cprobable\u201d a court would hold that the Charter applies to Indigenous governments, either where self-government institutions are created by statute \u201cbecause the Charter applies to all bodies exercising statutory powers\u201d, or because statutes implementing self-government agreements would \u201cprobably\u201d constitute \u201ca sufficient involvement by the Parliament of Canada to make the Charter applicable\u201d:\nDespite the silence of section 32 on Aboriginal governments, it is probable that a court would hold that Aboriginal governments are bound by the Charter. This would be so where self-government institutions have been created by statute, because the Charter applies to all bodies exercising statutory powers. Where self-government institutions have been created by an Aboriginal people and empowered by a self-government agreement, the source of the self-government powers is probably a treaty right (if the self-government agreement has treaty status) or an Aboriginal right (the inherent right of self-government) or both. Even here, however, as noted earlier, the self-government agreement needs the aid of a statute to make clear that the agreement is binding on third parties. The statute implementing the self-government agreement probably constitutes a sufficient involvement by the Parliament of Canada to make the Charter applicable. [Emphasis added; footnotes omitted; pp. 416-17.]\n[90] The RCAP Final Report stated that the Commission had been \u201cassisted\u201d by the analysis of Professors Hogg and Turpel in reaching its own conclusion that the Charter applies to Indigenous governments (vol. 2, at p. 232). Hogg and Turpel\u2019s paper is also significant because it made \u201cfrequent reference\u201d to the Yukon First Nation self-government agreements specifically, which the authors used as a case study to illustrate their reasoning on how self-government agreements could be implemented \u201cwithin the existing constitutional framework\u201d of Canada (pp. 388-96, 401-11 and 414).\n[91] We would also add that our conclusion that the Charter applies to the VGFN\u2019s residency requirement adopted under the framework of the federal self-government legislation differs from \u2014 and is narrower than \u2014 the conclusions apparently reached by the trial judge and Court of Appeal. The trial judge (at para. 130) and the Court of Appeal (at para. 98) both appeared to decide that the Charter applies to the exercise of the VGFN\u2019s self-government powers, whether viewed as an exercise of the VGFN\u2019s inherent right of self-government or under the self-government agreements with the federal and Yukon governments, as implemented by federal and territorial legislation. We conclude that the Charter applies to the VGFN\u2019s residency requirement only insofar as that requirement flows from an exercise of statutory power under s. 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867. We make no comment on whether an exercise of an inherent right of self-government untethered from federal legislation would be subject to the Charter, which in our view need not be decided in this case in view of the self-government arrangements in issue. As this Court has often noted, a \u201cpolicy [of] restraint in constitutional cases is sound\u201d as it is \u201cbased on the realization that unnecessary constitutional pronouncements may prejudice future cases, the implications of which have not been foreseen\u201d (Phillips v. Nova Scotia (Commission of Inquiry into the Westray Mine Tragedy), [1995] 2 S.C.R. 97, at para. 9; see also Canadian Council for Refugees v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2023 SCC 17, at para. 181; Reference re Remuneration of Judges of the Provincial Court of Prince Edward Island, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 3, at para. 301, per La Forest J., dissenting in part). This Court in Reference re Secession of Quebec, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 217 (\u201cSecession Reference\u201d), at para. 105, referred to this as \u201cthe usual rule of prudence in constitutional cases\u201d. The rule of prudence is especially salutary in this appeal, which in our view can be decided without addressing whether an inherent Indigenous right of self\u2011government operating outside a statutory framework would be subject to the Charter.\n[92] In our view, therefore, the Charter applies to the VGFN\u2019s residency requirement because the VGFN is government by nature.\n[93] Although in view of this conclusion it is unnecessary to consider the second branch of Eldridge, we will do so briefly for the sake of completeness.\n(b) The Charter Also Applies to the Residency Requirement as a \u201cGovernment Activity\u201d\n[94] Apart from our conclusion that the Charter applies to the VGFN\u2019s residency requirement because the VGFN is government by nature, we also conclude that the Charter applies to the enactment and enforcement of the residency requirement as a specific \u201cgovernmental activity\u201d.\n[95] The residency requirement under the VGFN\u2019s Constitution was adopted at least in part under federal statutory authority (even assuming it also reflects the exercise of an inherent right to self-government). The residency requirement involves the exercise of a statutory power of compulsion because it imposes legal restrictions on who may serve as a VGFN Chief or Councillor. It has the force of law because it forms part of the VGFN Constitution, adopted under the Self-Government Agreement, which was itself approved and given effect by the federal and territorial implementing legislation. As stated succinctly in s. 2 of the First Nations (Yukon) Self-government Act: \u201cThe Self-Government Agreement is hereby approved and has the force of law\u201d (see also Yukon First Nations Self-Government Act, s. 5(1) (bringing into effect the Self-Government Agreement), and s. 8(1)(b) (providing that a Yukon First Nation such as the VGFN \u201cshall, in a manner consistent with its self-government agreement\u201d, adopt a constitution that provides for, among other things, \u201cthe governing bodies of the first nation and their composition, membership, powers, duties and procedures\u201d)). The federal legislation thus gives the VGFN Constitution the force of federal law under the Constitution Act, 1867, even if it already had the force of law as an Indigenous law.\n[96] As a result, in our view, the enactment and enforcement of the residency requirement is a specific \u201cgovernmental activity\u201d under the second branch of Eldridge. It is therefore subject to review under the Charter.\n(c) Other Arguments for Applying the Charter\n[97] In closing, we briefly address two other arguments raised before this Court as to whether the Charter applies to the residency requirement.\n[98] First, Ms. Dickson and certain interveners submit that the Charter applies to the residency requirement because the residency requirement is a \u201claw\u201d under the supremacy clause, s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982, which states that \u201cany law that is inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution is, to the extent of the inconsistency, of no force or effect\u201d. We do not accept this submission. It is settled in this Court\u2019s jurisprudence that \u201c[t]he scope of application of the Charter is delineated in s. 32(1)\u201d of the Charter (R. v. McGregor, 2023 SCC 4, at para. 18; see also Godbout, at para. 43; Blencoe, at para. 10; Greater Vancouver Transportation Authority, at para. 13). Section 52(1) applies as a constitutional remedy only if a law is inconsistent with a provision of the Constitution. It does not delineate the scope of application of the Charter.\n[99] Second, the VGFN argues that the Charter does not apply to the residency requirement because the VGFN did not consent to the application of the Charter to its exercise of self-government powers. Ms. Dickson argues that the Charter applies because the Final Agreement itself states that the VGFN\u2019s self-government powers are to be \u201cin conformity with the Constitution of Canada\u201d (s. 24.1.2), which includes the Charter, and that any self-government agreement \u201cshall not affect\u201d the rights of VGFN persons \u201cas Canadian citizens\u201d (s. 24.1.3), which similarly includes Charter rights. Unlike other self-government agreements concluded after 1995, the agreements with the VGFN do not expressly state that the Charter applies.\n[100] Since we have concluded that the Charter applies through the normal operation of s. 32(1), it is unnecessary to address whether consent could be a proper basis for the application of the Charter, or whether it is even constitutionally open for the federal government or Parliament to agree that the Charter, as part of the \u201csupreme law of Canada\u201d (Constitution Act, 1982, s. 52(1)), does not apply to matters within Parliament\u2019s legislative authority. Even putting aside that legal issue, we emphasize that there is still value in self-government agreements expressly providing that the Charter applies to Indigenous governments, because such agreements may \u201csupply enough clarity to keep the issues out of the courts\u201d (Hogg and Wright, \u00a7 28:20; see also Watson, at p. 110, fn. 162).\n(d) Conclusion\n[101] We conclude that the Charter applies to the residency requirement, either because the VGFN is government by nature, or because the enactment and enforcement of the residency requirement is a \u201cgovernmental activity\u201d operating under a statutory power of compulsion. We reach this conclusion by applying the Eldridge framework to the specific agreements, implementing legislation, and Indigenous constitution at issue in this case. We expressly refrain from commenting on whether the Charter would apply to an Indigenous government exercising an inherent self-government authority untethered from federal, provincial, or territorial legislation.\nB. Sections 15, 25, and 1 of the Charter\n(1) Overview\n[102] Section 25 of the Charter is central to evaluating Ms. Dickson\u2019s claim that the residency requirement in the VGFN Constitution infringes her right to equality under s. 15(1) of the Charter. The VGFN agrees with the courts below that s. 25 operates as a shield to protect the residency requirement from challenge under the s. 15(1) Charter right. Ms. Dickson answers that s. 25 is not a bar to her claim. Properly balanced against the protection provided to Indigenous rights in s. 25 and considering s. 1 of the Charter, she says the residency requirement violates her right to be free from discrimination and cannot be justified in the circumstances.\n[103] Sections 15, 25, and 1 of the Charter provide:\n15 (1) Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.\n(2) Subsection (1) does not preclude any law, program or activity that has as its object the amelioration of conditions of disadvantaged individuals or groups including those that are disadvantaged because of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.\n25 The guarantee in this Charter of certain rights and freedoms shall not be construed so as to abrogate or derogate from any aboriginal, treaty or other rights or freedoms that pertain to the aboriginal peoples of Canada including\n(a) any rights or freedoms that have been recognized by the Royal Proclamation of October 7, 1763; and\n(b) any rights or freedoms that now exist by way of land claims agreements or may be so acquired.\n1 The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.\n[104] Over the life of the Charter, this Court has had relatively few occasions to consider the meaning of s. 25. When the Court has done so \u2014 as in R. v. Kapp, 2008 SCC 41, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 483, and Corbiere \u2014 it has addressed the equality right in circumstances different from this case. This case involves a dispute between a First Nation and one of its own members, and invites the Court to interpret s. 25 in connection with a residency requirement that is itself part of the constitutional law of a self-governing First Nation.\n[105] Corbiere did consider the constitutionality of a voting requirement that might be compared to the rule contested by Ms. Dickson, but the requirement in that case was under the Indian Act rather than an Indigenous constitution. Kapp involved a discrimination complaint based on s. 15(1) of the Charter and the possible relevance of s. 25 as an answer to that challenge, but that case was brought by a non-Indigenous person and did not concern an Indigenous law. And while Taypotat (SCC) involved a challenge under s. 15(1) of the Charter to a First Nation\u2019s rule on electoral qualifications brought by an Indigenous community member, the appeal was decided without addressing s. 25. Further complicating the relationship between the VGFN\u2019s collective right in s. 25 and the individual right invoked by Ms. Dickson is the reality that, ultimately, they are both rooted in Indigeneity (see generally Swiffen, at p. 34).\n[106] Elsewhere, the Court has made reference to s. 25, but did not have the opportunity, as it does here, to consider the full application and effect of the provision. The Court\u2019s existing jurisprudence thus provides only a modest guide for deciding this appeal. This invites caution. The majority\u2019s comment in Kapp on the complexities of s. 25 bears repeating: \u201c . . . prudence suggests that these issues are best left for resolution on a case-by-case basis as they arise before the Court\u201d (para. 65). As a result, our reasons focus on the task at hand: determining how s. 25 applies to the residency requirement in the constitution of a self-governing First Nation challenged by one of its members under s. 15(1) of the Charter.\n[107] The purpose of s. 25 is to uphold certain collective rights and freedoms of Indigenous peoples when those collective rights conflict with an individual\u2019s Charter rights. When an individual\u2019s Charter right would abrogate or derogate from an Aboriginal, treaty, or other right, s. 25 requires the collective Indigenous right to take precedence, even if the Charter claimant is a member of the First Nation concerned.\n[108] When Aboriginal, treaty, or \u201cother rights or freedoms\u201d specified in s. 25 are engaged, the limits on a competing individual Charter right need not be justified as would ordinarily be the case under s. 1 of the Charter. Unlike s. 1, s. 25 reflects a constitutional choice to protect the collective rights and freedoms associated with Indigenous peoples in Canada as a distinct minority. \u201c[R]espect for minority rights\u201d was identified by the Court in the Secession Reference, at para. 49, as an underlying constitutional principle that infuses the Constitution as a whole. The protection of linguistic and religious minorities are examples of this underlying principle, as is the protection of the rights of Indigenous peoples as a distinctive minority. This Court stated that, in keeping with a long tradition of respect for minorities, s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 provides protection for existing Aboriginal and treaty rights, while s. 25 similarly set forth a \u201cnon-derogation clause in favour of the rights of [A]boriginal peoples\u201d (Secession Reference, at para. 82). The Court allied the protection of s. 25 with the \u201cstrength [of the] promise\u201d to the Indigenous peoples of Canada in s. 35 that it had explained in Sparrow, at p. 1083. That promise \u201crecognized not only the ancient occupation of land by [A]boriginal peoples, but their contribution to the building of Canada, and the special commitments made to them by successive governments\u201d (Secession Reference, at para. 82).\n[109] Consonant with the principle of the protection of Indigenous peoples as a distinct minority, the \u201cother rights or freedoms\u201d in s. 25 are limited to those that protect Indigenous difference. All the collective Indigenous rights and freedoms referred to in s. 25 must be upheld, even when they conflict with individual Charter rights, in order to ensure respect for minority rights as a constitutional value.\n[110] The protection of Aboriginal, treaty, and other rights in s. 25 is not, however, absolute. Priority is given to collective Indigenous rights only when they conflict with an individual\u2019s Charter right. In any given case, the individual and collective rights referred to in s. 25 may not actually be in conflict. Some individual rights are part of Indigenous law and coexist with collective interests, as both the UNDRIP Act and the VGFN Constitution itself make plain (see Metallic, at p. 15; G. Otis, \u201c\u00c9lection, gouvernance traditionnelle et droits fondamentaux chez les peuples autochtones du Canada\u201d (2004), 49 McGill L.J. 393, at pp. 409\u201111). In addition, s. 25 would not apply if the individual Charter right invoked conflicted with an Indigenous right that does not rest on Indigenous difference. In such circumstances, any limit on the individual right must be justified under s. 1 of the Charter. And like s. 35 rights, the primacy afforded to the collective rights under s. 25 is subject to the equality guarantee for \u201cmale and female persons\u201d under s. 28 of the Charter and s. 35(4) of the Constitution Act, 1982.\n[111] In the reasons that follow, we seek to develop a framework to apply s. 25 to the circumstances of this case. The parties and interveners have described s. 25 as either a \u201cshield\u201d or an \u201cinterpretative prism\u201d (or \u201cinterpretive prism\u201d), but in our respectful view, neither term offers a full account of the provision. Section 25 mandates that when a Charter right abrogates or derogates from an Aboriginal, treaty, or other right belonging to the Aboriginal peoples of Canada, it can \u201cshield\u201d collective Indigenous rights from certain applications of the Charter. But to determine whether the individual Charter right conflicts with the collective Indigenous right or freedom, s. 25 directs that the individual Charter right must first be \u201cconstrued\u201d. Similarly, determining whether the residency requirement in the VGFN Constitution is an \u201cother righ[t] or freedo[m] that pertain[s] to the aboriginal peoples of Canada\u201d under s. 25 requires an exercise of interpretation.\n[112] In what follows, we first consider s. 25 in light of its purpose, with due consideration to its text, the Charter\u2019s character and larger object, and the provision\u2019s history. Second, we address the \u201cother\u201d collective rights and freedoms under s. 25 and their relationship to Indigenous difference. Finally, we discuss the scope of the so-called \u201cshield\u201d and \u201cinterpretative\u201d aspects of s. 25, before considering whether the provision protects the residency requirement in the VGFN Constitution from Ms. Dickson\u2019s s. 15(1) challenge, and further, whether the VGFN needs to justify its residency requirement under s. 1 of the Charter.\n(2) Purpose of Section 25\n[113] This Court has long recognized that the Charter must be interpreted purposively (see Hunter, at pp. 156-57; R. v. Poulin, 2019 SCC 47, [2019] 3 S.C.R. 566, at para. 32). A purposive approach engages with the text of the provision in question as a first factor, and then turns to \u201cthe character and the larger objects of the Charter itself . . ., to the historical origins of the concepts enshrined, and where applicable, to the meaning and purpose of the other specific rights and freedoms with which it is associated\u201d (Poulin, at para. 32, citing Big M Drug Mart, at p. 344; see also Quebec (Attorney General) v. 9147-0732 Qu\u00e9bec inc., 2020 SCC 32, [2020] 3 S.C.R. 426, at para. 10).\n[114] Further, as Lamer C.J. wrote in R. v. Van der Peet, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 507, the fiduciary relationship between the Crown and Indigenous peoples implies that \u201ctreaties, s. 35(1), and other statutory and constitutional provisions protecting the interests of [A]boriginal peoples, must be given a generous and liberal interpretation\u201d (para. 24, citing R. v. George, [1966] S.C.R. 267, at p. 279). In our view, the protection of Indigenous minority interests under s. 25 should be interpreted in the same spirit.\n[115] Before this Court, Ms. Dickson asserts that the purpose of s. 25, \u201clike s. 35, is the reconciliation of Indigenous peoples of Canada with the broader Canadian state\u201d (A.F., at para. 57). She sees s. 25 as aligned with international instruments that provide a balance in which Indigenous peoples have the right to the \u201cfull enjoyment\u201d of collective and individual rights and freedoms, which means that s. 25 is \u201can interpretative provision aimed at reconciliation\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Condensed Book, at p. 10). The VGFN urges the Court to consider s. 25 and the objective of reconciliation differently. It says the purpose of s. 25 is to \u201cprotect space necessary for Indigenous peoples to continue to be Indigenous\u201d as the process of reconciliation unfolds (Respondent\u2019s Condensed Book, at p. 1). The VGFN says that this \u201cspace\u201d includes the collective right of self-government, grounded in \u201cpre-existing societies of Indigenous peoples\u201d (p. 1). In our view, there is merit in both perspectives: s. 25 operates to \u201creconcile\u201d conflicting individual and collective rights and creates a novel dynamic for resolving any such conflict, but the provision also gives primacy to certain Indigenous rights over conflicting individual Charter rights to promote the reconciliation of Indigenous peoples with the Crown\u2019s assertion of sovereignty (see R. v. Desautel, 2021 SCC 17, [2021] 1 S.C.R. 533, at para. 22).\n[116] Both courts below (see trial reasons, at para. 198; C.A. reasons, at para. 148) relied on Bastarache J.\u2019s purpose statement for s. 25 from his concurring opinion in Kapp: \u201c. . . protecting the rights of [A]boriginal peoples where the application of the Charter protections for individuals would diminish the distinctive, collective and cultural identity of an [A]boriginal group . . .\u201d (para. 89, citing J. M. Arbour, \u201cThe Protection of Aboriginal Rights within a Human Rights Regime: In Search of an Analytical Framework for Section 25 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\u201d (2003), 21 S.C.L.R. (2d) 3, at p. 60). A significant body of academic commentary also supports the view that s. 25 has an essentially protective purpose regarding collective Indigenous interests (see, e.g., W. Pentney, \u201cThe Rights of the Aboriginal Peoples of Canada and the Constitution Act, 1982: Part I \u2014 The Interpretive Prism of Section 25\u201d (1988), 22 U.B.C. L. Rev. 21, at p. 28); K. McNeil, \u201cThe Constitutional Rights of the Aboriginal Peoples of Canada\u201d (1982), 4 S.C.L.R. 255, at p. 262; Macklem, at p. 225; C. Hutchinson, \u201cCase Comment on R. v. Kapp: An Analytical Framework for Section 25 of the Charter\u201d (2007), 52 McGill L.J. 173, at p. 179). The VGFN asks this Court to adopt Bastarache J.\u2019s statement of purpose (R.F., at para. 104), as do some interveners, including the Attorney General of Canada (I.F., at para. 29).\n[117] A majority of this Court has never fully analyzed the purpose of s. 25 of the Charter. This appeal requires us to do so. We view the purpose of s. 25 of the Charter as ensuring that the designated rights and freedoms of Indigenous peoples are protected where giving effect to conflicting individual Charter rights and freedoms would diminish Indigenous difference. This purpose aligns with the broad goals of s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 and is in step with the framework embraced by this Court to reconcile the sovereignty of the Crown with the reality that Indigenous peoples lived here, in distinct societies with laws, traditions, and customs, long before European contact (see Van der Peet, at para. 31). Section 25 echoes the aspiration to reconcile the guarantee of individual rights and freedoms in the Charter for all Canadians with the distinctive collective rights of Indigenous peoples. Protecting collective rights and freedoms in this way is also consonant with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, as brought into Canadian law by the UNDRIP Act. We recall in particular Article 34 of the Declaration: \u201cIndigenous peoples have the right to promote, develop and maintain their institutional structures and their distinctive customs, spirituality, traditions, procedures, practices and, in the cases where they exist, juridical systems or customs, in accordance with international human rights standards.\u201d\n[118] Four interpretative indicators support our view that s. 25\u2019s purpose is to protect Indigenous difference against inappropriate erosion by individual Charter rights: (1) the text of the provision; (2) the character and larger objects of the Charter; (3) the origin, meaning, and purpose of the Aboriginal and treaty rights referred to in s. 25; and (4) extrinsic evidence relating to the advent of s. 25.\n(a) Text of Section 25\n[119] First, the text of s. 25 plainly suggests the protective purpose of the provision. Two aspects of the wording are significant. The first is the operative terms used in the English and French texts \u2014 \u201cshall not be construed so as to abrogate or derogate\u201d from certain Indigenous rights in English, and \u201cne porte pas atteinte\u201d to those rights in French \u2014 which signal that s. 25 protects against an inappropriate impairment of the collective Indigenous right that would flow from applying the conflicting individual Charter right or freedom. This strong language has been seen by some as the surest sign that s. 25 operates as a \u201cbar\u201d or a \u201cshield\u201d against applying a Charter right that would diminish a relevant collective Indigenous interest. The second indicium bears on the character of the Indigenous rights that are relevant under s. 25. The phrase \u201cthat pertain to the aboriginal peoples of Canada\u201d or \u201cdes peuples autochtones du Canada\u201d suggests a guide to the proper scope of s. 25\u2019s protection.\n[120] For some, the reference to the fact that the individual Charter rights \u201cshall not be construed\u201d to abrogate or derogate from the collective Indigenous interest in the English version \u2014 absent from the French text \u2014 gestures to an interpretative dimension to s. 25. In addition, the words \u201cpertain to\u201d in the English version points to a wide berth for such other rights as they relate to Aboriginal peoples; others see the reference in the French to \u201cdes peuples autochtones\u201d as more confining. Given that an understanding of s. 25\u2019s purpose will begin with the text, it is important to examine these two indicia carefully and to dispel any sense that the French and English versions of the provision diverge from a shared meaning around a single purpose of protecting collective Indigenous interests from being diminished by individual Charter rights.\n[121] The French and English texts are, of course, equally authoritative as expressions of the intent reflected in s. 25 (see s. 57 of the Constitution Act, 1982; R. Sullivan, The Construction of Statutes (7th ed. 2022), at pp. 114-15). It is a recognized principle of bilingual interpretation, applicable to the Charter, that the exercise of discerning legislative intent can properly include the search for a shared meaning between the two linguistic texts, typically identified by reading both versions together (R. v. Collins, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265, at pp. 287-88; R. v. Lewis, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 921, at para. 72; see also P.-A. C\u00f4t\u00e9 and M. Devinat, Interpr\u00e9tation des lois (5th ed. 2021), at No. 1126).\n[122] In Kapp, Bastarache J. analyzed the text of s. 25 at some length, including possible discordances between the French and English versions as one measure of meaning for the provision. We agree with Bastarache J.\u2019s conclusion that the observable differences in wording between the French and English versions are not decisive as to the meaning of s. 25 and that, read together, they support a view of a single protective purpose (see paras. 86 and 101-3).\n[123] The language of \u201cabrogate or derogate\u201d and \u201cporte . . . atteinte\u201d (i.e. impairs, or harms) suggests that the purpose of s. 25 is what this Court has called, on occasion, a \u201cnon-derogation clause in favour of the rights of [A]boriginal peoples\u201d (Secession Reference, at para. 82) or a provision that \u201cshields\u201d Aboriginal rights from being abrogated or derogated from (Desautel, at para. 39). The chosen phrases both signal that s. 25 may act as a bar against the abrogation of or derogation from Indigenous collective interests by conflicting individual Charter rights. The texts speak to this somewhat differently. Scholar Jane M. Arbour usefully noted that the French text is more \u201cdeclaratory\u201d of the protective effect of s. 25 that would apply if a claimant\u2019s individual Charter right impaired the relevant Indigenous collective interest (p. 27). By comparison, she wrote, the language of \u201cshall not be construed\u201d in the English text refers explicitly to an interpretative exercise (p. 27 (emphasis deleted)). She did not see this difference of emphasis, however, as having any consequence in law.\n[124] There is a shared meaning for the central protective purpose conveyed by the two linguistic texts. To determine whether the relevant Indigenous collective interest should take precedence over (or be shielded from) a claimant\u2019s individual Charter right, one must discern whether what Bastarache J. called the two \u201ccompeting rights\u201d are in conflict, which requires that they be interpreted or \u201cconstrued\u201d (Kapp, at para. 87). This interpretative exercise is spoken to explicitly in the English text and is implicit in the more declaratory French text: one would have to interpret the two rights in question in order to conclude that the individual Charter right \u201cporte . . . atteinte\u201d (i.e., impairs or harms) the Indigenous collective interest. Similarly, one could only conclude that the effect of the individual Charter right is to \u201cabrogate\u201d (i.e., nullify or repeal), or to \u201cderogate\u201d from (i.e., detract or depart from), the collective right after having identified, through an initial exercise of interpretation of the competing interests, whether the collective right is incompatible with the individual Charter right or freedom. The French text uses a generic term to describe the effect of a conflict (\u201cporte . . . atteinte\u201d). The English text refers to the same idea by specifying how the effect of the conflict manifests itself (\u201cabrogate or derogate\u201d). Thus, the shared meaning in English and French suggests that s. 25 has both interpretative and shield dimensions, both of which are relevant to the purpose of the clause. The difference in expression is best explained by the exigencies of linguistic form.\n[125] Yet the mandatory language in the English text (\u201cshall not be construed\u201d) and the declaratory formulation of the French (\u201cne porte pas atteinte\u201d) suggests the compass of interpretation is limited and, in both texts, any judicial discretion in interpreting the competing individual and collective interests is constrained by the direction that the construction of the individual right cannot extend beyond the point of conflict with the protected minority interest. In sum, both linguistic versions of the Charter are \u201cnot only reconcilable, they are different ways of expressing the same idea\u201d (9147-0732 Qu\u00e9bec inc., at para. 65, per Abella J., dissenting, but not on this point).\n[126] In a closely related context, the UNDRIP Act contains a provision in its division on \u201cInterpretation\u201d, in its English and French texts, that maintains Indigenous rights in a similar fashion. Section 2(2) provides: \u201cThis Act is to be construed as upholding the rights of Indigenous peoples recognized and affirmed by section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982, and not as abrogating or derogating from them\u201d (in French, \u201celle n\u2019y porte pas atteinte\u201d). This supports the view that the \u201cupholding\u201d or \u201cmaintien\u201d of Indigenous rights under the protective purpose of s. 25 of the Charter can involve elements of a shield and of an exercise of construction.\n[127] Similarly, the difference in emphasis between \u201cpertain to the aboriginal peoples\u201d, in the English version of s. 25, and \u201cdes peuples autochtones\u201d, in the French version, is of no legal consequence in light of the clear shared meaning between the two versions. It is true that \u201cpertain to\u201d has a potentially broad meaning extending beyond rights that would belong to Indigenous peoples to include those that might relate to them more incidentally. The use of the French possessive \u201cdes\u201d is plainly narrower. Professors Pierre\u2010Andr\u00e9 C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Mathieu Devinat explain that, in such instances, [translation] \u201cthe shared meaning is thus the more narrow of the two\u201d (No. 1131). In this case, the narrower meaning conveyed by the French text is shared with the English text: \u201cdes peuples autochtones\u201d alludes to rights that belong to or benefit Indigenous peoples qua Indigenous peoples or, as Bastarache J. observed in Kapp, that \u201care particular to them\u201d (para. 101). This closer connection between the right or freedom and Indigenous peoples will prove important, as we shall see, in the measure of what scholars have described as the \u201cIndigenous difference\u201d spoken to in the rights or freedoms in s. 25.\n[128] We also observe that the marginal notes for s. 25 characterize the provision as \u201cAboriginal rights and freedoms not affected by Charter\u201d and \u201cMaintien des droits et libert\u00e9s des autochtones\u201d. Marginal notes are of course not an integral part of the text, and thus no definitive weight should be attributed to them when construing Charter provisions (see R. v. Wigglesworth, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 541, at pp. 556-58). But however limited their interpretative value, these notes support the view that s. 25\u2019s purpose is to guard against certain effects on rights belonging to the Indigenous peoples of Canada that would flow from applying the Charter.\n[129] Finally, it is noteworthy that the language in s. 25 is also found in ss. 21 and 22 of the Charter on the maintenance of certain language rights, and s. 29 on the maintenance of rights regarding certain schools. These provisions use phrasing similar to s. 25: \u201c[n]othing in [the relevant provisions] abrogates or derogates from [pre-existing rights]\u201d along with the French \u201cn\u2019ont pas pour effet de porter atteinte\u201d. Section 29, a Charter provision found (as is s. 25) in the \u201cGeneral\u201d \/ \u201cDispositions g\u00e9n\u00e9rales\u201d division of the Charter, has been allied with s. 25 as bearing on the underlying constitutional principle of the protection of minority rights (Secession Reference, at paras. 79 and 82). Section 29, with this similar vocation to s. 25\u2019s, was interpreted by this Court in Reference re Bill 30, An Act to amend the Education Act (Ont.), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1148, by Wilson J., who wrote that \u201cs. 29 is there to render immune from Charter review rights or privileges which would otherwise, i.e., but for s. 29 be subject to such review. . . . [T]hey are insulated from Charter attack\u201d (p. 1198). Commenting on the relevance of these related provisions to the purposive interpretation of s. 25, prior to his appointment to the bench, Professor Kenneth M. Lysyk has written that the \u201ccommon feature of all these provisions [(i.e., ss. 21, 25, 26 and 29)] is that they are saving clauses designed to protect rights that exist independently of the Charter itself\u201d (\u201cThe Rights and Freedoms of the Aboriginal Peoples of Canada\u201d, in W. S. Tarnopolsky and G.-A. Beaudoin, eds., The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms: Commentary (1982), 467, at p. 471). This further supports the view that the text of s. 25 has a protective purpose of safeguarding Indigenous rights from incursions by individual Charter rights.\n(b) Character and Larger Objects of the Charter\n[130] The character and larger objects of the Charter are consonant with the idea that the purpose of s. 25 is, as the text suggests, the protection of collective Indigenous minority interests from encroachment by conflicting individual Charter rights and freedoms. In R. v. Oakes, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103, Dickson C.J. wrote that the \u201cvalues and principles essential to a free and democratic society\u201d that might justify limitations on Charter rights include \u201crespect for cultural and group identity\u201d (p. 136). This latter idea, as we have seen, was identified in the Secession Reference, at para. 82, as an \u201cunderlying constitutional value\u201d \u2014 that of protection for minority rights. It finds expression in the constitutional text through, among other provisions, s. 25 of the Charter (see also Metallic, at p. 13). Chief Justice Lamer explained in Van der Peet that it is Indigenous peoples\u2019 prior occupancy of North America that \u201cseparates [them] from all other minority groups in Canadian society and which mandates their special legal, and now constitutional, status\u201d (para. 30).\n[131] These foundational decisions, and this Court\u2019s broader jurisprudence, confirm that while the Charter undoubtedly protects individual rights (see McKinney, at p. 261), it was not intended to do so at the expense of the collective rights of the Indigenous peoples of Canada as a distinct minority deserving of constitutional protection. The recognition that s. 25 protects certain rights and freedoms from abrogation or derogation that might flow from giving effect to conflicting Charter rights and freedoms is, therefore, in keeping with the character and overarching purposes of the Charter itself.\n(c) Historical Origins, Meaning and Purpose of Aboriginal and Treaty Rights\n[132] Aboriginal and treaty rights referred to in s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 shed light on the protection afforded by s. 25, which refers, in part, to the same rights. Section 35 gives those rights constitutional status by protecting them from unjustified infringement by legislative and executive action (see Sparrow).\n[133] In Van der Peet, Lamer C.J. explained that the doctrine of Aboriginal rights and the approach to interpreting those rights liberally in the Constitution is explained by plain historical fact: \u201c. . . when Europeans arrived in North America, [A]boriginal peoples were already here, living in communities on the land, and participating in distinctive cultures, as they had done for centuries\u201d (para. 30 (emphasis in original)). He therefore stated that s. 35 is designed to \u201cprovide the constitutional framework through which the fact that [A]boriginals lived on the land in distinctive societies, with their own practices, traditions and cultures, is acknowledged and reconciled with the sovereignty of the Crown\u201d (para. 31).\n[134] Section 35 also constitutionally entrenched treaty rights held by the Aboriginal peoples of Canada, which s. 35(3) states, for greater certainty, \u201cincludes rights that now exist by way of land claims agreements or may be so acquired\u201d. This constitutional guarantee is warranted because \u201ca treaty represents an exchange of solemn promises between the Crown and the various [First] [N]ations. It is an agreement whose nature is sacred\u201d (R. v. Badger, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 771, at para. 41).\n[135] The Court has given full expression to the purposes of s. 35 by recognizing that Aboriginal and treaty rights extend to a wide range of underlying constitutional interests. For instance, constitutional recognition of Indigenous peoples\u2019 relationships with the land can ground the right for an Indigenous people to hold land title that, in some circumstances, rests on s. 35 (see Delgamuukw; Tsilhqot\u2019in Nation v. British Columbia, 2014 SCC 44, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 257). Further, treaties may address various interests, including interests related to land or self-government (see, e.g., First Nation of Nacho Nyak Dun, at para. 10).\n[136] In Kapp, Bastarache J. drew upon Professor Macklem\u2019s view that the broad scope of the interests of the Indigenous peoples of Canada that may be recognized as constitutionally entrenched are those related to \u201c[I]ndigenous difference\u201d. Professor Macklem observed that Indigenous difference reflects \u201cfour complex social facts [that] lie at the heart of the relationship between Aboriginal people and the Canadian state\u201d (p. 4). These are: \u201c. . . Aboriginal cultural difference, Aboriginal prior occupancy, Aboriginal prior sovereignty, and Aboriginal participation in a treaty process . . .\u201d (p. 4).\n[137] Relying on the Court\u2019s opinion in the Secession Reference connecting both s. 35 and s. 25 to a tradition of constitutional protection of minority rights, Ms. Dickson asserts that s. 25 protects initiatives designed to preserve or enhance Indigenous difference. The Attorney General of Alberta intervenes to argue similarly that s. 25 \u201cenables an approach that protects interests associated with Indigenous difference from erosion by individual Charter rights\u201d (I.F., at para. 20). The VGFN resists this conclusion, and answers that this characterization would exclude a wide range of self-governance rights and unduly limit s. 25\u2019s protections. Instead, the VGFN ties the impugned residency requirement to Indigenous difference and the continuance of a pre-contact Indigenous legal order.\n[138] Indigenous difference is an appropriate criterion for circumscribing the \u201cother rights or freedoms\u201d under s. 25 because it helps identify the contours of the provision\u2019s protective purpose if there is a conflict with an individual Charter right. Indigenous difference connects the \u201cother righ[t] or freedo[m]\u201d to the collective minority interest that s. 25 is designed to serve. When Indigenous difference is not shown to underlie the competing collective interest, the ultimate justification for setting aside the individual Charter right falls away. The concept of Indigenous difference connects the \u201cother rights\u201d to the rest of s. 25 and gives content to what it means for a right or freedom to belong to or benefit \u2014 to meaningfully \u201cpertain to\u201d \u2014 the Aboriginal peoples of Canada.\n[139] The clear relationship between ss. 25 and 35 suggests that their purposes must be seen as related. Section 35 speaks to how the Canadian Constitution protects Indigenous difference from unjustified legislative or executive infringement. In the same spirit, s. 25 ensures that the individual rights in the Charter do not themselves undermine Indigenous difference where they abrogate or derogate from the measures that protect that difference.\n(d) Extrinsic Evidence\n[140] Finally, the protective purpose of s. 25 is confirmed by the testimony and debates before Parliament in relation to the provision\u2019s genesis. These extrinsic materials suggest that s. 25 was initially viewed, in the words of then Minister of Justice Jean Chr\u00e9tien, as a means of identifying which Indigenous rights would \u201cnot . . . be adversely affected by the Charter\u201d (Senate and House of Commons, Minutes of Proceedings and Evidence of the Special Joint Committee of the Senate and of the House of Commons on the Constitution of Canada, No. 36, 1st Sess., 32nd Parl., January 12, 1981, at p. 18; see also No. 38, 1st Sess., 32nd Parl., January 15, 1981, at pp. 67-69 (Hon. Jean Chr\u00e9tien; Mr. Roger Tass\u00e9); Arbour, at pp. 30-37). As noted earlier, the Government of Canada has regularly pursued a policy that the Charter should apply to all Canadians, including self-governing Indigenous peoples, and that s. 25 is a mechanism in the Constitution that directs that the Charter must be interpreted in a manner that respects and upholds Aboriginal, treaty, and other like rights (The Government of Canada\u2019s Approach to Implementation of the Inherent Right and the Negotiation of Aboriginal Self-Government; see generally Hogg and Turpel).\n[141] In our view, this sustains the generous approach to be taken in interpreting \u201cother rights\u201d in s. 25 and the Indigenous difference criterion, which helps guard against an overzealous application of the Charter to self-governing Indigenous peoples. Before his appointment to the bench, Professor S\u00e9bastien Grammond described the protection of the collective interest in s. 25 as something of a counterweight to the application of the Charter to self-governing Indigenous peoples:\n[translation] Therein may lie the most elegant way to transcend the debate: a flexible interpretation of section 25 could result in the Charter being considered applicable to Indigenous governments in principle, but in an attenuated manner, which seeks to ensure that the central elements of the Indigenous society are not infringed upon.\n(Am\u00e9nager la coexistence: Les peuples autochtones et le droit canadien (2003), at p. 342)\n[142] Although we would not assign definitive weight to external evidence of the purpose of this Charter provision (see Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486, at pp. 504-7), it too supports s. 25\u2019s protective purpose.\n(e) Conclusion on the Purpose of Section 25\n[143] We thus conclude that the purpose of s. 25 is to protect certain Indigenous collective rights from the application of conflicting individual Charter rights or freedoms, when such application would diminish the Indigenous difference protected and recognized by the collective rights. When the application of the individual right would undermine in an essential or non-incidental way the Indigenous difference protected by the collective right, s. 25 directs that the collective right be given primacy. This differs from the process of determining whether the impairment of an individual Charter right is justified in a free and democratic society under s. 1 of the Charter, which is not solely targeted at protecting the collective minority right as a social and constitutional good.\n(3) Rights Within the Scope of Section 25\n[144] In light of the purpose of s. 25, what collective minority rights or freedoms fall within its scope? Section 25 refers to \u201caboriginal, treaty or other rights or freedoms\u201d and provides that these include any rights or freedoms (a) recognized by the Royal Proclamation, 1763 (G.B.), 3 Geo. 3 (reproduced in R.S.C. 1985, App. II, No. 1), or (b) acquired through land claims agreements. By including \u201cother\u201d rights and freedoms among those deserving of constitutional protection in this context, s. 25 speaks to a wider range of rights than s. 35 (see, e.g., B. Slattery, \u201cThe Constitutional Guarantee of Aboriginal and Treaty Rights\u201d (1982), 8 Queen\u2019s L.J. 232, at p. 237; Hogg and Wright, at \u00a7 28:41). Professor Lysyk notes that the subcategories of rights or freedoms under s. 25(a) and (b) \u201cexemplify, but do not limit, the full range of rights and freedoms to which the protection of s. 25 extends\u201d (p. 473).\n[145] Whether an asserted right is an Aboriginal or treaty right depends of course on the applicable law concerning the recognition of such rights (see, e.g., Van der Peet; Pamajewon; R. v. Gladstone, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 723; Mitchell v. M.N.R., 2001 SCC 33, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 911; R. v. Sappier, 2006 SCC 54, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 686; Lax Kw\u2019alaams Indian Band v. Canada (Attorney General), 2011 SCC 56, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 535; Desautel; and see, e.g., R. v. Sioui, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1025; R. v. Sundown, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 393; Manitoba Metis Federation Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2013 SCC 14, [2013] 1 S.C.R. 623). However, no framework for the recognition of the third category of rights protected by s. 25 \u2014 \u201cother rights\u201d \u2014 has yet been definitively established.\n[146] In Kapp, the majority in obiter considered the scope of the rights included under s. 25 and wrote that not every Indigenous interest falls within its scope. Rather, \u201conly rights of a constitutional character are likely to benefit from s. 25\u201d (para. 63, per McLachlin C.J. and Abella J.). Justice Bastarache proposed a broader approach, consistent with the idea that s. 25 protects all rights that are \u201cunique to [Indigenous peoples] because of their special status\u201d, that is, rights that protect Indigenous difference (para. 103; see also para. 106).\n[147] Before this Court, Ms. Dickson asserts that only rights with \u201cconstitutional status\u201d, in the sense that they cannot be repealed or altered by ordinary legislation, are protected under s. 25 (A.F., at para. 66(a)). The VGFN opposes such a restriction. Alternatively, it submits that even if the rights protected under s. 25 must have a \u201cconstitutional character\u201d, this cannot mean that \u201ca court declaration or recognition by the Crown of an \u2018existing\u2019 aboriginal right is a pre-condition for s. 25 to apply\u201d (R.F., at para. 112).\n[148] It is recognized that Charter rights are not absolute (see Canada (Attorney General) v. JTI-Macdonald Corp., 2007 SCC 30, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 610, at para. 36). This is equally true for a provision like s. 25 that protects certain Indigenous rights and freedoms (see Kapp, at para. 97, per Bastarache J.). Potential limitations on the scope of \u201cother\u201d rights under s. 25 include limits on sources of the right, which we refer to as \u201cformal\u201d restrictions, and limits on the nature of the right, which we refer to as \u201csubstantive\u201d restrictions.\n[149] It is clear from the text and purpose of s. 25 that the provision\u2019s protections are not restricted to rights with \u201cconstitutional status\u201d, understood as rights that cannot be repealed or altered by ordinary legislation, as argued by Ms. Dickson. The possibility of such a formal restriction is foreclosed, in particular, by the express inclusion of rights recognized by the Royal Proclamation, 1763, which is not one of the documents that comprise the Canadian Constitution by virtue of s. 52(2) and is seen as having \u201cforce as a statute\u201d in a manner analogous to the status of the Magna Carta (Calder v. Attorney-General of British Columbia, [1973] S.C.R. 313, at p. 395, per Hall J.). Further, as the intervener the Attorney General of Canada notes, were s. 25 intended to only protect rights and freedoms with constitutional status, \u201cthe provision would presumably have referred to a right or freedom guaranteed by the Constitution of Canada, as was done in s. 29 of the Charter\u201d (I.F., at para. 45). As a result, the rights protected under s. 25 are not limited to those that are constitutionally entrenched and may instead include ordinary statutory rights (see also Corbiere, at para. 52, per L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9 J.).\n[150] While we would not give effect to the formal restriction on the source of an \u201cother\u201d right proposed by Ms. Dickson, the text and purpose of s. 25 do suggest a substantive restriction. Since s. 25 was intended to protect rights associated with Indigenous difference \u2014 understood as interests connected to cultural difference, prior occupancy, prior sovereignty, or participation in the treaty process \u2014 whether a right warrants s. 25 protection on the basis that it is an \u201cother\u201d right will hinge on whether it protects or recognizes those interests. In short, a party seeking the protection of s. 25 for a right alleged to be an \u201cother\u201d right must establish both the existence of the right and the fact that the right protects or recognizes Indigenous difference.\n[151] The Attorney General of Canada intervenes to say that a restriction on the scope of \u201cother\u201d rights is that they must have a \u201cconstitutional character\u201d in a substantive, rather than a formal, sense (see, e.g., I.F., at para. 44). While Bastarache J. suggested that a \u201cconstitutional character\u201d requirement stands in opposition to a broader, minority rights approach focused on protecting rights associated with Indigenous difference (Kapp, at paras. 102-3), it may be that the two are compatible if protecting Indigenous difference has inherent constitutional significance. However, since the asserted right at issue here has a constitutional character, we would leave for another day whether \u201cconstitutional character\u201d represents a distinct substantive restriction on \u201cother\u201d rights.\n(4) Operation of Section 25\n[152] When a right has been shown to be an Aboriginal, treaty, or \u201cother righ[t] or freedo[m]\u201d, s. 25 protections do not apply automatically. Those protections apply only if it is determined that there is irreconcilable conflict between the claimed Charter right and the s. 25 right, such that giving effect to the Charter right would undermine the Indigenous difference protected or recognized by the collective right. The question becomes what kind of protection the provision affords. There is broad consensus that s. 25 does not create new substantive rights or freedoms (see Hogg and Wright, at \u00a7 28:41; see also R. v. Steinhauer (1985), 63 A.R. 381 (Q.B.), at para. 19; R. v. Augustine (1986), 74 N.B.R. (2d) 156 (C.A.), at para. 50; R. v. Nicholas (1988), 91 N.B.R. (2d) 248 (Q.B.), at para. 10; R. v. Willocks (1992), 14 C.R.R. (2d) 373 (Ont. C.J. (Prov. Div.)), at p. 383, aff\u2019d (1995), 22 O.R. (3d) 552 (C.J. (Gen. Div.)); R. v. Redhead (1995), 99 C.C.C. (3d) 559 (Man. Q.B.), at p. 573; Kapp, at para. 79, per Bastarache J.; Rice v. Agence du revenu du Qu\u00e9bec, 2016 QCCA 666, [2016] 3 C.N.L.R. 311, at para. 50). However, the details of s. 25\u2019s operation remain largely unsettled.\n(a) The Effect of Section 25\n(i) Competing Views on the Effect of Section 25\n[153] In Kapp, this Court considered two competing views on the effect of s. 25 (para. 64, per McLachlin C.J. and Abella J.; paras. 79-80 and 94-97, per Bastarache J.). The first approach sees s. 25 as a \u201cshield\u201d. On this view, a successful invocation of s. 25 would bar a Charter claim in circumstances where applying the Charter right would abrogate or derogate from a right within the scope of s. 25 (para. 64; paras. 80 and 94-97).\n[154] The second approach sees s. 25 as an \u201cinterpretive prism\u201d or rule of interpretation (see Pentney, at pp. 27-29). The majority in Kapp wrote that s. 25 serves to \u201cinfor[m] the construction of potentially conflicting Charter rights\u201d, rather than act as a barrier to the Charter\u2019s application (para. 64). On this view, courts would attempt to construe the relevant Charter right to give effect to it without abrogating or derogating from the identified s. 25 right. If a conflict occurs, however, the Aboriginal, treaty, or other right would be afforded no special priority; the question as to whether the collective Indigenous right should be upheld would be left to judicial discretion, to be determined on a case-by-case basis (see, e.g., B. H. Wildsmith, Aboriginal peoples and Section 25 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (1988), at pp. 10-11).\n[155] In Kapp, Bastarache J. favoured the \u201cshield\u201d approach over the \u201cinterpretative prism\u201d view, noting that s. 25 was intended to give \u201cprimacy\u201d to Aboriginal, treaty, or other rights (para. 81; see also paras. 94-97). The Kapp majority resolved the case under s. 15(2) of the Charter and declined to decide this point (paras. 62-65).\n[156] Before this Court, Ms. Dickson argues that s. 25 should not operate as an \u201cabsolute\u201d shield (see A.F., at para. 97; see also paras. 11, 47, 56, 92-93, 96, 100 and 102). Instead, she submits that s. 25 should be considered as part of the s. 1 analysis under a balancing approach that weighs \u201cthe harm to the rights of Indigenous communities\u201d against the \u201charm of the Charter infringement\u201d (para. 97; see also paras. 50-52). In contrast, the VGFN contends that s. 25 achieves its purpose of ensuring \u201cthat the rights and freedoms of Indigenous peoples and their special position within Canadian society are not eroded by the guarantee of Charter rights and freedoms to Canadians\u201d by \u201cproviding a \u2018shield\u2019 for Indigenous rights and freedoms\u201d (R.F., at para. 104). It styles s. 25 as a \u201ccomplete shield\u201d to Ms. Dickson\u2019s s. 15(1) claim, not subject to limits, including those associated with s. 1 of the Charter (heading of para. 122; see also para. 126).\n[157] In the sparse s. 25 jurisprudence, the metaphorical language of a \u201cshield\u201d is sometimes used to describe the protective effect of the provision. Before Kapp, L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9 J. spoke of a \u201cshield\u201d in her concurring reasons in Corbiere (paras. 51-53). More recently, Rowe J., writing for the majority in Desautel, stated that s. 25 \u201cshields the rights and freedoms that pertain to Aboriginal peoples of Canada from being abrogated by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\u201d (para. 39). Lower courts have often referred to s. 25 as a \u201cshield\u201d (see, e.g., Steinhauer, at para. 19; Willocks (Ont. C.J. (Prov. Div.)), at p. 383; Campbell v. British Columbia (Attorney General), 2000 BCSC 1123, 79 B.C.L.R. (3d) 122, at paras. 156-58). In the present case, the trial judge and the Court of Appeal both adopted \u201cshield\u201d terminology in their s. 25 analyses (trial reasons, at para. 180; C.A. reasons, at para. 158). Shield-based approaches to s. 25 have also been embraced by some legal academics, although there remains no scholarly consensus (see Swiffen, at pp. 27 and 32\u201134).\n(ii) The Proper Approach to the Effect of Section 25\n1. Section 25 Affords Primacy to Indigenous Rights in Cases of Irreconcilable Conflict\n[158] In our view, the proper approach to s. 25 includes elements drawn from both the \u201cshield\u201d and \u201cinterpretative prism\u201d approaches. As we explain, s. 25 can be said to have a \u201cshielding\u201d effect because it affords primacy to Aboriginal, treaty, or other rights. However, a right within the scope of s. 25 is only prioritized after an interpretive exercise demonstrates that there is an irreconcilable conflict between the collective right and the individual Charter right in question.\n[159] In light of the purposive analysis above, the provision will sometimes serve as a \u201cshield\u201d for Aboriginal, treaty, and other rights to protect the collective minority interest of Indigenous peoples. But we also agree with the Attorney General of Canada that the s. 25 analysis should not rely too heavily on the metaphor of a \u201cshield\u201d (I.F., at paras. 31-33). An absolutist approach to s. 25, which would \u201cblock . . . a dialogue on the competing and, at times, conflicting interests\u201d, is inconsistent with a purposive approach (para. 32, citing Arbour, at p. 13). It also stands in opposition to the idea that in Indigenous legal cultures, as in Canadian constitutional law, individual and collective rights are conceived as operating harmoniously. Although the provision is not a mere interpretive lens for Charter analysis, discerning the extent of s. 25 protection requires drawing on some aspects of both approaches. This position has been advocated by a segment of the scholarly community: for example, Arbour argues that the shielding effect of s. 25 only applies once the court has determined that it is impossible to interpret the s. 25 identified right and the Charter right in a way that upholds them both (pp. 61-62).\n[160] As we have seen, the text of s. 25 suggests that prioritization is only warranted for Aboriginal, treaty, and other rights if giving effect to the claimed Charter right would abrogate or derogate from those collective rights. If there is no conflict between the Charter right and the Aboriginal, treaty, or other right, there is no need to protect the collective right from intrusion occasioned by the individual right. The Attorney General of Alberta joins the Attorney General of Canada and other interveners to argue that the effect of s. 25 is that Charter rights must yield to the s. 25 identified rights to the extent of the conflict between them. The M\u00e9tis Nation of Ontario and the M\u00e9tis Nation of Alberta similarly submit that where there is potential for \u201creal conflict\u201d between the exercise of a s. 25 right and an individual Charter right, \u201cthe Charter rights must give way\u201d (I.F., at para. 29).\n[161] The key question, then, is what kind of conflict must be shown between the collective and individual rights concerned for the s. 25 shield to operate. Standards ranging from \u201cpotential\u201d to \u201ctrue\u201d conflict have been suggested. In our view, the conflict between the rights must be real and irreconcilable, such that there is no way to give effect to the individual Charter right without abrogating or derogating from the right within the scope of s. 25. To adopt a lesser standard, such as the mere possibility of a conflict, would detract from the seriousness of compromising an individual Charter right. Section 25 protects the collective Indigenous interest when the conflict is not hypothetical and cannot be avoided.\n[162] The requirement of an irreconcilable conflict between the two rights best aligns with the purpose and text of s. 25 because if there is a way, through fair and careful interpretation, for courts to give effect to the Charter right and the s. 25 identified right, then \u201c[b]oth rights are respected, and the conflict is averted\u201d (R. v. N.S., 2012 SCC 72, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 726, at para. 32). In such cases, the individual Charter right has been construed to not \u201cabrogate\u201d or \u201cderogate\u201d from the right within the scope of s. 25.\n[163] Determining whether there is an irreconcilable conflict between the rights at issue is an interpretive exercise. It requires courts to interpret the substance of both the Charter right and the Aboriginal, treaty, or other right at issue (see Hutchinson, at p. 185). This interpretive exercise must be informed by, and respectful of, Indigenous perspectives (see Corbiere, at para. 54, per L\u2019Heureux\u2011Dub\u00e9 J.). At the same time, courts must be careful not to depart from the generous interpretation of individual Charter rights and freedoms mandated by this Court\u2019s jurisprudence. Professor Ghislain Otis observes that s. 25 can be understood in light of a fundamental rule of internal coherence of constitutional texts directing that interpretation should be undertaken on the assumption that conflict does not exist: [translation] \u201c. . . when two principles or provisions seem to be in conflict, they must nevertheless be able to coexist and each produce an effect . . .\u201d ((2005), at p. 240). Moreover, at this stage of the analysis, consideration should be given to any alternative relief sought by the claimant, as different Charter remedies may be more or less intrusive on the relevant Aboriginal, treaty, or other right.\n[164] In sum, s. 25 does not serve as a \u201cshield\u201d whenever a right falling within its scope is at issue. Rather, when a Charter right is engaged by the exercise of an Aboriginal, treaty, or other right, courts must consider whether the two rights can be reconciled. If giving effect to a Charter right would only affect incidentally or in a non\u2011essential manner the s. 25 identified right \u2014 in the sense that it would not undermine Indigenous difference \u2014 or if the Charter right can be interpreted in a manner consistent with the Aboriginal, treaty, or other right, then it would be inappropriate to give priority to the right within the scope of s. 25. It is only when the s. 25 right is affected in a non-incidental manner, thereby creating an irreconcilable conflict between the two rights, that s. 25 will protect the Indigenous right by rendering the individual right ineffective to the extent of the conflict. In this sense, s. 25 will sometimes function as what author Arbour describes as a \u201cpop up shield\u201d (p. 13). At other times, it will have only an interpretive role.\n2. A Single Framework Applies to Internal and External Conflicts\n[165] Section 25 is directed at safeguarding Aboriginal, treaty, or other rights that aim to protect Indigenous difference. Accordingly, the focus of s. 25 is on collective rights, irrespective of the identity of the individual or entity bringing the Charter challenge. The result is that the same analytical framework applies whether or not the Charter claimant is Indigenous, whether s. 25 is being asserted by an Indigenous group, or, as in this case, both parties are Indigenous. The s. 25 shield finds immediate application if a claimed Charter right abrogates or derogates from a collective s. 25 right, regardless of the parties involved.\n[166] We reject creating a distinct analysis for so-called \u201cinternal\u201d claims within an Indigenous community for several reasons.\n[167] First, the concerns raised by multiple interveners about not holding Indigenous governments accountable for alleged violations of their constituents\u2019 Charter rights are addressed by the application of the Charter to governmental acts by Indigenous governments, as set out above (see, e.g., I.F., Pan-Canadian Forum on Indigenous Rights and the Constitution, at para. 22; I.F., Band Members Alliance and Advocacy Association of Canada, at paras. 26-27; I.F., Congress of Aboriginal Peoples, at para. 8). An Indigenous government must show, on the basis of an interpretive exercise, that the Charter right, whether claimed by an Indigenous or non-Indigenous person, is in irreconcilable conflict with a collective right recognized by s. 25. Once that has been demonstrated, the collective right will be protected from abrogation or derogation by the effect of s. 25.\n[168] Second, s. 25\u2019s protection of Indigenous difference seeks to shield a collective right. The inquiry into whether the claimed Charter right would diminish Indigenous difference is an inquiry into the protection of Indigenous difference as understood and established by the collective, rather than by individual Indigenous community members.\n[169] Third, there is no basis in the text of s. 25 for finding that the protective shield should apply differently based on the parties\u2019 identities. Author Kerry Wilkins notes that \u201c[n]othing in section 25 itself . . . suggests that it applies any differently to some aboriginal rights, or to some Charter rights, than it does to others\u201d (p. 110). Relatedly, in Kapp, Bastarache J. observed that an Indigenous claimant may challenge a law under the Charter without invoking their own Indigeneity, noting that individuals can have multiple identities that are not all always engaged in the same way (para. 99).\n[170] Fourth, it will not always be clear, in a practical sense, when a claim is \u201cinternal\u201d. There may, for example, be claims from individuals who consider themselves members of the collective, but whose membership is disputed by the Indigenous group, making any distinction between internal and external claims untenable. There may also be a challenge brought by an individual against a rule resulting from collaboration between an Indigenous government and a non-Indigenous governmental or private actor. In such cases, any distinction between internal and external claims is equally difficult to discern.\n[171] And finally, s. 25\u2019s protective purpose is not incompatible with the recognition \u2014 made plain in both the UNDRIP Act and the VGFN Constitution \u2014 that individual and collective Indigenous rights can coexist. Fundamentally, the protection of Indigenous difference in s. 25 reflects the central place of Indigenous peoples and their governments in Canada\u2019s constitutional fabric. Recognizing constitutional protection under s. 25 allows Indigenous peoples to make decisions about their communities\u2019 individual and collective needs.\n[172] While we do not endorse separate frameworks for internal and external claims, we recognize the need for great caution when the claim is brought by an Indigenous person against their own community. Such a case is distinct from cases like Corbiere, where the impugned provision was found in federal legislation, and Kapp, where the Charter claimant was not Indigenous. In a claim by an Indigenous person against their own community, courts should proceed cautiously to avoid unnecessarily or unwittingly imposing incompatible ideas or legal principles upon the distinctive Indigenous legal system. As the intervener the Carcross\/Tagish First Nation submits, \u201cCanadian institutions have been advised to tread lightly around the inherent rights that Indigenous peoples have to their own governance and justice systems\u201d (I.F., at para. 21, citing Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada: Calls to Action (2015), at call 42).\n3. Further Limitations\n[173] Even when s. 25 would otherwise prioritize an Aboriginal, treaty, or other right, there may be other relevant limitations on the application and effect of s. 25. Examples include s. 28 of the Charter and s. 35(4) of the Constitution Act, 1982. Section 28, embedded like s. 25 in the \u201cGeneral\u201d provisions of the Charter, directs that \u201c[n]otwithstanding anything in this Charter, the rights and freedoms referred to in it are guaranteed equally to male and female persons.\u201d Section 35(4) provides: \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the aboriginal and treaty rights referred to in subsection (1) are guaranteed equally to male and female persons.\u201d These provisions \u2014 which apply notwithstanding any other provision in the Charter or the Constitution Act, 1982, respectively \u2014 ensure that a right protected under s. 25 does not shelter gender-based discrimination (see, e.g., McNeil (1996), at pp. 76-79; Wildsmith, at pp. 23-24; Arbour, at p. 68; Slattery (1982), at pp. 241-42; Kapp, at para. 97, per Bastarache J.). This being said, precisely demarcating the limits of s. 25\u2019s protections, including those resulting from other constitutional sources, is best left to cases when they arise on the facts.\n(b) The Order of Analysis\n[174] A final question is at what stage of a Charter analysis s. 25 is properly considered. The VGFN submits that \u201cs. 25 is engaged at the outset\u201d before any consideration of the merits of the Charter claim (R.F., at para. 109). The Attorney General of Canada and the British Columbia Treaty Commission, following Bastarache J.\u2019s comments in Kapp, submit that s. 25 should be considered only after the court is satisfied that the Charter is prima facie engaged (I.F., A.G. Canada, at para. 41; I.F., British Columbia Treaty Commission, at para. 12; Kapp, at paras. 108-9). As Ms. Dickson argues that s. 25 should be incorporated as an interpretative aid in the s. 1 justification analysis, she would see s. 25 considered after a full examination of the relevant Charter right.\n[175] In light of the approach to s. 25 outlined above, many of the proposed views on ordering can be readily rejected. Because s. 25 does not serve as an impermeable shield, at least some understanding of the Charter right at issue will always be needed to determine whether s. 25 protection properly applies. As a result, the VGFN\u2019s position on ordering cannot be accepted. Moreover, since s. 25 prioritizes Aboriginal, treaty, or other rights when there is an irreconcilable conflict with the relevant Charter right, s. 25 is more than a mere interpretative aid in a s. 1 analysis. Thus, Ms. Dickson\u2019s view on ordering is also precluded.\n[176] The order of analysis must reflect s. 25\u2019s purpose of protecting Indigenous difference as a feature of the constitutional protection of minority rights. An unduly late application of s. 25 would be contrary to this purpose. When s. 25 is ultimately found to give priority to an Aboriginal, treaty, or other right, requiring a party to defend fully against a Charter claim and further justify any breach under s. 1 would be superfluous and serve as a needless drain on the parties\u2019 resources. Moreover, the intervener the Carcross\/Tagish First Nation argues that such an approach may cause Indigenous communities to prioritize aligning their laws with Charter values, potentially at the expense of their own legal orders, to avoid protracted litigation. Such an outcome would thwart, rather than advance, the underlying constitutional value of respect for minority rights, specifically, the protection of Indigenous difference.\n[177] When a party seeks to invoke s. 25 in the face of a Charter claim, courts should consider applying s. 25 at the earliest possible stage without unduly prejudicing the individual Charter challenge. Given the competing interests that must be reflected in the s. 25 framework, the earliest that s. 25 could be properly considered is once the Charter claimant has shown a prima facie breach of their Charter right. Any justification under s. 1 should be required only if the court finds s. 25 inapplicable. This is so when there is no \u201caboriginal, treaty or other righ[t]\u201d in play, the \u201cother righ[t]\u201d does not engage Indigenous difference, or there is no irreconcilable conflict between the protected collective Indigenous right and the individual Charter right. In those circumstances, the party defending the impugned action can still seek to justify the limitation under s. 1 of the Charter.\n(5) Summary of the Section 25 Framework\n[178] The analysis above suggests a four-step framework under s. 25.\n[179] First, the Charter claimant must show that the impugned conduct prima facie breaches an individual Charter right. If no prima facie case is made out, then the Charter claim fails and there is no need to proceed to s. 25.\n[180] Second, the party invoking s. 25 \u2014 typically the party relying on a collective minority interest \u2014 must satisfy the court that the impugned conduct is a right, or an exercise of a right, protected under s. 25. That party bears the burden of demonstrating that the right for which it claims s. 25 protection is an Aboriginal, treaty, or other right. If the right at issue is an \u201cother\u201d right, then the party defending against the Charter claim must demonstrate the existence of the asserted right and the fact that the right protects or recognizes Indigenous difference.\n[181] Third, the party invoking s. 25 must show irreconcilable conflict between the Charter right and the Aboriginal, treaty, or other right or its exercise. If the rights are irreconcilably in conflict, s. 25 will act as a shield to protect Indigenous difference.\n[182] Fourth, courts must consider whether there are any applicable limits to the collective interest relied on. When s. 25\u2019s protections apply, for instance, the collective right may yield to limits imposed by s. 28 of the Charter or s. 35(4) of the Constitution Act, 1982.\n[183] Finally, where s. 25 is found not to apply, the party defending against the Charter claim may show that the impugned action is justified under s. 1 of the Charter.\n(6) Application of Sections 15(1) and 25 to This Case\n[184] Applying the above analysis, we conclude that Ms. Dickson\u2019s s. 15(1) Charter right was prima facie breached by the residency requirement, which created a distinction based on non-resident status in a self-governing Indigenous community and reinforced and exacerbated her existing disadvantage as a non-resident member of the VGFN.\n[185] Second, the VGFN has established that the residency requirement in the VGFN Constitution is an exercise of an Aboriginal, treaty, or other right under s. 25. It is an exercise of an \u201cother right\u201d, namely, the right to set criteria for membership in its governing body \u2014 a right that protects Indigenous difference.\n[186] Third, the VGFN has established that, properly interpreted, Ms. Dickson\u2019s s. 15(1) right and its right within the scope of s. 25 are irreconcilably in conflict, such that giving effect to Ms. Dickson\u2019s equality right would abrogate or derogate from the s. 25 identified right. This engages s. 25 as a protective shield, insulating the collective right from the individual Charter claim.\n[187] Finally, we find that there are no other applicable limits to the application of s. 25 in this case.\n(a) Section 15(1) of the Charter Is Prima Facie Breached\n(i) What Constitutes a Prima Facie Section 15(1) Breach?\n[188] Under s. 15(1) of the Charter, \u201c[e]very individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.\u201d In a s. 15(1) Charter challenge, a claimant must demonstrate that the impugned law or state action: (a) on its face or in its impact, creates a distinction based on enumerated or analogous grounds; and (b) imposes a burden or denies a benefit in a manner that has the effect of reinforcing, perpetuating, or exacerbating disadvantage (R. v. Sharma, 2022 SCC 39, at para. 28, R. v. C.P., 2021 SCC 19, [2021] 1 S.C.R. 679, at paras. 56 and 141; Fraser v. Canada (Attorney General), 2020 SCC 28, [2020] 3 S.C.R. 113, at para. 27; Taypotat (SCC), at paras. 19\u201120). When s. 25 is invoked, the Charter claimant must demonstrate a prima facie s. 15(1) breach before a court will consider whether s. 25 applies.\n[189] The VGFN and some interveners advocated against undertaking a complete s. 15(1) analysis before considering s. 25. The argument is that making out a distinction based on enumerated or analogous grounds furnishes courts with sufficient information to assess the extent of a potential conflict between the Charter right and the relevant Aboriginal, treaty, or other right, while still presenting a low threshold for considering the impact of s. 25. Full consideration of the s. 15(1) claim would thus be logically unnecessary and would also place needless strain on Indigenous communities\u2019 litigation resources \u2014 as well as the resources of courts and Charter claimants \u2014 and subject Indigenous legal orders to unnecessary scrutiny against non-Indigenous standards (see R.F., at paras. 125-26; I.F., A.G. Canada, at para. 41; I.F., Carcross\/Tagish First Nation, at para. 30; see also Wilkins, at pp. 115-17).\n[190] In our view, however, limiting the debate to the first branch of the s. 15(1) test does not provide courts with sufficient information to interpret the Charter right before determining whether it abrogates or derogates from the right within the scope of s. 25. Enumerated or analogous grounds may be \u201cconstant markers of suspect decision making or potential discrimination\u201d (Corbiere, at para. 8), but they do not provide information about the particular claim at issue. As this Court noted in Corbiere, \u201cdistinctions made on analogous grounds may well not be discriminatory\u201d (para. 8). Whether or not the ground is used in a discriminatory manner is fact-specific and is answered by the second stage of the s. 15(1) analysis. To understand the distinction\u2019s effect on the claimant, the court needs to know whether the distinction reinforced, perpetuated, or exacerbated the claimant\u2019s existing disadvantage.\n(ii) Ms. Dickson Has Demonstrated a Prima Facie Section 15(1) Breach\n1. Aboriginality-Residence Is Insufficient as an Analogous Ground\n[191] With respect to the first step of the s. 15(1) test, Ms. Dickson argues that the residency requirement creates a distinction on the basis of the analogous ground of \u201cAboriginality-residence\u201d, relying on this Court\u2019s decision in Corbiere. The VGFN distinguishes Corbiere on the basis that the case was decided in relation to off-reserve band membership under the Indian Act. It submits that any distinction drawn by the residency requirement here is not based on an analogous ground.\n[192] We agree that Corbiere is not fully dispositive of the question. Corbiere dealt with a s. 15(1) claim based on a residency requirement under the Indian Act that required band members to reside on reserve to vote in band elections. Contrary to the provision at issue in Corbiere, the residency requirement in this case is part of the constitution of a self-governing First Nation. As the VGFN observes, the residency requirement \u201cis not imposed by the Crown, but by VGFN Citizens freely and democratically exercising their inherent right to self-government\u201d (R.F., at para. 143). Since Aboriginality-residence, as set out in Corbiere, does not take this into account, we will not rely on it as an analogous ground in this case.\n2. Non-Resident Status in a Self-Governing Indigenous Community Is an Analogous Ground\n[193] The governing principles for identifying analogous grounds relied on by the majority in Corbiere remain useful here. Enumerated and analogous grounds serve to screen out those claims \u201chaving nothing to do with substantive equality and hel[p] keep the focus on equality for groups that are disadvantaged in the larger social and economic context\u201d (L. Smith and W. Black, \u201cThe Equality Rights\u201d (2013), 62 S.C.L.R. (2d) 301, at p. 336; see also Taypotat (SCC), at para. 19). The common ground shared by enumerated and analogous grounds in s. 15(1) is the \u201cimmutability\u201d of personal characteristics, including those that are \u201cconstructively immutable\u201d, like religion or citizenship. Such grounds are \u201cchangeable only at unacceptable cost to personal identity\u201d such that \u201cthe government has no legitimate interest in expecting us to change [them in order] to receive equal treatment under the law\u201d (Corbiere, at para. 13). In Corbiere, McLachlin and Bastarache JJ. recognized an Aboriginal person\u2019s off-reserve residence as an analogous ground because this characteristic is constructively immutable. It is essential to a band member\u2019s personal identity and changeable only at great personal cost.\n[194] Ms. Dickson submits that \u201cIndigenous persons living in urban areas or otherwise away from their communities are historically disadvantaged as a result of Canada\u2019s colonial policies of assimilation and displacement, directed at all Indigenous peoples and maintained for generations\u201d (R.F. on cross-appeal, at para. 52). She submits that \u201cthe historical disadvantages, prejudices and socio-economic conditions experienced by Indigenous persons living away from their communities [were not] automatically extinguish[ed] when their nations entered self-government agreements\u201d (para. 45). Ms. Dickson argues that to exclude the non-resident VGFN members from s. 15(1) protection on the basis that they are no longer subject to the Indian Act would \u201cfail to recognize the long-lasting harm of Canada\u2019s policies\u201d (para. 52).\n[195] The VGFN, on the other hand, submits that its residency requirement is not based on any enumerated or analogous grounds (R.F., at para. 51). The VGFN submits, correctly on this point, that new analogous grounds are not lightly identified (para. 145, citing Fraser, at paras. 114-23). It points to the direction given in Corbiere that the exercise of defining an analogous ground involves identifying \u201ca type of decision making that is suspect because it often leads to discrimination and denial of substantive equality\u201d (para. 146, citing Corbiere, at para. 8). The VGFN submits that the distinction at play in the residency requirement is not inherently suspect as it \u201cdoes not subject a group subject to historic disadvantage to differential treatment, or bear the kind of stigma reflected in Corbiere\u201d (para. 147).\n[196] We disagree with the VGFN\u2019s position. While Corbiere is not directly applicable in the case of an impugned provision enacted by a self-governing First Nation, this Court\u2019s discussion of disadvantage faced by non-resident Indigenous people was not constrained to the context of Indian Act provisions and provides helpful guidance. Justice L\u2019Heureux\u2011Dub\u00e9\u2019s discussion of Aboriginality-residence, adopted by the majority, outlines the difficulties faced by Indigenous people living away from their communities. She emphasized that, for off-reserve band members, the choice of whether to live on- or off-reserve \u201cis an important one to their identity and personhood\u201d, in terms of relating to a community and to land that have \u201cparticular social and cultural significance to many or most band members\u201d (Corbiere, at para. 62). Justice L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9 further observed that \u201cband members living off-reserve have generally experienced disadvantage, stereotyping, and prejudice, and form part of a \u2018discrete and insular minority\u2019 defined by race and place of residence\u201d (para. 62).\n[197] Intervening on behalf of Indigenous people living away from their traditional lands, the Congress of Aboriginal Peoples submits that discrimination faced by off-reserve or remote members is a direct legacy of \u201ccolonial and assimilationist policies and practices\u201d, including the residential school system and the unequal rights afforded to individuals on- and off-reserve under the Indian Act (I.F., at para. 9; see also para. 10). This history has resulted in \u201ca large number of off-reserve status Indians who are nominally members of First Nations hav[ing] little or no connection to the reserves or to \u2018home\u2019 communities\u201d (para. 12). Yet these individuals remain \u201csubject to the decisions of First Nations governments that control access to benefits, opportunities, and services for them, but do not always prioritize their interests\u201d (para. 12).\n[198] We conclude that recasting Ms. Dickson\u2019s potential analogous ground from \u201cAboriginality-residence\u201d to \u201cnon-resident status in a self-governing Indigenous community\u201d qualifies as an analogous ground under Corbiere. The historical and continuing disadvantage faced by Indigenous people living away from their traditional lands means that distinctions based on \u201cnon-resident status in a self-governing Indigenous community\u201d will serve as \u201cconstant markers of suspect decision making or potential discrimination\u201d (Corbiere, at para. 8).\n3. The Residency Requirement Reinforces, Perpetuates, or Exacerbates Disadvantage\n[199] At the second stage of the s. 15(1) analysis, the inquiry is whether the distinction drawn on enumerated or analogous grounds reinforces, perpetuates, or exacerbates disadvantage (Taypotat (SCC), at paras. 19\u201120). Does the residency requirement, which draws a distinction on the basis of non-resident status in a self-governing First Nation, reinforce, perpetuate, or exacerbate Ms. Dickson\u2019s disadvantage as a non-resident VGFN citizen?\n[200] Ms. Dickson argues that it does. A central theme in her submissions is that the residency requirement reinforces a stereotype \u201cthat non-resident citizens are less knowledgeable of, and less interested in preserving, their nation\u2019s Indigenous culture\u201d (A.F., at para. 14). The VGFN counters that \u201cthe [r]esidency [r]equirement does not contribute to pre-existing disadvantage experienced by [Ms. Dickson] as part of a group, and does not impose marginalization, stigma and stereotyping, which are the target harms addressed by s. 15\u201d (R.F., at para. 153). Acknowledging that Indigenous people, including Ms. Dickson, have been and remain subject to discrimination in Canadian society, the VGFN submits that there is no evidence of historical disadvantage experienced by VGFN citizens who live away from the traditional territory (paras. 154-55). The VGFN points to the finding by the trial judge that VGFN citizens who reside in urban settings like Whitehorse have access to more opportunities and resources (para. 155; trial reasons, at paras. 151 and 156).\n[201] We cannot accept the VGFN\u2019s submissions on this point. As the Court of Appeal noted, the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that Ms. Dickson had been advantaged by living in Whitehorse stands contrary to Corbiere, and the evidence in that case, detailed above, remains applicable to non-resident citizens of Indigenous communities. The Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples observed perceptions of incompatibility between Indigenous cultures and urban life, leading to the \u201cassumption that Aboriginal people living in urban areas must deny their culture and heritage in order to succeed \u2014 that they must assimilate into this other world. The corollary is that once Aboriginal people migrate to urban areas, their identity as Aboriginal people becomes irrelevant\u201d (RCAP Final Report, vol. 4, Perspectives and Realities (1996), at p. 519). Similarly, the 2019 report issued by the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls found that, because of past government conduct, Indigenous women in urban areas have found themselves \u201calienated from their home communities, sometimes as single parents and sole providers for their children\u201d and are \u201coften hundreds of kilometres from their homes and social support systems, navigating racist barriers deeply embedded in urban services and experiences\u201d (Reclaiming Power and Place: The Final Report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, vol. 1a (2019), at p. 273).\n[202] It is helpful to recall Abella J.\u2019s explanation in Taypotat of the relevance of discriminatory disadvantage rooted in arbitrariness for the second branch of s. 15(1). A court should consider \u201cwhether the impugned law fails to respond to the actual capacities and needs of the members of the group and instead imposes burdens or denies a benefit in a manner that has the effect of reinforcing, perpetuating or exacerbating their disadvantage\u201d (para. 20).\n[203] Here, Ms. Dickson is being denied, or at least significantly deterred from, the exercise of a fundamental democratic right \u2014 the right to run for Council \u2014 because of her non-resident status. This distinction on the basis of the analogous ground of non-resident status in a self-governing Indigenous community reinforces, perpetuates, and exacerbates her disadvantage as a non-resident. Not allowing her to participate in the electoral politics of her community further distances her from that community, making it difficult \u201cto preserve her identity as a VGFN citizen\u201d (R.F. on cross-appeal, at para. 65). We conclude that Ms. Dickson has made out both branches of a prima facie s. 15(1) breach.\n(b) The Residency Requirement Falls Within the Scope of Section 25 as an \u201cOther\u201d Right\n[204] The adoption of the residency requirement is an exercise of an \u201cother\u201d right under s. 25. The VGFN has a right to restrict the membership and composition of its governing bodies. The VGFN\u2019s exercise of this right through the residency requirement protects interests associated with Indigenous difference. Whether or not the residency requirement might also be understood as an exercise of an inherent right to self-government, we conclude that it is an \u201cother\u201d right protected under s. 25.\n[205] The trial judge found that the VGFN\u2019s right to adopt the residency requirement is an \u201cother\u201d right that pertains to the Aboriginal peoples of Canada (para. 212). He stated that even if such rights had to be of a \u201cconstitutional character\u201d, this criterion would be met since the residency requirement \u201cis not simply a law passed by Chief and Council\u201d, but is rather \u201cthe will of the First Nation expressed at its General Assembly as part of its Constitution . . . based upon hundreds of years of leadership by those who reside on the land, understand the essence of being Vuntut Gwitchin and that the custom or tradition exists today\u201d (para. 207).\n[206] The Court of Appeal agreed that the residency requirement is protected under s. 25, explaining that the Vuntut Gwitchin have always emphasized \u201c[their] leaders\u2019 connection to the land, their expectation of ongoing personal interaction between leaders and others, and their wish to resist the \u2018pull\u2019 of outside influences\u201d (para. 147). The court concluded that the residency requirement reflected the exercise, in modern guise, of an ancient right pertaining to Aboriginal peoples.\n[207] The VGFN argues that the residency requirement is an exercise of its inherent right to self-government. It asserts that this right to self-government, which includes its selection of leaders, is an Aboriginal or \u201cother\u201d right within the meaning of s. 25 (R.F., at para. 114). Alternatively, the VGFN submits that its right to adopt the residency requirement is also a right that exists under a land claim agreement, as the parties to the Final Agreement \u201cintended to recognize VGFN\u2019s collective, exclusive right to be self-governing over [its] own lands and internal affairs under [its] own Constitution and laws\u201d (para. 117).\n[208] By contrast, Ms. Dickson argues that the residency requirement is not an exercise of an Aboriginal, treaty, or other right. She says that it is expressly not a treaty right, nor is it an Aboriginal right proven under the Van der Peet test. Ms. Dickson also submits that the right at issue is not an \u201cother\u201d right, because it does not have constitutional status, it does not pertain to a historical practice of the VGFN, and it is not a collective right since it creates intra-group distinctions between VGFN citizens.\n[209] For a party seeking s. 25 protection to show that a collective Indigenous right, or its exercise, constitutes an \u201cother\u201d right or freedom, it must demonstrate the existence of the right and also show that the right, or its exercise, protects interests associated with Indigenous difference. In our view, both requirements are met here:\n(i) The VGFN has a statutory right to provide for the membership and composition of its governing bodies.\n(ii) There is no dispute that the VGFN has the right to enact a constitution providing for the membership and composition of its governing bodies. As we have seen, the Final Agreement, a s. 35 treaty, provides that negotiations regarding First Nation constitutions may include the composition, structure, and powers of the Yukon First Nation government institutions, as well as membership and election procedures (s. 24.5.1 generally, and see especially ss. 24.5.1.1, 24.5.1.2 and 24.5.1.3). The Self-Government Agreement and the federal Yukon First Nations Self-Government Act include similar language requiring First Nations like the VGFN to address such matters in their constitution (see Self-Government Agreement, s. 10.1.2, and the Yukon First Nations Self-Government Act, s. 8(1)(b), respectively). The Self-Government Agreement stipulates that the \u201cVuntut Gwitchin First Nation Constitution shall establish governing bodies and provide for their powers, duties, composition, membership and procedures\u201d (s. 10.1). Finally, s. 8(1)(b) of the federal Yukon First Nations Self-Government Act directs that the constitution of a First Nation, consistent with its self-government agreement, shall provide for \u201cthe governing bodies of the first nation and their composition, membership, powers, duties and procedures\u201d. Such a right necessarily includes the right to set criteria for membership. It would be impossible to provide for a governing body\u2019s membership without setting out the parameters of such membership. The VGFN therefore has a right to restrict the membership of its governing body. As a result, we turn to the question of whether this right, or its exercise, protects or recognizes Indigenous difference.\n(c) The Residency Requirement Protects and Recognizes Interests Associated With Indigenous Difference\n[210] As the Court of Appeal observed, the right to impose residency-based restrictions on the membership of its governing bodies enables Vuntut Gwitchin society to preserve the distinctive emphasis it places on \u201cits leaders\u2019 connection to the land\u201d (para. 147). This is plainly a foundation for the connection between Indigenous difference and the residency requirement in the VGFN Constitution.\n[211] At first instance, the trial judge made key factual findings about the historical and cultural context of residency. He noted that the historical evidence showed that \u201cthe Vuntut Gwitchin show a preference for leaders who demonstrate a knowledge of the land and traditions, commitment to community service, effective communication skills and wealth\u201d, and that \u201cthe consistent leadership theme narrated by the Elders is being accountable to the Vuntut citizens on a daily basis in Old Crow and at the annual General Assembly\u201d (para. 7).\n[212] The trial judge summarized his factual findings with respect to VGFN leadership and residency (at para. 44), including:\n1. The Vuntut Gwitchin people have governed themselves according to their traditional practices pre-dating the creation of Canada in 1867.\n2. Since time immemorial to the present day, all VGFN Chiefs and Councillors have been residents in the VGFN Traditional Territory.\n3. Even in modern times, post the Final Agreement in 1993, the practice is for elected citizens to reside in Old Crow. Chief Tizya-Tramm, former Chiefs Bruce Charlie and Robert Bruce Jr. all resided in Whitehorse at various times but all returned to reside in Old Crow during their terms as Chiefs.\n[213] The Court of Appeal also emphasized the significance of the connection between VGFN leadership and VGFN land, noting the evidence of a former VGFN Chief that \u201cthe very identity of the Vuntut Gwitchin has always been deeply rooted in the land itself\u201d and that \u201cVuntut Gwitchin practices, customs and traditions related to leadership and governance are also rooted in the land itself\u201d (para. 27 (emphasis deleted); A.R., vol. VI, at pp. 136-37). In the Chief\u2019s view, the VGFN\u2019s \u201cdecision\u2011making processes are based on reaching consensus and having a Council who does not reside in our community would be wholly incompatible with our traditional governance\u201d (C.A. reasons, at para. 28 (emphasis deleted), quoting A.R., vol. VI, at pp. 139-40).\n[214] Before this Court, the VGFN relies on the findings of the courts below regarding the importance of residency to its self-government and identity as a representative body for the Vuntut Gwitchin. The VGFN argues that, by adopting the residency requirement, it \u201cseeks to protect and promote VGFN\u2019s spiritual and economic relationship to the Traditional Territory; the Vuntut Gwitchin way of life including democratic deliberation and consensus-based decision-making among Citizens; and the general welfare of the collective\u201d (R.F., at para. 116). The VGFN argues that the residency requirement \u201cis a provision that seeks to preserve and enhance \u2018Indigenous difference\u2019 through the continuation of an inherent Indigenous legal order that survived colonization and for which VGFN has secured space in the fabric of the Canadian legal system\u201d (para. 121).\n[215] Ms. Dickson submits that the residency requirement does not protect Indigenous difference. Relying on affidavit evidence from VGFN citizens, she claims that the residency requirement disconnects citizens living away from the community, \u201cmaking it hard for them to preserve their culture and identity\u201d (A.F., at para. 83). Because the requirement effectively excludes non-resident citizens from Council, she argues that it does not preserve or protect Indigenous difference, \u201cbut undermines it, treating [them] as . . . \u2018less valuable\u2019 member[s] of VGFN\u201d (para. 90). Ms. Dickson also marshals arguments against the idea that the residency requirement is based on traditional VGFN identity. She submits that the requirement is a modern adoption of a democratic system of governance, \u201ca recent addition . . . enacted in 2006\u201d (para. 82; see also para. 84).\n[216] The inquiry at this stage is whether the residency requirement protects Indigenous difference, such that it should be protected from abrogation or derogation by Ms. Dickson\u2019s s. 15(1) Charter right. We have considered Ms. Dickson\u2019s arguments that the residency requirement works to erode Indigenous difference by making non-resident citizens feel like \u201cless valuable\u201d members of the community and distancing them from the community\u2019s governance structure, on the one hand, and that the requirement is not based on traditional practices, on the other. However, we cannot accept Ms. Dickson\u2019s arguments that there is no evidence that the residency of the Councillors is \u201cdemonstrative of their knowledge of the land, or their interest in the land\u201d or that the requirement is based on modern ideas of democracy (para. 83).\n[217] In light of the evidence and the factual findings at trial, we are satisfied that the residency requirement is an exercise of a right that protects interests associated with Indigenous difference. Requiring VGFN leaders to reside on settlement land helps preserve the leaders\u2019 connection to the land, which is deeply rooted in the VGFN\u2019s distinctive culture and governance practices. The residency requirement promotes the VGFN\u2019s expectation that its leaders will be able to maintain ongoing personal interactions between leaders and other community members. It also bolsters the VGFN\u2019s ability to resist the outside forces that pull citizens away from its settlement land and prevents erosion of its important connection with the land. Such interests are associated with various aspects of Indigenous difference, including Vuntut Gwitchin cultural difference and prior sovereignty, as well as their participation in the treaty process that culminated in the enactment of the VGFN Constitution.\n[218] Finally, we agree with both courts below that the residency requirement is of a \u201cconstitutional character\u201d in a substantive, rather than formal, sense (trial reasons, at para. 207; C.A. reasons, at para. 147). The question of whether a \u201cconstitutional character\u201d will always be required for s. 25 protection need not be decided: here it is clear that the residency requirement has a significant constitutional dimension. Beyond the mere fact that the residency requirement is part of the VGFN Constitution, it is an aspect of the First Nation\u2019s law that preserves and enshrines an important dimension of VGFN leadership traditions and practices, and VGFN leaders\u2019 connection to the land. We particularly note the Court of Appeal\u2019s conclusion that the residency requirement \u201cis clearly intended to reflect and promote the VGFN\u2019s particular traditions and customs relating to governance and leadership \u2014 a matter of fundamental importance to a small first nation in a vast and remote location\u201d (para. 147). On any reasonable understanding of what it means for a right or its exercise to have a \u201cconstitutional character\u201d, the residency requirement meets this standard.\n(d) The VGFN Has Established That the Conflict Between the Two Rights Is Irreconcilable\n[219] The Court must further determine whether the VGFN has established that the conflict between the two rights is irreconcilable, such that the s. 25 right would be protected from the abrogation or derogation that would flow from giving effect to Ms. Dickson\u2019s s. 15(1) right. We conclude that the VGFN has demonstrated that the conflict between the two rights is irreconcilable and that, as a result, s. 25 can be invoked to protect the VGFN residency requirement.\n[220] The conflict is plain when the two rights are first properly interpreted, then compared to one another, as required by the s. 25 framework.\n[221] With respect to the content of Ms. Dickson\u2019s s. 15(1) right, she has made out a prima facie case as a result of the distinction drawn on the basis of the analogous ground of non-resident status in a self-governing Indigenous community. She is unable to hold a position on the VGFN Council because she lives away from the settlement land. This distinction on the basis of her non-resident status reinforces and exacerbates the historical and continuing disadvantage faced by Indigenous people living away from their traditional lands.\n[222] Turning to the content of the \u201cother\u201d right: at its core, the residency requirement protects and recognizes Indigenous difference by preserving the connection between the members of VGFN leadership and VGFN lands. The other ways the residency requirement protects these interests, such as promoting the VGFN\u2019s ability to resist the pull of outside influences, are bound up in this connection.\n[223] Ms. Dickson argues that the VGFN could have adopted measures that would \u201cgiv[e] effect to both the individual democratic rights at stake, and VGFN\u2019s collective rights to govern and set eligibility criteria for their elected leaders\u201d (A.F., at para. 13). For example, at the 2019 General Assembly, Ms. Dickson proposed that a single Councillor be selected from the VGFN citizens living in Whitehorse (para. 119). Ms. Dickson presents this alternative in the context of her argument on minimal impairment under s. 1 of the Charter. However, her suggestion that this alternative would give effect to both her individual Charter right and the VGFN\u2019s right warrants consideration under s. 25, as it is essentially an argument that the two rights are, in fact, reconcilable.\n[224] The VGFN points to the Court of Appeal\u2019s holding that \u201cto apply s. 15(1) would indeed derogate from the Vuntut Gwitchin\u2019s rights to govern themselves in accordance with their own particular values and traditions and in accordance with the \u2018self-government\u2019 arrangements entered into in 1993 with Canada and Yukon\u201d (R.F., at para. 122, quoting C.A. reasons, at para. 149 (emphasis in original)).\n[225] We agree with the Court of Appeal. Permitting one Councillor to reside in Whitehorse would undermine, in a non-incidental way, the VGFN\u2019s right to decide on the membership of its governing bodies. As set out above, the Indigenous difference protected by the residency requirement is inextricably tied to leaders\u2019 connection to the settlement land. The Court of Appeal cited evidence from the Executive Director of the VGFN that Ms. Dickson\u2019s initial proposal to eliminate the residency requirement was not supported because it conflicted \u201cwith the widely held view that Vuntut Gwitchin self\u2011government and the protection of our culture is critically linked to the seat of our government being in Old Crow\u201d (para. 30 (emphasis deleted); A.R., vol. VIII, at p. 158). In our view, for this Court to allow one of the four Councillors to reside in Whitehorse would unacceptably diminish this connection.\n[226] As a result, we cannot accept that the effects of such a change to the composition of the VGFN Council on the interests that the residency requirement advances would be merely incidental. To borrow the words of Professor Macklem, giving effect to Ms. Dickson\u2019s Charter right in such a manner would pose \u201ca real risk to the continued vitality of [I]ndigenous difference\u201d (p. 232). Giving effect to Ms. Dickson\u2019s s. 15(1) right would abrogate or derogate from an \u201cother\u201d right that belongs to the VGFN. The two rights are, therefore, irreconcilably in conflict.\n(e) No Other Limits Apply\n[227] While s. 25 protections may be subject to other limits, including those imposed in relation to s. 28 of the Charter and s. 35(4) of the Constitution Act, 1982, no such restrictions are relevant here. The Court of Appeal found that s. 25\u2019s protections extended to the entire residency requirement, including the 14-day relocation rule. Before this Court, Ms. Dickson has not sought Charter relief regarding the 14-day relocation rule (A.R., vol. I, at pp. 209-10) or made arguments on severance. Given the burdens resting on Charter claimants under s. 25, we would not limit s. 25\u2019s protection in relation to that rule. Finally, because s. 25 applies to the residency requirement, the VGFN need not justify the residency requirement under s. 1 of the Charter.\n[228] We conclude that s. 25 operates as a shield to protect the residency requirement from Ms. Dickson\u2019s s. 15(1) claim.\nVII. Conclusion and Disposition\n[229] We propose to answer the constitutional questions of the appellant, Ms. Dickson, and the cross-appellant, the VGFN, as follows:\n1. Does the Charter apply to the residency requirement contained in Article XI(2) of the Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation Constitution?\nYes.\n2. If so,\n(a) Does the residency requirement infringe s. 15(1) of the Charter, and if so, is such infringement a reasonable limit prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society under s. 1 of the Charter?\nYes, in part. The residency requirement infringes, prima facie, s. 15(1) of the Charter. It is not necessary to determine whether such infringement is a reasonable limit under s. 1 of the Charter.\n(b) Is the residency requirement an exercise of an Aboriginal, treaty or other right or freedom that pertains to the Aboriginal peoples of Canada pursuant to s. 25 of the Charter, and if so, does the Charter\u2019s guarantee of rights under s. 15(1) abrogate or derogate from such Aboriginal, treaty or other right or freedom?\nYes. The residency requirement is an exercise of an \u201cother right or freedom\u201d that pertains to the Aboriginal peoples of Canada under s. 25 of the Charter, and the s. 15(1) claim abrogates or derogates from this right, such that the s. 15(1) claim cannot be given effect.\n[230] As for Ms. Dickson\u2019s equality claim under Article IV of the VGFN Constitution, which was pleaded in the alternative before the Supreme Court of Yukon, we take due note of Newbury J.A.\u2019s observation in the Court of Appeal reasons that, having pursued her claim under the Charter, Ms. Dickson may elect hereafter to pursue a similar claim under the VGFN Constitution (par. 157). Since the application of Article IV was not addressed in this Court, we refrain from further comment on this issue.\n[231] In the result, we would dismiss Ms. Dickson\u2019s appeal. We would also dismiss the VGFN\u2019s cross-appeal in light of our conclusion that the Charter applies. We would confirm the order of the majority of the Court of Appeal to set aside the judgment of the Supreme Court and to dismiss Ms. Dickson\u2019s petition. We would make no order as to costs.\nThe following are the reasons delivered by\nMartin and O\u2019Bonsawin JJ. \u2014\nI. Overview\n[232] Cindy Dickson is a citizen of the Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation (\u201cVGFN\u201d) who wishes to step forward as a candidate for election as a councillor. Standing in the way of her serving her community in this manner is a provision of the VGFN Constitution, enacted by the VGFN under its self-government powers, that requires councillors to either already live on the VGFN settlement land or move there within 14 days of their election (Article XI(2) (\u201cresidency requirement\u201d)). The residency requirement excludes and precludes hundreds of VGFN citizens who do not live on the settlement land \u2014 but retain their identity and cultural ties to their community \u2014 from a core aspect of democratic participation in the VGFN. This is so despite the history of colonialism and resulting socio-economic imperatives that have pulled many VGFN citizens away from their traditional lands.\n[233] Ms. Dickson, as one such citizen, currently lives in Whitehorse, Yukon and has for many years. She left the VGFN settlement land at the age of 16 to complete her high school education and to pursue post-secondary education and employment opportunities. Presently, she cannot take up residence on the settlement land for several reasons including that the limited medical resources available to her there would not meet the special health care needs of her child. Her uncontradicted evidence is that she cannot move to meet the prescribed residency requirement because she cannot leave behind the therapeutic and support services her child requires. She challenges this residency requirement under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms on the basis that preventing non-residents from holding a meaningful role in community governance unjustifiably discriminates against those group members who do not live on traditional lands.\n[234] This claim raises numerous issues of fundamental importance concerning the extent to which the Charter protects the rights and freedoms of Indigenous people in respect of actions taken by Indigenous governments. In our view, the Charter applies to governmental action taken by self-governing Indigenous nations because they are both governmental in nature and because the purpose of s. 32(1) was to extend the Charter\u2019s protections to address the power imbalance between the governed and those who govern in Canada. As the contours of Indigenous self-government evolve, it is essential that no Charter-free zones in Canada be created, that everyone be equally protected by its constitutionally entrenched guarantees, and that all forms of government be constrained by its limits.\n[235] The inclusion of s. 25 in the Charter, which stipulates that individual Charter rights \u201cshall not be construed so as to abrogate or derogate from any aboriginal, treaty or other rights or freedoms that pertain to the aboriginal peoples of Canada\u201d, was motivated by a specific concern about Indigenous difference and the distinct rights Indigenous peoples possess as \u201caboriginal peoples of Canada\u201d. Section 25 is a unique provision with a particular purpose, operating as an important interpretive aid to help protect these special collective rights held by Indigenous peoples from abrogation or derogation. Section 25 primarily protects against non-Indigenous people making claims that would have the effect of taking away from Indigenous peoples what is rightly theirs precisely because they are Indigenous peoples.\n[236] We do not accept the broader proposition that s. 25 shields the actions of a self-governing Indigenous nation from Charter claims brought by members of that community. To interpret s. 25 in such a non-purposive manner would lead to the far-reaching result of creating and affirming Charter-free zones, with the consequence that minorities within Indigenous communities would not be protected from the actions of their own governments. All Canadians, including Indigenous people, need constitutional tools to hold their governments accountable for breaches of their entrenched rights and freedoms. It is against the purposes of the Charter and s. 25, as well as being profoundly inequitable, to deny members of self-governing Indigenous nations similar rights, remedies and recourse.\n[237] We therefore apply the Charter, and the claimed s. 15(1) equality right, to the impugned residency requirement. We conclude that Ms. Dickson\u2019s s. 15(1) Charter claim must succeed. The residency requirement draws a discriminatory distinction between VGFN citizens that live on the settlement land and those that do not. The analogous ground of \u201cAboriginality-residence\u201d applies in this context. We are not satisfied that the residency requirement falls within the ambit of s. 25 as the requirement is directed at the internal regulation of the VGFN and is not aimed at recognizing the special status of Indigenous collectives within the broader Canadian state. Even under a contextual and culturally sensitive approach to applying s. 1 of the Charter in this case, one grounded in and respectful of Indigenous difference, the residency requirement is not minimally impairing and therefore not demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.\n[238] We would allow the appeal and dismiss the cross-appeal for the reasons that follow.\nII. Section 32(1) of the Charter\n[239] Modern governments are constrained by an array of limitations. Respecting these limitations, including individual rights protections and group-based guarantees, is a cornerstone of responsible and accountable governance. The introduction of constitutionally entrenched rights in the Charter was a turning point in the relationship between the governed and those who govern.\n[240] Several orders of government in Canada possess the authority to impinge on individual freedoms, including the federal government, provincial and territorial governments, and Indigenous governments (Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, (\u201cRoyal Commission\u201d), Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, vol. 2, Restructuring the Relationship (1996), at pp. 240\u201141). Especially since the adoption of the Constitution Act, 1982, governments and courts have begun to properly recognize Indigenous communities as law-makers and rights-bearers. An example of this recognition is the Umbrella Final Agreement, concluded in 1993 between representatives of Yukon First Nations, the federal government and the Yukon government, which established a framework for Indigenous self-government in the territory. Self-government agreements followed, including the agreement pertaining to the VGFN at the centre of this case. The VGFN Self-Government Agreement (1993) recognizes extensive lawmaking powers over such matters as the VGFN\u2019s internal affairs, the provision of certain programs and services, and matters of a local or private nature (ss. 13.1, 13.2 and 13.3; see also R.F., at para. 20). The VGFN enacts coercive laws that bind individuals like any other order of government.\n[241] In our view, a purposive reading of s. 32(1) of the Charter ensures that the VGFN, as a self-governing Indigenous community, is obliged to respect the Charter rights of its citizens. We agree with Kasirer and Jamal JJ. that the VGFN\u2019s enactment of the residency requirement is subject to the Charter and that the VGFN is \u201c\u2018government\u2019 by nature\u201d. However, we reach this conclusion through a different set of considerations.\n[242] We first explain how s. 32(1) is directed at the relationship between the governed and those who govern. Its purpose is to subject governmental action to constitutional review in order to protect individual rights and freedoms.\n[243] Second, we outline how existing s. 32(1) jurisprudence, which deals with other types of entities, is not directly applicable to the unique historical and legal position of Indigenous governments. In our view, the VGFN is not a creature of statute, does not derive its lawmaking authority through delegation, and does not need to ground its governmental status by reference to what has been transferred, bestowed, or granted from another level of government.\n[244] Third, we outline how s. 32(1) captures governmental action in respect of \u201cmatters within the authority\u201d of Parliament and the provincial legislatures and therefore the Charter applies to Indigenous governments because they have lawmaking authority over legislative matters caught by s. 32(1). This is so regardless of whether Indigenous self-government is affirmed or recognized by a statute, is based on a treaty term, or is grounded in an inherent Aboriginal right to self-government. The central s. 32(1) inquiry concerns whether the entity engages in governmental action that may touch on those matters and may impinge on the rights of the governed. It is not necessary for the impugned action to stem from authority granted by federal, provincial, or territorial legislation for it to be subject to Charter scrutiny. The recognition of self-governing Indigenous nations as governments in their own right falls clearly within the purpose and ambit of s. 32(1).\n[245] Finally, we conclude that the VGFN is a government by its very nature because it exercises legislative and executive powers pertaining to \u201cmatters within the authority\u201d of Parliament and the provincial legislatures, which significantly touch upon individual rights and freedoms protected by the Charter. As a result, all of the VGFN\u2019s activities, including its enactment of the residency requirement, are subject to Charter scrutiny. This approach reflects the purpose of s. 32(1), aligns with long\u2011standing Indigenous self-governance practices, and advances reconciliation in Canada.\nA. The Charter Is Directed at the Relationship Between the Governed and Those Who Govern\n(1) Determining the Scope of Section 32(1)\n[246] Section 32(1) addresses \u201cwho is subject to the burden of Charter rights, or, in other words, who is bound by the Charter\u201d (P. W. Hogg and W. K. Wright, Constitutional Law of Canada (5th ed. Supp.), at \u00a7 37:6 (emphasis in original)). It provides as follows:\n32 (1) This Charter applies\n(a) to the Parliament and government of Canada in respect of all matters within the authority of Parliament including all matters relating to the Yukon Territory and Northwest Territories; and\n(b) to the legislature and government of each province in respect of all matters within the authority of the legislature of each province.\n[247] On its face, the text of s. 32(1) provides that the Charter applies to \u201cthe Parliament and government of Canada\u201d, and to \u201cthe legislature and government of each province\u201d, in respect of all matters within the legislative authority of each level of government. Importantly, this Court\u2019s s. 32(1) jurisprudence has consistently affirmed the broad range of entities captured by the provision. As early as in RWDSU v. Dolphin Delivery Ltd., [1986] 2 S.C.R. 573, McIntyre J. reasoned that, by its terms, s. 32(1) specifies that the Charter applies to \u201cthe legislative, executive and administrative branches of government\u201d (p. 598).\n[248] Under s. 32(1), the Charter applies where there has been governmental action; \u201c[t]he rights guaranteed by the Charter take effect only as restrictions on the power of government over the persons entitled to the rights\u201d (Hogg and Wright, at \u00a7 37:13). \u201cGovernment\u201d has been defined by this Court to capture \u201cthe body that can enact and enforce rules and authoritatively impinge on individual freedom\u201d (McKinney v. University of Guelph, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 229, at p. 262). The need to preserve individual rights in light of this significant authority requires governments to be \u201cconstitutionally shackled\u201d (p. 262; see also Dolphin Delivery, at p. 593).\n[249] The purpose underlying the scope of the Charter\u2019s applicability is thus to address the power imbalance between the governed and those who govern. Justice Dickson (as he then was) in Hunter v. Southam Inc., [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145, acknowledged this purpose explicitly, at p. 156:\nThe Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms is a purposive document. Its purpose is to guarantee and to protect, within the limits of reason, the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms it enshrines. It is intended to constrain governmental action inconsistent with those rights and freedoms; it is not in itself an authorization for governmental action. [Emphasis added.]\nSimilarly, as noted by Lauwers J.A. in Spence v. BMO Trust Co., 2016 ONCA 196, 129 O.R. (3d) 561, at para. 125, \u201cthe Charter exists to control the activities of government, as provided in s. 32(1), in order to protect personal autonomy and freedom from governmental activities\u201d. The importance of this power imbalance to determining whether an entity is captured by s. 32(1) is recognized throughout this Court\u2019s jurisprudence (see, e.g., McKinney, at pp. 261-62; Dolphin Delivery, at pp. 593 and 597; Stoffman v. Vancouver General Hospital, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 483, at p. 505).\n[250] This purpose motivates a broad understanding of the entities captured by s. 32(1). In light of the significant interests at stake, Wilson J. was clear in Lavigne v. Ontario Public Service Employees Union, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 211, that \u201cthe Charter applies to \u2018government\u2019 entities broadly construed\u201d (p. 240 (emphasis added)). This sentiment was echoed by La Forest J. in Godbout v. Longueuil (City), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 844, who cautioned against unduly narrowing the applicability of the Charter such that governments could evade their Charter obligations (para. 48).\n[251] This purpose must underlie any understanding and interpretation of s. 32(1). In assessing to whom the Charter applies, there must be a focus on entities that are entitled to exercise governmental power over individuals in a manner that potentially limits their rights and freedoms. Any interpretation of Charter applicability that has the effect of creating a Charter-free zone in the face of this form of power imbalance would undermine the Charter\u2019s objectives and importance.\n[252] The point that s. 32(1) should not be given a restrictive interpretation was made clear by La Forest J. in Godbout, at para. 47:\n. . . where such entities are, in reality, \u201cgovernmental\u201d in nature \u2014 as evidenced by such things as the degree of government control exercised over them, or by the governmental quality of the functions they perform \u2014they cannot escape Charter scrutiny. In other words, the ambit of s. 32 is wide enough to include all entities that are essentially governmental in nature and is not restricted merely to those that are formally part of the structure of the federal or provincial governments. [Emphasis added.]\n(See also para. 48.)\nUnder this jurisprudence it would be a mistake to narrowly focus on whether or how an entity fits within the structure of the federal or provincial governments.\n[253] Justice La Forest in Godbout endorsed a broad understanding of s. 32(1). Specifically, he explained how, in light of the overarching purpose of subjecting governmental action to constitutional scrutiny, an interpretive approach that limited the Charter\u2019s application to entities formally part of federal or provincial government structures would suffer from a fatal flaw:\nMoreover, interpreting s. 32 as including governmental entities other than those explicitly listed therein is entirely sensible from a practical perspective. Were the Charter to apply only to those bodies that are institutionally part of government but not to those that are \u2014 as a simple matter of fact \u2014 governmental in nature (or performing a governmental act), the federal government and the provinces could easily shirk their Charter obligations by conferring certain of their powers on other entities and having those entities carry out what are, in reality, governmental activities or policies. In other words, Parliament, the provincial legislatures and the federal and provincial executives could simply create bodies distinct from themselves, vest those bodies with the power to perform governmental functions and, thereby, avoid the constraints imposed upon their activities through the operation of the Charter. Clearly, this course of action would indirectly narrow the ambit of protection afforded by the Charter in a manner that could hardly have been intended and with consequences that are, to say the least, undesirable. Indeed, in view of their fundamental importance, Charter rights must be safeguarded from possible attempts to narrow their scope unduly or to circumvent altogether the obligations they engender. [Emphasis added; para. 48.]\n(See also Eldridge v. British Columbia (Attorney General), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 624, at para. 42.)\n[254] This passage from Godbout identifies a fundamental concern about institutional arrangements being used as a mechanism to circumvent Charter scrutiny of governmental action. To answer this concern, the heart of the inquiry remains focused on safeguarding Charter rights, not on the particular entities listed in s. 32(1). For this reason, \u201cthe Charter applies not only to Parliament, the legislatures and the government themselves, but also to all matters within the authority of those entities\u201d (Greater Vancouver Transportation Authority v. Canadian Federation of Students \u2014 British Columbia Component, 2009 SCC 31, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 295, at para. 14 (emphasis added)). Put another way, governmental action directed at \u201cmatters within the authority\u201d of Parliament and the provincial legislatures \u2014 the heads of power under ss. 91 to 95 of the Constitution Act, 1867 \u2014 is subject to Charter scrutiny. This is so regardless of an entity\u2019s connection to formal federal or provincial government structures.\n[255] The scope of s. 32(1), while broad, is by no means unlimited. Non-governmental private action is not subject to the Charter \u2014 s. 32(1) does not capture \u201crelations between private persons and private persons\u201d (Hogg and Wright, at \u00a7 37:13; see also Dolphin Delivery, at p. 597; Spence, at para. 125). Nor is it sufficient that \u201can entity performs what may loosely be termed a \u2018public function\u2019\u201d or that \u201ca particular activity may be described as \u2018public\u2019 in nature\u201d (Eldridge, at para. 43; see also McKinney, at pp. 268-69). Rather, the entity or activity must be governmental in nature.\n(2) The Eldridge Framework for Identifying Charter Applicability\n[256] The Eldridge framework discusses the applicability of the Charter under s. 32(1). Under this framework, an entity may be subject to the Charter in two ways (para. 44). First, an entity is subject to the Charter if it is \u201cgovernment\u201d within the meaning of s. 32(1) \u2014 either by its very nature or due to the degree of governmental control over it. Where this category is fulfilled, all of the entity\u2019s activities will attract Charter scrutiny. Second, where an entity is not \u201cgovernment\u201d but is undertaking an activity that is \u201c\u2018governmental\u2019 in nature\u201d, the entity is subject to Charter review in respect of that activity.\n[257] Under the first branch of Eldridge, courts ask whether an entity is government \u201cby its very nature\u201d or because government exercises substantial control over it (para. 44; see also Greater Vancouver Transportation Authority, at para. 16). In Godbout, La Forest J. noted that the \u201cfactors that might serve to ground a finding that an institution is performing \u2018governmental functions\u2019 do not readily admit of any a priori elucidation\u201d, but proceeded to list several non-exhaustive indicia of government by nature (paras. 49-51). Alternatively, entities \u201cwholly controlled by government\u201d and \u201cin essence, emanations of the . . . legislatures that created them\u201d are also government under the first branch (para. 47; see also Douglas\/Kwantlen Faculty Assn. v. Douglas College, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 570, at p. 584; Lavigne, at pp. 241-42).\n[258] Under the second branch of Eldridge, the focus is on the \u201cquality of the act\u201d and whether it is truly \u201cgovernmental\u201d (para. 44). Justice La Forest listed \u201cthe implementation of a specific statutory scheme or a government program\u201d as examples of governmental activities attracting Charter scrutiny (para. 44).\n[259] The Eldridge framework thus captures two ways in which an entity may be considered governmental. The first branch of Eldridge concerns the nature of the entity; the second concerns the nature of the activity (Greater Vancouver Transportation Authority, at para. 16). In both cases, the Charter applies in respect of governmental action.\n(3) The Eldridge Framework and Indigenous Governments\n[260] Like Kasirer and Jamal JJ., we acknowledge that the VGFN falls within the first branch of the Eldridge framework as it is a government by nature. However, we question whether existing categories are adequate to deal with self-governing Indigenous nations and reject the idea that VGFN\u2019s governmental status is based on the delegation of authority from another level of government.\n[261] As noted above, existing jurisprudence provides general and instructive statements about the purpose of s. 32(1). However, these cases did not involve the distinct context of Indigenous governments and instead addressed other unrelated circumstances. Legal tests devised to assess whether municipalities, universities, or hospitals must respect the Charter arise from, and necessarily respond to, their particular factual contexts. They should not be read as a complete answer on the scope of the Charter\u2019s applicability to self-governing Indigenous nations. Principles articulated for entities wholly created by the federal or provincial governments will be incomplete and ill-suited when assessing the lawmaking authority of the first inhabitants of Canada.\n[262] Different considerations arise with respect to Indigenous governments as they are a foundational piece of Canada\u2019s constitutional fabric. Over time, governments and courts have learned that legal questions involving Indigenous peoples frequently require different considerations, legal concepts, and perspectives, grounded in the reality that they are the first inhabitants of Canada. Analogies to existing case law that identify governmental entities will be partial and imperfect when applied to self-governing Indigenous nations. Limiting conditions should not be grafted onto s. 32(1) when to do so would stunt the growth of what was intended to be a living, remedial, and responsive constitution. Although this Court has yet to fully recognize an inherent Aboriginal right to self-government, s. 32(1) should not be interpreted in a manner that would impair the recognition of such a right prior to the issue being adjudicated.\n[263] The delegated authority or substantial control approaches used in Eldridge and McKinney are therefore not particularly helpful for assessing the applicability of the Charter to the VGFN. Looking for a form of delegated authority by the federal or a provincial government does not respect the historic and integral role of Indigenous societies in Canada and fails to account for the modern context of self-governing Indigenous nations.\n[264] Indigenous peoples were self-governing entities before the arrival of European settlers and continue to govern themselves to this day (S. Grammond, \u201cTreaties as Constitutional Agreements\u201d, in P. Oliver, P. Macklem and N. Des Rosiers, eds., The Oxford Handbook of the Canadian Constitution (2017), 305, at p. 314). The long-standing self-governance practices of Indigenous societies are well established in this Court\u2019s jurisprudence: \u201cLong before Europeans explored and settled North America, aboriginal peoples were occupying and using most of this vast expanse of land in organized, distinctive societies with their own social and political structures\u201d (Mitchell v. M.N.R., 2001 SCC 33, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 911, at para. 9; see also Haida Nation v. British Columbia (Minister of Forests), 2004 SCC 73, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 511, at para. 25). The \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between Indigenous peoples and the Crown is based on these long-standing practices and recognition of Indigenous institutions that existed before the Crown\u2019s assertion of sovereignty (Beckman v. Little Salmon\/Carmacks First Nation, 2010 SCC 53, [2010] 3 S.C.R. 103, at para. 122, per Deschamps J., concurring; Manitoba Metis Federation Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2013 SCC 14, [2013] 1 S.C.R. 623, at para. 67).\n[265] Recognition of self-governing Indigenous nations as governments in their own right, and not by virtue of delegated power, falls clearly within the ambit of s. 32(1) and the purpose of the Charter. Importantly, it upholds long\u2011standing Indigenous practices of self-governance and advances reconciliation in Canada. It is not necessary for the impugned action to stem from authority granted by federal, provincial, or territorial legislation for it to be subject to Charter scrutiny. The emphasis the majority places on the VGFN deriving at least some of its lawmaking authority from federal law gives insufficient weight to the VGFN\u2019s independent governmental nature.\n[266] We thus reject the notion that an essential factor for the Charter\u2019s applicability under s. 32(1) is that the source of the VGFN\u2019s lawmaking authority flows from Parliament. We acknowledge that Kasirer and Jamal JJ. take great care to respect the position of self-governing Indigenous nations like the VGFN: noting that the VGFN is not controlled by the federal or Yukon government under the control prong (para. 76), that the Vuntut Gwitchin have been self-governing since time immemorial (para. 82), that Parliament can recognize an Indigenous government to which it confers lawmaking authority under s. 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867 without creating that Indigenous government (para. 83), and that the reasons should not be taken to suggest that the VGFN is similar to a municipality (para. 88). Nevertheless, they find that \u201cthe VGFN exercises powers that Parliament otherwise would have exercised through its legislative jurisdiction under s. 91(24)\u201d (para. 82) and place substantial weight on the Constitution Act, 1867 and federal legislation as the source of the VGFN\u2019s authority to enact the residency requirement. For example, at para. 91, they state:\nWe conclude that the Charter applies to the VGFN\u2019s residency requirement only insofar as that requirement flows from an exercise of statutory power under s. 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867. We make no comment on whether an exercise of an inherent right of self-government untethered from federal legislation would be subject to the Charter, which in our view need not be decided in this case in view of the self-government arrangements in issue. [Emphasis added.]\n[267] The weight placed on delegation under s. 91(24) does not reflect the unique situation of self-governing Indigenous nations and is not required under the first branch of Eldridge for an entity like the VGFN to attract Charter scrutiny. Self-governing Indigenous nations may not be expressly mentioned in s. 32(1) but they deal with \u201cmatters\u201d which are, and this section must receive a purposive, expansive application so that the Charter applies to protect all.\n(4) The Charter Applies to Governmental Action in Respect of \u201cMatters Within the Authority\u201d of Parliament and the Provincial Legislatures\n[268] It is important to underscore that s. 32(1) was enacted when Parliament, provincial legislatures, and their subordinate entities, represented the entire legislative universe. Those bodies were the modalities for the exercise of all legislative power in Canada. Indigenous peoples were not recognized as self-autonomous and were often not consulted in legislative decision-making. References to \u201cdelegating\u201d authority (Eldridge, at para. 42), the government \u201capparatus\u201d (McKinney, at p. 275), or Parliament and the provincial legislatures having \u201ccreated\u201d certain entities (Godbout, at paras. 47-48) should be understood in this context. Self-government agreements that recognize and affirm the lawmaking authority of Indigenous communities, like the VGFN Self-Government Agreement, came later.\n[269] Eldridge, Godbout, and other related jurisprudence should not be read as imposing a condition that authority be delegated by Parliament or the provincial legislatures for the Charter to apply. The reference to these bodies instead signals an intention that the full legislative field \u2014 \u201call matters within the authority\u201d of Parliament and the provincial legislatures \u2014 be covered by the Charter. Otherwise, individuals would be deprived of critical protections in situations of power imbalance between the governed and those who govern. This would amount to sanctioning Charter-free zones.\n[270] The broad ambit of s. 32(1) is also supported by other sections of the Constitution Act, 1982. For instance, s. 52(1) provides that \u201c[t]he Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of Canada, and any law that is inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution is, to the extent of the inconsistency, of no force and effect.\u201d We do not agree with Ms. Dickson, the Attorney General of Alberta, and the Government of Yukon that s. 52(1) speaks to the Charter\u2019s scope of application. The provision is remedial and empowers courts to strike down legislation (G. R\u00e9gimbald and D. Newman, The Law of the Canadian Constitution (2nd ed. 2017), at \u00a7 29.23). As explained in our colleague Rowe J.\u2019s reasons, s. 52(1) does not allow parties to circumvent the question of whether the Charter can be invoked in the first place. However, concluding that the Charter only applies to the laws and actions of the federal and provincial governments or their delegates would create an inconsistency with the remedial breadth available under s. 52(1), given that the broad language of s. 52(1) would readily capture the laws enacted by a self-governing Indigenous nation.\n[271] Additionally, we agree with the Attorney General of Canada\u2019s submission that the inclusion of s. 25, which instructs courts to interpret Charter rights and freedoms in a way that respects the position of Indigenous peoples and their unique rights, is compatible with the Charter\u2019s application to self-governing Indigenous nations (see also Royal Commission, vol. 2, at p. 231 (describing the application of the Charter to Indigenous governments as being \u201cmoulded and tempered by the mandatory provisions of section 25\u201d)). While neither s. 52(1) nor s. 25 directly expand the scope of the Charter\u2019s applicability, they helpfully provide guidance on how any particular interpretation of s. 32(1) would accord with the internal architecture of the Constitution of Canada.\n[272] To summarize, the Charter broadly applies to governmental action in respect of \u201cmatters within the authority\u201d of Parliament and the provincial legislatures. All orders of government are captured. This interpretation aligns with and upholds s. 32(1)\u2019s overarching purpose of addressing the power imbalance between the governed and those who govern. To interpret s. 32(1) and the Eldridge framework as being limited to situations of delegated authority would unduly prioritize an overly textual approach to s. 32(1) and deprive Indigenous people of the Charter\u2019s protections when their rights have been infringed by their own governing bodies.\nB. Application of Section 32(1) to the VGFN\n(1) Delegation Does Not Accurately Describe the Relationship Between the Crown and Self-Governing Indigenous Nations\n[273] Recognition and acceptance of the VGFN\u2019s historic and ongoing self-governance is clear. The preamble to the VGFN Self-Government Agreement affirms that the \u201cVuntut Gwitchin have traditional decision-making structures and are desirous of maintaining these structures\u201d. It specifies that \u201cthe Parties wish to support and promote the contemporary and evolving political institutions and processes of the Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation\u201d. The VGFN Constitution preamble notes that the Constitution is adopted in furtherance of a \u201cdesir[e] to exercise our inherent right of self-government\u201d.\n[274] The VGFN Self-Government Agreement has been recognized and affirmed by federal and territorial legislation (Yukon First Nations Self-Government Act, S.C. 1994, c. 35; First Nations (Yukon) Self-government Act, R.S.Y. 2002, c. 90). The stated purpose of the federal legislation is to \u201cbring into effect self-government agreements\u201d concluded with Indigenous nations, including the VGFN (ss. 4 and 5(1)). The territorial legislation provides, inter alia, for the approval of self-government agreements, including that of the VGFN, and the recognition of such agreements as having \u201cthe force of law\u201d (ss. 1 and 2).\n[275] Legislative recognition of the VGFN\u2019s self-governance authority does not transform it into delegated authority. The federal and territorial legislation confirms the self-government powers set out in the agreements and, as the VGFN puts it, \u201ccreate[s] a space for their practical and contemporary exercise through legal recognition by Canada and Yukon\u201d (R.F., at para. 51 (footnote omitted)). We agree with Ms. Dickson\u2019s submission that this statutory recognition \u201cdoes not undermine the fact that [the] VGFN is a rights-holding Indigenous collective in Canada\u201d that practiced its own legal traditions prior to European settlement and continues to do so (R.F. on cross-appeal, at para. 34). Given the historic and ongoing self-governance practices of Indigenous societies, it would be inapt to characterize Indigenous self-government as a delegated authority.\n[276] As we have explained, however, it is not a prerequisite to the applicability of the Charter that an entity exercise delegated authority from Parliament or a provincial legislature. Therefore, we need not go further on the source of Indigenous self-government authority. Rather, under the first branch of Eldridge, the Charter applies to governmental action in respect of \u201cmatters within the authority\u201d of Parliament and the provincial legislatures. The key question is whether the VGFN, as an entity, is a government by its very nature.\n(2) The VGFN Is a Government by Its Very Nature\n[277] We have no hesitation concluding that the VGFN is subject to the Charter. It is inherently governmental. The VGFN\u2019s long\u2011standing history reinforces its governmental nature; as the trial judge noted, \u201c[t]he Vuntut Gwitchin were constituted as a political entity prior to the assertion of British sovereignty and have governed themselves in accordance with their own laws since time immemorial\u201d (2020 YKSC 22, 461 C.R.R. (2d) 230, at para. 11).\n[278] An array of relevant factors demonstrate that the VGFN is governmental in nature. For example, the VGFN council is democratically elected, it has the authority to levy taxes, and it possesses extensive lawmaking powers \u2014 all of which were described by La Forest J. in Godbout as non-exhaustive indicia of government (para. 51; see also VGFN Final Agreement (1993), ch. 24; VGFN Self-Government Agreement, s. 13.0; Yukon First Nations Self\u2011Government Act, s. 11 and Sch. III). The VGFN also has the exclusive authority to govern its internal affairs (VGFN Self-Government Agreement, s. 13.1). This includes the enactment of the residency requirement itself \u2014 a legislative action that impacts individual members\u2019 rights by restricting democratic participation. Further, the VGFN can enact laws applicable in the Yukon in relation to a wide array of matters touching the everyday lives of its citizens, such as health care, education, adoption and child welfare, solemnization of marriage, and estate administration (s. 13.2). It is empowered to legislate on matters of a local or private nature on the settlement land, which the VGFN Self-Government Agreement defines as including the administration of justice, land use, expropriation of land, protection of fish, wildlife, and habitat, environmental protection, vehicles, curfews and the prevention of disorderly conduct, public health, public order, and other \u201cmatters coming within the good government of Citizens on Settlement Land\u201d (s. 13.3).\n[279] The VGFN\u2019s extensive catalogue of lawmaking powers touches on \u201cmatters within the authority\u201d of Parliament and the provincial legislatures, as provided by s. 32(1). As the Congress of Aboriginal Peoples points out, many of the services provided by the VGFN as a self-governing Indigenous nation would otherwise be within the purview of other levels of government (I.F., at para. 8). While a different modality for the exercise of legislative power, the VGFN\u2019s authority as a self-governing Indigenous nation is no less impactful or binding on its citizens and no less capable of limiting their Charter rights.\n[280] The VGFN\u2019s structure and functions reflect its inherently governmental nature: it creates laws and makes decisions that benefit, order, and restrict the lives of its citizens. We accordingly conclude that the VGFN is a government by its very nature. Its enactment of the residency requirement must attract Charter scrutiny.\nC. Conclusion on Section 32(1)\n[281] \u201cThe Charter is a nation-building instrument\u201d (J. Harrington, \u201cInterpreting the Charter\u201d, in Oliver, Macklem and Des Rosiers, The Oxford Handbook of the Canadian Constitution, 621, at p. 622). It was intended to solidify a national identity and preserve individual rights and freedoms in the face of governmental action. This purpose aligns with its application to self-governing Indigenous nations, including the VGFN. All orders of government in Canada are bound to uphold the Charter\u2019s protections as these protections represent an integral feature of the relationship between the governed and those who govern. Any narrower approach to s. 32(1) risks the creation of Charter-free zones and would undermine the balance intended to be struck by the introduction of constitutionally entrenched rights in Canada.\n[282] Section 32(1) can be read to recognize the political and constitutional evolution that has occurred in respect of Indigenous self-government. Indigenous nations like the VGFN have been self-governing since time immemorial and our reasons affirm that, whatever the source of their self-government authority, self-governing Indigenous nations are subject to the Charter pursuant to s. 32(1) and in accordance with a modified Eldridge framework when they engage in governmental action.\nIII. Section 25 of the Charter\n[283] The constitutional place of Indigenous peoples and the application of the Charter to them engages a series of special considerations. While the Charter primarily protects individual rights, Indigenous peoples also have collective rights and interests, including group title to land (Tsilhqot\u2019in Nation v. British Columbia, 2014 SCC 44, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 257) and the right to self-government recognized in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (U.N. Doc. A\/RES\/61\/295, October 2, 2007 (\u201cUNDRIP\u201d), Articles 3 and 4; see also United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act, S.C. 2021, c. 14). Although the original peoples in Canada, the various nations \u2014 even taken together \u2014 are presently a minority within the Canadian population and polity. They have been, and continue to be, subjected to the forces of colonialism in ways that distinguish them from other groups protected and recognized by the Charter. Section 25 plays a distinct role from other Charter provisions, operating to preserve a form of collective rights unique to Indigenous peoples in Canada while at the same time recognizing that when Indigenous governments make distinctions between their citizens, as all governments do, individuals and minorities within the collective should nevertheless benefit from all the constitutionally entrenched protections of the Charter.\n[284] This case marks the first time a majority of this Court has considered s. 25, which provides as follows:\n25 The guarantee in this Charter of certain rights and freedoms shall not be construed so as to abrogate or derogate from any aboriginal, treaty or other rights or freedoms that pertain to the aboriginal peoples of Canada including\n(a) any rights or freedoms that have been recognized by the Royal Proclamation of October 7, 1763; and\n(b) any rights or freedoms that now exist by way of land claims agreements or may be so acquired.\nThe two main elements of s. 25 that must be interpreted on this appeal pertain to its operation and scope. First, in light of its text, context and purpose, how does s. 25 operate and how should a court resolve a challenge posed by the potentially competing rights the provision contemplates? Second, which rights are included within the scope of \u201caboriginal, treaty or other rights or freedoms that pertain to the aboriginal peoples of Canada\u201d?\n[285] We take a view that is different from what Kasirer and Jamal JJ. propose concerning both the operation of s. 25 and the scope of the rights and freedoms captured by the provision. In our view, a purposive approach to s. 25 leads to the conclusion that this provision is an interpretive tool, not an impenetrable shield. Moreover, the rights within the scope of s. 25 are limited to those that are unique to Indigenous peoples because they are Indigenous and do not extend to all matters on which Indigenous governments may act. This conception ensures that s. 25 does not serve to effectively create extensive Charter-free zones in the context of Indigenous self-government, depriving Indigenous peoples of fundamental rights protections and immunizing governments \u201cfrom the rights and freedoms floor established in the Charter\u201d (I.F., Canadian Constitution Foundation, at para. 17). Though our analyses diverge, we understand Canadian constitutionalism as one wherein contending ideas are not a flaw that must be overcome, but are instead essential to our constitutional democracy (see J. Webber, The Constitution of Canada: A Contextual Analysis (2nd ed. 2021), at pp. 7\u20118).\nA. How Does Section 25 Operate?\n[286] There are competing views on the effect of s. 25 and the question is sometimes posed as whether the provision is a shield or an interpretive prism. The VGFN argues that s. 25 is a complete shield to Ms. Dickson\u2019s Charter claim and that the purpose of s. 25 is protection of space for the exercise of Aboriginal, treaty, and other rights \u2014 \u201cnot balancing or reconciliation\u201d (R.F., at paras. 103\u20114 and 122). Ms. Dickson, on the other hand, submits that s. 25 does not operate as an automatic shield to Charter scrutiny, but rather contemplates some degree of balancing between the individual Charter right and the collective Indigenous right (A.F., at paras. 92 and 97).\n[287] In our view, interpretation is key to a s. 25 analysis. We agree with the position of Ms. Dickson and some interveners that the \u201c\u2018shield approach\u2019 . . . amounts to an \u2018either\/or\u2019 exercise that oversimplifies the discussion about the interaction of collective and individual rights\u201d (I.F., A.G. Canada, at para. 36). For the reasons that follow, we conclude that it is not necessary or desirable, at this early stage in the application of s. 25, to carve out Charter \u201cno go\u201d zones that would result from the erection of shields.\n(1) A Purposive Interpretation\n[288] Charter provisions, including s. 25, must be interpreted purposively (Hunter, at pp. 156-57). The meaning of a provision is understood in light of the interests it is meant to protect. When ascertaining the purpose of a Charter provision, courts look \u201cto the character and the larger objects of the Charter itself, to the language chosen to articulate the specific right or freedom, to the historical origins of the concepts enshrined, and where applicable, to the meaning and purpose of the other specific rights and freedoms with which it is associated within the text of the Charter\u201d (R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., [1985] 1 S.C.R. 295, at p. 344). A purposive analysis of s. 25 includes an examination of the \u201clanguage, structure, and history of the constitutional text\u201d (Reference re Public Service Employee Relations Act (Alta.), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 313, at p. 394, per McIntyre J.).\n[289] As we explain, the text of s. 25 does not dictate the result or point unequivocally in one direction. Fairly read, it is capable of supporting either an interpretive or shield approach. We are persuaded, however, that s. 25 was intended to operate as an interpretive prism based on its nature, purpose, and history. This approach is most consistent with the way in which competing rights under the Charter are balanced and best reflects the needs of all Indigenous people, the final recommendations of the Royal Commission, and the rights enshrined in UNDRIP. It provides a respectful and responsive path forward into a future in which Charter rights and Indigenous conceptions of rights will be integrated in a variety of legal fora.\n(2) The Text\n[290] The text of s. 25 says that individual Charter rights \u201cshall not be construed so as to abrogate or derogate from any aboriginal, treaty or other rights or freedoms that pertain to the aboriginal peoples of Canada\u201d.\n[291] We agree with several points that Kasirer and Jamal JJ. make about the text of s. 25, namely that:\n\u2022 The English and French versions of constitutional texts are \u201cequally authoritative as expressions of the intent reflected in s. 25\u201d (para. 121).\n\u2022 There is a shared meaning conveyed by the two linguistic texts that speaks to both a protective purpose in relation to the collective Indigenous right and an interpretive exercise in relation to the competing rights that must be undertaken by the court (para. 124).\n\u2022 A common feature of ss. 21, 25, 26 and 29 of the Charter is that they are \u201cdesigned to protect rights that exist independently of the Charter itself\u201d (para. 129, quoting K. M. Lysyk, \u201cThe Rights and Freedoms of the Aboriginal Peoples of Canada\u201d, in W. S. Tarnopolsky and G.\u2011A. Beaudoin, eds., The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms: Commentary (1982), 467, at p. 471).\n[292] In our view, however, the text of s. 25 offers little assistance on whether an interpretive approach or a shield approach should be preferred. It is plain from the text that the inclusion of s. 25 was an attempt to protect certain collective Indigenous rights from abrogation or derogation, as we explain more fully in our analysis of the provision\u2019s purpose and history. As Kasirer and Jamal JJ. note, the words \u201cshall not be construed\u201d and \u201cne porte pas atteinte\u201d speak to the mandatory and declaratory nature of the provision (para. 125). We are in agreement with that observation, but this does not oust the interpretive exercise that s. 25 prescribes in relation to the competing rights at stake. Put another way, it does not end the matter for a court to conclude that a Charter claim implicates an Aboriginal, treaty, or other right or freedom that \u201cpertain[s] to the aboriginal peoples of Canada\u201d. The court must still consider the Charter claim in context and attempt to balance or reconcile the competing interests at stake.\n[293] A review of the purpose and legislative history of s. 25, this Court\u2019s jurisprudence on interpreting competing constitutional rights, and other sources including the Final Report of the Royal Commission and UNDRIP is therefore more instructive on the operation and scope of s. 25. In the sections that follow, we demonstrate why these sources affirm an interpretive approach to the provision.\n(3) The Purpose and History of Section 25\n[294] The constitutional entrenchment of a bill of rights in Canada in 1982 was a major turning point in the relationship between individuals and the state. The Charter would permit governmental action to be reviewed by courts on the basis of its consistency with individual rights protections. A host of individual interests were to be protected, including fundamental freedoms, democratic rights, legal rights, and \u2014 importantly \u2014 equality rights.\n[295] Concerns were voiced about possible tension arising between the protection and prioritization of individual Charter rights and the special position, status, and rights of certain collectives within Canadian society. In particular, many people, including governments, Indigenous communities, and other stakeholders, began to consider how an entrenched bill of rights would impact the unique collective rights of Indigenous peoples and the programs designed to ameliorate their conditions. For example, the Attorney General of Saskatchewan, Roy Romanow, told the Federal-Provincial Conference of First Ministers on the Constitution in 1978 that:\nIn Saskatchewan, for example, for some years now I believe the government has in effect discriminated if I could put it that way . . . . Recently we signed an agreement with a major mining company for a new mining project in Northern Saskatchewan and part of that agreement requires that by 1982 fifty per cent of the employees be northerners . . . most of whom would be by definition Indians status or non-status. Now with an entrenched Bill of Rights, and if you judge by the American experience, policies like those might be struck down by the courts as being discriminatory . . . .\nIn Canada some would argue, Prime Minister, that our greater need is to encourage affirmative action programmes to redress some social injustices and the proposed charter, indeed any Bill of Rights, might make it difficult to pursue that goal.\n(Federal-Provincial Conference of First Ministers on the Constitution (afternoon session of October 30, 1978), at p. 157; see also I.F., Canadian Constitution Foundation, at paras. 11-12.)\nIn other words, would Indigenous difference be undermined by a formalistic conception of equality?\n[296] Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau responded that Attorney General Romanow\u2019s concern about permitting affirmative action was addressed by cl. 26 of what was then Bill C-60, 3rd Sess., 30th Parl., 1978, which proposed that:\nNothing in this Charter shall be held to abrogate, abridge or derogate from any right or freedom not declared by it that may have existed in Canada at the commencement of this Act, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any right or freedom that may have been acquired by any of the native peoples of Canada by virtue of the Royal Proclamation of October 7, 1763.\n(See also B. H. Wildsmith, Aboriginal peoples and Section 25 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (1988), at p. 5.)\nWhile Bill C-60 never became law, the essence of cl. 26 was incorporated in subsequent iterations of what is now s. 25 of the Charter.\n[297] Legislative debates on constitutional reform shed light on the purpose of s. 25. The entrenchment of the rights of Indigenous peoples in what is now s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 was not on the agenda at the beginning of the patriation process (see J. M. Arbour, \u201cThe Protection of Aboriginal Rights within a Human Rights Regime: In Search of an Analytical Framework for Section 25 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\u201d (2003), 21 S.C.L.R. (2d) 3, at pp. 30\u201131). However, by October 1980, Prime Minister Trudeau had made an undertaking to several Indigenous leaders that he would use the Constitution as a tool to better protect their rights (House of Commons Debates, vol. IV, 1st Sess., 32nd Parl., October 17, 1980, at p. 3778). Several months after the introduction of the constitutional reform package in Parliament, Minister of Justice Jean Chr\u00e9tien proposed on January 30, 1981, a new clause, contained in Part II of the Constitution Act, 1982 and outside the Charter, that would recognize and affirm the Aboriginal and treaty rights of Indigenous peoples (Arbour, at pp. 33\u201134). That clause was removed in November 1981 following further constitutional negotiations, which Minister Chr\u00e9tien described as the \u201cconsequence of a process which required the making of compromises\u201d (House of Commons Debates, vol. XII, 1st Sess., 32nd Parl., November 20, 1981, at p. 13045). Later that month, further compromise resulted in the re-insertion of what is now s. 35 to protect \u201cexisting aboriginal and treaty rights\u201d of Indigenous peoples (House of Commons Debates, vol. XII, 1st Sess., 32nd Parl., November 24, 1981, at pp. 13202-3 (emphasis added); see also Arbour, at p. 35; Wildsmith, at p. 7).\n[298] Concurrently, debates surrounding what is now s. 25 were occurring in the context of uncertainty about which Aboriginal rights, if any, would be constitutionally recognized and affirmed. The Department of Justice\u2019s Assistant Deputy Minister, Barry L. Strayer, told the Special Joint Committee of the Senate and of the House of Commons on the Constitution of Canada that s. 25 stipulates that \u201cif those rights exist, they continue to exist and that the Charter does not affect them. It is not prejudging whether they exist or they do not exist, it is just saying if they do, the Charter does not alter those rights in any way\u201d (Minutes of Proceedings and Evidence of the Special Joint Committee of the Senate and of the House of Commons on the Constitution of Canada, No. 38, 1st Sess., 32nd Parl., January 15, 1981, at p. 16 (emphasis added)). Similarly, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Ray Ch\u00e9nier, explained the intended effect of s. 25:\n. . . the existing protection of the native people\u2019s way of life by assuring that any rights or freedoms that pertain to the native peoples of Canada shall not be abrogated by the introduction of a guarantee in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms of certain rights and freedoms for all Canadians. This section is purposefully open-ended. There is, as I have said before, the possibility of future entrenchment of additional rights in the constitution such as those demanded by native peoples. [Emphasis added.]\n(House of Commons Debates, vol. V, 1st Sess., 32nd Parl., November 20, 1980, at p. 4915; see also Arbour, at pp. 31-32.)\n[299] When Minister Chr\u00e9tien was questioned at the Special Joint Committee, he explained that in the government\u2019s view, the Charter should not \u201caffect\u201d those rights or \u201ccreate any problems in relation to those rights\u201d for Aboriginal peoples (Minutes of Proceedings and Evidence of the Special Joint Committee of the Senate and of the House of Commons on the Constitution of Canada, No. 49, 1st Sess., 32nd Parl., January 30, 1981, at p. 94). In this way, Minister Chr\u00e9tien indicated that the purpose of s. 25 is to ensure the individual rights outlined in the Charter do not prevent Indigenous peoples from exercising their collective rights.\n[300] A review of the Charter drafting and negotiation process thus reveals a \u201cpreservation of rights approach\u201d with respect to s. 25 \u2014 aimed at ensuring that the Charter would not lessen other existing rights, including unique rights held by Indigenous peoples (I.F., A.G. Alberta, at para. 24). In addition, former drafts of s. 25 offer additional insight in support of this approach. In October 1980, a draft of the provision was tabled in the House of Commons and the Senate. It read as follows:\n. . . The guarantee in this Charter of certain rights and freedoms shall not be construed as denying the existence of any other rights or freedoms that exist in Canada, including any rights or freedoms that pertain to the native peoples of Canada.\n(The Canadian Constitution 1980: Proposed Resolution respecting the Constitution of Canada (1980), at p. 24)\n[301] Similarly, Minister Chr\u00e9tien submitted further draft provisions in January 1981 to the Special Joint Committee, which read:\n. . . The guarantee in this Charter of certain rights and freedoms shall not be construed as denying the existence of:\n(a) any aboriginal, treaty or other rights or freedoms that may pertain to the aboriginal peoples of Canada including any right or freedom that may have been recognized by the Royal Proclamation of October 7, 1763;\nor\n(b) any other rights or freedoms\nthat may exist in Canada.\n(Minutes of Proceedings and Evidence of the Special Joint Committee of the Senate and of the House of Commons on the Constitution of Canada, No. 36, 1st Sess., 32nd Parl., January 12, 1981, at p. 18)\n[302] Both of these earlier draft provisions suggest the government intended for the provision to protect collective Indigenous rights from being erased or excluded by the assertion of individual rights under relevant Charter sections. The drafts do not suggest it was the government\u2019s intent for s. 25 to create an impenetrable shield to encircle Aboriginal rights and freedoms and create Charter-free zones in certain parts of the country. Instead, the legal effect of s. 25 is to make clear that the rights and freedoms guaranteed in the Charter should not be read as undermining the rights and freedoms afforded to Indigenous peoples.\n[303] Three important conclusions about the purpose of s. 25 can be discerned from the provision\u2019s legislative origins.\n[304] First, the inclusion of s. 25 was motivated by concerns about how the collective rights and interests of Indigenous peoples might interact with the constitutional entrenchment of individual rights \u2014 especially the right to equality under s. 15(1). A central motivating concern for s. 25 was about whether, in its absence, protections against racial discrimination contained in s. 15(1) of the Charter would adversely impact Aboriginal or treaty rights that are held by Indigenous peoples on the basis of their Indigeneity (Hogg and Wright, at \u00a7 28:41; C. Hutchinson, \u201cCase Comment on R. v. Kapp: An Analytical Framework for Section 25 of the Charter\u201d (2007), 52 McGill L.J. 173, at p. 178). While this Court has now repeatedly affirmed that the \u201canimating norm\u201d of s. 15(1) is substantive equality \u2014 which entails looking \u201cbehind the facade of similarities and differences\u201d in assessing equality claims \u2014 this jurisprudential trend was by no means a foregone conclusion at the time of the Charter\u2019s adoption (Fraser v. Canada (Attorney General), 2020 SCC 28; [2020] 3 S.C.R. 113, R. v. Sharma, 2022 SCC 39, at paras. 37 and 187; Withler v. Canada (Attorney General), 2011 SCC 12, [2011] 1 S.C.R. 396, at para. 39). Section 25 was motivated by a real concern that collective Indigenous rights would be undermined by a formalistic interpretation of s. 15(1). For example, s. 25 would prevent non-Indigenous people from claiming identical rights to hunt or fish on traditional lands and would insulate programs and provisions designed to protect the special rights of Indigenous peoples.\n[305] Second, s. 25 was not intended to create or confer rights. Section 25 is a \u201csaving provision that does not purport either to create new rights or to amplify or otherwise affect the constitutional or legal status of rights that already exist or that may be brought into existence independently of the Charter\u201d (Lysyk, at p. 472; see also J. Borrows, \u201cContemporary Traditional Equality: The Effect of the Charter on First Nation Politics\u201d (1994), 43 U.N.B.L.J. 19, at p. 28; Hogg and Wright, at \u00a7 28:41). Justice Bastarache observed in R. v. Kapp, 2008 SCC 41, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 483, at para. 93, that, based on the provision\u2019s legislative history, it was \u201cmade abundantly clear that s. 25 creates no new rights\u201d. Rather, s. 25 was envisaged as a mechanism to \u201cguide the application of the Charter\u201d and \u201caddress the concern that the Charter would be used to take away from the rights\u201d of Indigenous peoples (Arbour, at p. 36). It is an interpretive tool, not a source of rights.\n[306] Third, while we accept that protecting Indigenous difference is an objective that motivated the inclusion of s. 25 in the Charter, a more precise formulation of the provision\u2019s aim is to protect the special status of certain collective rights held by Indigenous peoples. These are rights that pertain uniquely to Indigenous peoples because they are Indigenous (see Kapp, at para. 103, per Bastarache J.). They are intrinsically linked to the \u201cdistinctive, collective, [and] cultural identity\u201d of an Indigenous group (see Arbour, at p. 60; I.F., A.G. Canada, at para. 29). For example, Aboriginal and treaty rights recognized by s. 35, as well as other laws that confer benefits on the basis of one\u2019s membership in an Indigenous group \u2014 such as the \u201caffirmative action\u201d program described by Attorney General Romanow in 1978 \u2014 protect collective interests that are unique to Indigenous peoples and stem from their identity. In R. v. Van der Peet, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 507, at para. 19, Lamer C.J. explained that:\nAboriginal rights cannot, however, be defined on the basis of the philosophical precepts of the liberal enlightenment. Although equal in importance and significance to the rights enshrined in the Charter, aboriginal rights must be viewed differently from Charter rights because they are rights held only by aboriginal members of Canadian society. They arise from the fact that aboriginal people are aboriginal. [Emphasis added; emphasis in original deleted.]\nWhile s. 25 does not create rights and stands separate from provisions that create or constitutionally affirm them, it is noteworthy that s. 25 was drafted and adopted in the context of ongoing debates about which types of rights would ultimately be protected by what is now s. 35. We agree with Bastarache J.\u2019s statement from Kapp that, given s. 25\u2019s reference to \u201caboriginal and treaty rights\u201d, \u201cthe focus of [s. 25] is the uniqueness of those persons or communities mentioned in the Constitution; the rights protected are those that are unique to them because of their special status\u201d (para. 103).\n[307] This understanding of s. 25\u2019s purpose is entirely concordant with this Court\u2019s jurisprudence on how Indigenous rights are recognized and given effect within the Canadian constitutional framework. In Van der Peet, Lamer C.J. stated that \u201cthe purpose of s. 35(1) lies in its recognition of the prior occupation of North America by aboriginal peoples\u201d and that s. 35(1) provides \u201cthe constitutional framework through which the fact that aboriginals lived on the land in distinctive societies, with their own practices, traditions and cultures, is acknowledged and reconciled with the sovereignty of the Crown\u201d (paras. 31-32). Sections 35 and 25 do not fulfill the same function, nor are the rights within their scope co-extensive. However, both provisions recognize the special status of Indigenous communities and seek to reconcile collective Indigenous rights and interests with those of the broader Canadian state (see, e.g., Kapp, at para. 65; I.F., Congress of Aboriginal Peoples, at para. 20; A.F., at paras. 61-62; I.F., A.G. Quebec, at para. 19; I.F., A.G. Alberta, at paras. 14-16). Section 25 affirms that the protection of individual Charter rights does not impair this process of reconciliation.\n[308] To summarize, s. 25 furthers a particular purpose: to ensure that the introduction of a constitutionally entrenched bill of rights in Canada did not have the effect of abrogating or derogating from the unique rights held by Indigenous peoples that stem from their identity as Indigenous peoples.\n(4) Jurisprudence on the Interpretation of Constitutional Rights\n[309] That s. 25 furthers this purpose and operates as an interpretive prism is supported by many other important principles arising from constitutional jurisprudence. This Court has consistently affirmed that all parts of the Constitution must be read together and that there is no hierarchy among its various provisions (see Gosselin (Tutor of) v. Quebec (Attorney General), 2005 SCC 15, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 238, at para. 2; Reference re Same-Sex Marriage, 2004 SCC 79, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 698, at para. 50; Dagenais v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp., [1994] 3 S.C.R. 835, at p. 877). Moreover, constitutional rights are not absolute \u2014 they are often limited by the rights of others. This is equally true of Indigenous rights (see R. v. Badger, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 771, at paras. 80\u201182; R. v. Sparrow, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1075, at pp. 1108-9; R. v. Nikal, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 1013, at para. 92). Indeed, \u201climits placed on those rights are, where the objectives furthered by those limits are of sufficient importance to the broader community as a whole, equally a necessary part of [the] reconciliation\u201d between Indigenous communities and the broader community (R. v. Gladstone, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 723, at para. 73 (emphasis deleted); see also Delgamuukw v. British Columbia, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 1010, at paras. 160-61). Put simply, rights do not exist in a vacuum (Nikal, at para. 92).\n[310] Section 25 acknowledges this. It does not obviate the need for a balancing of competing interests or represent a marked exception to a flexible and contextual approach to constitutional interpretation. As Ms. Dickson notes, interpreting s. 25 as providing for an \u201cautomatic and absolute shield would be an outlier in this Court\u2019s jurisprudence\u201d (A.F., at para. 93). Aboriginal and treaty rights affirmed by s. 35 can be limited based on pressing societal interests (see Sparrow; Badger; Tsilhqot\u2019in Nation, at para. 152). It would be highly incongruent to automatically shield those same rights when their exercise results in Charter infringements, no matter how serious or extensive. The Charter ushered in a new relationship between the governed and those who govern; there is an important societal interest in reconciling collective and individual rights. We do not accept that the former absolutely trumps the latter. Such an interpretation of s. 25 would be \u201cinflexible to the point of being blunt\u201d (I.F., A.G. Canada, at para. 36).\n[311] As s. 25 should not be interpreted in a manner that bestows \u201cblanket immunity\u201d from Charter scrutiny, \u201cthe issue then becomes one of addressing a conflict between two different sets of constitutional rights\u201d (D. L. Milward, Aboriginal Justice and the Charter: Realizing a Culturally Sensitive Interpretation of Legal Rights (2012), at p. 69; see also T. Isaac, \u201cCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms: The Challenge of the Individual and Collective Rights of Aboriginal People\u201d (2002), 21 Windsor Y.B. Access Just. 431, at p. 437).\n(5) Post-1982 Constitutional Engagement\n[312] The 1996 Final Report of the Royal Commission is also of significance to the interpretation of s. 25 of the Charter. The Royal Commission had an expansive mandate to examine the situation of Aboriginal peoples across Canada and to propose solutions and remedies. The Final Report articulated four important principles as guidelines towards a \u201crenewed relationship\u201d between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal communities: \u201c. . . mutual recognition, mutual respect, sharing and mutual responsibility\u201d (Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, vol. 1, Looking Forward, Looking Back (1996), at p. 677). According to the Royal Commission, this involves \u201cequality, co-existence and self-government\u201d (p. 678). Respect for individual rights and self-determination for Indigenous communities does not have to be a zero-sum equation. In fact, equity and accountability through the application of the Charter may induce previously estranged individuals to reorient themselves to their communities of origin. In its factum, the Band Members Alliance and Advocacy Association of Canada writes that reconciliation efforts should not further deprive Indigenous people of their legal rights. Instead, reconciliation requires the law to chart a path forward that merges \u201ccolonial\u201d law with Indigenous social and legal orders until the two can co\u2011exist (para. 23).\n[313] Section 25 \u201cmust be given a flexible interpretation that takes account of the distinctive philosophies, traditions and cultural practices of Aboriginal peoples\u201d (Royal Commission, vol. 2, at p. 234). While this Court must make space in the Constitution for Indigenous peoples to develop their cultures and societies in the way they see fit, it must also be mindful that, due to the legacy of colonialism, Indigenous people face existing disadvantages and suffer from systemic discrimination. Reconciliation should not be a means by which they are further deprived of legal rights on their own lands. As such, while Indigenous self-government is an integral part of Canadian governance, it should, like any other head of government, be required to respect constitutional constraints, including the rights and freedoms guaranteed under the Charter.\n[314] Section 25 should not be interpreted in a way that prohibits Indigenous claimants from accessing other sections of the Charter, including s. 15(1), even if the challenge is to their own communities\u2019 laws. Since the Charter\u2019s enactment, important issues about the construction of and balance between individual and collective interests have been raised (see J. Koshan and J. Watson Hamilton, \u201cKahkewistahaw First Nation v Taypotat \u2014 Whither Section 25 of the Charter?\u201d (2016), 25:2 Const. Forum 39, at p. 42). These include the claim by the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada for an equal role in debating constitutional reforms (Native Women\u2019s Assn. of Canada v. Canada, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 627), litigation concerning band membership rules that excluded some women and their children (see K. Gover, \u201cWhen tribalism meets liberalism: Human rights and Indigenous boundary problems in Canada\u201d (2014), 64 U.T.L.J. 206, at pp. 230-34), and the allegation that election codes in some Indigenous communities may prevent individuals from running for office on the basis of their gender, marital status or sexual orientation (K. Busby, \u201cDiscussed, reformulated and enriched many times\u201d: The Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s Equality Jurisprudence \u2014 Notes for a presentation at the Canadian Bar Association Annual National Constitutional and Human Rights Conference, June 2014 (online), at pp. 4\u20115).\n[315] The need for a balancing of rights and a reconciliation of interests and peoples was not only central to the final recommendations of Royal Commission, it was at the core of the equality-based submissions made by the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada at the time of the Charlottetown Accord. Its comments about the discriminatory nature of some Indigenous governance structures and the need to apply the Charter to self-governing nations continue to resonate today:\nThe Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada supports individual rights. These rights are so fundamental that, once removed, you no longer have a human being. Aboriginal Women are human beings and we have rights which cannot be denied or removed at the whim of any government. . . . These views are in conflict with many Aboriginal leaders and legal theoreticians who advocate for recognition by Canada of sovereignty, self-government and collective rights. It is their unwavering view of the male Aboriginal leadership that the \u201ccollective\u201d comes first, and that it will decide the rights of individuals.\n. . .\nThe Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada recognizes that there is a clash between collective rights of sovereign Aboriginal governments and individual rights of women. Stripped of equality by patriarchal laws which created \u201cmale privilege\u201d as the norm on reserve lands, Aboriginal women have a tremendous struggle to regain their social position. We want the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms to apply to Aboriginal governments.\n(Statement on the \u201cCanada Package\u201d (1992), at pp. 9 and 11; see also Borrows (1994), at p. 44.)\n[316] Indigenous women warned that if the Charter did not apply to Indigenous governments, they might lose an important tool to assert their right to equality within their communities. It should come as no surprise that the inequalities that exist within the wider Canadian society may also be present or reproduced within Indigenous communities. Professor John Borrows notes that Indigenous governments can be just as dismissive and oppressive when it comes to issues of gender equality as other orders of government (Freedom and Indigenous Constitutionalism (2016), at p. 188). There is a similar and common need to protect the rights of all Indigenous citizens if their governments treat them unfairly, especially if they are part of a minority within the larger Indigenous collective.\n(6) International Sources\n[317] International human rights law can be a helpful source of information and direction when interpreting Charter provisions. The presumption of conformity directs that the Charter should be presumed to provide at least as great a protection as that which is afforded by similar provisions in international documents that Canada has ratified (Reference re Public Service Employee Relations Act, at p. 349, per Dickson C.J. and Wilson J., dissenting). Binding international instruments carry weight in the Charter interpretation exercise (Quebec (Attorney General) v. 9147-0732 Qu\u00e9bec inc., 2020 SCC 32, [2020] 3 S.C.R. 426, at para. 38). In this case, UNDRIP is binding on Canada and therefore triggers the presumption of conformity.\n[318] UNDRIP recognizes the need to protect both the collective and individual rights of Indigenous peoples. For example, Articles 4, 5, 20 and 34 affirm Indigenous peoples\u2019 right to self-determination, self-government, and the ability to protect their distinct political, legal, economic, social, and cultural institutions. Moreover, Articles 2 and 9 further direct that both Indigenous peoples and individuals must be free from all kinds of discrimination and be equal to all other peoples in the exercise of their rights. In this way, Indigenous people both have the right to belong to an Indigenous community or nation and must be protected from discrimination of all kinds in the exercise of this right.\n[319] UNDRIP is therefore illustrative of how one type of right cannot absolutely trump another. An interpretation of s. 25 that shields collective Indigenous rights and freedoms from incursion but does not uphold individual Indigenous peoples\u2019 right to be free from discrimination would be inconsistent with the comprehensive nature of UNDRIP\u2019s protections. Instead, a holistic reading of UNDRIP supports the view that s. 25 operates as an interpretive prism that ensures both collective and individual rights are respected.\n(7) Conclusion on the Operation of Section 25\n[320] For the foregoing reasons, s. 25 should serve as an interpretive prism and not operate as a shield. The extent to which this prism refracts and colours the Charter\u2019s application will depend on who brings the claim, against whom, and when. Adapting for context can create a \u201cstrong hedge\u201d around Aboriginal, treaty, and other rights in challenges brought by external parties, while ensuring that member-initiated challenges based on Charter principles can continue to exist (G. Christie, \u201cAboriginal Citizenship: Sections 35, 25 and 15 of Canada\u2019s Constitution Act, 1982\u201d (2003), 7 Citizsh. Stud. 481, at p. 491).\n[321] We add this. While we reject the shield approach to s. 25, we should not be taken as suggesting that the protection of fundamental rights can only occur through the Charter, or that self-governing Indigenous nations have no role to play in this regard. As governments in their own right, Indigenous nations can and often do entrench the rights of their citizens in constitutional documents. The VGFN Constitution, for example, provides that \u201c[e]very individual is equal before and under the laws of the Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation and has the right to the equal protection [and] equal benefit of Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation law without discrimination\u201d (Article IV(7)). The rights and freedoms set out in the VGFN Constitution are subject \u201conly to such reasonable limits as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic Vuntut Gwitchin society\u201d (Article IV(1)). The VGFN correctly notes that Ms. Dickson has the ability to bring a claim under Article IV(7) of the VGFN Constitution (R.F., at para. 95; see also 2021 YKCA 5, 495 C.R.R. (2d) 98, at paras. 156-57).\n[322] Indigenous legal orders do not stand separate and apart from Canadian law; they form an integral part of it (Mitchell, at paras. 10-11; Pastion v. Dene Tha\u2019 First Nation, 2018 FC 648, [2018] 4 F.C.R. 467, at para. 8). This does not, however, immunize Indigenous governments from the responsibility of respecting the individual rights and freedoms articulated in the Charter (see I.F., Canadian Constitution Foundation). In effect, the Charter establishes a \u201cfloor\u201d of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms that must be respected by all governments, subject to the interpretive function performed by s. 25 when collective Indigenous rights are implicated.\n[323] Nothing prevents Indigenous governments from protecting rights or interpreting them. Indigenous courts \u2014 including the Vuntut Gwitchin Court (which has yet to be established) \u2014 will have a meaningful role to play (see VGFN Constitution, Article XV; C.A. reasons, at paras. 23 and 25). The Constitution Act, 1982, which includes the Charter, is a pluralist document that is capable of incorporating and reflecting Indigenous and non-Indigenous perspectives alike. The living tree interpretive doctrine ensures that these perspectives can be built upon in the future. Professor Borrows writes that the dialectical interaction of traditional Indigenous practices and the Charter created a productive cultural exchange during constitutional conferences and invigorated equality movements within Indigenous communities. We agree that \u201c[t]he process of injecting new understandings into customary ancient practices is very much in agreement with the cyclical world\u2011view of many First Nations people and follows the culturally reproductive patterns of oral tradition\u201d ((1994), at pp. 31-33 (footnote omitted)).\n[324] The Charter and Indigenous peoples\u2019 right to self-determination can peacefully co-exist (I.F., Band Members Alliance and Advocacy Association of Canada). Our understanding of constitutional rights such as equality both consists of universally applicable animating norms and is coloured by relevant context. There is no doubt that the proliferation of Indigenous rights instruments and greater activity by Indigenous courts will shape other courts\u2019 understanding of the context in which Charter protections are engaged. Courts must learn from each other to give effect to individual rights, in whatever form, in their proper context.\nB. Rights Within the Scope of Section 25\n[325] Section 25 protects Aboriginal rights, treaty rights and \u201cother rights or freedoms that pertain to the aboriginal peoples of Canada\u201d. We agree with Kasirer and Jamal JJ. that the rights within the scope of s. 25 are not restricted to those that have \u201cconstitutional status\u201d (para. 149). However, Kasirer and Jamal JJ. also conclude that an \u201cother\u201d right will fall within the ambit of s. 25 when the party seeking to rely on it establishes that the \u201cright protects or recognizes Indigenous difference\u201d (para. 150). In our view, this formulation is too broad, especially when considered in the context of Indigenous self-government.\n[326] The scope of protection afforded by s. 25 is \u201cbounded by [its] purposes\u201d (R. v. Poulin, 2019 SCC 47, [2019] 3 S.C.R. 566, at para. 54; see also Chagnon v. Syndicat de la fonction publique et parapublique du Qu\u00e9bec, 2018 SCC 39, [2018] 2 S.C.R. 687, at para. 27). This Court must be mindful not to overshoot the provision\u2019s underlying objectives (see 9147-0732 Qu\u00e9bec inc., at para. 10).\n[327] While the protection of Indigenous difference is undoubtedly an objective of s. 25, as we have explained, the provision\u2019s purpose is to protect certain collective rights that Indigenous peoples uniquely hold because they are Indigenous (see Kapp, at para. 103). There is a parallel in this regard with the rights recognized and affirmed by s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982; the rights within the scope of both provisions are held only by Indigenous peoples and arise from their Indigenous identity (see Van der Peet, at para. 19; Newfoundland and Labrador (Attorney General) v. Uashaunnuat (Innu of Uashat and of Mani\u2011Utenam), 2020 SCC 4, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 15, at para. 207, per Brown and Rowe JJ., dissenting). These rights are intrinsically linked to the distinctive, collective, and cultural identity of an Indigenous community.\n[328] It is not enough, in our view, for a right to relate to Indigenous peoples to bring it within the scope of s. 25 (see Corbiere v. Canada (Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 203, at para. 52, per L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9 J., concurring). We similarly view it as insufficient to attract the protection of s. 25, in the context of self-government, for an Indigenous nation to possess broad rights to govern its community. Not everything that Indigenous governments do represents the exercise of a unique collective right stemming from the community\u2019s distinctive culture. Self-governing Indigenous nations often govern in a manner no different than any other governmental entity.\n[329] Accordingly, in the context of Indigenous self-government, intra-group distinctions will generally fall outside the ambit of s. 25, including laws that distinguish between members of the Indigenous community on the basis of personal grounds such as age, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, or disability, to name a few. Professor Patrick Macklem explains that a broad interpretation of s. 25 \u201cin the context of an internal restriction potentially sacrifices the interests of less powerful members of Aboriginal societies, in cases where the restriction may entail serious deleterious consequences to certain members and may bear only a loose relation to interests associated with indigenous difference\u201d (Indigenous Difference and the Constitution of Canada (2001), at p. 226 (emphasis added); see also I.F., Congress of Aboriginal Peoples, at para. 18). Even though an Indigenous government may seek to justify such laws on cultural grounds, they are usually not aimed at recognizing the special status of Indigenous collectives within the broader Canadian state. Therefore, Indigenous governments that enact legislation drawing internal distinctions on the basis of personal characteristics unrelated to Indigenous identity will generally \u201cbe required to satisfy the Oakes test to resist a challenge\u201d when an infringement of s. 15(1) of the Charter has been made out (Kapp, at para. 99, per Bastarache J.; see also Macklem, at pp. 226\u201127).\n[330] Conversely, s. 25 could capture \u201claws that distinguish between Aboriginal people and non-Aboriginal people for the purpose of protecting interests associated with indigenous difference\u201d (Macklem, at p. 225). Such laws can empower an Indigenous community \u201cagainst threats posed to its difference by the larger society in which it is located\u201d (p. 225 (footnote omitted)). For example, Kapp is precisely the type of case where the implicated collective Indigenous right would fit within the purpose of s. 25. Kapp concerned a federal program granting a special communal fishing licence to three Indigenous bands. The licence conferred the exclusive right to fish for salmon in the mouth of the Fraser River for a 24-hour period. A group of mainly non-Indigenous commercial fishers brought a s. 15(1) claim, alleging that the licence discriminated on the basis of race. In his concurring reasons concluding that s. 25 applied, Bastarache J. recognized that the licence was a unique right possessed by the Indigenous peoples to whom it was granted. He noted the unique relationship between the fishery and the British Columbia Indigenous communities (para. 119); in other words, the right was held by the Indigenous peoples because they were Indigenous. Therefore, in Bastarache J.\u2019s view, s. 25 could be relied upon to resist a Charter claim brought by external, non-Indigenous litigants.\n[331] Section 25 was not intended to create Charter-free zones. As Bastarache J. observed in Kapp, at para. 99:\nThere is no reason to believe that s. 25 has taken Aboriginals out of the Charter protection scheme. . . . It is not at all obvious in my view that it is necessary to constrain the individual rights of Aboriginals in order to recognize collective rights under s. 25 . . . .\nWe are concerned, however, that Kasirer and Jamal JJ.\u2019s broad interpretation of the rights within the scope of s. 25 may yield or justify this result. Members of Indigenous communities must be able to challenge the actions of their own governments.\n[332] Justices Kasirer and Jamal conclude that the VGFN\u2019s enactment of the residency requirement is the exercise of a right protected by s. 25. In reaching this conclusion, they explain why they believe the residency requirement in this case is associated with Indigenous difference:\nRequiring VGFN leaders to reside on settlement land helps preserve the leaders\u2019 connection to the land, which is deeply rooted in the VGFN\u2019s distinctive culture and governance practices. The residency requirement promotes the VGFN\u2019s expectation that its leaders will be able to maintain ongoing personal interactions between leaders and other community members. It also bolsters the VGFN\u2019s ability to resist the outside forces that pull citizens away from its settlement land and prevents erosion of its important connection with the land. Such interests are associated with various aspects of Indigenous difference, including Vuntut Gwitchin cultural difference and prior sovereignty, as well as their participation in the treaty process that culminated in the enactment of the VGFN Constitution. [para. 217]\nWe dispute none of these observations, but suggest that such considerations are more appropriately considered as part of a s. 1 analysis, in which an Indigenous government would seek to justify a prima facie infringement of an individual Charter right on the basis of pressing collective interests, rather than as a reason why Charter rights do not apply at all.\n[333] Further, and importantly, there is a host of reasons a self-governing Indigenous nation may proffer to justify the enactment of any particular law, and only some of them would relate to or recognize Indigenous difference. It is unremarkable that a government would legislate in a manner attuned to the unique circumstances of its constituency or seek to justify its actions based on its view of the community\u2019s history, laws, customs, and practices. However, not all members of the collective may share the government\u2019s assessment of the community\u2019s history, laws, customs, and practices. Indeed, such matters are often deeply contested and are the subject of the very type of disputes that are likely to give rise to rights-based challenges, whether under the Canadian Charter or the nation\u2019s own constitutional documents.\n[334] In our view, the \u201cIndigenous difference\u201d criterion does not serve a meaningful filtering function here. The focus must be on the collective right itself and whether it is unique to an Indigenous community on the basis of Indigeneity, not the justification for why an Indigenous nation exercised its self-government powers in a certain way. If all that is required to attract the protective effect of s. 25 is for an Indigenous nation to have broad self-government powers, and exercise those powers in a manner that is expressly linked to some aspect of Indigenous difference, the result will be broad immunity for Indigenous governments from Charter compliance. By definition, there will always be a link to Indigeneity when an Indigenous government acts, but that constant cannot meet the standard of an Aboriginal, treaty or other right under s. 25.\n[335] We offer two hypothetical examples to make the point that not every act by an Indigenous government should merit exemption from Charter scrutiny under s. 25. First, assume a self-governing Indigenous nation was concerned with an unacceptable level of drug and alcohol use in the community \u2014 which it tied to the legacy of colonialism and systemic mistreatment by the Canadian state. In the collective interest, it authorized law enforcement to conduct random, warrantless searches of citizens and residences as a proactive measure to ensure the community was \u201cdry\u201d or that the supply of intoxicating substances was limited. Would recourse under s. 8 of the Charter be denied on the basis that the state action recognized Indigenous difference \u2014 or, more precisely, the unique or different position of that Indigenous community?\n[336] Second, what if instead of a residency-based restriction, as in the case at bar, the court were dealing with a similar exclusionary electoral rule which barred 2SLGBTQI+ individuals or persons with disabilities from being eligible to serve on council. Could such provisions be shielded from Charter scrutiny based on evidence of a community\u2019s history, laws, traditions, and practices? There is a real risk under this approach of rendering \u201csacrosanct\u201d \u2014 in the sense of not being subject to a justificatory standard when a prima facie rights infringement occurs \u2014 \u201cany enactment . . . no matter how odious the provision at issue may be\u201d (Peavine M\u00e9tis Settlement v. Alberta (Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development), 2009 ABCA 239, 310 D.L.R. (4th) 519, at para. 73, rev\u2019d on other grounds 2011 SCC 37, [2011] 2 S.C.R. 670). We raise these questions to illustrate that using a broad conception of \u201cIndigenous difference\u201d as a filtering mechanism at the rights recognition stage could be tantamount to sanctioning Charter-free zones and denying Indigenous people important Charter protections which are intended to apply to every person.\n[337] In our view, a more precise conception of the provision\u2019s purpose leads to the conclusion that rights within the scope of s. 25 are limited to those that are truly unique to Indigenous peoples because they are Indigenous. In the context of Indigenous self-government, laws creating intra-group distinctions on the basis of a personal characteristic other than Indigeneity will generally not fall within s. 25\u2019s ambit.\nC. Summary of the Operation and Scope of Section 25\n[338] When s. 25 is invoked, the court must consider several issues to decide whether it applies. First, the claimant must demonstrate a breach of a Charter right or freedom. Second, the party relying on s. 25 must show that the implicated collective right or freedom at stake is an Aboriginal, treaty or other right or freedom \u201cthat pertain[s] to the aboriginal peoples of Canada\u201d, such that it is unique to an Indigenous community on the basis of Indigeneity. Third, the court must attempt to reconcile the competing collective and individual rights where possible. In R. v. N.S., 2012 SCC 72, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 726, at para. 32, the majority considered that in a case involving competing rights, courts should strive to resolve claims \u201cin a way that will preserve both rights\u201d. Ideally, the court would arrive at an interpretation that respects both rights and averts a conflict between them.\n[339] Where there is a true conflict, s. 25 directs the court to construe the individual Charter right so as to not abrogate or derogate from the right protected by s. 25. In our view, it is at this point that a form of balancing must occur to reconcile the competing interests at play. Not just any incursion into the sphere covered by a s. 25 right will constitute abrogation or derogation within the meaning of the provision. We accept two limitations proposed by interveners that naturally flow from interpreting s. 25 purposively.\n[340] First, s. 25 will not afford primacy to the collective Indigenous right when giving effect to an individual Charter right would impact the collective right in a minor or incidental way (see I.F., A.G. Alberta, at para. 35).\n[341] Second, it is appropriate to restrict the application of s. 25 to situations where a party relying on the provision shows that the impugned exercise of the collective Indigenous right is necessary to the maintenance of the Indigenous community\u2019s distinctive culture (see I.F., A.G. Canada, at paras. 48-53). This limitation accords with the purpose of s. 25 of protecting the unique rights held by Indigenous peoples, which are intrinsically linked to their distinctive cultural and collective identities. Moreover, as the Attorney General of Canada points out, a necessity test is consistent with this Court\u2019s approach to determining the scope of other protections that can compete with individual Charter rights (see Chagnon, at paras. 27\u201128 (parliamentary privilege); Canada (House of Commons) v. Vaid, 2005 SCC 30, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 667, at para. 41 (parliamentary privilege); Alberta (Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development) v. Cunningham, 2011 SCC 37, [2011] 2 S.C.R. 670, at para. 45 (ameliorative programs); Kapp, at para. 52 (ameliorative programs); Adler v. Ontario, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 609, at para. 49 (denominational schools)). It is critical that a necessity assessment be informed by Indigenous perspectives (see Corbiere, at paras. 54 and 67, per L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9 J.). In making this assessment, it may be relevant to consider whether the Charter challenge is brought by a member of the Indigenous community or an external party, as this may shed light on the necessity issue.\n[342] Both limitations on what constitutes an abrogation or derogation from a s. 25 right incorporate a balance between collective Indigenous rights and individual Charter rights. They serve to avoid situations where an insignificant incursion on a collective right within the scope of s. 25 takes primacy over a potentially significant Charter violation.\n[343] In summary, s. 25 prescribes an interpretive exercise to resolve challenges posed by competing collective Indigenous rights and individual Charter rights. The court must interpret both rights to determine whether both can be preserved. If this is not possible, the court must assess whether giving effect to an individual Charter right would impact the collective right in more than a minor or incidental way, and whether the impugned exercise of the collective right is necessary to the maintenance of the Indigenous community\u2019s distinctive culture. Only then could the exercise of a collective Indigenous right justify an impact on individual Charter rights. It is therefore inapt to characterize s. 25 as a shield that ousts any interpretive role, balancing, or reconciliation of competing interests.\nIV. Application of Sections 15(1) and 25 to This Case\n[344] As the VGFN relies on s. 25 in relation to the residency requirement, the first question is whether Ms. Dickson\u2019s right to equality guaranteed by s. 15(1) of the Charter is infringed.\nA. Is There a Section 15(1) Infringement?\n[345] Section 15(1) of the Charter provides that \u201c[e]very individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.\u201d Like other rights\u2011conferring Charter provisions, it must be read broadly and purposively (Hunter, at pp. 155-56).\n[346] This Court has consistently characterized the guarantee of equality as substantive. Substantive equality recognizes that \u201cpersistent systemic disadvantages have operated to limit the opportunities available to members of certain groups in society and seeks to prevent conduct that perpetuates those disadvantages\u201d (Kahkewistahaw First Nation v. Taypotat, 2015 SCC 30, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 548, at para. 17). The current test was developed in Quebec (Attorney General) v. Alliance du personnel professionnel et technique de la sant\u00e9 et des services sociaux, 2018 SCC 17, [2018] 1 S.C.R. 464, and reaffirmed in Fraser and Sharma.\n[347] To succeed under s. 15(1), a claimant must show that the law or state action: (1) on its face or in its impact, creates a distinction based on enumerated or analogous grounds; and (2) imposes burdens or denies a benefit in a manner that has the effect of reinforcing, perpetuating, or exacerbating disadvantage (Fraser, at para. 27; Sharma, at para. 28).\n(1) Step One: Establishing a Distinction Based on a Protected Ground\n[348] A law can create a distinction in two ways. When it does so directly, it is an example of direct discrimination. A challenged law can also create a distinction indirectly, in its impact. This is an example of adverse effects discrimination. Rather than creating a distinction on its face, the distinction arises by having a disproportionately adverse impact on a particular group (Fraser, at para. 30).\n[349] The evidence required to establish a distinction varies with context (Withler, at para. 37). When a law creates a facial distinction, the test can be satisfied by simply reading the relevant text. In contrast, claimants in \u201cadverse impact\u201d cases will generally \u201chave more work to do\u201d (Sharma, at para. 189, per Karakatsanis J., dissenting, citing Withler, at para. 64). Regardless of context, \u201ca court\u2019s focus must ultimately be directed to the test\u201d (Sharma, at para. 38 (emphasis in original)). The test makes clear that the first step only requires a distinction \u201cbased on a protected ground\u201d (Fraser, at para. 50 (emphasis added)).\n[350] Once the claimant establishes that the challenged law creates a distinction, on its face or in its impact, the claimant must establish that the distinction is on the basis of an enumerated or analogous ground. The Corbiere case remains this Court\u2019s most comprehensive assessment of analogous grounds. Corbiere articulated that the common feature of the personal characteristics identified in the enumerated grounds, and thus the defining feature to be used in identifying analogous grounds, is immutability. For a personal characteristic to be immutable, and therefore recognized as an analogous ground, it must be either actually immutable or changeable only at an unacceptable cost to personal identity (para. 13). In Corbiere, the Court found that s. 77 of the Indian Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I\u20115, which disqualified off-reserve members from voting in any band election, violated s. 15(1) of the Charter. In doing so, it affirmed that being an off-reserve band member is an analogous ground of discrimination.\n[351] In Corbiere, McLachlin and Bastarache JJ., writing jointly for the majority, also clarified that once a personal characteristic is recognized as an analogous ground, it will serve as an analogous ground in all contexts. Protected grounds do not vary with context; they stand as \u201cconstant markers of suspect decision making or potential discrimination\u201d and it is only \u201cwhether they amount to discrimination in the particular circumstances of the case\u201d that varies (para. 8).\n(a) Application\n(i) The Residency Requirement Creates a Distinction\n[352] The residency requirement creates a distinction directly, on its face, based on whether a VGFN citizen lives on or off the VGFN\u2019s settlement land. The distinction is \u201capparent and immediate\u201d (Taypotat, at para. 33; Fraser, at para. 61) and is conceded by the VGFN (R.F., at para. 130).\n(ii) The Aboriginality-Residence Ground Applies\n[353] The VGFN argues that although a distinction exists, the analogous ground of Aboriginality-residence does not apply outside of the Indian Act context. It submits that the residency requirement creates a distinction based on residence only, which is not a protected ground (R.F., at para. 131, referring to R. v. Turpin, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1296, at p. 1333; Corbiere, at para. 13; Siemens v. Manitoba (Attorney General), 2003 SCC 3, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 6, at paras. 47-48; Canadian Snowbirds Association Inc. v. Ontario (Attorney General), 2020 ONSC 5652, 152 O.R. (3d) 738 (Div. Ct.), at para. 73). Given that other governments within Canada can impose a residency requirement for their governing bodies, there is no reason why it would be \u201cinherently suspect\u201d for the VGFN to do the same, \u201cbased on its own culture and tradition\u201d (R.F., at para. 150). The VGFN is not a \u201cband\u201d, it has never had a reserve, and its citizens are regulated by the VGFN Constitution. The residency requirement is not imposed by the Crown, but by VGFN citizens \u201cfreely and democratically exercising their inherent right to self-government\u201d (para. 143). To view the VGFN\u2019s citizens as \u201cband members\u201d, and to treat their settlement land as a \u201creserve\u201d, is to diminish the unique accomplishment of preserving and carrying out inherent self-government, outside of the \u201cdivisive and contradictory\u201d Indian Act framework (para. 144).\n[354] In response, Ms. Dickson argues that the VGFN\u2019s interpretation of Corbiere is overly narrow (R.F. on cross-appeal, at para. 48). It is irrelevant to the Indigenous person experiencing inequality whether the discriminatory distinction at issue was made by the federal government, her provincial or territorial government, or her own Indigenous government \u2014 be it an Indian Act band or a self-governing nation (para. 46). The root of Aboriginality-residence is the constructively immutable characteristic of having to choose \u201cwhether to live with other members of the band to which [one] belong[s], or apart from them\u201d, a choice that \u201crelates to a community and land that have particular social and cultural significance to many or most band members\u201d (para. 49, citing Corbiere, at para. 62, per L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9 J.). To accept the VGFN\u2019s argument that Aboriginality-residence only applies in the Indian Act context would be to endorse the view that this Court intended to provide equality protection to some Indigenous individuals but not others, even though all Indigenous peoples suffer the harmful impacts of Canada\u2019s assimilation and displacement policies.\n[355] As the factual circumstances in this case are meaningfully distinct from those in Corbiere, it is not sufficient for a court to \u201creflexively assume\u201d that Aboriginality-residence \u2014 \u201ca moniker that, on the surface, sounds fitting\u201d \u2014 is indeed relevant here (R.F., at para. 136). This Court must seriously consider whether the same \u201cinherently suspicious\u201d discriminatory tendencies that accompany \u201cAboriginality\u2011residence\u201d apply in this context. The analysis at the analogous grounds stage requires consideration of whether differential treatment of those defined by that characteristic or combination of traits has the potential to violate human dignity in the sense underlying s. 15(1) (Egan v. Canada, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 513, at para. 171, per Cory and Iacobucci JJ., dissenting; Corbiere, at para. 59, per L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9 J.).\n[356] The reserve system was created by the Indian Act and its history is rooted in a particular colonial project that cannot be equated with self-governing Indigenous nations. The creation of reserves served to restrict Indigenous people to specific territories, often on \u201cunproductive\u201d land (see Jack v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 294). The Indian Act effectively dictated Indigenous identity in Canada. Without Indian status and band membership, Indigenous people were not permitted to live on the reserve land assigned to their community. In this way, the Indian Act splintered relations between on- and off-reserve band members and alienated Indigenous people who could not prove patrilineal relation to members of their community (B. Lawrence, \u201cGender, Race, and the Regulation of Native Identity in Canada and the United States: An Overview\u201d (2003), 18:2 Hypatia 3, at pp. 6 and 20).\n[357] By contrast, the VGFN presently operates outside of the Indian Act. The VGFN participated in the 20-year negotiation process that led to the Umbrella Final Agreement, entered into in 1993. The Vuntut Gwitchin are a distinct sub-group of the Gwich\u2019in Nation. The Vuntut Gwitchin have governed themselves as a nation since time immemorial, long before British colonization (trial reasons, at para. 11). Their traditional territory includes a large portion of Northern Yukon and archeological evidence indicates this land has been occupied for up to 40,000 years.\n[358] Importantly, though the Vuntut Gwitchin way of life survived the imposition of the Indian Act, the Vuntut Gwitchin people were profoundly affected by colonial laws and policies, including the imposition of residential schools and resource development within Vuntut Gwitchin territory. Though the Vuntut Gwitchin were able to retain their culture and land-based way of life, \u201cthe pressures of cultural assimilation and displacement persist on the Vuntut Gwitchin as a minority group in Canada\u201d (trial reasons, at para. 13).\n[359] While this Court has never extended the Aboriginality-residence ground outside of the Indian Act, the Federal Court has applied Aboriginality-residence to s. 15(1) cases where councils are chosen in accordance with band customs (R.F. on cross-appeal, at para. 58; see Cockerill v. Fort McMurray First Nation No. 468, 2010 FC 337, 218 C.R.R. (2d) 127 (sub nom. Woodward v. Council of the Fort McMurray), at paras. 28-29 and 33; Thompson v. Leq\u2019\u00e1:mel First Nation Council, 2007 FC 707, 284 D.L.R. (4th) 80, at paras. 8 and 13; Clifton v. Hartley Bay Indian Band, 2005 FC 1030, [2006] 2 F.C.R. 24, at paras. 44-45 and 50; Cardinal v. Bigstone Cree Nation, 2018 FC 822, [2019] 1 F.C.R. 3, at paras. 48 and 51).\n[360] Aboriginality-residence is different from other forms of residence because of the unique tie between Indigenous peoples and their land base or ancestral territory. As was explained by the Royal Commission:\nCultural identity for urban Aboriginal people is also tied to a land base or ancestral territory. For many, the two concepts are inseparable. . . .\n. . .\nIdentification with an ancestral place is important to urban people because of the associated ritual, ceremony and traditions, as well as the people who remain there, the sense of belonging, the bond to an ancestral community, and the accessibility of family, community and elders.\n(Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, vol. 4, Perspectives and Realities, at p. 525; see also vol. 1, ch. 6.)\n[361] In Archibald v. Canada, [2000] 4 F.C. 479, the Federal Court of Appeal considered whether the compulsory pooling provision of the Canadian Wheat Board Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-24, which requires wheat producers living in certain areas of Canada to sell all their wheat to the Canadian Wheat Board and prohibits them from selling in another province or outside of Canada, violated the appellants\u2019 Charter rights. Justice Rothstein was not persuaded that place of residence was an analogous ground. In applying Corbiere to the case before him, he stated, at para. 23:\nCorbiere implies that residence must be linked to something else that is fundamental to one\u2019s identity, that is immutable, or is at least constructively immutable. Thus, it is insufficient for purposes of identifying an analogous ground that the location of an individual\u2019s residence and farm is within the designated area or, indeed, at any place in Canada. Something more is needed. [Emphasis added.]\n[362] Unlike the circumstances of Archibald, the place of residence of VGFN citizens goes to the essence of their identities (Chippewas of Nawash First Nation v. Canada (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans), 2002 FCA 485, [2003] 3 F.C. 233, at para. 40). The \u201csomething else\u201d is the connection VGFN citizens have with their particular traditional territory, which militates against any group member leaving their community for an urban centre. As a result, \u201cthis characteristic is no less constructively immutable than religion or citizenship\u201d (Chippewas, at para. 40).\n[363] Due to the legacy of the Indian Act, some VGFN citizens are forced to make the challenging decision of whether to live proximate to other members of their community or jeopardize certain opportunities, including access to appropriate housing, social services, education, and employment. The \u201cchoice\u201d to live outside their traditional territory puts them at risk of having their interests overlooked or having their views underrepresented within political spheres of power (see Corbiere, at para. 62, per L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9 J.). While the context of off-reserve band members is not identical to that of Vuntut Gwitchin citizens living outside their traditional territory, the legacy of colonialism through the Indian Act is a common thread that connects the two groups, such that the analogous ground of \u201cAboriginality-residence\u201d remains applicable in the instant case. Though the VGFN is no longer subject to the Indian Act, the discrimination faced by Indigenous people living away from their communities as identified in Corbiere continues to be experienced by VGFN citizens and was not erased when the VGFN entered into a self\u2011government agreement (para. 62). We therefore agree with Ms. Dickson that the analogous ground of \u201cAboriginality-residence\u201d applies here.\n(2) Step Two: Establishing Discrimination\n[364] Under the second step of s. 15(1), a claimant must establish that the distinction imposes a burden or denies a benefit in a discriminatory manner.\n[365] The requirement that a challenged law create a distinction that imposes a burden or denies a benefit operates to weed out s. 15(1) challenges involving distinctions that do not have a negative impact on the claimant. If the distinction created by the law has a \u201cbeneficial or benign\u201d impact on the claimant, the s. 15(1) claim will fail (Quebec (Attorney General) v. A, 2013 SCC 5, [2013] 1 S.C.R. 61, at para. 151, per LeBel J., citing Gosselin v. Quebec (Attorney General), 2002 SCC 84, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 429, at para. 243, per Bastarache J., dissenting; see also Withler, at para. 37).\n[366] Further, the distinction is discriminatory only if it reinforces, perpetuates or exacerbates disadvantage. This involves a search for disadvantage that exists independently of \u2014 and that is reinforced, perpetuated or exacerbated by \u2014 the impugned distinction. It requires an examination of the historical or systemic disadvantage of the claimant group (Sharma, at para. 52; Fraser, at para. 76). Disadvantage is not restricted to economic disadvantage, but includes other forms of disadvantage, like social exclusion, physical and psychological harm, and political exclusion (Sharma, at para. 52; Fraser, at para. 76, citing C. Sheppard, Inclusive Equality: The Relational Dimensions of Systemic Discrimination in Canada (2010), at pp. 62-63). While disadvantage is the focus of the discrimination requirement, prejudice and stereotyping can satisfy the disadvantage requirement (Sharma, at para. 53; Fraser, at para. 78).\n(a) Role of Legislative Context\n[367] Charter claims must be examined contextually. However, only context that is relevant and necessary for the s. 15(1) analysis, where the burden of proof falls on the claimant, should be considered at this stage: \u201cThe fault line of the division between s. 15(1) and s. 1 is justification, which falls to the state\u201d (Sharma, at para. 202, per Karakatsanis J., dissenting). The s. 15(1) test only requires claimants to show that the impugned law or state action has a discriminatory impact on them (Miron v. Trudel, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 418, at para. 139; Fraser, at para. 79).\n[368] Legislative context will sometimes be relevant and necessary to the claimant meeting their burden. \u201c[T]he full context of the claimant group\u2019s situation and the actual impact of the law on that situation\u201d must be considered under s. 15(1) (Sharma, at para. 57, citing Withler, at para. 43; see also Withler, at para. 40; Turpin, at p. 1334; Law v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 497, at para. 30; Quebec v. A, at para. 51; Taypotat, at para. 18; Ontario (Attorney General) v. G, 2020 SCC 38, [2020] 3 S.C.R. 629, at para. 43). In Corbiere, the claimant had the burden to establish that \u201cthe powers of electors or the chief and council they vote for\u201d affected more than \u201cpurely local\u201d issues (para. 74, per L\u2019Heureux\u2011Dub\u00e9 J.). The Court found that although some of the matters dealt with by the band council, such as law enforcement and traffic control, affected only the residents of the reserve, many other matters affected all band members. Policies and spending on \u201ceducation, creation of new housing, creation of facilities on reserves, and other matters that may affect off-reserve band members\u2019 economic interest\u201d concerned band members wherever they lived (para. 77). The voting restrictions affected interests unrelated to residence, and thus were ultimately found to be discriminatory (paras. 73-78 and 92). It appropriately fell to the claimants to demonstrate how the band\u2019s policies affected them in a discriminatory manner.\n[369] In Sharma, a majority of the Court detailed relevant considerations in assessing the legislative context: \u201c. . . the objects of the scheme, whether a policy is designed to benefit a number of different groups, the allocation of resources, particular policy goals sought to be achieved, and whether the lines are drawn mindful as to those factors . . .\u201d (para. 59, referring to Withler, at para. 67). However, \u201ccontext must not be confused with [the] justification\u201d required under s. 1 (R. v. C.P., 2021 SCC 19, [2021] 1 S.C.R. 679, at para. 57, per Abella J.). While some or all of these considerations may be relevant under s. 15(1), \u201ca court\u2019s focus must ultimately be directed to the test\u201d (Sharma, at para. 38 (emphasis in original)). A claimant\u2019s burden is to show that \u201cthe impugned law or state action has a discriminatory impact on the disadvantaged group\u201d (para. 202, per Karakatsanis J., dissenting, citing Miron, at para. 139; see also Fraser, at para. 79). Unless these considerations go to \u201cthe full context of the claimant group\u2019s situation\u201d or to \u201cthe actual impact of the law on that situation\u201d (Withler, at para. 43), legislative context is best left to the justification stage. Only the governing body has a deep understanding of its policy choices and legislative goals, and the burden should appropriately fall on it to explain this under s. 1. Keeping rights distinct from their limitations promotes clarity and purposive Charter protection.\n(b) Application\n(i) The Distinction Denies a Benefit\n[370] First, the claimant must establish that the distinction denies a benefit or imposes a burden. The residency requirement denies Ms. Dickson the benefit of serving in government. This is a form of political exclusion (Sharma, at para. 52; Fraser, at para. 76, citing Sheppard, at pp. 62\u201163) that bars Ms. Dickson from a core aspect of democratic participation and the opportunity to affect decision-making processes that impact her.\n[371] We agree with Ms. Dickson that \u201c[t]he right to run for, and serve, in office is a defining feature of democracy\u201d and \u201ca pillar of democratic governments, protected in both s. 3 of the Charter and Article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It is not a \u2018narrow\u2019 right but a fundamental political right, and its denial is severe\u201d (R.F. on cross-appeal, at para. 68, citing Reference re Secession of Quebec, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 217, at para. 65; Frank v. Canada (Attorney General), 2019 SCC 1, [2019] 1 S.C.R. 3, at para. 82; Sauv\u00e9 v. Canada (Chief Electoral Officer), 2002 SCC 68, [2002] 3 S.C.R. 519, at para. 59; Harvey v. New Brunswick (Attorney General), [1996] 2 S.C.R. 876, at paras. 23-30). The residency requirement satisfies the requirement that the distinction deny a benefit.\n(ii) The Benefit Is Denied in a Discriminatory Manner\n[372] Second, the claimant must establish that the distinction that imposes the burden or denies the benefit is discriminatory. A benefit is discriminatory if it reinforces, perpetuates or exacerbates the disadvantage. This step involves examining the historical or systemic disadvantage of the claimant group. Evidence of the \u201csituation of the claimant group\u201d and the \u201cphysical, social, cultural or other barriers\u201d its members face, and evidence \u201cabout the outcomes that the impugned law or policy . . . has produced in practice\u201d is particularly helpful (Fraser, at paras. 55-59; Sharma, at para. 192, per Karakatsanis J., dissenting).\n[373] While a challenged law may satisfy this step by widening a group\u2019s relative disadvantage, the term \u201cperpetuate\u201d indicates that a law may discriminate even if it does not aggravate the disadvantage. \u201cCare must be taken not to disregard how discrimination can result from \u2018continuing to do things \u00ab the way they have always been done \u00bb\u2019\u201d (Sharma, at para. 193, per Karakatsanis J., dissenting, citing F. Faraday, \u201cOne Step Forward, Two Steps Back? Substantive Equality, Systemic Discrimination and Pay Equity at the Supreme Court of Canada\u201d (2020), 94 S.C.L.R. (2d) 301, at p. 310; see also J. Koshan, \u201cIntersections and Roads Untravelled: Sex and Family Status in Fraser v Canada\u201d (2021), 30:2 Const. Forum 29, at pp. 31-32).\n[374] Ms. Dickson argues that the distinction created by the residency requirement \u201cperpetuates and reinforces the stereotype, observed in Corbiere and the cases that followed, that Indigenous citizens living outside their community are not interested in maintaining a meaningful connection with their nation and are less interested in the preservation of their land, sending the message they are less deserving members of the nation\u201d (R.F. on cross-appeal, at para. 65). Further, she submits that the residency requirement exacerbates her inability to maintain a connection to her community and to preserve her identity as a citizen of the VGFN.\n[375] We agree. For over a century, governments sought to encourage \u201cenfranchisement\u201d, or assimilation of Indigenous people into mainstream Canadian society. The increase in Indigenous people living away from their home territories is intricately tied to a legacy of discrimination. Indigenous people were encouraged to renounce their identity, and it is \u201c[a]s a result of this history [that] a large number of off-reserve status Indians who are nominally members of First Nations have little or no connection to the reserves or to \u2018home\u2019 communities\u201d (I.F., Congress of Aboriginal Peoples, at para. 12). The unequal rights afforded to those living on- and off-reserve under the Indian Act, such as the exclusion of off-reserve band members from voting on band governance, splintered relations between those groups and in many cases permanently alienated off-reserve members from their communities. Historically, Canada has also enacted laws that deprived women of Indian status if they married non-status men. In 1985, Bill C-31, which became an Act to amend the Indian Act, S.C. 1985, c. 27, reversed this discriminatory policy and restored Indian status to many women and to some of their descendants. However, this led to an abrupt increase in the number of status Indian women living off-reserve (Corbiere, at paras. 30 and 85-86, per L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9 J.).\n[376] Indigenous people in urban centres \u201chave experienced racism, culture shock, and difficulty maintaining their identity in particular and serious ways\u201d (R.F. on cross-appeal, at para. 57, citing Corbiere, at para. 72, per L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9 J.; see also Royal Commission, vol. 4, at pp. 519-26). In 2019, the report issued by the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls found that, as a result of past government conduct, Indigenous women in urban areas are \u201calienated from their home communities, sometimes as single parents and sole providers for their children\u201d and are \u201coften hundreds of kilometres from their homes and social support systems, navigating racist barriers deeply embedded in urban services and experiences\u201d (Reclaiming Power and Place: The Final Report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, vol. 1a (2019), at p. 273; see also R.F. on cross-appeal, at para. 61).\n[377] Band members living off-reserve are a \u201cdiscrete and insular minority\u201d (Corbiere, at para. 71, per L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9 J.). The repercussions of colonial and assimilationist policies persist. Just like off-reserve band members, other Indigenous people who live outside of their home community are vulnerable to being viewed as \u201cless aboriginal\u201d than their counterparts living on traditional territories (I.F., Congress of Aboriginal Peoples, at para. 9, citing Lovelace v. Ontario, 2000 SCC 37, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 950, at paras. 71-72; Corbiere, at para. 18, per McLachlin and Bastarache JJ., and at paras. 71 and 92, per L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9 J.).\n[378] The residency requirement reinforces the stereotype that non-resident VGFN citizens are less worthy and entitled because they live off their traditional territory. The \u201cpowers of the band council . . . affect the interests and needs of both [on- and off-settlement land citizens]\u201d (Corbiere, at para. 74, per L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9 J.). By preventing Ms. Dickson and other VGFN citizens that live away from the settlement land from participating in government decision-making, the residency requirement at the very least perpetuates disadvantage. Direct evidence of this can be found in the record. VGFN citizens living outside of Old Crow, the only village on the settlement land, stated feeling as though they were not valued members of their community because of where they lived (A.R., vol. II, at pp. 22, 38 and 42). One citizen mentioned having inadequate access to information or decision-making, rendering it difficult for non\u2011residents to stay connected to the community (p. 22). Another citizen stated feeling \u201cdisconnected and forgotten\u201d because of where she lived, and that her views were not represented on council (p. 38). A third citizen stated that she feels it is more difficult for VGFN citizens who live outside of Old Crow to \u201cparticipate in the governance of our nation and maintain a connection to the nation\u201d (p. 42). By excluding non-resident citizens from meaningful democratic participation, the residency requirement reinforces the stereotype that to be \u201ctruly Aboriginal\u201d, one has to live on the reserve or the settlement land (Corbiere, at para. 71, per L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9 J.; Cardinal, at para. 54).\n[379] As observed in Corbiere (at para. 71 (emphasis added)), the Royal Commission noted that \u201c[d]ecision makers have not always considered the perspectives and needs of Aboriginal people living off reserves, particularly their Aboriginal identity and their desire for connection to their heritage and cultural roots\u201d (vol. 4, at p. 519). The right to vote, without ever being able to vote for someone who represents or understands the perspective of those who live away from the settlement land, is inadequate. Several cases from the Federal Court have similarly concluded that being able to vote is not a replacement for holding office as a council member. In Esquega v. Canada (Attorney General), 2007 FC 878, [2008] 1 F.C.R. 795, rev\u2019d on other grounds by 2008 FCA 182, [2009] 1 F.C.R. 448, the Federal Court found that the residency requirement in s. 75(1) of the Indian Act violated s. 15(1) of the Charter. Under the terms of this provision, \u201c[n]o person other than an elector who resides in an electoral section may be nominated for the office of councillor to represent that section on the council of the band.\u201d Relying on Corbiere, the Federal Court found that \u201cband members who live off-reserve have historically faced disadvantage as a result of legislation and policies designed to deny them the right to participate in band governance\u201d and that \u201c[s]uch legislation perpetuates the wrongful notion that band members who live off-reserve have no interest in participating in band governance and are therefore less worthy of doing so\u201d (para. 88). The court also found that off-reserve members \u201chold a fundamental interest in participating in band council and making decisions on behalf of their band\u201d (para. 91). The court concluded that s. 75(1) of the Indian Act discriminated \u201cagainst off-reserve members by prohibiting them from participating in the representative governance of their band through band council on the basis of their \u2018Aboriginality-residence\u2019 status\u201d (para. 92).\n[380] Similarly, in Joseph v. Dzawada\u2019enuxw (Tsawataineuk) First Nation Band Council, 2013 FC 974, [2014] 1 C.N.L.R. 149, the Dzawada\u2019enuxw (Tsawataineuk) First Nation\u2019s 2011 election code provided governing positions for both resident and non-resident band members. However, while three quarters of the band members were non-resident, three out of the four positions on council were not available to them, including the position of the Chair. The court noted that even if the non-resident members were represented in council deliberations by the non-resident councillor, \u201cwhen push comes to shove, that Councillor can be easily outvoted by the resident Councillors\u201d (para. 57). The court found that the distinction in the code created \u201ca disadvantage by perpetuating the stereotype that non-resident Band members have reduced ability or interest in contributing to Band governance\u201d and concluded that the restriction therefore violated s. 15(1) of the Charter (para. 58).\n[381] In this case, the residency requirement is not absolute. Non-residents can run for office, so long as they \u201crelocate to Settlement Land within 14 days after election day\u201d (VGFN Constitution, Article XI(2)). Any burden of relocating is mitigated by a four-year paid salary and Vuntut Gwitchin staff housing (R.F., at para. 157, citing trial reasons, at para. 156). The VGFN argues this relocation requirement means that \u201cthere is no exclusion from participation generally and there is not a \u2018total\u2019 exclusion from candidacy, but instead a limited effect only on those who are ultimately elected\u201d (R.F., at para. 157 (emphasis deleted)).\n[382] We agree with Ms. Dickson that requiring a non-resident citizen to relocate to the settlement land to participate in community governance means requiring a person to change a constructively immutable characteristic (R.F. on cross-appeal, at paras. 70\u201171). \u201cThis Court has consistently held that differential treatment can be discriminatory even if it is based on choices made by the affected individual or group\u201d (Fraser, at para. 86). Once it is accepted, as we have, that Aboriginality-residence is an analogous ground outside the reserve context, choice is no longer relevant as a matter of law (Fraser, at para. 91, citing Miron, at para. 153; see also J. Koshan and J. Watson Hamilton, Tugging at the Strands: Adverse Effects Discrimination and the Supreme Court Decision in Fraser, November 9, 2020 (online)). In Cardinal, the Federal Court struck down a requirement that elected councillors must relocate to the reserve within three months of being elected, finding that it perpetuates \u201cthe pre-existing disadvantage of the group it was intended to benefit\u201d and \u201cthe stereotype that only members on the reserve are able to decide the affairs of the band\u201d (paras. 58 and 65). Similarly, in the instant case, having found that there is a discriminatory distinction based on the analogous ground of Aboriginality-residence, Ms. Dickson\u2019s illusory choice to move back to the settlement land is no longer relevant under the s. 15(1) analysis. Asking Ms. Dickson to relocate once elected is to ask her to change a constructively immutable characteristic \u2014 akin to changing religion or citizenship. Relocating to Old Crow is not simply a matter of cost, and it is not sufficiently mitigated by the fact that VGFN councillors earn a salary or that housing will be arranged. As was recognized in Corbiere, claimants live apart from their home communities due to factors that are beyond their control such as \u201c[l]ack of land, what are often scarce job opportunities on reserves, and the need to go far from the community for schooling\u201d (para. 84, per L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9 J.). In Ms. Dickson\u2019s case, she cannot move primarily due to her son\u2019s medical condition (A.R., vol. II, at p. 63).\n[383] The distinction created by the residency requirement imposes a burden and denies a benefit to non-resident citizens like Ms. Dickson in a manner that has the effect of perpetuating the erroneous notion that citizens who do not live on the settlement land have no interest in and a reduced ability to participate in community governance. The distinction also reinforces the stereotype that non-resident citizens are less worthy to serve on the basis of where they live (Cardinal, at para. 52).\n[384] We therefore conclude that Ms. Dickson\u2019s right to equality guaranteed by s. 15(1) of the Charter is infringed by the VGFN\u2019s enactment of the residency requirement.\nB. Does the Residency Requirement Fall Within the Scope of Section 25?\n[385] The second question is whether s. 25 is engaged. Does this case implicate a collective Indigenous right within the scope of s. 25?\n[386] As we have explained, the rights within the scope of s. 25 are those that are unique to Indigenous peoples because they are Indigenous. Moreover, as s. 25 was not intended to create Charter-free zones, we agree with the Attorney General of Alberta\u2019s submission that a s. 25 right relating to self-government must be cast in terms of a \u201cright to impose a specific rule [or] law\u201d rather than a right to govern or regulate in general (I.F., at para. 73 (emphasis in original)). Otherwise, Charter protections could be minimized in relation to a broad range of inherently governmental action. Section 25 is narrower than that.\n[387] The VGFN has the right to regulate the composition of its governing bodies. Its ability to do so stems from a number of sources, including s. 8(1)(b) of the Yukon First Nations Self-Government Act (the constitution shall provide for the \u201ccomposition\u201d and \u201cmembership\u201d of the first nation\u2019s governing bodies), s. 24.5.1 of the VGFN Final Agreement (negotiations regarding the constitution may include the composition and structure of government institutions), and s. 10.1.2 of the VGFN Self-Government Agreement (the constitution shall establish governing bodies and provide for their \u201cpowers, duties, composition, membership and procedures\u201d).\n[388] But is a self-governing Indigenous nation\u2019s right to regulate the composition of its governing bodies a unique collective right, belonging to Indigenous peoples because they are Indigenous? We cannot say that it is.\n[389] There is growing recognition that Indigenous communities are law-makers, in addition to being rights-bearers. Self-government agreements, such as the Umbrella Final Agreement with Yukon First Nations and the VGFN Self-Government Agreement, are examples of this recognition. There is no doubt that Indigenous self-government, which for the VGFN has been a reality since time immemorial, is a means of recognizing and protecting Indigenous difference.\n[390] However, not everything that an Indigenous government does can be fairly said to be the exercise of a unique right tied to the community\u2019s collective identity. Many laws and actions of a self-governing Indigenous nation will be best characterized as simply governmental. There is nothing unique about governments \u2014 whether federal, provincial, territorial, municipal, or Indigenous \u2014 enacting laws concerning the composition of their governing bodies. All governments do so. Governments across Canada also impose residency requirements for service in legislatures and other governing bodies (see, e.g., Legislative Assembly Act, R.S.Y. 2002, c. 136, ss. 4 and 8, referentially incorporating the Elections Act, R.S.Y. 2002, c. 63, ss. 3(c) and 6; Legislative Assembly Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.10, s. 6; Local Authorities Election Act, R.S.A. 2000, c. L-21, s. 21). The VGFN is not unique in this regard. As Ms. Dickson notes, the residency requirement reflects the VGFN\u2019s \u201cadoption of a democratic system of governance\u201d (A.F., at para. 84).\n[391] The residency requirement draws an intra-group distinction on the basis of residency; it has the effect of excluding non-resident VGFN citizens like Ms. Dickson from a core aspect of democratic participation in their community. It is directed at the internal regulation of the VGFN and is not aimed at recognizing the special status of Indigenous collectives within the broader Canadian state. We are therefore not satisfied that the residency requirement constitutes the exercise of a right falling within the ambit of s. 25. As it infringes s. 15(1) of the Charter, it should be subject to a justification analysis under s. 1.\nC. In the Alternative, Does Section 25 Operate to Protect the Residency Requirement?\n[392] Alternatively, even if we were to share Kasirer and Jamal JJ.\u2019s view that the residency requirement constitutes the exercise of a right within the scope of s. 25, we would nevertheless conclude that s. 25 would not give primacy to the collective right in this case. Given this conclusion, the VGFN should bear the burden of justifying the residency requirement, which infringes s. 15(1) of the Charter, under s. 1.\n[393] We are not persuaded that the residency requirement \u2014 the impugned exercise of the collective Indigenous right \u2014 is necessary to the maintenance of the VGFN\u2019s distinctive culture. Ms. Dickson is an internal claimant seeking vindication of her individual Charter right in an attempt to participate in the collective governance of her community. This is not a case involving external forces seeking to undermine the VGFN\u2019s self-government rights broadly or, more specifically, its right to regulate the composition of its governing bodies.\n[394] Similarly, any impact on the VGFN\u2019s right to regulate the composition of its governing bodies that results from giving effect to Ms. Dickson\u2019s equality rights under the Charter would be minor. We agree with Ms. Dickson that the VGFN would be well positioned to enact a residency requirement that reflects the community\u2019s unique circumstances but does not fully bar the hundreds of citizens that live away from the settlement land from a core aspect of democratic participation. Respect for equality rights can co-exist with robust Indigenous self-government.\n[395] Accordingly, interpreting the competing rights in a manner that is respectful of the purpose of s. 25 reveals that giving effect to Ms. Dickson\u2019s Charter rights would not \u201cabrogate or derogate from any aboriginal, treaty or other rights or freedoms that pertain to the aboriginal peoples of Canada\u201d. Section 25 does not operate to give primacy to the residency requirement over individual Charter rights in this case.\nV. Section 1 of the Charter\n[396] Our conclusion that s. 25 does not apply in this case does not mean that Indigenous difference is an irrelevant consideration in assessing the Charter claim. On the contrary \u2014 it has a significant role to play in the s. 1 justification analysis. Courts must respectfully take into account the perspective of the Indigenous community at all analytical stages. Like all s. 1 analyses, the assessment is contextual. As Professor Macklem explains:\nBecause of the constitutional significance of indigenous difference, the judiciary ought to extend a wide margin of appreciation to Aboriginal forms of social and political organization when assessing the constitutionality of an internal restriction. Most Aboriginal nations in Canada, for example, place great emphasis on the interconnectedness of family and clan. Densely textured forms of social and political organization that reflect . . . the unique identity of an Aboriginal nation should not be dismantled through Charter litigation because they might appear to be foreign to Western norms of individualism. In the event of an infringement, an Aboriginal community should be required to justify the restriction in the name of indigenous difference by demonstrating its relevance to the community\u2019s past and future. [Emphasis added; footnote omitted; p. 226.]\n[397] Section 1 of the Charter permits a government entity to justify an infringement of an individual\u2019s Charter rights. To establish that the s. 15(1) infringement is justified in this case, the VGFN has the onus of demonstrating that the residency requirement furthers a pressing and substantial objective and that the means chosen to achieve it are proportionate to it (R. v. Oakes, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103, at pp. 138\u201139).\nA. Pressing and Substantial Objective\n[398] The residency requirement serves to advance the pressing and substantial objective of \u201cthe promotion and maintenance of self-governance and connection to the homelands\u201d (R.F., at para. 162). Requiring members of the governing body to reside on the settlement land fosters a real, substantial and present connection to the community. This facilitates the pursuit of meaningful and effective self-government by and for VGFN citizens, in the context of the cultural erosion that has occurred as a result of Crown policy (see R.F., at para. 169). We accept that the residency requirement was enacted for a pressing and substantial objective.\nB. Proportionality\n(1) Rational Connection\n[399] The question at the first step of the proportionality inquiry is whether the measure that has been adopted is rationally connected to the objective it was designed to achieve. Ms. Dickson argues that VGFN culture is enhanced by broad participation of citizens who are knowledgeable about VGFN land and traditions and possess leadership skills, regardless of where they live. As many VGFN citizens do not live on the settlement land, mandating a non-resident councillor would better represent the \u201cneeds and issues\u201d of the non-resident community (A.F., at para. 117, citing A.R., vol. VI, at p. 140). As such, the residency requirement is not rationally connected to its objectives.\n[400] The VGFN submits that as a self-governing Indigenous community with a legal order rooted in its traditional territory, it is critical and logical that elected leaders be connected to the territory by being physically present on those lands. Currently, non-resident citizens can participate in and influence band governance by voting, but governance positions are limited to local citizens. This limitation is necessary to maintain traditional place-based decision-making structures, including the VGFN\u2019s practice of deliberative assembly (R.F., at para. 170, citing A.R., vol. VI, at pp. 139\u201140; trial reasons, at para. 12). The Gwitchin traditions encapsulate particular attributes of leadership, including the ability to maintain enduring relationships with their people and with the land (C.A. reasons, at para. 115, citing S. M. Beairsto, Dinjii Kat Chih Ahaa: Gwich\u2019in Notions of Leadership (1999)).\n[401] We accept the VGFN\u2019s statement on the rationale of the residency requirement. Moreover, the requirement for residential connection of an elected representative to the relevant jurisdiction is consistently expressed in non-Indigenous electoral rules (Legislative Assembly Act (Yukon), ss. 4 and 8, referentially incorporating the Elections Act, ss. 3(c) and 6; Municipal Act, R.S.Y. 2002, c. 154, ss. 48(1)(c), 50(1) and 193.04(1)(a)(iii); trial reasons, at para. 209). Such a requirement is no less relevant in the context of Indigenous self-government. We therefore conclude that the residency requirement is rationally connected to its purposes.\n(2) Minimal Impairment\n[402] At the minimal impairment stage, the VGFN must show that the measure at issue impairs the Charter right as little as reasonably possible in furthering the legislative objective (RJR-MacDonald Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), [1995] 3 S.C.R. 199, at para. 160, per McLachlin J.; Oakes, at p. 139). To be minimally impairing, a measure must therefore be \u201ccarefully tailored\u201d (RJR-MacDonald, at para. 160; Mounted Police Association of Ontario v. Canada (Attorney General), 2015 SCC 1, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 3, at para. 149).\n[403] Under s. 1, the means chosen by governments to achieve an objective are accorded a degree of deference (C.P., at para. 179, per Kasirer J., concurring; Quebec v. A, at para. 439; RJR-MacDonald, at para. 160; Alberta v. Hutterian Brethren of Wilson Colony, 2009 SCC 37, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 567, at paras. 37 and 53). The need for courts to defer to governmental decision-making is even more acute in the context of a self-governing Indigenous nation such as the VGFN. Indigenous peoples must be given latitude \u201cto develop their cultures and societies in the way they see fit\u201d (see I.F., Band Members Alliance and Advocacy Association of Canada, at para. 23).\n[404] The residency requirement seeks to balance the legitimate competing social values of preserving the VGFN\u2019s collective identity and maximizing opportunities for VGFN citizens to participate in self-governance (R.F., at para. 172). While we accept that some distinction may be justified in order to protect the collective interests of citizens living on the settlement land, a minimally impairing measure must make at least some accommodation of the right to participate in community governance for non-resident citizens (see Corbiere, at para. 21; Esquega (FC), at para. 96; Clifton, at para. 17). As the majority noted in Hutterian Brethren, at para. 55 (emphasis deleted), at the minimal impairment stage, \u201cthe court need not be satisfied that the alternative would satisfy the [pressing and substantial] objective to exactly the same extent or degree as the impugned measure\u201d. The availability of alternative measures that would \u201cgive sufficient protection, in all the circumstances, to the government\u2019s goal\u201d should be considered (para. 55).\n[405] A majority of the Court in Corbiere found the restriction on voting, while rationally connected to the aim of the legislation, was not minimally impairing (para. 21). The Court could not accept that a complete denial of voting rights of band members living off-reserve was necessary to achieve the objective. A similar conclusion was reached in Esquega ((FC), at para. 96). Without any efforts to seek alternatives to an outright ban, the Federal Court found that preventing off-reserve band members from participating in a governing role does not minimally impair their equality rights (para. 95). While the VGFN\u2019s residency requirement is not a form of total political exclusion, as citizens living off-settlement retain their voting rights, it does exclude non-resident citizens from serving on council and therefore precludes them from a core aspect of democratic participation.\n[406] We are sensitive to the VGFN\u2019s argument that colonialism and decades of assimilationist policies have eroded the VGFN\u2019s land and culture to the point where the residency requirement is one of the few mechanisms available to preserve what remains. However, it is these same policies that have forced individuals like Ms. Dickson to live away from the settlement land. The residency requirement wholly bars non-resident citizens from serving on the VGFN\u2019s council despite this reality.\n[407] We also take account of the fact that successful candidates for a VGFN council position are able to access staff housing in Old Crow (trial reasons, at para. 44). Moreover, councillors receive a full-time salary during their term of office (paras. 44 and 156). We agree with the VGFN that these factors mitigate to some degree the burden associated with a non-resident having to move to the settlement land if elected (see R.F., at para. 172).\n[408] However, while affording a margin of appreciation to the VGFN is important, there is no evidence that the VGFN has sought any meaningful alternatives to the residency requirement itself. As we have explained above, obliging Ms. Dickson to change a constructively immutable characteristic in order to assume a council position is simply too invasive. As a result, we conclude that the residency requirement is not minimally impairing.\n[409] In the past, Ms. Dickson has asserted at a VGFN General Assembly gathering that a minimally restrictive rule would reserve one council seat for non-resident citizens (see A.F., at para. 119). While we would defer to the VGFN to modify its residency requirement in a manner it sees fit, some adjustment must be made to ensure that non-resident citizens\u2019 rights are impaired no more than is reasonably necessary.\n(3) Salutary and Deleterious Effects\n[410] Our conclusion that the residency requirement is not minimally impairing of Ms. Dickson\u2019s s. 15(1) Charter right is sufficient to conclude that it is not justified under s. 1. However, for the sake of completeness, we turn to the final step of the Oakes analysis.\n[411] At this stage, the court considers whether there is proportionality between the overall effects of the Charter-infringing measure and the legislative objective (Oakes, at p. 139; Hutterian Brethren, at paras. 72-73). As we note above, we accept the VGFN\u2019s position that the residency requirement furthers self-government by maintaining the connection of the VGFN\u2019s elected leaders to traditional territory. The rule ameliorates the effects of colonial dislocation of the Vuntut Gwitchin peoples from control over that territory (R.F., at para. 173).\n[412] However, the residency requirement mandates the political exclusion of non-resident citizens by denying them the ability to serve as an elected member of government. The ability to move back to the settlement land if elected is not a meaningful option for individuals like Ms. Dickson, who are displaced through no real choice of their own, and thus cannot be a mitigating consideration in these circumstances. As in Frank, this type of justification \u201cis based on a misinterpretation of the nature of the choice available to non-resident citizens and also, more fundamentally, distorts the proper approach to the justification of a Charter infringement\u201d (para. 81). The infringement of Ms. Dickson\u2019s Charter rights would not end if she resumed residence in Old Crow after becoming elected, and would not \u201cdetract from the harm done by an absolute prohibition\u201d on her ability as a non-resident to hold a position on council if elected (para. 81). While the residency requirement is not a complete bar to democratic participation given that non-residents retain the right to vote, it nonetheless represents a significant incursion (para. 81).\n[413] In our view, the VGFN has not shown that the benefits of the residency requirement outweigh the negative effects of the s. 15(1) breach at issue.\nVI. Conclusion\n[414] We would allow the appeal and dismiss the cross-appeal. The VGFN is a government by its very nature, and therefore its enactment of the residency requirement attracts Charter scrutiny pursuant to s. 32(1). Having undertaken that exercise, we conclude that the residency requirement infringes Ms. Dickson\u2019s right to equality guaranteed by s. 15(1) of the Charter.\n[415] Section 25 does not operate to give primacy to the collective Indigenous right in this case. The residency requirement is not aimed at recognizing the special status of Indigenous collectives within the broader Canadian state and therefore falls outside the ambit of s. 25 protection. Moreover, in any event, giving effect to Ms. Dickson\u2019s Charter rights would not abrogate or derogate from the VGFN\u2019s right to regulate the composition of its governing bodies in the sense contemplated by s. 25.\n[416] The residency requirement is not demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society pursuant to s. 1. It represents a total exclusion for VGFN citizens residing away from the settlement land from a core aspect of participation in the community\u2019s self-governance. It is neither minimally impairing of Ms. Dickson\u2019s s. 15(1) Charter right nor representative of an appropriate balance between its salutary and deleterious effects. We would therefore declare it to be of no force or effect.\nThe following are the reasons delivered by\nRowe J. \u2014\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nParagraph\nI. Overview\n417\nII.

Overview\n[417] Central to these reasons is the foundational premise that it is for Indigenous peoples to \u201cdefine themselves and to choose by what means to make their decisions, according to their own laws, customs and practices\u201d (R. v. Desautel, 2021 SCC 17, [2021] 1 S.C.R. 533, at para. 86).\n[418] This case concerns whether the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms applies to the internal governance choices of the Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation (\u201cVGFN\u201d), including on matters as fundamental as the residence of their elected leaders. The VGFN is a First Nation in northern Yukon that governs the affairs of the Vuntut Gwitchin pursuant to its own Constitution, which was enacted after agreements were reached with Canada and the Yukon in 1993 concerning Vuntut Gwitchin land claims and self-government. This Constitution sets out the governing bodies for VGFN citizens, including an elected Council. Pursuant to Article XI(2) of the VGFN Constitution, any candidate who is elected to the VGFN Council and does not reside on the VGFN\u2019s \u201cSettlement Land\u201d must relocate there within 14 days after election day (\u201cresidency requirement\u201d). Cindy Dickson is a VGFN citizen who resides in Whitehorse and wishes to run for a position on the VGFN Council but is unable to relocate to the Settlement Land due to caretaking commitments. She challenges the residency requirement on the basis that it violates her equality rights under s. 15(1) of the Charter.\n[419] In my view, the VGFN\u2019s enactment of the residency requirement in its Constitution is not subject to the Charter. In light of this conclusion, it is not necessary to address arguments concerning ss. 15(1) or 25 of the Charter. My reasons address and reject several arguments relating to the Charter\u2019s application.\n[420] First, the applicability of the Charter is determined under s. 32(1) of the Charter. Arguments made before this Court that seek to circumvent s. 32(1) by relying on other bases for Charter applicability are inconsistent with this Court\u2019s jurisprudence.\n[421] Second, arguments that seek to bring the VGFN or its activities within s. 32(1) on the basis that the VGFN is a government are contrary to the text of s. 32(1), its history and place within the structure of the Constitution Act, 1982, and this Court\u2019s jurisprudence on the provision\u2019s purpose and scope. This jurisprudence confirms that the Charter applies to the federal and provincial governments. The meaning of \u201cgovernment\u201d under s. 32(1) has been interpreted purposively so as to encompass the numerous manifestations of the federal and provincial governments, but other entities or their activities must exhibit a significant connection to one of those governments to fall within s. 32(1). Importantly, the rights of Indigenous peoples, including those relating to Indigenous governance, were dealt with separately in the Constitution Act, 1982, and their internal governance does not fall within the scope of the Charter unless there exists a significant connection to either the federal or a provincial government. While this connection may be present with band council structures imposed by the Indian Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-5, the same cannot be said for governance structures chosen by the Vuntut Gwitchin themselves, absent particular arrangements with the federal government or a provincial\/territorial government.\n[422] Third, the various arrangements between the VGFN and the federal and\/or Yukon governments do not satisfy the significant connection necessary to bring the VGFN or its enactment of the residency requirement within the scope of s. 32(1). The VGFN\u2019s governance structures and internal decisions are rooted in the Vuntut Gwitchin\u2019s own legal traditions and choices and do not attract Charter scrutiny under s. 32(1).\n[423] Fourth, imposing the Charter on the VGFN is not consistent with the objective of reconciliation and with the need to respect the ability and the right of the Vuntut Gwitchin to make decisions pursuant to their own laws, customs, and practices. This includes decisions about the adoption and amendment of protections for the rights and freedoms of VGFN citizens.\n[424] Finally, contrary to Ms. Dickson\u2019s submissions, the VGFN never agreed to adopt the protections set out in the Charter. Rather, the VGFN has enacted its own protections for the rights of its citizens, many of which mirror the Charter but are adjusted to its people\u2019s own laws, customs, and practices. The protections in the VGFN Constitution include protections for equality rights. Ms. Dickson\u2019s challenge to a provision of the VGFN Constitution must be addressed pursuant to the VGFN\u2019s own internal structures and processes.\n[425] Ultimately, this case is about whether, in crafting their own Constitution, the Vuntut Gwitchin can make their own choices about their affairs \u2014 including as to how they wish to protect fundamental rights and freedoms \u2014 or whether their choices are subject to judicial scrutiny under the Charter. I conclude that the choice is theirs. I would therefore dismiss Ms. Dickson\u2019s appeal and allow the VGFN\u2019s cross-appeal, on the basis that the Charter does not apply to the VGFN\u2019s enactment of the residency requirement.\nII. The Applicability of the Charter Is Determined Under Section 32(1)\n[426] The \u201cscope of the Charter\u2019s application is delineated by s. 32(1) of the Charter\u201d (Blencoe v. British Columbia (Human Rights Commission), 2000 SCC 44, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 307, at para. 32; see also RWDSU v. Dolphin Delivery Ltd., [1986] 2 S.C.R. 573, at pp. 598-99). Section 32(1) governs \u201cwho is subject to the burden of Charter rights, or, in other words, who is bound by the Charter\u201d (P. W. Hogg and W. K. Wright, Constitutional Law of Canada (5th ed. Supp.), at \u00a7 37:6 (emphasis in original)).\n[427] Ms. Dickson, the Attorney General of Alberta, and the Government of Yukon submit that, separate from s. 32(1), the Charter applies because the residency requirement in the VGFN Constitution is a \u201claw\u201d under s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982, which states that \u201cany law that is inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution is . . . of no force or effect\u201d. Implicit in their position is the assumption that s. 32(1) is not the only avenue for the Charter to apply and that it is enough to characterize the residency requirement as a \u201claw\u201d. This argument is inconsistent with this Court\u2019s jurisprudence.\n[428] Only when it has been determined that an entity or their activity is bound by the Charter under s. 32(1), and that it has violated the Charter, does the analysis turn to ss. 24 and 52(1), which govern the available remedies (Greater Vancouver Transportation Authority v. Canadian Federation of Students \u2014 British Columbia Component, 2009 SCC 31, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 295 (\u201cGVTA\u201d), at paras. 13 and 87). Notably, s. 52(1) \u201cprovides a remedy for laws that violate Charter rights either in purpose or in effect\u201d (R. v. Ferguson, 2008 SCC 6, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 96, at para. 61 (emphasis in original)) by empowering courts to declare \u201claws\u201d that violate the Charter to be of no force and effect (see also Ontario (Attorney General) v. G, 2020 SCC 38, [2020] 3 S.C.R. 629, at paras. 84-88). It does not circumvent the question of whether the Charter can be invoked in the first place (N. Dupl\u00e9, Droit constitutionnel: principes fondamentaux (5th ed. 2011), at pp. 462-63).\n[429] For example, in Godbout v. Longueuil (City), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 844, it was not taken as a given that municipal by-laws were subject to the Charter because they are \u201claws\u201d. Rather, the Court was required to consider s. 32(1), as interpreted by this Court\u2019s jurisprudence, to determine whether the Charter applied. Similarly, in GVTA, this Court first determined whether the entities in question fell within s. 32(1). Only after answering this question in the affirmative and finding a Charter violation did the Court turn to whether the impugned policies were \u201claw\u201d for the purpose of applying the remedy in s. 52(1).\n[430] Put another way, it is not \u201cinconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution\u201d under s. 52(1) to abide by the limits of Charter applicability set out in s. 32(1). Thus, s. 32(1) must be the focus of the analysis to determine whether the Charter applies to the VGFN and its enactment of the residency requirement.\nIII. The Charter Applies to the Federal and Provincial Governments and Entities or Activities With a Significant Connection to Those Governments\n[431] There is no dispute that the VGFN is a \u201cgovernment\u201d in the sense that it represents a body by which the Vuntut Gwitchin community is governed (Concise Oxford English Dictionary (12th ed. 2011)). However, many of the arguments in support of the Charter\u2019s applicability suffer from a fundamental misconception: that the Charter applies to any entity that is a government or any activities that appear \u201cgovernmental\u201d, whether or not they have a connection to the federal or a provincial government. For example, the Attorney General of Canada says that the Charter applies whenever an entity \u201cexercises quintessentially governmental functions\u201d (I.F., at para. 18) and that \u201ca connection to or degree of control by Parliament or a legislature\u201d is therefore not required (para. 22). Similarly, the Attorney General of Alberta says \u201call entities (Indigenous and non-Indigenous alike) undertaking a governmental role by exercising a law-making power have an obligation to comply with the Charter\u201d (I.F., at para. 6). The courts below seemingly adopted this perspective, concluding that \u201cs. 32 does not provide an exhaustive list of governments subject to the Charter\u201d (2020 YKSC 22, 461 C.R.R. (2d) 230, at para. 123; see also 2021 YKCA 5, 495 C.R.R. (2d) 98, at paras. 84-85) and that the Charter applies to the VGFN because it is \u201ca government\u201d and exercises \u201cgovernment activities\u201d (trial reasons, at para. 131).\n[432] These arguments must be rejected. As I will explain, they are contrary to the text of s. 32(1), its history and place within the structure of the Constitution Act, 1982, and the jurisprudence concerning its purpose and scope. This jurisprudence confirms that the Charter applies only to the federal and provincial governments in respect of matters within their authority. The scope of s. 32(1) of the Charter is understood purposively in a manner that encompasses the federal and provincial governments in all their modern forms, so as to prevent those governments from evading Charter scrutiny through the stratification of authority in the modern administrative state. However, entities or activities that are not part of the institutions of the federal or a provincial government must exhibit a significant connection to one of those governments in order to fall within s. 32(1).\n[433] Before proceeding, I note that in these reasons, I refer to the institutions enumerated in s. 32(1) collectively as the federal and provincial governments. The jurisprudence uses the term \u201cgovernment\u201d both in terms of the executive branch of the federal and provincial governments (Dolphin Delivery, at pp. 598-99), and more broadly to denote the federal and provincial levels of government. I use the term in the latter sense. Moreover, references to the provinces, provincial governments or provincial legislation in these reasons should be understood to include reference to the territories, as the context may require.\nA. Text of Section 32(1)\n[434] The starting point of a purposive approach to Charter interpretation remains the text of the provision at issue (Toronto (City) v. Ontario (Attorney General), 2021 SCC 34, at para. 65; Quebec (Attorney General) v. 9147-0732 Qu\u00e9bec inc., 2020 SCC 32, [2020] 3 S.C.R. 426, at para. 8; see also R. v. McGregor, 2023 SCC 4, at para. 18). In this case, the provision at issue is s. 32(1) of the Charter. Section 32(1) reads as follows:\n32 (1) This Charter applies\n(a) to the Parliament and government of Canada in respect of all matters within the authority of Parliament including all matters relating to the Yukon Territory and Northwest Territories; and\n(b) to the legislature and government of each province in respect of all matters within the authority of the legislature of each province.\n[435] The text of s. 32(1) does not refer to the concept of \u201cgovernment\u201d generally. Rather, the text enumerates distinct institutions under two paragraphs: the \u201cParliament and government of Canada\u201d (s. 32(1)(a)) and the \u201clegislature and government of each province\u201d (s. 32(1)(b)). In Dolphin Delivery, McIntyre J. made clear that \u201cs. 32 of the Charter specifies the actors to whom the Charter will apply\u201d (p. 598; see also GVTA, at para. 13). Section 32(1) also makes clear that the Charter applies to the federal and provincial governments \u201cin respect of all matters within their respective authorities\u201d (Dolphin Delivery, at p. 598).\n[436] The clear language used to address to whom and to what the Charter applies reflects s. 32(1)\u2019s purpose. No interpretation can be adopted that effectively rewrites s. 32(1) of the Charter (R. v. Terry, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 207, at para. 23). Accordingly, any approach to Charter applicability under s. 32(1) cannot ignore the clear boundaries set out within the provision itself.\nB. Section 32(1)\u2019s History and Place Within the Structure of the Constitution Act, 1982\n[437] The history of s. 32(1) and its place within the structure of the Constitution Act, 1982 confirm that the Charter was designed by the federal and provincial governments, for those governments. In contrast, the relationship between these governments and Indigenous peoples, and the place for Indigenous governance within contemporary Canada, were addressed through separate mechanisms such as modern treaties protected by s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982.\n(1) The Charter Was Designed by the Federal and Provincial Governments, for the Federal and Provincial Governments\n[438] The Charter was, in essence, a binding agreement entered into by the federal government on one side and the provincial governments (with the exception of Quebec) on the other. It was a way to constitutionally affirm individual protections against those governments established by the British North America Act, 1867 (now the Constitution Act, 1867). In parallel to patriation, the federal and provincial governments, as the successors to the Imperial Crown, agreed to a rights document to protect those who were subject to their authority. Thus, the Charter mediates the relationship \u201cbetween the Crown and individuals with respect to the individual\u2019s fundamental rights and freedoms\u201d (Beckman v. Little Salmon\/Carmacks First Nation, 2010 SCC 53, [2010] 3 S.C.R. 103, at para. 97 (emphasis added), per Deschamps J., concurring).\n[439] The negotiations leading to the Charter took place over a series of federal-provincial conferences, primarily between First Ministers. Even where discussions took place between other ministers or government officials, the dominant method of negotiation and conflict resolution was the practice of holding a conference between the federal and provincial levels of government (J. R. Mallory, \u201cThe Politics of Constitutional Change\u201d, in P. Davenport and R. H. Leach, eds., Reshaping Confederation: The 1982 Reform of the Canadian Constitution (1984), 53, at pp. 60 and 66). As drafts were being studied, consultations took place with various stakeholders in order for them to present their perspectives (see Senate and House of Commons, Minutes of Proceedings and Evidence of the Special Joint Committee of the Senate and of the House of Commons on the Constitution of Canada, No. 57, 1st Sess., 32nd Parl., February 13, 1981); however, these groups were petitioners, not participants (D. Sanders, \u201cAn Uncertain Path: The Aboriginal Constitutional Conferences\u201d, in J. M. Weiler and R. M. Elliot, eds., Litigating the Values of a Nation: The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (1986), 63, at p. 63). The ultimate negotiations remained between the representatives of the federal and provincial governments (D. Gibson, The Law of the Charter: General Principles (1986), at pp. 38-39).\n[440] The Charter \u2014 including s. 32(1) \u2014 was designed with these actors in mind. As Professor K. Swinton explains, it is necessary to \u201ckeep in mind the concerns of the federal and provincial governments in drafting and agreeing to the Charter. Their focus was its effect on their own governmental operations\u201d (\u201cApplication of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (ss. 30, 31, 32)\u201d, in W. S. Tarnopolsky and G.-A. Beaudoin, eds., The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms: Commentary (1982), 41, at p. 48 (emphasis added)). This explains why the protections enshrined in the Charter are replete with references to the federal and provincial levels of government (see, e.g., ss. 3 to 6, 16 to 20, and 23).\n[441] This negotiating context also explains why, although many provisions in the Charter generated heated debate, the precursor to s. 32(1) did not. The issue of the Charter\u2019s applicability was alluded to during the tabling of prior federal drafts (Gibson, at p. 36; see also Federal-Provincial Meeting of the Continuing Committee of Ministers on the Constitution, Rights and Freedoms within the Canadian Federation \u2014 Discussion Draft, No. 830-81\/027, July 4, 1980); however, an express provision concerning the Charter\u2019s applicability first appeared in a federal draft placed before Parliament in October 1980 (The Canadian Constitution 1980: Proposed Resolution respecting the Constitution of Canada (1980)). It did not generate significant discussion in Parliament or in a subsequent Special Joint Committee. Throughout intense negotiations in pursuit of an agreement on the substance of the Charter between the federal government and the provinces, the applicability provision was not the subject of dispute; its only change in wording was made by a drafting committee after an agreement had been reached on substantive rights and freedoms (Gibson, at p. 115). It is worth noting that this change had the effect of emphasizing the connection between the Charter and the federal and provincial levels of government by clarifying that it applied \u201cin respect of\u201d matters within their authority, rather than applying to the aforementioned governments \u201cand\u201d matters within their authority (p. 115).\n(2) Indigenous Peoples Were Addressed Separately Within the Constitution Act, 1982\n[442] The Charter was designed to entrench standards of constitutional behaviour that were tailored to the structures and philosophical underpinnings of federal and provincial governance (see generally Davenport and Leach, eds.; B. L. Strayer, Canada\u2019s Constitutional Revolution (2013)). Nevertheless, some interveners suggest that because Indigenous peoples are part of Canada\u2019s constitutional fabric, their governments should \u201cbe required to respect constitutional constraints, including the rights and freedoms guaranteed under the Charter\u201d (I.F., Band Members Alliance and Advocacy Association of Canada, at para. 4). They also point to the presence of s. 25 of the Charter as evidence that this is part of the Charter\u2019s design. In my view, these submissions are inconsistent with a structural analysis of Canada\u2019s constitutional architecture.\n[443] The history and structure of the Constitution Act, 1982 make clear that the relationship between the federal and provincial governments and Indigenous peoples \u2014 and, as a corollary, the place for Indigenous governance within contemporary Canada \u2014 was addressed through mechanisms separate from the Charter. Most significantly, the collective rights of Indigenous peoples were given constitutional protection by means of s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982. Notably, s. 35 was placed outside of the Charter, in a separate \u201cPart\u201d of the Constitution Act, 1982. The presence of s. 35 yields several insights relevant to the scope of s. 32(1).\n[444] First, the degree of Indigenous involvement highlights the differences between the bargains found within the Constitution Act, 1982. The Charter primarily concerned federal and provincial actors: Indigenous peoples were not at the negotiating table, did not agree for the Charter to apply to them, and were not included within the constitutional amending formula which was adopted alongside the Charter. By contrast, the ultimate inclusion of s. 35 \u201crepresents the culmination of a long and difficult struggle in both the political forum and the courts for the constitutional recognition of aboriginal rights\u201d (R. v. Sparrow, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1075, at p. 1105). Outstanding questions were also discussed in separate, albeit unsuccessful, constitutional conferences, which included direct involvement by Indigenous groups (Gibson, at p. 39; Constitution Act, 1982, ss. 35.1(b) and 37.1(3) (repealed on April 18, 1987, by s. 54.1)).\n[445] Second, the constitutional entrenchment of modern treaties under s. 35(1) is of particular relevance to understanding why the scope and limits of Indigenous governance are not addressed by the Charter. The 1970s had ushered in a new era of treaty-making between Indigenous groups and the federal and provincial governments, and a major topic of those discussions was the implementation and scope of Indigenous self-government (S. Imai, \u201cIndigenous Self-Determination and the State\u201d, in B. J. Richardson, S. Imai and K. McNeil, eds., Indigenous Peoples and the Law: Comparative and Critical Perspectives (2009), 285, at p. 295; S. Grammond, Terms of Coexistence: Indigenous Peoples and Canadian Law (2013), at pp. 123-25 and 128\u201129). Such discussions included the negotiations that began in 1973 and culminated two decades later in the agreements concerning self-government for Yukon First Nations, including the VGFN (J. T. S. McCabe, The Law of Treaties Between the Crown and Aboriginal Peoples (2010), at pp. 52-59). Cognizant of this ongoing effort, s. 35(3) makes clear that \u201ctreaty rights includes rights that now exist by way of land claims agreements or may be so acquired\u201d. Thus, the federal and provincial governments understood that the scope and limits of Indigenous governance would be addressed under s. 35, particularly through the entrenchment of modern treaties, rather than through the Charter.\n[446] As for s. 25, it serves as the link between Part I and Part II of the Constitution Act, 1982. Section 25 is best understood as a protection against Charter challenges to federal and provincial measures that protect s. 35 rights, as well as \u201cother rights or freedoms\u201d (H. S. LaForme, with the assistance of C. Truesdale, \u201cSection 25 of the Charter; Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982: Aboriginal and Treaty Rights \u2014 30 Years of Recognition and Affirmation\u201d, in E. Mendes and S. Beaulac, eds., Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (5th ed. 2013), 1337, at p. 1377). The concerns that led to its inclusion are understandable: Charter negotiations occurred only a decade after the release of the federal White Paper of 1969 (Statement of the Government of Canada on Indian Policy, 1969), which proposed to remove special status for Indigenous peoples in order to promote \u201cequality of rights\u201d (D. Sanders, \u201cThe Rights of the Aboriginal Peoples of Canada\u201d (1983), 61 Can. Bar Rev. 314, at p. 319; T. J. Courchene, Indigenous Nationals, Canadian Citizens: From First Contact to Canada 150 and Beyond (2018), at p. 66). Indigenous concerns also stemmed from jurisprudence concerning prior challenges to the Indian Act under the Canadian Bill of Rights, S.C. 1960, c. 44 (see, e.g., The Queen v. Drybones, [1970] S.C.R. 282; Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell, [1974] S.C.R. 1349; R. M. M\u2019Gonigle, \u201cThe Bill of Rights and The Indian Act: Either? Or?\u201d (1977), 15 Alta. L. Rev. 292).\n[447] In this sense, s. 25 reinforces the distinct relationships involved in the Constitution Act, 1982 \u2014 one concerning the interaction between individuals and the Crown, and one concerning the protection of Indigenous peoples from certain forms of interference by the Crown (see, e.g., Beckman, at para. 97, per Deschamps J., concurring). Section 25 is thus of a similar character to the other \u201cGeneral\u201d provisions of the Charter that \u201cform a coherent whole of interpretative provisions that do not grant rights in themselves, but can affect, usually by restricting, the scope of Charter review in certain circumstances\u201d (G. J. Kennedy, \u201cThey\u2019re All Interpretative: Towards a Consistent Approach to ss 25-31 of the Charter\u201d (U.B.C. L. Rev., forthcoming), at p. 2). It ensures that the latter relationship is unaffected by the former (Ontario (Attorney General) v. Bear Island Foundation, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 570) by requiring that the Charter not be interpreted in a way that would bring the two relationships \u201cinto conflict with one another\u201d (Beckman, at para. 98, per Deschamps J., concurring). In doing so, it reinforces that the Charter is designed to constrain the federal and provincial governments, without affecting their ability to give effect to the collective rights of Indigenous peoples.\n[448] Taken together, it is clear that s. 32(1)\u2019s focus on the federal and provincial governments is consistent with the history of the Charter and with the distinct relationships that undergird the structure of the Constitution Act, 1982.\n[449] I cannot leave s. 25 without addressing the meaning given to it in the reasons of my colleagues in the majority and in dissent, a meaning fundamentally different from that which I have just set out and one that will have far-reaching consequences for the relationship between the courts and Indigenous self-government.\n[450] By their respective interpretations of s. 25 and s. 32(1), my colleagues apply judicial review for Charter compliance to Indigenous self-government. Both groups of colleagues describe at length a process of judicial review under s. 25; while they diverge as to whether s. 25 is a \u201cshield\u201d or an \u201cinterpretative prism\u201d, both descriptions are complex. Whatever the nuances, their approaches amount to a means for courts to apply Charter rights (or \u201cvalues\u201d) to the operation of Indigenous self-government.\n[451] Stripped to its essentials, what will result is an analysis that parallels R. v. Oakes, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103, for legislative action and Dor\u00e9 v. Barreau du Qu\u00e9bec, 2012 SCC 12, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 395, for administrative action. Though not using the language of Oakes and Dor\u00e9, in effect, after determining that a Charter right is infringed, through the lens of s. 25 courts will conduct a form of \u201cjustification\u201d exercise akin to Oakes or a \u201cbalancing\u201d exercise akin to Dor\u00e9, having regard on the one hand to the Charter rights\/values infringed and Indigenous rights on the other (Kasirer and Jamal JJ.\u2019s reasons, at paras. 177-82; Martin and O\u2019Bonsawin JJ.\u2019s reasons, at paras. 338-39). Moreover, akin to Oakes, the burden of justification will lie with the party whose actions caused the Charter infringement, here the Indigenous government, something that has no basis in the text of s. 25.\n[452] One needs to reflect as to whether such continued oversight of Indigenous self-government by the courts is what s. 25 is meant to do. There is nothing in s. 25 to suggest it is. Rather, the wording is consonant with my interpretation of s. 25, that courts are directed to avoid interfering with Indigenous rights when they adjudicate the constitutionality of actions by the federal or a provincial government. On the interpretation of my colleagues, courts are also to do something quite different \u2014 that is, to review the actions of Indigenous governments for Charter compliance. This will engage the courts in a role of permanent oversight of Indigenous self-government.\n[453] In a sense, the two groups of my colleagues have no choice as to their interpretation of s. 25. Once they decide that the Charter applies to Indigenous self-government, they need some mechanism for courts to \u201cbalance\u201d Charter rights\/values against Indigenous rights. Section 25 is recruited to that task, even though that is not what s. 25 was meant to do.\nC. Jurisprudence on the Purpose and Scope of Section 32(1)\n[454] The foregoing makes clear that only the federal and provincial governments were intended to fall within the scope of s. 32(1). Accordingly, the Charter does not apply, inter alia, to purely private litigation (Dolphin Delivery, at pp. 597-98; Hill v. Church of Scientology of Toronto, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 1130, at para. 95) or to foreign governments (United States v. Allard, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 564), as such entities lack a connection to the federal or a provincial government.\n[455] Consistent with a purposive approach to Charter interpretation, this Court has recognized that the scope of s. 32(1) must be interpreted in a manner that reflects how the federal and provincial governments take form in modern Canadian society. This is necessary to ensure that those governments cannot evade Charter scrutiny, including by acting through entities that are effectively extensions of those governments (McKinney v. University of Guelph, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 229, at p. 265; Godbout, at para. 51; GVTA, at para. 22), or by delegating the implementation of particular policies or programs to non-governmental entities (Eldridge v. British Columbia (Attorney General), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 624, at para. 42). This concern was aptly summarized by La Forest J. in Godbout:\nWere the Charter to apply only to those bodies that are institutionally part of government but not to those that are \u2014 as a simple matter of fact \u2014 governmental in nature (or performing a governmental act), the federal government and the provinces could easily shirk their Charter obligations by conferring certain of their powers on other entities and having those entities carry out what are, in reality, governmental activities or policies. In other words, Parliament, the provincial legislatures and the federal and provincial executives could simply create bodies distinct from themselves, vest those bodies with the power to perform governmental functions and, thereby, avoid the constraints imposed upon their activities through the operation of the Charter. Clearly, this course of action would indirectly narrow the ambit of protection afforded by the Charter in a manner that could hardly have been intended and with consequences that are, to say the least, undesirable. Indeed, in view of their fundamental importance, Charter rights must be safeguarded from possible attempts to narrow their scope unduly or to circumvent altogether the obligations they engender. [Emphasis added; para. 48.]\nIt is important, however, to note that these comments remain directed to the particular institutions enumerated under s. 32(1) \u2014 \u201cParliament, the provincial legislatures and the federal and provincial executives\u201d \u2014 and not to an abstract conception of \u201cgovernments\u201d more generally.\n[456] This Court has sought to give effect to the foregoing by interpreting the boundaries of \u201cgovernment\u201d in a manner that reflects how government takes form in modern Canadian society. Such an approach is supported by the reference in s. 32(1) to \u201cmatters within the authority\u201d of the federal and provincial governments (GVTA, at para. 14): entities that are not part of the institutions of the federal and provincial governments, but are \u201ccontrolled by government or that perform truly governmental functions are themselves \u2018matters within the authority\u2019 of the particular legislative body that created them\u201d (Godbout, at para. 48 (emphasis added)). This Court has therefore concluded that \u201cgovernment\u201d under s. 32(1) encompasses entities that may not, on their face, fall within the institutions of the federal and provincial governments but are sufficiently connected for all or some of their activities to fall within the authority of those governments (GVTA, at para. 16).\n[457] In Eldridge, La Forest J. reviewed this Court\u2019s jurisprudence and set out a two-branch framework to give effect to s. 32(1). Under the first branch, a court may conclude that \u201cthe entity is itself \u2018government\u2019 for the purposes of s. 32 . . . either by its very nature or in virtue of the degree of governmental control exercised over it\u201d (para. 44). If the entity itself is found to fall within \u201cgovernment\u201d under s. 32(1), all of the entity\u2019s activities are subject to the Charter (GVTA, at para. 16). Under the second branch, a court may conclude that while the entity itself cannot be equated with the federal or provincial government, some of its particular activities can be \u201cascribed to government\u201d, namely where the activity involves the \u201cimplementation of a specific statutory scheme or a government program\u201d (Eldridge, at para. 44). In such a case, only those activities attract Charter scrutiny because they are, effectively, the activities of the federal or provincial government under s. 32(1).\n[458] Ms. Dickson, various interveners, and the courts below rely on portions of this Court\u2019s jurisprudence in support of the notion that s. 32(1) encompasses any entity or activity that can be termed a government or governmental, even with no connection to the federal or a provincial government. This is not a tenable proposition. As I will explain, this Court has always required \u2014 under both branches of Eldridge \u2014 that an entity or activity have a significant connection to the federal or provincial government before it will fall within the scope of \u201cgovernment\u201d under s. 32(1). The terms \u201cgovernment\u201d or \u201cgovernmental\u201d in this Court\u2019s s. 32(1) jurisprudence have always referred to the particular governments enumerated in s. 32(1). Eldridge and its progeny are not a judicially generated expansion of s. 32(1). Rather, this Court has sought to interpret s. 32(1) in a manner which ensures that the federal and provincial governments do not evade their constitutional responsibilities under the Charter. Portions of that jurisprudence cannot be taken out of context in order to support an application of s. 32(1) that is divorced from this underlying purpose and the provision\u2019s text, history, and place within the Constitution Act, 1982.\n(1) The Nature of the Entity\n[459] A significant connection to the Crown has always been required under the first branch of Eldridge, whereby an entity may be considered \u201citself \u2018government\u2019\u201d and thus subject to the Charter in all of its activities. For example, such entities have been described, inter alia, as part of the \u201capparatus\u201d or \u201cfabric\u201d of government (McKinney, at p. 275; Eldridge, at paras. 37 and 40), as \u201csubordinate bodies\u201d (Stoffman v. Vancouver General Hospital, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 483, at p. 507), \u201corgans\u201d (McKinney, at p. 272), or an \u201cemanation\u201d (Eldridge, at para. 39; Godbout, at para. 47) of government, or \u201cassimilated to the government itself\u201d (R. v. Buhay, 2003 SCC 30, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 631, at para. 28). In each of these cases, \u201cgovernment\u201d referred to either the federal or provincial government, and it is apparent from these descriptions that a significant connection to one of those governments is required. This is because such a connection engages the underlying concern that the federal and provincial governments would otherwise be able to evade Charter scrutiny through entities that are extensions of those governments.\n[460] This Court has recognized that entities within the modern administrative state take on various forms, with varying degrees of autonomy from the federal and provincial governments in their operations. Thus, Eldridge recognizes two general ways in which an entity may be considered \u201citself \u2018government\u2019\u201d. In either instance, a significant connection to the federal or provincial government is required.\n[461] First, some entities \u2014 such as a labour arbitrator (Slaight Communications Inc. v. Davidson, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1038), a human rights commission (Blencoe), and municipalities (Godbout) \u2014 have been held to be government \u201cby their very nature\u201d (see Eldridge, at para. 44) despite operating independently from the federal and provincial governments. This language appears to be the foundation for the arguments resting on the fact that the VGFN is a government. However, an assessment of the nature of the entity under Eldridge does not occur by reference to an abstract conception of \u201cgovernment\u201d. Rather, it is an inquiry into the entity\u2019s connection to the particular governments enumerated in s. 32(1), as demonstrated by the entity\u2019s creation, structure, and powers. For example, in each of the aforementioned cases, the entity owed both its existence and authority to either the federal or a provincial government. Thus, the labour arbitrator in Slaight and the human rights commission in Blencoe \u201ceach exercise[d] governmental powers conferred upon them by a legislative body\u201d, and \u201c[t]he ultimate source of authority in each of these cases [was] government\u201d (Blencoe, at para. 39). And what was decisive in determining that the Charter applies to municipalities in Godbout was not that they are a government (they clearly are), but rather that they \u201cderive their existence and law-making authority from the provinces\u201d (para. 51).\n[462] My colleagues Justices Kasirer and Jamal state that the VGFN engages the illustrative indicia for \u201cgovernment by nature\u201d (para. 78) because,\nalthough (as the trial judge found) the Vuntut Gwitchin have been self-governing since time immemorial, and even if the VGFN has lawmaking authority under an inherent right to self-government, the VGFN is also recognized as a legal entity under the federal implementing legislation. To that extent, it derives at least some of its lawmaking authority under federal law. In other words, at least one source of the VGFN\u2019s lawmaking authority flows from Parliament, in that the VGFN exercises powers that Parliament otherwise would have exercised through its legislative jurisdiction under s. 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867. [Emphasis in original; para. 82.]\nThis implies that, as the self-government agreement in this case was authorized by federal legislation, Indigenous self-government for the VGFN is somehow an emanation of federal authority. This is fundamentally inconsistent with the nature, status and purpose of Indigenous self-government. Its purpose is to recognize and give practical effect to an autonomy that is different in status and nature from that exercised by band councils under the Indian Act. The idea of self-government is not that it is an \u201cauthority [that] flows from Parliament\u201d, but rather Indigenous peoples exercising authority that is rightfully theirs.\n[463] Thus, the fact that an entity is a government does not automatically lead to the conclusion that the Charter applies to its activities. Nor does the conclusion that an entity is not subject to the Charter mean that it cannot be a government. For example, the government of the United Kingdom is no less a government because it is not subject to the Charter. The jurisprudence simply recognizes that the scope of s. 32(1), while capable of embracing extensions of the federal and provincial governments in the modern administrative state, is not so broad as to encompass entities that bear no significant connection to the particular governments enumerated in s. 32(1) itself.\n[464] Second, some entities may not be the federal or provincial government by their very nature but may nonetheless be considered \u201cgovernment\u201d for the purposes of Charter applicability where they are subject to \u201csubstantial control\u201d by those governments (GVTA, at para. 16). Government control must be \u201croutine or regular\u201d rather than \u201cultimate or extraordinary\u201d to bring an entity that is not government by its very nature within the sphere of the controlling government (Stoffman, at pp. 513-14; Harrison v. University of British Columbia, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 451, at p. 463). Clearly, this standard entails a significant connection to the federal or a provincial government. Thus, the college in Douglas\/Kwantlen Faculty Assn. v. Douglas College, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 570, was \u201cpart of the apparatus of government\u201d and subject to the Charter because the provincial government at all times controlled its operations (p. 584; see also, e.g., GVTA, at paras. 17-21). This distinguished the college from the universities considered in McKinney and Harrison which, despite being subject to provincial regulations and dependent on provincial funds, were not subject to the Charter because they were \u201cessentially autonomous bodies\u201d (Douglas College, at pp. 584-85; see also Stoffman, at pp. 513-14).\n[465] The Band Members Alliance and Advocacy Association of Canada suggests that s. 32(1) \u201cis meant to draw the line of application between inherently private and public relationships\u201d (I.F., at para. 14). The term \u201cprivate\u201d is often used to describe entities that are not themselves \u201cgovernment\u201d, such as individual people (Dolphin Delivery, at pp. 599-600), corporations (Eldridge, at para. 35), or railroads and airlines (McKinney, at p. 269; Stoffman, at p. 511). However, this Court has expressly rejected the distinction between \u201cprivate\u201d and \u201cpublic\u201d as the test for s. 32(1). The fact that an entity performs public functions \u2014 even ones that are similar to those undertaken by the federal or provincial governments \u2014 does not determine whether the entity is itself one of those governments. This Court has repeatedly stated that \u201c[a] public purpose test is simply inadequate\u201d and \u201cis simply not the test mandated by s. 32\u201d (McKinney, at p. 269; Eldridge, at para. 43; Godbout, at para. 49; Buhay, at para. 28). Conversely, once an entity is considered \u201citself \u2018government\u2019\u201d under the first branch of Eldridge, the Charter applies to all of its activities, \u201cwhether or not those activities may be otherwise characterized as \u2018private\u2019\u201d (Eldridge, at para. 41). The focus of the s. 32(1) inquiry is always on the entity\u2019s connection to the federal or provincial governments.\n(2) The Nature of the Activity\n[466] A significant connection to the federal or a provincial government is also required under the second branch of Eldridge, whereby a \u201cnon-governmental entit[y]\u201d (i.e., an entity that is not \u201citself \u2018government\u2019\u201d under s. 32(1) (see para. 41)) may still be subject to the Charter in the performance of particular activities that can be \u201cascribed to government\u201d (para. 44).\n[467] As with the first branch, \u201cthe fact that a particular activity may be described as \u2018public\u2019 in nature, will not be sufficient to bring it within the purview of \u2018government\u2019 for the purposes of s. 32 of the Charter\u201d (Eldridge, at para. 43; see also Buhay, at para. 28). Nor is it sufficient to point to any connection, however tenuous, between a non-governmental entity\u2019s activities and the federal or a provincial government. What is necessary is a \u201cdirect and . . . precisely-defined connection\u201d between the federal or provincial government and the activity (Eldridge, at para. 51, citing Dolphin Delivery, at p. 601). Put another way, it must \u201cfairly be said that the decision is that of the government, or that the government sufficiently partakes in the decision as to make it an act of government\u201d (McKinney, at p. 274).\n[468] Once again, the scope of the second branch of Eldridge seeks to give effect to a modern understanding of the mechanisms of government and the express rationale of the Eldridge framework. If the federal and provincial governments cannot perform an activity directly without violating the Charter, they cannot evade Charter scrutiny by delegating the activity to a non-governmental entity (Eldridge, at para. 40). Even if another entity is charged with performing it, the nature of the activity has not changed: it remains that of the federal or provincial government. The non-governmental entities are \u201cmerely the vehicles\u201d (para. 50) chosen by the government for the accomplishment of what are, in essence, activities that can be ascribed to government. In contrast, no concern about Charter evasion arises for entities that act in furtherance of their own policies and objectives, rather than implementing those of the federal or a provincial government. This distinction explains why this Court\u2019s jurisprudence has consistently focused on whether the activity involves the implementation of a specific statutory scheme, government policy, or government program (see, e.g., Eldridge, at paras. 43\u201144; Blencoe, at para. 37).\nD. Summary\n[469] It is clear that the Charter applies under s. 32(1) to the federal and provincial governments. While the jurisprudence recognizes that \u201cgovernment\u201d takes on various forms in the modern administrative state, an entity or activity must bear a significant connection to the federal or a provincial government in order to fall within the scope of s. 32(1) of the Charter. Consequently, to determine whether the Charter applies to an entity such as the VGFN or to its activities, the focus must be on a connection to the federal or provincial government.\nIV. The VGFN Arrangements Do Not Establish a Significant Connection to Either the Federal or the Yukon Government\n[470] Having examined the scope of s. 32(1) of the Charter, I turn to whether the VGFN or its activities \u2014 namely, its enactment of the residency requirement \u2014 fall within that scope.\n[471] In light of their flawed interpretation of this Court\u2019s s. 32(1) jurisprudence, many of the arguments made by the interveners, including the Attorney General of Canada, make no effort to demonstrate a significant connection to either the federal or the Yukon government. However, some of Ms. Dickson\u2019s arguments are directed to the VGFN\u2019s connection to the federal government by virtue of the various arrangements concerning self-government agreed to and adopted around 1993-1994 (\u201cVGFN Arrangements\u201d). She suggests that the VGFN Arrangements are sufficient to connect the VGFN to the federal government in the manner required under s. 32(1). These arguments are the focus of this section of my reasons.\n[472] The VGFN Arrangements include multiple instruments. First, the signatories entered into the Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation Final Agreement (1993). It incorporates the terms of the Umbrella Final Agreement signed in 1993 between the federal and Yukon governments and the Council for Yukon Indians, which represented various Yukon First Nations, including the VGFN. The Final Agreement is a treaty protected by s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. It implements a framework designed to \u201cestablis[h] institutions for self-government and the management of lands and resources\u201d (First Nation of Nacho Nyak Dun v. Yukon, 2017 SCC 58, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 576, at para. 10). Further to this framework, the signatories also agreed to the Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation Self-Government Agreement (1993). The Final Agreement stipulates that the Self-Government Agreement is not a treaty under s. 35, although its content and implementation flow directly from the parameters set out by the Final Agreement. Finally, legislation, including the federal Yukon First Nations Self-Government Act, S.C. 1994, c. 35 (\u201cFederal Act\u201d), was passed by Parliament and the Yukon legislature to give effect to the aforementioned agreements (see, e.g., Federal Act, s. 4). I note that the adoption of such legislation was expressly contemplated in the Umbrella Final Agreement and the Final Agreement, including a commitment to negotiate with and consult Yukon First Nations.\n[473] Ms. Dickson\u2019s submissions relying on the VGFN Arrangements as establishing a significant connection to the federal government are often unclear, both in terms of their underlying assumptions and the branch of the Eldridge framework being relied upon. For clarity, I will examine her arguments within the framework set out in Eldridge and explain why they must be rejected under both branches.\nA. The Nature of the VGFN\n[474] The question under the first branch of Eldridge is whether there exists a significant connection between the VGFN and either the federal or the Yukon government, such that the VGFN is itself \u201cgovernment\u201d in the sense required by s. 32(1). As I have explained, this is assessed based on either the nature of the entity or the degree of control exercised by the federal or the Yukon government over the entity. It is not suggested that the VGFN is controlled by the federal or the Yukon government, nor is it suggested that the VGFN is, by its very nature, part of the Yukon government; thus, the only question is whether the VGFN itself falls within the federal \u201cgovernment\u201d by its very nature, as demonstrated by its creation, structure, and powers.\n[475] Ms. Dickson suggests that \u201c[t]he VGFN constitution and all VGFN laws\u201d (R.F. on cross-appeal, at para. 29; see also para. 30) are given effect through a statutory delegation or grant of authority by the federal government to the Vuntut Gwitchin through the VGFN Arrangements. For example, she relies on the Federal Act to characterize the VGFN\u2019s \u201cpowers\u201d as \u201ccreatures of legislation\u201d and suggests that the VGFN\u2019s responsibilities were \u201ctransferred\u201d to it by the federal government (para. 34). Taken together, the thrust of her position is that the VGFN Arrangements have the effect of the federal government creating and structuring VGFN governance and delegating powers to the VGFN in a manner sufficient to bring the VGFN within the scope of the federal government under s. 32(1).\n[476] This argument fundamentally misconceives the special relationship between the Vuntut Gwitchin on one hand and the federal government as one of the successors to the Imperial Crown on the other. It also misconceives the restorative effect of the VGFN Arrangements on the Vuntut Gwitchin\u2019s internal governance structures.\n[477] This Court\u2019s jurisprudence has consistently affirmed the special relationship between Indigenous peoples and the Crown (Delgamuukw v. British Columbia, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 1010; Rio Tinto Alcan Inc. v. Carrier Sekani Tribal Council, 2010 SCC 43, [2010] 2 S.C.R. 650, at paras. 59-60; Nacho Nyak Dun, at para. 33). This relationship stems from the prior existence of Indigenous peoples and their occupation of the territory that now encompasses Canada: \u201cLong before Europeans explored and settled North America, aboriginal peoples were occupying and using most of this vast expanse of land in organized, distinctive societies with their own social and political structures\u201d (Mitchell v. M.N.R., 2001 SCC 33, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 911, at para. 9; see also R. v. Van der Peet, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 507, at para. 30). This Court has also repeatedly recognized the distinction between Indigenous and non-Indigenous legal traditions (Delgamuukw, at paras. 144-47; R. v. Marshall, 2005 SCC 43, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 220, at para. 130), which reflects the fact that each tradition was developed by distinct structures of governance. The Vuntut Gwitchin are no exception: they had formed their own society long before the assertion of Crown sovereignty (trial reasons, at para. 11). Within this society, they developed their own laws, rules, and customs, pursuant to their own governance structures (para. 43).\n[478] In the early period of Crown-Indigenous relations, the Imperial Crown largely did not interfere in matters of Indigenous peoples\u2019 internal governance and instead developed relationships with Indigenous leaders and communities (see, e.g., the Royal Proclamation, 1763 (G.B.), 3 Geo. 3 (reproduced in R.S.C. 1985, App. II, No. 1), and the Treaty of Niagara (1764)). However, Crown respect for Indigenous governance eventually gave way to the \u201csuperimposition of European laws and customs\u201d (Manitoba Metis Federation Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2013 SCC 14, [2013] 1 S.C.R. 623, at para. 67, citing Van der Peet, at para. 248), particularly through the Indian Act\u2019s band council system (trial reasons, at paras. 11-13). Internally, the Vuntut Gwitchin continued to make significant governance decisions collectively (trial reasons, at para. 12); however, their legal traditions were effectively relegated [translation] \u201cto a space frequented by members of the community, but not third parties. In this way, [Indigenous] law has become invisible in the public space and in the structures and institutions of the dominant society that do not recognize it as having any validity\u201d (G. Motard, \u201cRegards crois\u00e9s entre le droit innu et le droit qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois: territorialit\u00e9s en conflit\u201d (2020), 65 McGill L.J. 421, at p. 442). As described by the trial judge, \u201c[t]he displacement and alienation of Vuntut Gwitchin people from Vuntut Gwitchin Territory through imposed colonial laws and policies including residential schools, Indian Act administration and resource development without Vuntut Gwitchin consent or involvement has caused significant harm to the integrity and health of the Vuntut Gwitchin as a collective\u201d (trial reasons, at para. 13). Such experiences are not unique to the Vuntut Gwitchin.\n[479] It is in light of this historical context that modern treaties and similar agreements have sought to undo structures of imposed governance such as the Indian Act. To use the vocabulary of Professor Motard, they restore a \u201cspace\u201d for Indigenous peoples to govern their own affairs pursuant to their own laws, customs, and practices. These acts of restoration are protected by binding commitments by the Crown to \u201crelinquis[h] the historic control that the Canadian government has exerted\u201d, thereby \u201ccreating physical and jurisdictional space for such communities to express and foster cultural difference\u201d (K. Manley-Casimir, \u201cToward a Bijural Interpretation of the Principle of Respect in Aboriginal Law\u201d (2016), 61 McGill L.J. 939, at p. 974). The mutual commitments made within these agreements are necessary to ensure that Indigenous governance structures and traditions are not ignored by federal, provincial, or territorial institutions or rendered invisible in the face of conflicting laws. This is a legitimate concern, since Indigenous governance structures are emerging from a lengthy period in which this was what had occurred.\n[480] The ongoing connection entailed by the mutual commitments in a modern treaty or other such agreement does not mean that the Indigenous governance structures derive their existence or authority from the federal government. Rather, such agreements are \u201csui generis\u201d in nature (Nacho Nyak Dun, at para. 33); they \u201cattempt to further the objective of reconciliation . . . by creating the legal basis to foster a positive long-term relationship between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal communities\u201d (Beckman, at para. 10). As Deschamps J. explained in Beckman regarding the various agreements with Yukon First Nations pursuant to the Umbrella Final Agreement, these agreements are \u201cbinding on the parties with respect to the matters they cover\u201d and \u201c[t]hrough these agreements, the First Nations concerned have taken control of their destiny\u201d (para. 91).\n[481] The VGFN Self-Government Agreement accomplishes these objectives by removing the band council structure under the Indian Act, which \u201ccease[s] to exist\u201d (s. 9.1). Various other components of the Indian Act are also rendered inapplicable through the ensuing Federal Act, alongside amendments to other statutes designed to give effect to the Crown\u2019s commitments toward Yukon First Nations (Federal Act, ss. 17(1) and 33 to 39). These developments had the consequence of restoring space for the Vuntut Gwitchin to govern their affairs pursuant to their own governance structures, rather than structures imposed by the Crown. This is an express purpose of the Self-Government Agreement:\n2.1 The Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation has traditional decision-making structures and desires to maintain these traditional structures integrated with contemporary forms of government.\nThis is what occurred. The VGFN enacted its own Constitution, which sets out the VGFN\u2019s governance structures, including four branches of government: the General Assembly, the Elders Council, the Council, and the Vuntut Gwitchin Court (VGFN Constitution, Article V(1)). These structures constitute the \u201cmodern expression\u201d of traditional Vuntut Gwitchin governance and were developed by the Vuntut Gwitchin through their traditional \u201cgovernance practice of making significant decisions collectively through processes of community deliberation and discussion\u201d (trial reasons, at para. 12). They do not owe their existence or authority to either the federal or the Yukon government.\n[482] In spite of the foregoing, Ms. Dickson points to various provisions in the Federal Act to say that the VGFN Constitution and VGFN laws are \u201cgiven the force of law in Canada\u201d and thus derive their authority \u201cas legislative instruments given force of law by Parliament\u201d (R.F. on cross-appeal, at paras. 30-31; see also para. 29). This misunderstands what the Federal Act does. Statutes like the Federal Act are routinely adopted by the federal and provincial or territorial governments to ratify and implement modern treaties and agreements with Indigenous peoples. Indeed, the signatories to the VGFN Final Agreement and Self-Government Agreement expressly contemplated that Parliament and the Yukon legislature would enact legislation to implement these agreements, and that such legislation would be the product of negotiation and consultation with Yukon First Nations. This is not the sort of statute that would establish a significant connection between the federal government and the VGFN, as required under Eldridge. Indeed, the nature of the federal government\u2019s involvement within the VGFN Arrangements has the opposite effect of what is required by Eldridge, by ensuring that the federal government respects the VGFN\u2019s autonomy pursuant to commitments arrived at by agreement.\n[483] Ms. Dickson also misconstrues the effect of particular provisions of the Federal Act. For example, she points to the fact that s. 8 of the Federal Act requires First Nations to enact a constitution. But this provision simply implements what Yukon First Nations had previously agreed to in the Umbrella Final Agreement. A written constitution fits within the restorative purpose of the VGFN Arrangements, because it is \u201can essential step in bridging the gap between Indigenous legal traditions and the Canadian legal system\u201d (A. Geddes, \u201cIndigenous Constitutionalism Beyond Section 35 and Section 91(24): The Significance of First Nations Constitutions in Canadian Law\u201d (2019), 3 Lakehead L.J. 1, at p. 15; Final Agreement, s. 24.5; Self-Government Agreement, s. 10.1; Federal Act, s. 8(1)). It facilitates a transition from Crown-led to Indigenous-led governance by setting out, in a publicly accessible manner, the basic governance structures chosen by the Vuntut Gwitchin.\n[484] Ms. Dickson also relies on s. 10 of the Federal Act. This is an administrative provision that again merely repeats the procedures agreed to by Yukon First Nations in the Umbrella Final Agreement and by the VGFN in the Self-Government Agreement. For example, s. 10 establishes a register of Yukon First Nation laws to make those laws easy to access (Self-Government Agreement, s. 21), a default rule for when laws come into force in order to avoid uncertainty (Federal Act, s. 10(4)), and an evidence provision on how the content of Yukon First Nations laws can be proved before Canadian legal institutions (s. 10(5)). Nothing in this provision suggests that the underlying exercises of VGFN governance derive their authority from the federal government.\n[485] Nor does the fact that the VGFN agreed to a list of subject matters in the Final Agreement that would be the focus of further negotiation, or that the Federal Act and Self-Government Agreement entrenched VGFN authority in relation to particular subject matters, indicate a delegation of power by the federal government. Rather, the enumeration of specific subject matters is an important part of binding the federal government to respect the VGFN\u2019s spheres of governance authority. It would be impossible for the VGFN agreements to restore a protected space for Vuntut Gwitchin governance if the signatories did not make the scope of that space clear. To avoid this, the VGFN agreements seek to make the scope of the federal and territorial governments\u2019 commitments unequivocal. For example, the VGFN agreements recognize the VGFN\u2019s exclusive authority to regulate certain areas, with the corollary being that the Crown will withdraw from regulating these areas in relation to the VGFN (see, e.g., Final Agreement, s. 13.1; Federal Act, s. 11(1)(a)). This focus on giving practical effect to the restoration of space for VGFN governance explains why significant portions of the VGFN agreements are devoted to the applicability (or inapplicability) of federal laws to VGFN citizens and the resolution of conflicts between federal and VGFN laws.\n[486] Of course, the Federal Act is an act of Parliament and is therefore subject to the Charter. Thus, Ms. Dickson may challenge the Federal Act or any of its provisions pursuant to the Charter. I note that in Stoffman, McKinney, and Harrison, there existed a network of provincial legislation concerning the structure and by-laws of hospitals or universities, any of which could be challenged under the Charter, yet the Charter was found not to apply to those entities\u2019 own activities. As in those cases, Ms. Dickson is not challenging the Federal Act itself or any of its provisions, but rather a provision found within the VGFN Constitution concerning the VGFN\u2019s internal governance structures.\n[487] Finally, the courts below and certain interveners seek to apply the Charter by analogizing the VGFN to Indian Act band councils or municipalities, which have been viewed as extensions of the federal and provincial governments respectively in the existing jurisprudence (see, e.g., I.F., Attorney General of Quebec, at para. 7; trial reasons, at paras. 124-25; C.A. reasons, at para. 84). These comparisons are misplaced.\n[488] Band councils are \u201ca creature of the Indian Act\u201d whose powers and constraints arise by virtue of federal legislation (Public Service Alliance of Canada v. Francis, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 72, at p. 78; see also pp. 76-77). By contrast, as I have explained, the VGFN Arrangements remove the band council layer of Crown-imposed governance and sever various connections to the federal government, in order for the Vuntut Gwitchin to restore and carry forward their own governance structures. I therefore disagree with the intervener the Attorney General of Quebec that it is [translation] \u201cillogical for Indian Act band councils to be subject to the Charter but for other Indigenous governance entities not to be\u201d (I.F., at para. 7). To the contrary, to proceed as if the Crown-imposed band council and the present-day VGFN are indistinguishable extensions of the federal government is to disregard the very purpose of the VGFN Arrangements and the \u201cincredible accomplishment of replacing the Indian Act with the VGFN Constitution\u201d (trial reasons, at para. 152; C.A. reasons, at para. 51).\n[489] Similarly, as I have previously noted, municipalities \u201cderive their existence and law-making authority from the provinces; that is, they exercise powers conferred on them by provincial legislatures\u201d (Godbout, at para. 51), and they are subject to the province\u2019s \u201cabsolute and unfettered legal power to do with them as it wills\u201d (Toronto (City), at para. 2, citing Ontario Public School Boards\u2019 Assn. v. Ontario (Attorney General) (1997), 151 D.L.R. (4th) 346 (Ont. C.J. (Gen. Div.)), at p. 361). This is clearly not the case with the VGFN\u2019s governance structures, whose autonomy the federal and Yukon governments have bound themselves to respect.\n[490] It is clear from the foregoing that the VGFN is not, by its nature, part of the apparatus of the federal government in the sense required under s. 32(1). Rather, its internal governance structures are rooted in the VGFN\u2019s own laws, customs, and practices. The VGFN Arrangements give the VGFN\u2019s unique governance structures effect within contemporary Canada through mutually binding commitments between the VGFN and the Crown.\nB. The Nature of the Residency Requirement\n[491] The second branch of the Eldridge framework involves an inquiry into the activity itself (Eldridge, at para. 44). In this case, the question is whether the residency requirement enacted by the VGFN can be \u201cascribed\u201d to either the federal or the Yukon government under s. 32(1) based on its nature. It is unclear whether Ms. Dickson relies on the second branch of Eldridge. While at times she targets the residency requirement specifically, her arguments extend to the entirety of the VGFN Constitution and all VGFN laws. She focuses on various provisions within the Federal Act to say that VGFN laws are given external force through the legislation and can therefore be ascribed to the Crown. However, even if one interprets her argument that the \u201cResidency Requirement . . . has the force of law in Canada pursuant to the Federal Act\u201d (R.F. on cross-appeal, at para. 31) as relating to the second branch of Eldridge, it must be rejected for the same reasons as those canvassed above. Moreover, as I explain below, there are additional considerations relating to the second branch of Eldridge which demonstrate that the Charter does not apply.\n[492] I note that my analysis under the second branch is confined to the particular activity in question in the present case: the VGFN\u2019s enactment of the residency requirement in its Constitution. I do not foreclose the possibility that other activities may satisfy the second branch of Eldridge on account of a significant connection to the federal or the Yukon government. However, each activity of a \u201cnon-governmental entit[y]\u201d (see Eldridge, at para. 41) must be examined on a case-by-case basis, and the only activity in question in this case is the enactment of the residency requirement.\n[493] It is clear that the decision to enact the residency requirement is an autonomous act of Vuntut Gwitchin governance, not a decision \u201cascribable\u201d to the federal government. The residency requirement is a provision of the VGFN\u2019s own Constitution. It was enacted by the VGFN, following a General Assembly with VGFN citizens, in keeping with the consensus-based practices of traditional Vuntut Gwitchin leadership selection (trial reasons, at para. 11). It was enacted to regulate the internal elections of the VGFN Council, which is one of the branches of VGFN government created by the Vuntut Gwitchin. It is clearly not the \u201cimplementation of a specific statutory scheme or a government program\u201d (Eldridge, at para. 44) of the federal government and does not constitute what is required under the second branch of Eldridge. There is no specific, identifiable federal policy akin to what was found in Eldridge, where the Court concluded that hospitals \u201cact as agents for the government in providing the specific medical services set out in the [Hospital Insurance Act]\u201d (para. 51). That finding was based on the legislation that hospitals operate under and with a clear connection to the mandate of the provincial government. As La Forest J. explained, \u201cit is the government, and not hospitals, that is responsible for defining both the content of the service to be delivered and the persons entitled to receive it\u201d (para. 49). Hospitals were \u201cmerely the vehicles the legislature has chosen to deliver this program\u201d (para. 50). Through its enactment of the residency requirement, the VGFN is not \u201cmerely the vehicl[e]\u201d for a policy choice of the federal government.\n[494] The case for applying the Charter to the residency requirement is even less compelling than in Stoffman, where the Charter was held not to apply to a hospital\u2019s by-laws. Although the by-laws were expressly subject to approval by the government before coming into force, they did not implement a specific governmental policy and were thus not subject to the Charter. Indeed, there was considerable variety between the by-laws adopted by different hospitals, which indicated that the policies were \u201cleft to the judgment of those entrusted with the responsibility of managing individual hospitals\u201d (p. 508). Not only can there be considerable variety in the constitutions of various Yukon First Nations, but there is nothing akin to the oversight found in Stoffman. This is to be expected for arrangements which are about VGFN self-government.\n[495] Thus, the VGFN Arrangements do not establish a \u201cdirect and . . . precisely-defined connection\u201d between the residency requirement and the federal government (Eldridge, at para. 51). As under the first branch of Eldridge, nothing in the VGFN Arrangements transform the VGFN\u2019s internal decision to enact the residency requirement into an activity ascribable to the Crown. The residency requirement reflects the VGFN\u2019s own decision about its own elected leaders. On a proper understanding of the VGFN Arrangements, the enactment of the residency requirement is not an act that can be ascribed to either the federal or the Yukon government in the sense required by s. 32(1).\nC. Summary\n[496] Taken together, none of the aspects of the VGFN Arrangements show that either branch of the Eldridge framework applies. To the contrary, they reinforce that the VGFN is distinct from the Crown, including in enacting the residency requirement pursuant to its own laws, customs, and practices. To apply the Charter in this case would amount to viewing the VGFN as an extension of the federal or the Yukon government, or its enactment of the residency requirement as ascribable to one of them. Such an understanding is not only inconsistent with the VGFN Arrangements, but is also inconsistent with the special relationship between the federal and territorial governments and the Vuntut Gwitchin.\nV. A Proper Application of Section 32(1) Promotes the Objective of Reconciliation\n[497] A faithful application of this Court\u2019s jurisprudence leads inexorably to the conclusion that the VGFN and its enactment of the residency requirement do not fall within the scope of s. 32(1) of the Charter. Underlying Ms. Dickson and the interveners\u2019 arguments on the Charter\u2019s applicability are, in reality, policy arguments: that the Charter\u2019s protections should apply, because the VGFN is a government with significant authority over its citizens, and the inapplicability of the Charter under s. 32(1) would amount to creating a \u201c\u2018Charter-free\u2019 zon[e]\u201d (R.F. on cross-appeal, at para. 43). Such policy arguments are not a sound basis in law to impose the Charter on the VGFN in a manner that effectively amends s. 32(1). Moreover, for the courts to impose the Charter on the VGFN would be contrary to the objective of reconciliation.\n[498] Both the Charter and the diversity of Indigenous legal traditions are concerned with the protection of human dignity, but the Charter represents only one way to achieve this (L. E. Trakman, \u201cNative Cultures in a Rights Empire Ending the Dominion\u201d (1997), 45 Buff. L. Rev. 189; M. Boldt and J. A. Long, \u201cTribal Philosophies and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\u201d, in M. Boldt and J. A. Long, eds., The Quest for Justice: Aboriginal Peoples and Aboriginal Rights (1985), 165; N. Metallic, \u201cChecking our Attachment to the Charter and Respecting Indigenous Legal Orders: A Framework for Charter Application to Indigenous Governments\u201d (2022), 31:2 Const. Forum 3, at p. 15). The Charter exhibits one conception of how the individual interacts with the state, inspired by liberal enlightenment philosophy (Van der Peet, at para. 18; T. S. Axworthy, \u201cColliding Visions: the Debate Over the Charter of Rights and Freedoms 1980-81\u201d, in Weiler and Elliot, Litigating the Values of a Nation (1986), 13, at p. 15; Strayer, at p. 219). Thus, it has been suggested that \u201cthe rights guaranteed in the Charter erect around each individual, metaphorically speaking, an invisible fence over which the state will not be allowed to trespass\u201d (R. v. Morgentaler, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 30, at p. 164, per Wilson J., concurring).\n[499] These philosophical underpinnings of the Charter may not necessarily be commensurate with some Indigenous worldviews (A. Swiffen, \u201cConstitutional Reconciliation and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\u201d (2019), 24 Rev. Const. Stud. 85, at pp. 110-12; K. McNeil, \u201cAboriginal Governments and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\u201d (1996), 34 Osgoode Hall L.J. 61; J. Y. Henderson, First Nations Jurisprudence and Aboriginal Rights: Defining the Just Society (2006)) and with the structure of Indigenous governing bodies which seek to \u201cmaintain . . . traditional structures integrated with contemporary forms of government\u201d (Self-Government Agreement, s. 2.1). For example, there may be tensions between the Charter\u2019s general focus on negative rights and certain communities\u2019 preference for a more relational, reciprocal understanding of \u201crelationships, duties, and responsibilities\u201d (Henderson, at p. 126; Boldt and Long, at p. 167). Some scholars have noted the potential for cultural disconnect between the Charter\u2019s anthropocentric focus on human rights-holders, and a more ecocentric or cosmocentric understanding of rights and responsibilities (A. Mills, \u201cThe Lifeworlds of Law: On Revitalizing Indigenous Legal Orders Today\u201d (2016), 61 McGill L.J. 847, at pp. 864-65; Boldt and Long, at p. 166; Manley-Casimir, at p. 953). Finally, depending on the systems upon which Indigenous governance structures are created, Indigenous communities may see the balance between individual and collective rights, and between individuals and the state, differently (Trakman, at pp. 193-94).\n[500] Even where the value systems and legal traditions of specific Indigenous communities point to the same result as the Charter, their mode of reasoning may differ. For example, Indigenous stories, customs, covenants, ceremonies and deliberative circles can be powerful sources of Indigenous law, including on the limits of government power (see, e.g., In re: Certified Questions II, 6 Nav. R. 105 (1989); Henderson, at pp. 127 and 163-77). These can form the basis for Indigenous communities to codify a charter of rights that is adapted to their culture, traditions, and outlook. Rather than a \u201cmonolithic form of rights analysis\u201d, Indigenous communities can craft protections for human rights which integrate their particular and distinct forms of Indigenous law (H. P. Glenn, Legal Traditions of the World: Sustainable Diversity in Law (5th ed. 2014), at p. 92). These alternative sources of rights and responsibilities can \u201cserve the goal of human dignity as effectively as a western code of human rights\u201d (p. 93). By contrast, the imposition of the Charter by the courts risks enabling litigants to \u201cconstitutionally interrogate the rich complexity of Aboriginal societies according to a rigid analytic grid of individual right and state obligation\u201d (P. Macklem, Indigenous Difference and the Constitution of Canada (2001), at p. 195).\n[501] Of course, the foregoing analysis is not to say that Charter protections are inherently in tension with the desires of Indigenous communities, including the VGFN. Indigenous value systems and legal traditions should not be treated as monolithic, and it should not be assumed that individual rights are necessarily in conflict with collective Indigenous governance (Metallic, at p. 15). Moreover, Indigenous communities are not static: interaction with other societies over centuries, and the adoption of different systems of governance via treaty, may increase the commensurability of Charter protections (G. Otis, \u201cLa gouvernance autochtone avec ou sans la Charte Canadienne?\u201d (2005), 36 Ottawa L. Rev. 207). The Charter remains an exceptional achievement, which explains why a variety of Indigenous groups, especially women\u2019s groups, have supported its content (see, e.g., Swiffen, at pp. 110-12; Metallic, at p. 6).\n[502] What is clear, however, is that the Charter should not be imposed on Indigenous communities. As noted by Professor McNeil, \u201c[f]or the Charter to be unilaterally imposed on their governments today through a questionable interpretation of section 32(1) would turn the clock back to a time when the Aboriginal peoples were often not given the opportunity to participate when important decisions affecting their constitutional rights were made\u201d (pp. 70-71). It is not for this Court to scrutinize the wisdom or fairness of the VGFN\u2019s choices by transposing an instrument designed by and for the federal and provincial governments onto the Vuntut Gwitchin, who did not participate in its creation or agree to its terms. To do so would be to subject the Vuntut Gwitchin to the sort of federal oversight from which it sought to remove itself through the VGFN Arrangements.\n[503] Some scholars suggest that s. 25 can serve as a flexible way to remedy such concerns, without sacrificing Charter protection (see, e.g., P. W. Hogg and M. E. Turpel, \u201cImplementing Aboriginal Self-Government: Constitutional and Jurisdictional Issues\u201d, in Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, Aboriginal Self-Government: Legal and Constitutional Issues (1995), 375; Otis). This position may have superficial appeal, but it does not withstand closer scrutiny. First, whether s. 25 is used as a shield or an interpretative prism, the VGFN is still \u201csubjected to having its legal order intensely scrutinized by standards foreign to it\u201d (Metallic, at p. 8). For example, on the proposed approach of the Attorney General of Canada, courts would be tasked with evaluating the prima facie engagement of a Charter right, whether there is a \u201ctrue conflict\u201d between the Charter right and the Aboriginal right, and if so, whether the exercise of the implicated right is necessary \u201cto the maintenance of the Indigenous group\u2019s distinctive culture\u201d (I.F., at para. 27). This is highly intrusive, calling for the VGFN to justify the exercise of its authority by reference to standards not of their own choosing.\n[504] Second, many claims may not be shielded by s. 25 at all. On the Attorney General of Canada\u2019s approach, s. 25 would be reserved for Aboriginal and treaty rights, and other rights of a \u201cconstitutional character\u201d (I.F., at para. 44, citing R. v. Kapp, 2008 SCC 41, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 483, at para. 63). Moreover, Indigenous governments would have the burden of demonstrating the existence of such a right or freedom. Decades of s. 35(1) litigation have shown that this is a lengthy and evidence-heavy process. As McLachlin C.J. noted in Haida Nation v. British Columbia (Minister of Forests), 2004 SCC 73, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 511, \u201cproving rights may take time, sometimes a very long time\u201d (para. 26). Ultimately, the s. 25 analysis would force Indigenous governments to expend significant resources in order to protect their laws from the scrutiny of an instrument which was imposed upon them.\n[505] As for policy arguments suggesting that the inapplicability of the Charter under s. 32(1) would create a \u201cCharter-free zone\u201d, such arguments are dismissive of Indigenous approaches to protecting their members. Indeed, they rest on the erroneous assumption that if the Charter is not imposed, Indigenous community members will have no protections.\n[506] Indigenous communities can and have enacted protections to regulate the interaction between members and their governments. A number of related approaches have been given effect across Canada. An Indigenous community can choose, on its own initiative, to implement an instrument that incorporates protections for members (as the federal and provincial governments did in enacting the Charter). Alternatively, it can commit via agreement or treaty \u2014 including through self-government agreements \u2014 to enact such an instrument. In either case, however, the Indigenous community plays an active role in deciding how it wants to craft such an instrument. Thus, it may enact \u2014 or agree to enact \u2014 its own protections rooted in its legal traditions; it may adopt an instrument that is inspired by the Charter; or it may even agree to the application of Charter protections. This may also be a subject of discussion among parties during the negotiation of self-government agreements. I note in passing that since 1995, Canada\u2019s negotiation policy has been to seek the insertion of a provision accepting the application of the Charter within self-government agreements (see, e.g., the Nisga\u2019a Final Agreement (1999) and the Tla\u2019amin Final Agreement (2014)). Numerous questions arise concerning the effect of such an agreement (e.g., is the actual Charter being applied, or are its protections being incorporated? How are such rights enforced, and by which adjudicative bodies? What happens if the Charter is amended pursuant to the amending formula between the federal and provincial governments?), but it is not possible to answer these questions in the present case.\n[507] What is crucial, and what the arguments of Ms. Dickson and certain interveners fail to appreciate, is that the foregoing avenues are a product of Indigenous choice. Indigenous communities can choose how to implement effective protections \u2014 whether on their own initiative or by mutual agreement with federal, provincial, and territorial authorities \u2014 rather than being subjected to the Charter via a distorted interpretation of s. 32(1). As I explained, taking reconciliation seriously means respecting Indigenous peoples\u2019 ability to \u201cdefine themselves and to choose by what means to make their decisions, according to their own laws, customs and practices\u201d (Desautel, at para. 86).\nVI. The VGFN Agreed to the Enactment of Its Own Rights Protections, Rather Than the Application of Charter Protections\n[508] This brings me to the final argument for the Charter\u2019s applicability to the VGFN and its enactment of the residency requirement. Ms. Dickson suggests that even if the Charter does not apply pursuant s. 32(1), the VGFN expressly agreed to the applicability of Charter protections to its Constitution and laws. This argument is without merit. The VGFN did not agree to the applicability of the Charter; to the contrary, it agreed to enact its own rights protection instrument that is similar to, but still distinct from, the Charter.\nA. The VGFN Arrangements Do Not Contain an Agreement as to the Applicability of the Charter\n[509] Neither the Final Agreement nor the Self-Government Agreement refers to the Charter. Ms. Dickson nonetheless relies on a number of provisions from these agreements to say that the VGFN \u201cclearly and unambiguously\u201d agreed to subject its Constitution and laws to the Charter (R.F. on cross-appeal, heading of para. 24).\n[510] First, Ms. Dickson relies on s. 24.1.2 of the Final Agreement, which provides:\n24.1.2 Subject to negotiation of an agreement pursuant to 24.1.1 and in conformity with the Constitution of Canada, the powers of a Yukon First Nation may include the powers to: . . . . [Emphasis added.]\nMs. Dickson observes that the Charter is, of course, part of the Constitution of Canada \u2014 specifically, Part I of the Constitution Act, 1982. In her submission, it follows that \u201cthe powers of a Yukon First Nation\u201d exercised under s. 24.1.2 must comply with the Charter. The trial judge and the Court of Appeal relied on s. 24.1.2 in concluding that the Charter applies to the residency requirement (see, e.g., trial reasons, at paras. 47 and 110-11; C.A. reasons, at para. 97).\n[511] This submission falls into many of the same misconceptions of the architecture of the Constitution as those examined above. It is entirely \u201cin conformity with the Constitution of Canada\u201d to abide by the clear language of s. 32(1), its history and place within the Constitution Act, 1982, and this Court\u2019s consistent jurisprudence on s. 32(1)\u2019s purpose and scope. As I have explained, it would not be in conformity with the Constitution of Canada to extend the application of the Charter to the VGFN. Section 24.1.2 of the Final Agreement cannot plausibly be understood as supplanting or altering a proper interpretation of s. 32(1), itself a provision of the Constitution of Canada.\n[512] There is much more to the Constitution of Canada than the Charter. Properly understood, s. 24.1.2 recognizes that the implementation of VGFN self-government was negotiated with the federal and territorial governments within Canada\u2019s overarching constitutional architecture. These structures include the division of powers under ss. 91 and 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867, as well as s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982. Such constitutional limitations are relevant, for example, to the negotiation process for the Self-Government Agreement. Indeed, s. 24.1.2 must be read in light of s. 24.1.1, which it directly follows and expressly references:\n24.1.1 Government shall enter into negotiations with each Yukon First Nation which so requests with a view to concluding self-government agreements appropriate to the circumstances of the affected Yukon First Nation.\nPlaced in its proper context, s. 24.1.2 confirms that the federal government could not have negotiated for self-government over matters falling within the exclusive authority of the provinces or territories under s. 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867, and vice versa. Nor could the federal or territorial government negotiate in a manner contrary to Aboriginal and treaty rights recognized and affirmed under s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. I note that the VGFN submits that s. 24.1.2 is limited to the federal and territorial governments\u2019 constitutional limitations in the negotiation process and does not condition the VGFN\u2019s own exercise of governance powers (R.F., at paras. 66-69). In my view, it is not necessary in the present case to comment on the interpretation of s. 24.1.2 in such a manner. It suffices to note that compliance with the Constitution of Canada by any of the involved signatories does not supplant a jurisprudentially faithful answer to the narrower question of the applicability of the Charter to the VGFN.\n[513] Second, Ms. Dickson relies on s. 24.1.3.1 of the Final Agreement, which provides:\n24.1.3 Self-government agreements shall not affect:\n24.1.3.1 the rights of Yukon Indian People as Canadian citizens;\nThis provision says nothing about the applicability of the Charter to the VGFN. VGFN citizens are simultaneously members of an Indigenous community and citizens of Canada (D. Panagos, Uncertain Accommodation: Aboriginal Identity and Group Rights in the Supreme Court of Canada (2016)). As citizens of Canada, they enjoy the same rights and freedoms as others in Canada in relation to the laws and actions of the federal and provincial governments. The federal and provincial governments continue to be burdened by these responsibilities as against VGFN citizens. However, nothing in s. 24.1.3.1 suggests that the VGFN agreed to the application of Charter protections beyond the scope provided for under s. 32(1). Section 24.1.3.1 of the Final Agreement is therefore of no assistance to Ms. Dickson.\n[514] Finally, Ms. Dickson relies on s. 13.5.1 of the Self-Government Agreement, which provides:\n13.5.1 Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, all laws of General Application shall continue to apply to the Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation, its Citizens and Settlement Land.\nThe term \u201claws of general application\u201d has a well-understood meaning in the context of the applicability of provincial laws to Indigenous peoples under s. 88 of the Indian Act. It refers to ordinary laws that extend uniformly throughout the territory and are not in relation to one class of citizens in object and purpose (Kruger v. The Queen, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 104, at p. 110). The term, as it is used in the Self-Government Agreement, cannot be understood as describing parts of the Constitution of Canada, which itself imposes limits on the scope of federal and provincial laws, including laws of general application.\n[515] Properly understood, s. 13.5.1 confirms that ordinary federal and territorial laws that extend uniformly across Canada or the Yukon will continue to apply to VGFN citizens. I observe also that ss. 13.5.2 and 13.5.3 of the Self-Government Agreement provide for processes by which the VGFN can supplant federal and territorial laws of general application with VGFN laws. If the Charter did indeed apply as a \u201cla[w] of general application\u201d, it would subvert the principle of constitutional supremacy to subordinate the Charter to a form of VGFN override. This could not have been the intention of the signatories when they agreed to s. 13.5.1. Rather, this provision was clearly intended to facilitate a smooth transition to VGFN self-governance without leaving gaps in existing regulatory structures.\n[516] In short, none of the provisions of the Final Agreement or the Self-Government Agreement suggest, much less \u201cclearly and unambiguously\u201d state, that the VGFN agreed to the applicability of the Charter. However, as I explain below, this does not mean that the VGFN fails to have regard to fundamental rights or freedoms, or that Canada and the Yukon did not, during negotiations, seek to ensure some measure of rights protections.\nB. The VGFN Has Enacted Its Own Rights Protections\n[517] The signatories to the Self-Government Agreement agreed to the following provision concerning the VGFN Constitution:\n10.1 The Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation Constitution shall:\n. . .\n10.1.4 recognize and protect the rights and freedoms of Citizens;\nFurthermore, s. 10.1.6 stipulates that the VGFN Constitution shall \u201cprovide for amending the Constitution by the Citizens\u201d \u2014 that is, the citizens of the VGFN. Just as the federal and provincial governments have had the authority to amend the Constitution of Canada since patriation in 1982, s. 10.1.6 provides that the VGFN is able to amend its own Constitution, including the instrument stipulated in s. 10.1.4 recognizing and protecting the rights and freedoms of citizens.\n[518] Section 10.1.4\u2019s inclusion in the Self-Government Agreement confirms the signatories\u2019 agreed-upon method for protecting the rights and freedoms of VGFN citizens in a manner that is reconcilable with Vuntut Gwitchin laws, customs, and practices. The provision makes no reference to the Charter. Instead, the signatories provided more generally for the recognition and protection of the rights and freedoms of citizens, without requiring the adoption of the exact rights and freedoms set out in the Charter, and while providing for the VGFN to amend those protections through its own governance structures.\n[519] The VGFN has made good on its commitments by adopting Article IV of its Constitution on the \u201cRights of Citizens\u201d. Much of Article IV is clearly inspired by the Charter, and many of the enumerated rights are nearly identical in wording to Charter rights. Despite these similarities, Article IV of the VGFN Constitution is uniquely tailored to the VGFN\u2019s own traditions, values, or priorities. For example, the VGFN has chosen to recognize Gwich\u2019in as its official language and to protect its use (Articles IV(15) to (18)). And the VGFN has enshrined a right to access personal information possessed or controlled by the VGFN government (Article IV(20)(a)) \u2014 a right with no analogue in the Charter. Crucially, for the purposes of the present case, the right to hold office in Vuntut Gwitchin Government is expressly \u201c[s]ubject to residency and other requirements set out in Vuntut Gwitchin Law\u201d (Article IV(4)). The residency requirement itself is part of the VGFN Constitution under Article XI(2) and was added pursuant to constitutional amendments in 2006. The VGFN has thus elevated its view of the importance of its leaders residing on Settlement Land to constitutional status, pursuant to its own priorities and its own values for community leadership.\n[520] Article IV of the VGFN Constitution exemplifies how an Indigenous community can enact protections for fundamental rights and freedoms that are commensurate with its own laws, customs, and practices. Contrary to the suggestions of Ms. Dickson and various interveners, it is not the case that individual rights are not respected by the VGFN or that VGFN citizens are deprived of fundamental rights and exist in a rights-free zone. The VGFN has constitutionally entrenched rights and freedoms \u2014 many of which mirror those in the Charter \u2014 alongside procedures for VGFN citizens to challenge VGFN laws.\n[521] Indeed, Ms. Dickson\u2019s own petition pursued an alternative claim that the residency requirement was invalid under the VGFN Constitution. This claim under the VGFN Constitution was mentioned briefly by the trial judge, but the courts below did not decide the claim on the merits, preferring to resolve the case under the Charter. The VGFN argues that Ms. Dickson\u2019s claim is properly addressed under the VGFN Constitution, rather than under the Charter. I agree. Ms. Dickson seeks to challenge an internal rule of the VGFN in order to participate in its governance; her claim must be addressed based on the rights enshrined within the VGFN Constitution, pursuant to the VGFN\u2019s own governance structures and processes.\nVII. Conclusion\n[522] The VGFN governs the affairs of the Vuntut Gwitchin pursuant to its own governance structures and processes. This fulfills the goal of self-government enshrined in the VGFN Arrangements: to restore the Vuntut Gwitchin to a place wherein they make and implement decisions according to their own laws, customs, and practices. Having regard to the architecture of the Constitution Act, 1982, the relationship between Indigenous peoples and the federal and provincial governments, and the jurisprudence of this Court, it is my view that decisions about how to implement protections for the fundamental rights and freedoms of its citizens also rest with the VGFN. This in no way lessens the rights and freedoms that they enjoy vis-\u00e0-vis the federal and provincial governments under the Charter as citizens of Canada. Giving effect to Vuntut Gwitchin self-government is a critical part of the promise of reconciliation. This necessarily entails the right for the Vuntut Gwitchin themselves to decide what is fair and just in accordance with those rights and freedoms that they choose to enshrine in their own Constitution.\n[523] I would dismiss Ms. Dickson\u2019s appeal and allow the VGFN\u2019s cross-appeal, on the basis that the Charter does not apply to the VGFN\u2019s enactment of the residency requirement, and set aside the orders of the lower courts.\nAppeal and cross\u2011appeal dismissed, Rowe J. dissenting on the cross\u2011appeal and Martin and O\u2019Bonsawin JJ. dissenting on the appeal.\nSolicitors for the appellant\/respondent on cross\u2011appeal: Fasken Martineau DuMoulin, Vancouver; Ruby Shiller Enenajor DiGiuseppe, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the respondent\/appellant on cross\u2011appeal: Mandell Pinder, Vancouver.\nSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Canada: Attorney General of Canada, Department of Justice Canada \u2014 National Litigation Sector, Ottawa.\nSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Quebec: Minist\u00e8re de la Justice du Qu\u00e9bec \u2014 Direction du droit constitutionnel et autochtone, Qu\u00e9bec.\nSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Alberta: Alberta Justice \u2014 Constitutional and Aboriginal Law, Edmonton.\nSolicitor for the intervener the Government of Yukon: Department of Justice, Legal Services Branch, Whitehorse.\nSolicitors for the intervener the British Columbia Treaty Commission: Blake, Cassels & Graydon, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the interveners the M\u00e9tis Nation of Ontario and the M\u00e9tis Nation of Alberta: Pape Salter Teillet, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the intervener the Carcross\/Tagish First Nation: Woodward & Company Lawyers, Whitehorse.\nSolicitors for the intervener the Teslin Tlingit Council: Ratcliff, North Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the intervener the Congress of Aboriginal Peoples: Paliare Roland Rosenberg Rothstein, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the intervener the Council of Yukon First Nations: Boughton Law Corporation, Vancouver.\nSolicitor for the intervener the Pan-Canadian Forum on Indigenous Rights and the Constitution: Universit\u00e9 de Moncton, Moncton.\nSolicitors for the intervener the Canadian Constitution Foundation: McCarthy T\u00e9trault, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the intervener the Band Members Alliance and Advocacy Association of Canada: MacKenzie Fujisawa, Vancouver.\nSolicitor for the intervener the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations: Bruce J.

At the same time, the parties concluded an offsets contract pursuant to which the Canadian company would subcontract some of the work associated with the aircraft procurement to Greek companies. The offsets contract provided that the Canadian company would owe HMOD liquidated damages if it did not fulfil its subcontracting obligations. Payment of these liquidated damages was secured by a letter of credit issued by a Greek bank in favour of HMOD (\u201cGreek Letter of Guarantee\u201d). A second letter of credit was issued by a Canadian bank in favour of the Greek bank to secure payment of the amounts that the latter would be required to pay HMOD under the Greek Letter of Guarantee should HMOD state that the Canadian company failed to perform its obligations under the offsets contract (\u201cCanadian Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee\u201d). Disputes under the offsets contract were to be resolved by an arbitral tribunal under the rules of the International Chamber of Commerce (\u201cICC\u201d).\nWhen the Canadian company determined that it would be unable to meet its subcontracting obligations under the offsets contract, an ICC Arbitral Tribunal was constituted and arbitration hearings took place. HMOD formally undertook not to demand payment under the Greek Letter of Guarantee for as long as the arbitration procedure was ongoing. However, while the issuance of the final award was still pending, HMOD repeatedly demanded payment from the Greek bank. The Canadian company sought and obtained an order from the ICC Arbitral Tribunal preventing HMOD from demanding payment under the Greek Letter of Guarantee until issuance of the final award. It also sought and obtained provisional injunctions from the Superior Court of Quebec to prevent payment under the Greek Letter of Guarantee and the Canadian Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee. Despite this, HMOD made a final demand for payment, seven days before the final award was set to be released, and said that the Greek bank would be subject to civil and criminal legal measures if it refused to pay. The Greek bank paid HMOD under the Greek Letter of Guarantee, and the Greek bank then demanded payment from the Canadian bank under the Canadian Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee.\nThe ICC Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s final award decided that the offsets contract violated European Union law such that it was null and void ab initio and that no liquidated damages were due by the Canadian company to HMOD. In response to the final award, the Greek bank commenced proceedings before Greek courts, where it unsuccessfully sought to recover the money that it had paid to HMOD. The Greek courts decided that the conduct of HMOD under the Greek Letter of Guarantee was not fraudulent under Greek law. In parallel proceedings before Quebec courts, the Canadian company sought a permanent injunction enjoining the Canadian bank from paying the Greek bank under the Canadian Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee. It argued that the fraud exception to an issuing bank\u2019s near absolute duty to honour a demand for payment under a letter of credit applied to the Greek bank as beneficiary under the Canadian Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee. Given that HMOD\u2019s conduct was fraudulent, the Greek bank\u2019s demand for payment under the Canadian Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee was, by extension, also fraudulent. The trial judge held that the manner in which HMOD obtained payment under the Greek Letter of Guarantee was fraudulent, and that the Greek bank\u2019s own conduct was fraudulent because its payment to HMOD was a result of fraud of which it was aware. He thus enjoined the Canadian bank from paying any amount to the Greek bank under the Canadian Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee. The Greek bank appealed. The Court of Appeal dismissed its appeal, holding that it was open to the trial judge to conclude that the Canadian bank was not bound to pay the Greek bank as beneficiary under the Canadian Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee, since the Greek bank had sufficient knowledge of the fraud prior to paying under the Greek Letter of Guarantee.\nHeld (Karakatsanis and C\u00f4t\u00e9 JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Wagner C.J. and Rowe, Martin, Kasirer, Jamal, O\u2019Bonsawin and Moreau JJ.: The fraud exception applies with respect to the Greek bank\u2019s demand for payment under the Canadian Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee. Given that the Greek bank, as the beneficiary of the Canadian Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee, knew of and participated in fraud by HMOD, that fraud can be attributed to the Greek bank as its own. The requirement that there be fraud by the beneficiary is therefore met. Moreover, there is no question that the Greek bank\u2019s fraud was brought to the attention of the Canadian bank as issuer of the Canadian Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee. On that basis, the Canadian bank was rightly enjoined by the trial judge from paying out any amount under the Canadian Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee to the Greek bank and the majority of the Court of Appeal made no error in confirming that conclusion.\nA letter of credit is an instrument understood to be autonomous from the underlying contract to which it speaks that is issued by a financial institution at the behest of its customer. It entitles the beneficiary of the letter to payment on demand from the issuing bank, so long as that demand conforms to the requirements set out in the letter of credit. Commonly relied upon in domestic and international commercial transactions, letters of credit are widely used as a means of managing risk. They are issued in order to ensure that the beneficiary will be paid what they believe they are owed under an underlying contract. A demand for payment will typically arise when there is an allegation of failure of the customer or account party to perform some duty as agreed. The premise is pay now, and argue later if necessary. It is the issuing financial institution who takes on the risk of not being paid by their client.\nThere are two fundamental principles to the law governing letters of credit: autonomy and strict compliance. Autonomy means that a letter of credit is an independent obligation of the issuing or confirming bank. The obligation of the issuing bank to honour a valid demand for payment is independent of the performance of the underlying contract for which the credit was issued. The bank undertakes to pay the beneficiary provided that specified conditions are met. The bank\u2019s customer may ultimately have a claim against the beneficiary, but that is typically not the financial institution\u2019s concern, since the letter of credit ensures that the beneficiary is paid in the meantime. Strict compliance means that the obligation of the issuing bank must be determined based only on the strict conformity of the presentation (including conformity of the documents presented) with the terms of the letter of credit. It requires not only that the tendered documents conform to the terms and conditions of the letter of credit but that they appear on their face, upon reasonably careful examination, to be consistent with one another. The test does not require perfection. It is possible, in clearly appropriate cases, to overlook immaterial discrepancies.\nFraud is the only exception recognized in Canadian law to the issuing bank\u2019s obligation to pay the beneficiary on demand. When there is fraud by the beneficiary of the credit which has been sufficiently brought to the knowledge of the bank before payment or demonstrated to a court called on by the customer of the bank to issue an interlocutory injunction, the issuing bank need not honour the draft. The potential scope of the fraud exception must be properly circumscribed. It should be sufficiently inclusive to capture most conduct that should not be facilitated through letters of credit, yet at the same time, if it is too inclusive, letters of credit could become much less reliable. To achieve a balance, the standard set for fraud is high. \u201cFraud\u201d in this context must import some aspect of impropriety, dishonesty or deceit. A key feature of civil or commercial fraud is its effect on the demand for payment by the beneficiary. If a beneficiary demands payment while knowing that they have no right to be paid under the underlying contract, that conduct may amount to fraud. Whether it does is an issue of mixed fact and law for which deference is owed on appeal.\nThe fraud exception is no less applicable when a second letter of credit is issued by a financial institution that requires it to pay when presented with an attestation that a first letter of credit has been called upon. Indeed, the conduct of a beneficiary under a counter\u2011guarantee may serve to make the fraud of a third party its own. In such a case, the fraud exception applies directly to the demand of the beneficiary. However, the fraud of a third party to a letter of credit does not engage the fraud exception where the beneficiary to the letter is innocent of that fraud. To accept otherwise would unduly expand the fraud exception at the expense of the reliability of letters of credit.\nA beneficiary ceases to be innocent when they have knowledge of the fraud of a third party and participate in that fraud. When there is both knowledge and participation, the third party\u2019s fraud can fairly be attributed to the beneficiary as the beneficiary\u2019s own. This is not indirect or vicarious liability but is merely an application of the fraud exception to the beneficiary of the relevant letter of credit.\nIn the instant case, the trial judge\u2019s finding that HMOD engaged in fraud is entitled to deference. His determination that HMOD engaged in some measure of impropriety that could amount to fraud is amply supported by the evidence. The evidence supports a finding that HMOD engaged in a fraudulent attempt to circumvent the ICC Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s interim order and final award by repeating its demand for payment around one week before the final award was released and, after the final award was issued and it became clear that HMOD had not right under the offsets contract to the money that it received, by not returning the money. In addition, there is no basis to interfere with the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that the Greek bank had clear knowledge of HMOD\u2019s fraud and that it actively participated in HMOD\u2019s fraud by paying HMOD in improper circumstances. The Greek bank\u2019s employees who made the decision to pay HMOD knew that HMOD was enjoined from demanding payment under the Greek Letter of Guarantee and that the issuance of the final arbitral award was imminent. The Greek bank was not merely suspicious that HMOD demanded payment contrary to the interim order; it clearly knew that this was happening. At the very least, this suggests that the Greek bank knew that the demand for payment was made in contravention of at least one order, which, in the circumstances, amounts to clear knowledge of the fraudulent conduct of HMOD. Because it knew of and participated in HMOD\u2019s fraud, the Greek bank became the co\u2011author of that fraud and must, for the purposes of the fraud exception, bear responsibility for it. As the beneficiary of the Canadian Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee, it is the Greek bank\u2019s fraud that is actionable before Quebec courts.\nAs for the judgments of the Greek courts, they have no decisive relevance in measuring the conduct of HMOD and the Greek bank. Absent a successful application for recognition and enforcement, foreign judgments are merely evidence and the weight given to them is an issue of fact to which deference is owed on appeal. A decision to place little or no weight on an unenforceable foreign judgment can be justified if that decision does not give proper consideration to relevant Canadian judgments or raises other public order concerns. Here, the foreign courts concluded that a party can disregard an order of an arbitral tribunal to which it had agreed to be subject. In the circumstances, both the trial judge and the Court of Appeal expressly opted to give no weight to the decisions of the Greek courts. No reviewable error has been shown.\nPer Karakatsanis and C\u00f4t\u00e9 JJ. (dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the action instituted by the Canadian company against the Greek and Canadian banks should be dismissed. To conclude otherwise would dismiss as irrelevant the decisions of the Greek courts, which cannot be ignored. International comity is an essential guiding principle when considering or enforcing foreign judgments. In the instant case, there is no public policy rationale for not giving weight to the judgments of the Greek courts. Taking them into account, HMOD\u2019s demand for payment under the Greek Letter of Guarantee was neither fraudulent nor tantamount to fraud; and, even if it were, the Greek bank would be innocent of that fraud. There is an inherent contradiction in the requirement that a reviewing court place itself in the position of the issuing bank at the time of payment to assess whether it had sufficient knowledge of any fraud, but at the exact same time discard the decisions of the courts of competent jurisdiction that were binding on that bank. Thus, the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that the fraud exception applies cannot stand.\nThe Greek Letter of Guarantee and the Canadian Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee in this case are best referred to as demand guarantees. Demand guarantees, like letters of credit, are contracts established at the request of a principal whereby the guarantor, usually a bank, irrevocably promises to pay the beneficiary on demand, irrespective of any ongoing dispute between the principal and the beneficiary. While the terms and conditions for payment of a demand guarantee reflect the underlying contract, the guarantor undertakes to pay regardless of external facts or events. In this sense, the demand guarantee is independent from the underlying contract; it is autonomous in nature. When parties to a commercial transaction agree to use demand guarantees to secure the performance of their obligations, they express their intention to be bound by a \u201cpay now, argue later\u201d structure. The guarantor\u2019s obligation to pay is triggered solely on the terms and conditions specified by the principal. Once the terms and conditions are set, the only control that the bank may exercise is over the regularity of the documents tendered by the beneficiary. The fundamental rule is that the documents must appear on their face, upon reasonably careful examination, to be in accordance with the terms and conditions of the letter of credit. The bank\u2019s role as a guarantor is thus simple. It must pay when presented with a compliant demand, and cannot investigate the circumstances of the underlying contract to determine whether the obligation secured by the demand guarantee was performed. The bank does not have the specialized skill and experience to be a referee on matters that divide the parties to the secured contract, and it should not and is not expected to enter into controversies between the parties to the underlying contract.\nThe guarantor\u2019s obligation to pay when presented with a compliant demand is subject to one exception \u2014 fraud. The principal has two options to prevent payment under a demand guarantee: it can seek an interlocutory injunction from a court of competent jurisdiction to restrain the bank from honouring the demand by establishing a strong prima facie case of fraud, or it can present sufficient evidence of fraud to the guarantor before payment is made. Payment should be refused only in the rare cases where the guarantor has clear or obvious knowledge of the fraud. \u201cClear or obvious knowledge\u201d is a high standard in that the fraud must be blatantly apparent. What is \u201cclear or obvious\u201d fraud in a legal sense is not necessarily \u201cclear or obvious\u201d in a commercial sense. That is why, when a court is asked to review the legality of a bank\u2019s decision to honour its obligation to pay pursuant to a demand guarantee, it must place itself in the exact same situation that the bank was in at that time, without resorting to ex post facto reasoning. The exception must be kept narrow: the potential scope of the fraud exception must not be a means of creating serious uncertainty and a lack of confidence in the operation of demand guarantees; at the same time the application of the principle of autonomy must not serve to encourage or facilitate fraud in such transactions.\nCourts can look to either the tendered documents or the underlying contract to detect fraud. However, an allegation of fraud is not an invitation for courts to allow sophisticated commercial parties to refashion their agreement to an \u201cargue now, pay later\u201d structure when the bar is not met. Fraud is a high bar, and the exception will not apply where the principal can only prove conduct amounting to something less than fraud. Fraud in this context involves some aspect of public order \u2014 bad faith alone is not enough \u2014 and it has to be tailored to the specific context of demand guarantees. The case must be one where the demand on the guarantee is utterly without justification or where it is apparent there is no right to payment.\nFraud committed by a third party should not prevent an innocent beneficiary from demanding payment on a demand guarantee. In the context of a letter of guarantee backed by a counter\u2011guarantee, fraud committed by the beneficiary of the guarantee will always be third\u2011party fraud for the purposes of the counter\u2011guarantee. Where the guarantor has clear or obvious knowledge of the beneficiary\u2019s fraud under the letter of guarantee but decides to pay nonetheless, that fraud can be attributed to the guarantor. What triggers the demand for payment under a counter\u2011guarantee is payment under the guarantee. To determine whether a beneficiary\u2019s demand for payment under a counter\u2011guarantee was fraudulent, a court must look past the clear line of separation between the guarantee and the counter\u2011guarantee. This inquiry must not be transformed, however, into a dispute over the underlying contract.\nIn the instant case, the trial judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal erred by not giving any weight to the judgments of the Greek courts. Had these judgments been considered as facts informing the conduct of HMOD and of the Greek bank for the purposes of assessing whether the fraud exception applies to the Canadian Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee, the only possible conclusion would have been that HMOD\u2019s demand under the Greek Letter of Guarantee and the Greek bank\u2019s decision to pay were valid. It is irrelevant that the Greek judgments were not formally recognized and therefore not enforceable in Quebec, since the Greek Letter of Guarantee was governed by Greek law and the parties to this letter were not domiciled in Quebec. There would have been no reason to seek the recognition and enforcement of the Greek judgments because there was simply nothing in these decisions to be enforced in Quebec.\nFurthermore, while the Greek judgments are not binding on the Quebec courts, the principle of comity must guide any determination regarding the weight to be given to them. When foreign judgments are received in evidence without being formally recognized in Quebec, they are still prima facie proof of the reported facts, of the proper application of the foreign law and of the foreign court\u2019s jurisdiction over the matter, under art. 2822 C.C.Q. They cannot simply be ignored by Quebec courts, who must recognize the factual effect of those decisions. A foreign decision introduced as evidence is a factual constraint on the Quebec courts and should be treated as such. Although a trial judge is free to determine the appropriate weight to be given to a foreign decision in light of all the evidence, they cannot second-guess the reported facts or the proper application of the foreign law by the foreign court. This is precisely what the trial judge failed to do. Further, the public order exception in arts. 3081 and 3155(5) C.C.Q. cannot serve as a basis for disregarding the factual effect of the Greek judgments. Giving a factual effect to a foreign decision is very different from a Quebec court applying foreign law, recognizing that decision, or incorporating its solution into Quebec\u2019s legal order.\nIn light of all of the evidence, which includes the Greek judgments, the trial judge\u2019s ultimate conclusion that the requirements for the fraud exception were met cannot stand. The trial judge failed to interpret as a whole HMOD\u2019s undertaking not to demand payment under the Greek Letter of Guarantee as long as the arbitration procedure was ongoing and until the final award was rendered. HMOD could validly withdraw its undertaking, and it was no longer in effect when HMOD demanded payment. Drawing on the Greek Letter of Guarantee in this context thus cannot be a basis for a finding of fraud. It was also an error for the trial judge to conclude that HMOD\u2019s conduct was fraudulent on the basis of either the ICC Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s interim order or one of the Superior Court\u2019s provisional injunctions, which were not enforceable in Greece. As to the timing of HMOD\u2019s demand for payment, although it may be tempting to look at HMOD\u2019s conduct after the fact, doing so would constitute impermissible reasoning. On the face of the Greek Letter of Guarantee, HMOD could validly demand payment when it did.\nFinally, even if HMOD\u2019s conduct was fraudulent or tantamount to fraud for the purposes of the Canadian Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee, in light of all the evidence, the Greek bank (the beneficiary) must be considered innocent of HMOD\u2019s (the third party) alleged fraud for the purposes of that letter. In assessing whether the Greek bank had clear or obvious knowledge of the alleged fraud, the Court must place itself in the exact same situation that the Greek bank was in by standing in its shoes, and therefore confine itself to the facts as the Greek bank knew them on the date when payment to HMOD was made. The Greek bank was faced with a judgment from a court of competent jurisdiction \u2014 the only court of competent jurisdiction for the purposes of the Greek Letter of Guarantee \u2014 which found that HMOD could validly draw on the Greek Letter of Guarantee. This decision, as a factual constraint, is a determinative element in the analysis of the Greek bank\u2019s clear or obvious knowledge. In reality, only one decision was enforceable against the Greek bank at the time, and this decision did not enjoin it from paying HMOD. Given the autonomous nature of the guarantee and lack of an operative injunction, the Greek bank had no choice but to pay. The conduct of the Greek bank was that of an innocent beneficiary under the Canadian Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee. It did not participate in any fraud, nor did it have clear or obvious knowledge of alleged fraud at the time of payment. The requirements for the fraud exception were not met, and in consequence, the autonomy of the Canadian Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee had to prevail.\nCases Cited\nBy Kasirer J.\nApplied: Bank of Nova Scotia v.

Overview\n[1] This appeal invites the Court to determine when, by reason of the fraud exception recognized in Canadian law, an issuing bank must refuse to honour a demand for payment under a letter of credit. The debate in this case has fixed on allegations of fraud brought against a third party to the disputed letter of credit. When will the fraudulent conduct of a stranger to a letter of credit be attributable to that letter\u2019s beneficiary, as the beneficiary\u2019s own fraud, thereby requiring the issuing bank to refuse a demand for payment under the fraud exception?\n[2] At the heart of this dispute is a Letter of Counter-Guarantee governed by Quebec law. This letter of credit was issued by the National Bank of Canada at the behest of its customer, Bombardier inc., in favour of a Greek bank, Eurobank Ergasias S.A. By arranging the issuance of this letter of credit, Bombardier sought to facilitate a complex transaction for the supply of aircraft to the Hellenic Ministry of Defense, or \u201cHMOD\u201d. Eurobank issued a distinct Letter of Guarantee in favour of HMOD, again at Bombardier\u2019s request, that is subject to Greek law. The plan for the interlocking letters of credit was straightforward: should HMOD call on Eurobank to honour the Greek Letter of Guarantee, Eurobank would be entitled to call on the National Bank to reimburse it under the Quebec Letter of Counter-Guarantee.\n[3] When HMOD demanded payment under the Greek letter of credit, Bombardier sought an injunction before the Quebec Superior Court to stop the National Bank from honouring a subsequent demand for payment by Eurobank as beneficiary under the Quebec Letter of Counter-Guarantee. Bombardier has alleged that HMOD \u2014 a third party to the Quebec letter \u2014 committed fraud under that instrument and that, by reason of Eurobank\u2019s knowledge and participation in that fraud, the National Bank should be prevented from honouring Eurobank\u2019s demand for payment based on the fraud exception. If the credit is honoured by the National Bank, Bombardier would of course be liable to its bank for that amount. That is unfair, says Bombardier, because an arbitration tribunal to which the parties had submitted their differences decided that Bombardier did not owe the relevant funds to HMOD.\n[4] The narrow question on appeal to this Court is whether fraud committed by HMOD under the Greek letter of credit can be attributed to Eurobank as its own as beneficiary of the Quebec letter of credit. In that event, says Bombardier, the fraud exception to the autonomous character of letters of credit should apply to Eurobank. This would mean that the National Bank must refuse the beneficiary\u2019s demand for payment under the Quebec letter as fraudulent. In an alternative argument, Bombardier takes the view that because the underlying contract is null, so too are the letters of credit connected to it, notwithstanding the principle of autonomy that governs such letters.\n[5] In Bank of Nova Scotia v. Angelica-Whitewear Ltd., [1987] 1 S.C.R. 59, the Court recognized the fraud exception to an issuing bank\u2019s near absolute duty to honour a demand for payment under a letter of credit. Writing for the Court, Le Dain J. carefully sought to balance two competing policy objectives that he described as being in \u201ctension\u201d in the law: the importance to international commerce that banks respect the autonomous character of letters of credit and the importance of suppressing fraud in transactions (p. 72). On the one hand, widening the fraud exception might undermine the reliability of letters of credit; on the other hand, turning a blind eye to fraud might encourage misconduct in letter transactions. Le Dain J. concluded that the fraud exception should be confined to cases of obvious fraud of the beneficiary that is so egregious that the legitimacy of the supporting letter of credit can no longer be assumed. The bar for the fraud exception was set high. In keeping with this careful balance and high bar, he wrote, the exception should not extend to the fraud of a third party of which the beneficiary is \u201cinnocent\u201d (p. 84).\n[6] We are now asked to consider if the fraud exception can extend to fraud by a third party and in what circumstances the beneficiary\u2019s conduct \u2014 in this case Eurobank\u2019s \u2014 will not be viewed as \u201cinnocent\u201d. Specifically, the Court must decide whether, by reason of its connection to the third party HMOD\u2019s misdeeds, Eurobank must answer for that fraud as its own.\n[7] The factual and legal setting is made complex by these interlocking letters of credit that are governed by different laws. It is made more complicated still in that Greek courts have decided that HMOD\u2019s conduct under the Letter of Guarantee was not fraudulent under Greek law.\n[8] That said, in the proceedings relevant to this appeal, Bombardier sought an injunction in the Quebec Superior Court. Those proceedings fix our attention only on Quebec law and only on the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. And while judgments of the Greek courts have spoken to HMOD\u2019s responsibility under the Greek Letter of Guarantee, no one has petitioned the Quebec courts for their recognition and enforcement under the relevant provisions of the Civil Code of Qu\u00e9bec (\u201cC.C.Q.\u201d).\n[9] To answer whether the National Bank must refuse payment to Eurobank under the fraud exception, we need not opine on the validity of the Letter of Guarantee under Greek law nor measure HMOD\u2019s conduct under Greek law. These questions are the proper province of the Greek courts and cannot decide the matter before this Court that turns on whether the fraud exception applies to the Letter of Counter-Guarantee, governed as it is by Quebec law.\n[10] Eurobank has urged the Court in written and oral argument \u2014 mistakenly in my respectful view \u2014 to undertake an analysis of the fraud exception in the context of the Letter of Guarantee. Eurobank does so, no doubt, thinking that we will be convinced by judgments of the Greek courts concluding that there was no fraud by HMOD under the Greek letter of credit. But that is not the question on appeal before this Court, and since recognition and enforcement of these foreign decisions has not been obtained before the Quebec courts, those judgments cannot decide the matter. Instead, we must first ask whether HMOD\u2019s conduct amounted to fraud by a third party under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee as governed by Quebec law. If so, we must then decide whether the fraud exception applies to Eurobank as beneficiary under the Quebec letter, on the basis of its own conduct, according to the Canadian standard set forth in Angelica-Whitewear.\n[11] To my mind, where fraud by a third party is established on the facts and a beneficiary under a letter of credit governed by Quebec law knows of that fraud and participates in it, the fraud becomes the beneficiary\u2019s own. The fraud exception then applies, and the issuer must be stopped from paying the beneficiary.\n[12] Here, the trial judge decided, as a matter of fact, that HMOD acted fraudulently. He found too that Eurobank knew of HMOD\u2019s fraud and nevertheless demanded payment under the Quebec Letter of Counter-Guarantee. In a word, Eurobank was not \u201cinnocent\u201d because it was aware of the third-party fraud and participated in it. Like the majority judges in the Court of Appeal, I see no reviewable errors in these findings nor in the trial judge\u2019s ultimate conclusion: HMOD\u2019s fraud is attributable to Eurobank as its own and Eurobank cannot, as beneficiary under the Quebec letter, demand payment.\n[13] On this basis, I would dismiss the appeal and confirm the conclusion that the National Bank should be enjoined from honouring Eurobank\u2019s demand for payment under the fraud exception recognized in Angelica-Whitewear. In the circumstances, I find it unnecessary to decide whether the letters of credit are null.\nII. Background\n[14] Understanding this appeal requires a brief description of the four principal actors, the two underlying contracts and the two interlocking letters of credit.\nA. The Relevant Actors\n[15] Bombardier inc., a respondent in this appeal and plaintiff in the originating proceedings, is a Canadian aviation company. Its head office is in Montreal, Quebec.\n[16] Eurobank Ergasias S.A. (together with its predecessors, \u201cEurobank\u201d), the appellant and a defendant before the Superior Court, is a Greek bank. One of its predecessors was the issuer of the Letter of Guarantee. Eurobank is the beneficiary of the Letter of Counter-Guarantee.\n[17] The General Directorate for Defense Armaments and Investments of the Hellenic Ministry of National Defense is designated as an appellant in this appeal and a defendant in first instance. It is responsible for military procurement for the Hellenic Republic. As it notes in its written argument, HMOD did not file appeals from the trial judgment or the judgment of the Court of Appeal because it does not recognize the jurisdiction of Quebec courts over it, but stated it was \u201cduty-bound\u201d to address before our Court points it raised in the courts below (A.F., HMOD, at para. 96).\n[18] The National Bank of Canada, the second respondent in this appeal, is a Canadian bank. Its head office is in Montreal. The National Bank is the issuer of the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. It was named as a defendant in the originating proceedings by Bombardier, its customer, who sought to stop the bank from making payment which would ultimately be to Bombardier\u2019s detriment. The National Bank takes positions that are consonant with Bombardier\u2019s views of an issuing bank\u2019s responsibility under a letter of credit. In particular, the National Bank joins Bombardier in asking that Eurobank not be paid under the Quebec letter and that the present appeal be dismissed.\nB. The Underlying Contracts\n[19] In 1998, HMOD entered into a procurement contract with Bombardier for the purchase of 10 firefighting amphibious aircraft for US$252,151,899. The contract is governed by Greek law.\n[20] At the same time, Bombardier and HMOD concluded an \u201cOffsets Contract\u201d, pursuant to which Bombardier agreed to subcontract some of the work associated with the aircraft procurement to Greek companies. Also governed by Greek law, the Offsets Contract provides that Bombardier would owe HMOD liquidated damages at the end of a 10-year term if it did not fulfil its subcontracting obligations. It was agreed that payment of these liquidated damages would be secured by a letter of credit issued by a Greek bank in favour of HMOD. The Offsets Contract also directs that disputes will be resolved by an arbitration tribunal, to be seated in Paris, under the rules of the International Chamber of Commerce (\u201cICC\u201d).\nC. The Letters of Credit\n[21] One of Eurobank\u2019s predecessors, ANZ Grindlays Bank Limited, also a Greek bank, issued the Letter of Guarantee in favour of HMOD on February 5, 1999, in the amount of US$27,736,709 to secure payment of the liquidated damages Bombardier would owe pursuant to the Offsets Contract. The Letter of Guarantee is governed by Greek law. Under the Offsets Contract, HMOD was responsible for reducing the amount of the Letter of Guarantee as Bombardier fulfilled its subcontracting obligations. In June 2010, the Letter of Guarantee was reduced to US$13,868,354.60.\n[22] The National Bank issued the Letter of Counter-Guarantee in favour of Eurobank on January 29, 1999, to secure payment of the amounts that Eurobank would be required to pay HMOD under the Letter of Guarantee should HMOD state that Bombardier failed to perform its obligations under the Offsets Contract. HMOD is not a party to the Letter of Counter-Guarantee, which is governed by Quebec law. The Letter of Counter-Guarantee provides that the \u201cNational Bank of Canada hereby irrevocably undertake[s] to reimburse [Eurobank] all amount(s) claimed by the beneficiary of [its Letter of] Guarantee\u201d (A.R., vol. IV, at p. 118). It states further that payment would be made under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee by the issuing National Bank \u201cafter receipt of [Eurobank\u2019s] tested telex\/authenticated SWIFT indicating that [it] ha[s] received from the beneficiary of [its] guarantee [(i.e. the beneficiary of the Letter of Guarantee, HMOD)] a demand for payment in conformity with the terms and conditions of [its] guarantee [(i.e. the Letter of Guarantee)]\u201d (p. 118).\n[23] While the two letters of credit are distinct \u2014 and governed by different laws \u2014 they are connected. The opening paragraphs of the Letter of Counter-Guarantee, which reproduce word for word the entirety of the Letter of Guarantee, make that plain.\nD. The Initial Dispute\n[24] Eventually, Bombardier determined that it would be unable to meet its subcontracting obligations under the Offsets Contract given what it viewed as an insufficient number of available and qualified Greek companies. Bombardier claimed that it should not be required to pay liquidated damages. HMOD disagreed. To resolve the matter, an ICC Arbitral Tribunal was constituted as provided for in the Offsets Contract. Arbitration proceedings took place over several years, with hearings in 2012 and 2013. In 2012, Bombardier obtained permission to add a second issue to its claim, arguing that the Offsets Contract was null because it violated European Union law relating to the free movement of goods.\n[25] In April 2012, HMOD formally undertook to Bombardier and the ICC Arbitral Tribunal not to demand payment under the Letter of Guarantee \u201cfor as long as the [arbitration] procedure is ongoing\u201d (A.R., vol. IV, at p. 199).\n[26] In July 2013, Bombardier and HMOD were advised that the ICC Arbitral Tribunal would issue its final award by December 31, 2013.\n[27] On August 5, 2013, notwithstanding its previous undertaking, HMOD demanded payment from Eurobank under the Letter of Guarantee in the amount of US$13,868,354.60 while the issuance of the final award was still pending. This was followed by other demands for payment, leading up to a final demand on December 23, 2013.\nE. Applications for Interim Relief\n[28] On learning that HMOD had demanded payment under the Letter of Guarantee, Bombardier filed an urgent application for interim relief with the ICC Arbitral Tribunal. Bombardier sought an order declaring that HMOD\u2019s demand for payment was invalid and requiring HMOD to comply with its undertaking. On August 13, 2013, the ICC Arbitral Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 11, which \u201corder[ed] that [HMOD] shall abstain from demanding payment under the Letter of Guarantee issued pursuant to Offsets Benefit Contract 27\/98, and this until issuance of the Final Award in the present case\u201d (A.R., vol. V, at p. 39). Bombardier asked for assurances that HMOD would comply with this order, but such assurances were not given.\n[29] Unsure as to whether HMOD would comply with Procedural Order No. 11, Bombardier filed a motion for provisional, interlocutory and permanent injunction and safeguard order in the Superior Court of Quebec. Bombardier sought orders to prevent payment under the Letter of Guarantee and the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. In August 2013, Pr\u00e9vost J. issued a provisional injunction, to last 10 days, that enjoined Eurobank and the National Bank from honouring the letters of credit. Later, Davis J. issued a new provisional injunction, to last 10 days, that also prevented payment.\n[30] In August 2013, Eurobank brought parallel proceedings in Greece, seeking an order to prevent payment under the Letter of Guarantee until the conclusion of the arbitral proceedings. Judge Chrysoula Pana of the Athens One-Member First Instance Court issued a provisional injunction that authorized Eurobank to not pay under the Letter of Guarantee. On December 16, 2013, Judge Panayiotis Kostis of that court dismissed Eurobank\u2019s application for injunctive relief on its merits.\nF. HMOD\u2019s Final Demand for Payment\n[31] On December 5, 2013, the ICC Arbitral Tribunal informed the parties that its final award had been submitted to the ICC Court for approval, which was confirmed by the ICC Court on December 19, 2013. On December 23, 2013, the ICC Arbitral Tribunal informed the parties that the final award would be released on December 31, 2013.\n[32] On December 23, 2013, HMOD served Eurobank with an \u201cExtrajudicial Invitation-Protest\u201d demanding that Eurobank, as the issuer of the Letter of Guarantee, pay HMOD as beneficiary of that letter of credit. The Extrajudicial Invitation-Protest stated that Eurobank had an obligation to pay HMOD in accordance with its demand, notwithstanding the orders of Quebec courts. No reference was made to the imminent issuance of the final arbitral award or HMOD\u2019s undertaking not to demand payment under Procedural Order No. 11. The Extrajudicial Invitation-Protest further stated that \u201c[i]n the case of non-payment of the letter of guarantee until tomorrow, Tuesday 24 December 2013, the Hellenic Republic will take not only civil but also criminal legal measures, against the competent-responsible officers and employees of [Eurobank] for the fraudulent misappropriation of the amount embodied in the letter of guarantee and for any other offense\u201d (A.R., vol. VI, at p. 151 (emphasis deleted)).\n[33] Drawing on expert evidence, the trial judge described the measures alluded to in the Extrajudicial Invitation-Protest in detail. He found that Eurobank believed that if it did not comply with the Extrajudicial Invitation-Protest, it would expose itself to the freezing of a portion of its assets and assets of its employees, as well as criminal sanctions, including imprisonment, for the bank\u2019s representatives.\n[34] The day after the Extrajudicial Invitation-Protest was served, Eurobank paid HMOD under the Greek Letter of Guarantee.\n[35] On December 27, 2013, following up on earlier communications, Eurobank demanded payment from the National Bank under the Quebec Letter of Counter-Guarantee. The notice to the National Bank recorded that HMOD had demanded payment of US$13,868,354.40 pursuant to the Letter of Guarantee and, \u201c[t]herefore, [the National Bank is] in default on [its] obligations, including under the terms of the above referenced counter-guarantee\u201d for the same amount, plus expenses and interest (A.R., vol. VI, at p. 148).\nG. The Final ICC Arbitral Award and Subsequent Proceedings\n[36] In its final award, the ICC Arbitral Tribunal decided that the Offsets Contract violated European Union law. It was thus null and void ab initio, and thus no liquidated damages were due. That award was upheld by the Court of Appeal of Paris.\n[37] In the weeks following, Schrager J., as he then was, issued a safeguard order upon petition by Bombardier. Schrager J. decided that HMOD\u2019s conduct was \u201cclearly abusive and fraudulent\u201d and that Eurobank\u2019s predecessor had acted with \u201cfull knowledge of the facts\u201d (2014 QCCS 181, at paras. 43 and 46 (CanLII)). This was \u201ca fraud or at least participation . . . in a fraud\u201d, on the part of the Greek bank, that \u201csufficiently polluted\u201d demands for payment under the Quebec letter (paras. 46-47). Relying on Angelica-Whitewear, Schrager J. enjoined the National Bank from paying Eurobank under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. The safeguard order was later extended until the issuance of the judgment on the merits.\n[38] Bombardier\u2019s action on the merits for an injunction relating to Eurobank\u2019s demand for payment under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee advanced to trial in the Superior Court. These proceedings are at the origin of the present appeal.\n[39] As amended, Bombardier\u2019s originating motion sought homologation of the award of the ICC Arbitral Tribunal and a permanent injunction enjoining the National Bank from paying Eurobank under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. Bombardier rested its arguments on two grounds, both of which remain in dispute before this Court.\n[40] First, Eurobank\u2019s connection to HMOD\u2019s fraudulent conduct as beneficiary under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee makes the fraud its own, such that the National Bank should not honour Eurobank\u2019s demand for payment. Bombardier argues that the fraud exception applied to Eurobank as beneficiary under the Quebec letter. Given that HMOD\u2019s conduct was fraudulent, pleaded Bombardier, Eurobank\u2019s demand for payment under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee is, by extension, also fraudulent. More specifically, Eurobank knew of HMOD\u2019s fraud under the Letter of Guarantee and nevertheless demanded payment under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. For Bombardier \u2014 joined in this argument by the National Bank \u2014 this means that the fraud should be by extension attributed to Eurobank such that it cannot call on the National Bank to honour its undertaking to pay under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee.\n[41] Second, and in the alternative, Bombardier argues that the letters of credit are null. Given that the Offsets Contract is null because it violates European Union law, so too are the letters of credit associated with it, including the Letter of Counter-Guarantee.\n[42] In proceedings before Greek courts that were parallel to the proceedings before Quebec courts, Eurobank sought to recover the money that it had paid to HMOD. On November 29, 2019, the Greek court of first instance ordered HMOD to reimburse Eurobank the amount it had paid under the Letter of Guarantee, plus interest. The Court of Appeal of Athens allowed an appeal of that order after the trial judgment of the Quebec Superior Court was rendered. Eurobank moved to admit the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Athens as new evidence before the Court of Appeal of Quebec. That motion was granted. At the time of the hearing in our Court, a further appeal before the Hellenic Supreme Court was pending.\n[43] Following the hearing, the Hellenic Supreme Court rendered judgment, confirming in substance the decision of the Court of Appeal of Athens. While the present appeal was on reserve, Eurobank successfully moved to adduce the judgment of the Hellenic Supreme Court as new evidence for the purposes of this appeal. Bombardier and the National Bank contested the motion, arguing in particular that the judgment of the Hellenic Supreme Court has only \u201ctenuous relevance\u201d to the questions on appeal and that, as a result, the test for adducing additional evidence on appeal was not made out. I disagree. It is sufficient that the proposed additional evidence bear on a \u201cpotentially\u201d decisive issue \u2014 here the character of the conduct of HMOD \u2014 to meet the test set out in Palmer v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759 (see also Barendregt v. Grebliunas, 2022 SCC 22, at para. 29). The motion having been granted, I propose to consider the probative value of this fresh evidence on appeal.\nIII. Judicial History\nA. Quebec Superior Court, 2018 QCCS 2127 (Wery J.)\n[44] The trial judge held that Quebec courts had jurisdiction over the proceedings relating to the Letter of Counter-Guarantee as well as jurisdiction to homologate the arbitral award as a matter incidental to that letter. He homologated the award and ordered HMOD to comply with it.\n[45] Turning to whether the National Bank, as the issuer of the Letter of Counter-Guarantee, should be enjoined from paying Eurobank, he addressed Bombardier\u2019s argument that the fraud exception applied. To answer that question, the trial judge considered whether the payment by Eurobank, as issuing bank under the Letter of Guarantee, was made to HMOD as a result of the latter\u2019s fraud.\n[46] The trial judge held that the manner in which HMOD obtained payment under the Letter of Guarantee was fraudulent. He rejected Eurobank\u2019s argument that it had been forced to make the payment by HMOD\u2019s threats. Eurobank\u2019s own conduct was fraudulent because its payment to HMOD was a result of fraud of which it was aware. Ultimately, he wrote, \u201cEurobank may not have conceived the fraudulent plot, it may not have supplied the weapons, but it surely participated in pulling the trigger\u201d (para. 205 (CanLII)). The trial judge characterized Eurobank\u2019s conduct as \u201ctantamount to \u2018fraud\u2019\u201d, noting that \u201c[o]nce contaminated by HMOD\u2019s fraud, Eurobank cannot cleanse itself and may not demand payment from [the National Bank]. Fraus Omnia Corrumpit\u201d (para. 214).\n[47] Finally, the trial judge held that \u201c[i]t is difficult to accept in law that the invalidity, ab initio, of the Offsets Contract . . . does not cause the invalidity of the instruments that were issued to guarantee the obligations flowing from said contract\u201d (para. 237). Given that the Letter of Guarantee was declared null by the ICC Arbitral Tribunal, the Counter-Guarantee \u201cmust follow suit\u201d, and the National Bank \u201cshould be ordered not to pay Eurobank\u201d (para. 240).\n[48] At the end of the day, the trial judge declared the Letter of Counter-Guarantee null and enjoined the National Bank from paying any amount to the beneficiary under the Counter-Guarantee. He homologated the final award of the ICC Arbitral Tribunal and declared that the payment made to HMOD under the Letter of Guarantee was not due and could not be the basis for payment under the Counter-Guarantee or produce legal consequences against Bombardier. Finally, he ordered that HMOD comply with the final arbitral award.\nB. Quebec Court of Appeal, 2022 QCCA 802 (Mainville, Hamilton and Baudouin JJ.A.)\n(1) Mainville J.A., Baudouin J.A. Concurring\n[49] By a majority judgment, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal for the sole purpose of striking the Superior Court\u2019s order that HMOD comply with the ICC Tribunal\u2019s final award. Writing for the majority, Mainville J.A. confirmed the trial judgment in all other respects. In particular, the court enjoined the National Bank from paying Eurobank under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee and declared that letter of credit null.\n[50] First, the majority agreed with the trial judge that Quebec courts have jurisdiction over the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. However, the trial judge should not have ordered HMOD to comply with the final arbitral award as it is not domiciled in Quebec. Quebec courts can homologate the award so that it is legally binding in Quebec, but cannot order that it be binding extraterritorially in Greece.\n[51] Second, the majority saw no basis to interfere with the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that the National Bank be enjoined from paying Eurobank as beneficiary under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee.\n[52] Eurobank did not directly challenge the finding of fraud on the part of HMOD before the Court of Appeal. That challenge came from HMOD itself. However, since HMOD did not recognize the jurisdiction of Quebec courts, it had not filed an appeal of the trial judgment. Its contestation of this finding was therefore not properly before the Court of Appeal and was dismissed on that basis alone. In any event, no reviewable error was shown in the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that HMOD had engaged in \u201ca bad faith and fraudulent attempt to circumvent the Interim Order and the Final Award of the ICC Arbitral Tribunal by any and all means\u201d (para. 60 (CanLII)).\n[53] Moreover, the finding of a Greek court that HMOD acted consistently with Greek law does not undermine the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that HMOD acted fraudulently. The foreign judgments were not formally recognized and, as such, are not \u201cbinding on Quebec courts\u201d (para. 64). Mainville J.A. accepted that the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Athens could \u201cform part of the record in this case\u201d (para. 62). However, citing the principle in art. 3155(5) C.C.Q., he noted that Quebec courts could disregard a foreign judgment when the outcome of the judgment is manifestly inconsistent with public order in international relations. The outcome of the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Athens was, in his view, manifestly inconsistent with public order. \u201cIt would be curious indeed\u201d, wrote Mainville J.A., \u201cif this Court were to enforce a foreign decision which is in complete contradiction with binding judgments of the Superior Court and which has chosen to both disregard and discard those judgments\u201d (para. 68). Further, the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Athens \u201cessentially stands for the proposition that the Greek State may ignore with impunity both the Interim Order and the Final Award of the ICC Arbitral Tribunal\u201d (para. 69).\n[54] After reviewing evidence given by Eurobank\u2019s representatives at trial, Mainville J.A. held that it was open to the trial judge to conclude that the National Bank was not bound to pay Eurobank, as beneficiary under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. \u201cIt is clear in this case\u201d, he wrote, \u201cthat Eurobank had sufficient knowledge of the fraud prior to paying\u201d (para. 71). Although Eurobank paid HMOD as a result of threats made against it, the trial judge had rightly concluded that this did not absolve it of responsibility. Eurobank\u2019s decision to pay was contrary to orders of Quebec courts and the ICC Arbitral Tribunal. These orders must be upheld as a matter of judicial and public policy. Ordering the National Bank to pay under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee would \u201ccondone the evasion of a binding arbitration process by means of fraud and threats\u201d and render meaningless the interim order and final awards of the ICC tribunal (para. 76).\n(2) Hamilton J.A., Dissenting\n[55] The dissenting judge would have allowed the appeal, set aside the trial judgment in part, and dismissed the action.\n[56] Hamilton J.A. rejected Eurobank\u2019s arguments based on the lack of jurisdiction of the Quebec courts over the Letter of Counter-Guarantee and chose not to comment on the authority of Quebec courts to order HMOD to comply with the ICC Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s order.\n[57] Turning to a consideration of HMOD\u2019s demand for payment under the Letter of Guarantee, he wrote that the conduct was, \u201cin a word, deplorable\u201d (para. 164).\n[58] The dissenting judge proceeded to review each of the six bases the trial judge identified in finding that HMOD\u2019s conduct amounted to fraud. He found the trial judge had made errors in every conclusion but one. In particular, he decided that HMOD was entitled to withdraw its undertaking not to demand payment under the Letter of Guarantee because the undertaking did not have a \u201cspecific duration\u201d (para. 177). He held that the provisional orders of the arbitral tribunal, including Procedural Order No. 11, were not binding on HMOD because no court had declared the orders to be enforceable. The orders were contractually binding on HMOD, but \u201c[t]he breach of the order by HMOD is . . . a contractual breach, . . . not a legal one\u201d (para. 184). As for the characterization of HMOD\u2019s \u201clegal bullying\u201d against Eurobank, the dissenting judge wrote that there is \u201cnothing fraudulent\u201d in threatening to apply sanctions available under Greek law for the failure to pay (para. 192).\n[59] For the dissenting judge, it was, however, \u201cindicative of fraud\u201d that once HMOD received the final arbitration award, it continued to refuse repayment of the amount it had received under the Letter of Guarantee (para. 200). He continued: \u201c. . . the urgent demands for payment made in the days preceding the final arbitration award which HMOD expected to lose and HMOD\u2019s intent to keep the money regardless of the final arbitration award, are sufficient to conclude that HMOD\u2019s demand for payment on December 18, 2013 was fraudulent\u201d (para. 201).\n[60] He nevertheless chose not to hold Eurobank responsible for the fraud. While Eurobank knew that HMOD\u2019s demand was made right before the final arbitral award was issued, it did not know that HMOD expected to lose or intended to keep the funds even if it lost. Although Eurobank may have suspected fraud, \u201cthese suspicions . . . should not be assimilated to knowledge of fraud\u201d (para. 218).\n[61] Ultimately, it was not \u201cclear and obvious\u201d to Eurobank that HMOD\u2019s demand for payment was fraudulent based on suspicions alone (para. 223). Eurobank did not pay with knowledge of the fraud, therefore it is entitled to payment from the National Bank under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee.\nIV. Issues and Grounds of Appeal\n[62] The issue before this Court is whether the National Bank is required to refuse Eurobank\u2019s demand for payment under the Quebec Letter of Counter-Guarantee. The Court must determine whether the courts below erred in deciding that the fraud exception applies to Eurobank, in light of HMOD\u2019s misconduct, so that the National Bank must be enjoined from honouring the demand for payment. A second issue is raised in the alternative: Did the courts below err in deciding that payment is not due because the Letter of Counter-Guarantee is null given that the underlying Offsets Contract was declared null by the ICC Arbitral Tribunal?\n[63] Before this Court, Eurobank submits that HMOD\u2019s conduct does not amount to fraud because the Greek courts confirmed its right to demand payment under the Letter of Guarantee. Notwithstanding the orders of the ICC Arbitral Tribunal, HMOD\u2019s demand for payment was not indicative of fraud because provisional orders cannot be homologated. HMOD\u2019s conduct was perhaps a breach of contract, but not an illegal act (A.F., at paras. 74-75).\n[64] Even if HMOD engaged in fraud, Eurobank says that it could not have known about it since \u201cthe Court of competent jurisdiction \u2014 the Greek Court \u2014 confirmed otherwise\u201d (A.F., at para. 88). Finally, its decision to honour HMOD\u2019s demands was made under threat and, consequently, cannot be considered fraudulent.\n[65] Based on the parties\u2019 arguments, it would seem that they have, at times, lost sight of the issues that are properly before this Court. Much of the debate in this case was framed around the question whether HMOD\u2019s conduct in respect of the Letter of Guarantee amount to fraud under Quebec law. But the Letter of Guarantee is not subject to Quebec law. And while the two letters are interlocking, HMOD is technically a stranger \u2014 a third party \u2014 to the Letter of Counter-Guarantee, which is the letter of credit that is at issue before this Court.\n[66] The real issue is whether, under Quebec law, HMOD\u2019s conduct amounts to what Le Dain J. in Angelica-Whitewear called \u201cfraud by a third party\u201d in respect of the Quebec Letter of Counter-Guarantee. If so, then the subsequent issue becomes whether that third party\u2019s fraud can be attributed to Eurobank, as party to and beneficiary under that letter of credit, such that the fraud exception applies. In that case, payment by the issuer, the National Bank, should be prohibited.\nV. Analysis\nA. The Law Relating to Letters of Credit in Canada\n[67] A letter of credit is an instrument, understood to be autonomous from the underlying contract to which it speaks, that is issued by a financial institution at the behest of its customer. It entitles the beneficiary of the letter to payment on demand from the issuing bank, so long as that demand conforms to the requirements set out in the letter of credit. Typically, the customer contracts with the financial institution to issue the letter of credit as a means of providing comfort to the beneficiary that an underlying agreement will be performed as promised. The financial institution has a nearly absolute obligation to pay when presented with a valid demand. There is only one recognized exception in Canadian law: when there is fraud by the beneficiary that is brought to the financial institution\u2019s attention prior to payment, as explained in Angelica-Whitewear.\n[68] Some letters of credit are used to facilitate payment in a transaction \u201cas a means of moving money from one jurisdiction to another\u201d (K. McGuinness, The Law of Guarantee (3rd ed. 2013), at \u00a716.20; see also Crawford and Falconbridge, Banking and Bills of Exchange (8th ed. 1986), by B. Crawford, at p. 838; N. L\u2019Heureux and M. Lacoursi\u00e8re, Droit bancaire (5th ed. 2017), at pp. 399-400). These letters of credit, called often \u201cdocumentary letters of credit\u201d, are typically the primary method of payment in the transaction. However, it is increasingly common for a different sort of letter of credit that \u201cbegan [to evolve] only a few decades ago\u201d, called a \u201cstandby letter of credit\u201d to be used as a \u201cperformance ensuring mechanism\u201d rather than the primary method of payment (McGuinness, at \u00a716.43). L\u2019Heureux and Lacoursi\u00e8re explain that [translation] \u201c[a] standby letter of credit is a letter of credit whose usual function is to serve as a guarantee. Its purpose is therefore different from that of the traditional documentary letter of credit that constitutes a payment instrument\u201d (p. 434).\n[69] I note that the parties and the courts below have primarily referred to the Letter of Guarantee and the Letter of Counter-Guarantee simply as \u201cletters of credit\u201d, although they have occasionally used other terms, such as \u201cguarantee\u201d and \u201ccounter-standby\u201d (see, e.g., A.R., vol. VI, at p. 83). When a letter of credit is used as a means to secure performance of a contractual obligation, it may be called a \u201cstandby letter of credit\u201d (see G. B. Graham and B. Geva, \u201cStandby Credits in Canada\u201d (1984), 9 Can. Bus. L.J. 180, at p. 183). The term \u201cdemand guarantee\u201d is used for similar purposes, especially outside of North America (see McGuinness, at \u00a7\u00a73.87-3.88 and 16.51\u201116.52; see also R. Goode, \u201cAbstract Payment Undertakings in International Transactions\u201d (1996), 22 Brook. J. Int\u2019l L. 1, at p. 15). The difference between demand guarantees and standby letters of credit has been said to be \u201clargely illusory or, perhaps, of a semantic nature\u201d (E. P. Ellinger, \u201cStandby Letters of Credit\u201d (1978), 6 I.B.L. 604, at p. 622). As Professor Roy Goode observed, \u201cfrom a legal viewpoint demand guarantees and standby credits are indistinguishable, and the latter clearly falls within the definition of a demand guarantee in article 2 [of the Uniform Rules for Demand Guarantees]\u201d (p. 16). With that in mind, it is not unusual for standby letters of credit to be subject to the Uniform Rules for Demand Guarantees, as is the case here (A.R., vol. IV, at p. 118). Whether the Letter of Guarantee and the Letter of Counter-Guarantee are best described as \u201cdemand guarantees\u201d, \u201cletters of credit\u201d or \u201cstandby letters of credit\u201d is of no consequence to the outcome of this appeal.\n[70] Commonly relied upon in domestic and international commercial transactions, letters of credit are widely used as a means of managing risk. In particular, standby letters of credit are issued in order to ensure that the beneficiary will be paid what they believe they are owed under an underlying contract. The letter of credit does not replace the customer\u2019s obligation to pay the beneficiary under the underlying contract. Instead, the letter of credit is superimposed on the transaction (L\u2019Heureux and Lacoursi\u00e8re, at pp. 399-400). A demand for payment will typically arise when there is an allegation of \u201cfailure of the customer or account party to perform some duty as agreed\u201d (Crawford and Falconbridge, at p. 838). The premise is \u201cpay now, and argue later if necessary\u201d (McGuinness, at \u00a716.47).\n[71] The beneficiary can take comfort in knowing that they will be paid, unless they engage in fraud, and that any disputes relating to the underlying contract will be resolved only after they have been paid. The risk of non-payment by their co-contracting party is allocated away from them. Instead, the issuing financial institution takes on the risk of not being paid by their client. Should the beneficiary make a valid demand for payment because the issuer\u2019s client is in default under the underlying contract, the client is no less responsible for its breach of contract and must reimburse the issuer.\n[72] While letters of credit \u201care only as good as the issuer who stands behind them\u201d (McGuinness, at \u00a716.53), the business community has come to regard autonomous letters of credit issued by reputable banks as a reliable means of ensuring payment for the beneficiary. For this reason, courts are \u201cslow to interfere\u201d with letters of credit, \u201cbecause interventions by the courts that are too ready or too frequent might seriously impair the reliance which international business places on [them]\u201d (I. F. G. Baxter, The Law of Banking (4th ed. 1992), at p. 172).\n(1) Autonomy and Strict Compliance\n[73] There are two fundamental principles to the law governing letters of credit: autonomy and strict compliance (L\u2019Heureux and Lacoursi\u00e8re, at p. 403; see also M. Deschamps, \u201cLetters of Credit: The Autonomy Principle and the Fraud Exception\u201d (2022), 38 B.F.L.R. 245, at p. 249).\n(a) Autonomy of the Letter of Credit\n[74] Autonomy means that \u201ca letter of credit is an independent obligation of the issuing or confirming bank\u201d (Crawford and Falconbridge, at p. 853; see also Angelica-Whitewear, at p. 70; L\u2019Heureux and Lacoursi\u00e8re, at p. 403; Deschamps, at p. 248). As the Quebec Court of Appeal has noted, [translation] \u201c[i]t is well established that a letter of credit is an autonomous contract between the issuing bank and the beneficiary and is defined by its own terms and conditions, independently of the contract between the originator and the issuing bank or between the beneficiary and the originator\u201d (Groupe SM (International) Construction inc. v. Banque Nationale du Canada, 2013 QCCA 1118, at para. 8 (CanLII)). The obligation of the issuing bank to honour a valid demand for payment is \u201cindependent of the performance of the underlying contract for which the credit was issued\u201d (Angelica-Whitewear, at p. 70).\n[75] In an opinion that refers to Angelica-Whitewear, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit observed that, due to the autonomy principle, \u201c[t]he letter of credit takes on a life of its own\u201d which \u201cinfuses the credit transaction with the simplicity and certainty that are its hallmarks\u201d (Alaska Textile Co. v. Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A., 982 F.2d 813 (1992), at p. 815). The autonomy principle gives letters of credit their reliable character; a dispute about performance of the underlying contract generally does not justify a bank\u2019s refusal to honour the credit. A leading American case that was cited by Le Dain J. in Angelica-Whitewear was careful to recall that the autonomy principle should not be lightly set aside: \u201cIt would be a most unfortunate interference with business transactions if a bank before honoring drafts drawn upon it was obliged or even allowed to go behind the documents . . . and enter into controversies between the buyer and the seller . . .\u201d (Sztejn v. J. Henry Schroder Banking Corp., 31 N.Y.S.2d 631 (Sup. Ct. 1941), at p. 633).\n[76] It follows that \u201cthe beneficiary can be completely satisfied that whatever disputes may thereafter arise between him and the bank\u2019s customer in relation to the performance or indeed existence of the underlying contract, the bank is personally undertaking to pay him provided that the specified conditions are met\u201d (Bolivinter Oil S.A. v. Chase Manhattan Bank, [1984] 1 Lloyd\u2019s Rep. 251 (Eng. C.A.), at p. 257). Of course, the bank\u2019s customer may ultimately have a claim against the beneficiary, but that is typically none of the financial institution\u2019s concern since the letter of credit ensures that the beneficiary is paid in the meantime. The financial institution [translation] \u201cis not . . . required to inquire into the performance of the underlying contract\u201d since its obligation is simply to pay the beneficiary when presented with a valid demand (L\u2019Heureux and Lacoursi\u00e8re, at p. 403).\n(b) Strict Compliance\n[77] Strict compliance means that \u201cthe obligation of the issuing bank must be determined based only on the strict conformity of the presentation (including conformity of the documents presented) with the terms of the letter of credit\u201d (Deschamps, at p. 248). Therefore, the financial institution must ensure that the beneficiary, when it demands payment, presents documents that correspond to the requirements stated in the letter of credit. A letter of credit \u201cis drafted to define the scope and terms of the issuer\u2019s undertaking so that the issuer need only examine the terms of the letter of credit and the documents presented by the beneficiary\u201d (OMERS Realty Corp. v. 7636156 Canada Inc. (Trustee in Bankruptcy of), 2020 ONCA 681, 153 O.R. (3d) 271, at para. 42). As Le Dain J. explained, strict compliance \u201crequires not only that the tendered documents conform to the terms and conditions of the letter of credit but that they appear on their face to be consistent with one another\u201d (Angelica-Whitewear, at p. 98).\n[78] \u201cSubstantial compliance\u201d is not the test. Only documents that strictly conform to the terms in the letter of credit will trigger an obligation to pay (Crawford and Falconbridge, at p. 856; see also Angelica-Whitewear, at p. 96). That said, there is room for a limited qualification to this rule that makes it possible, in clearly appropriate cases, to overlook immaterial discrepancies (Angelica-Whitewear, at pp. 97-98; see also Universal Stainless Steel & Alloys Inc. v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, 2009 ONCA 801, 256 O.A.C. 109).\n[79] Le Dain J. wrote that \u201c[t]he fundamental rule is that the documents must appear on their face, upon reasonably careful examination, to be in accordance with the terms and conditions of the letter of credit\u201d (Angelica-Whitewear, at p. 94 (emphasis in original)). A \u201creasonably careful examination\u201d does not require perfection. The Singapore Court of Appeal, speaking to the same idea, observed that this works \u201cto protect the bank and to ensure the smooth flow of international trade and the avoidance of delay\u201d (Beam Technology (Mfg) Pte Ltd v. Standard Chartered Bank, [2002] SGCA 53, [2003] 1 S.L.R. 597, at para. 32). That said, if the financial institution pays the beneficiary without evaluating the documents presented to ensure that they strictly conform to the requirements set out in the letter of credit, they run the risk of not being reimbursed by their client (L\u2019Heureux and Lacoursi\u00e8re, at p. 404).\n(2) The Fraud Exception to the Autonomy of Letters of Credit\n[80] As noted, the issuing financial institution\u2019s obligation to pay the beneficiary on demand is nearly absolute. There is only one recognized exception: when there is \u201cfraud by the beneficiary of the credit which has been sufficiently brought to the knowledge of the bank before payment of the draft or demonstrated to a court called on by the customer of the bank to issue an interlocutory injunction to restrain the bank from honouring the draft\u201d (Angelica-Whitewear, at p. 71).\n[81] Le Dain J. took care to note that \u201c[t]he potential scope of the fraud exception must not be a means of creating serious uncertainty and lack of confidence in the operation of letter of credit transactions; at the same time the application of the principle of autonomy must not serve to encourage or facilitate fraud in such transactions\u201d (p. 72). To achieve this balance, the standard set in Angelica-Whitewear for fraud is high in order to attain, as the intervener helpfully stated, a \u201cproper apportionment of risk between [the] issuers of letters of guarantee . . . and the participating business parties to the underlying transaction\u201d (I.F., at para. 31).\n[82] The fraud exception is no less applicable when a second letter of credit is issued by a financial institution that requires it to pay when presented with an attestation that the first letter of credit has been called upon. As Professors L\u2019Heureux and Lacoursi\u00e8re observe, the bank issuing the counter-guarantee must make the payment to the beneficiary when it attests that it has received a demand for payment under the first letter of credit. They explain that the obligation of the issuer of a counter-guarantee should however be subject to the exception of fraud by the beneficiary: [translation] \u201cOnly obvious fraud or clear abuse constitutes an obstacle to payment of the guarantee by the bank that must make the decision to pay or not to pay\u201d (p. 433).\n[83] The intervener says that in instances of a counter-guarantee, a third party will sometimes engage in fraudulent conduct. The fraud by a third party in a counter-guarantee does not preclude the application of the fraud exception to the counter-guarantee itself \u201cwhere the beneficiary of a letter of counter-guarantee would be a perpetrator of a clear and obvious fraud\u201d (I.F., at para. 26, fn. 32). I agree that the conduct of a beneficiary under a counter-guarantee may serve to make the fraud of a third party its own. In such a case, the fraud exception applies directly to the demand of the beneficiary.\n[84] While Angelica-Whitewear spoke first to Quebec law, Le Dain J. emphasized that the fraud exception to the autonomy of letters of credit is identical in both the Canadian common and civil law systems. It rests on a shared idea that is \u201cexpressed in the civil law by the maxim fraus omnia corrumpit and in the common law by the maxim ex turpi causa non oritur actio\u201d (p. 82). Le Dain J. observed that this shared foundation for the fraud exception underscores \u201cthe desirability of as much uniformity as possible in the law with respect to these vital instruments of international commerce\u201d (p. 83). Indeed, courts across Canada have applied the test developed in Angelica-Whitewear (Deschamps, at p. 256; see also OMERS Realty, at para. 43), and common law courts outside of Canada have turned to Angelica-Whitewear as a helpful resource (see, e.g., Alaska Textile (United States); Xing Fa (Hong Kong) Imp. & Exp. Ltd. v. Sungsan International Co., [2018] HKCFI 2743 (Hong Kong); Westpac New Zealand Ltd. v. MAP and Associates Ltd., [2011] NZSC 89, [2011] 3 N.Z.L.R. 751 (New Zealand)).\n[85] I share Le Dain J.\u2019s sense of the importance of a right balance between the need to protect the autonomy of letters of credit with the need to discourage fraud. The exception should be sufficiently inclusive to capture most fraudulent conduct that should not be facilitated through letters of credit. At the same time, if the fraud exception is too inclusive, letters of credit could become much less reliable. Balancing these two concerns requires this Court to set a high bar for fraud, which should be obvious before an issuing bank refuses to honour payment under a letter of credit.\n[86] Le Dain J. was right to say that, generally speaking, the fraud of a third party to a letter of credit does not engage the fraud exception where the beneficiary of the letter is innocent of that fraud. To accept that the fraud of a third party requires the issuer to refuse to honour a demand for payment in all circumstances would expand the fraud exception at the expense of the reliability of letters of credit. But Le Dain J. was equally careful to leave open the possibility that the beneficiary might not be \u201cinnocent\u201d of the third party\u2019s misconduct. At a minimum, the beneficiary will likely be innocent of the third party\u2019s fraud if it demands payment in circumstances in which it is unaware of the fraud (see L. Sarna, Letters of Credit: The Law and Current Practice (3rd ed. (loose-leaf)), at pp. 5-56 and 5-57). But where the beneficiary has knowledge of fraud and proceeds to call for payment when it knows that the conditions of payment are not met, the beneficiary has, in a manner of speaking, made the fraud their own. This can occur in situations, like the present appeal, where the third party is itself a party to a letter of guarantee which interlocks with a letter of counter-guarantee. As the intervener wrote, \u201cin cases where it is established to the knowledge of the issuer of the letter of counter-guarantee that its beneficiary had clear and obvious knowledge of the fraud (perpetrated by the beneficiary of the primary letter of guarantee), that said issuer could refuse payment thereunder\u201d (I.F., at para. 26).\n[87] For the trial judge, this latter scenario is what happened here. He found that HMOD, a third party to the Letter of Counter-Guarantee, perpetrated a fraud as beneficiary under the primary Letter of Guarantee. Eurobank, the beneficiary of the Letter of Counter-Guarantee, had clear and obvious knowledge of that fraud and called for payment anyway. Eurobank is therefore not innocent of the fraud perpetrated by HMOD. The National Bank, as issuer of the counter-guarantee, knew of this state of affairs before it paid and thus should not honour the demand for payment under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. I turn now to Eurobank\u2019s contestation of the scenario described by the trial judge and confirmed on appeal.\nB. Application\n[88] Before this Court, Eurobank argues that the trial judge, as well as the majority in the Court of Appeal, erred in applying the fraud exception.\n[89] First, Eurobank says that the Greek courts, who were competent to decide the matter under the Letter of Guarantee, found that HMOD did not act fraudulently in demanding payment under that letter of credit. Moreover, HMOD\u2019s conduct, while \u201cunsavoury\u201d, is not fraudulent because there was nothing \u201cillegal\u201d or \u201cdeceitful\u201d in its demand for payment (A.F., Eurobank, at paras. 64, 67 and 79). HMOD supports this position, arguing that Greek courts found its conduct to be neither abusive nor fraudulent under the Letter of Guarantee and that the judgments of the Greek courts were \u201cmisread, improperly criticized and completely disregarded\u201d by the courts below (A.F., HMOD, at para. 5).\n[90] Second, Eurobank says that even if one were to conclude that HMOD acted fraudulently, that conduct has no bearing on its right, as beneficiary under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee, to demand payment (A.F., at para. 109). The trial judge erred in finding that Eurobank knew that HMOD\u2019s conduct constituted fraud because there was not one \u201ciota\u201d of proof before him (para. 111). In addition, the principle of autonomy means that the Letter of Counter-Guarantee is \u201cdistinct\u201d, and the fraud exception must be applied in that light (para. 115).\n[91] For the reasons that follow, I disagree with Eurobank and HMOD. It is important to emphasize that Eurobank must identify a legal error or a palpable and overriding error of fact or of mixed fact and law in order to justify appellate intervention. Appellate courts must remember in particular that \u201cthere is one, and only one, standard of review applicable to all factual conclusions made by the trial judge \u2014 that of palpable and overriding error\u201d (see Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, at para. 25) and that issues of mixed fact and law, absent an extricable legal error, are owed the same degree of deference. As I will explain, I am of the view that Eurobank has failed to identify a reviewable error.\n[92] It is true that the Letter of Guarantee is governed by Greek law and that Greek courts have jurisdiction to determine whether Eurobank was required to comply with HMOD\u2019s demand for payment. But the Greek judgments have not been formally recognized by Quebec courts under the rules for recognition and enforcement of foreign decisions found in Title Four of Book Ten on Private International Law in the Civil Code of Qu\u00e9bec; they are thus unenforceable in the province. Under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee which is governed by Quebec law, HMOD\u2019s demand for payment under the Greek letter of credit is relevant to determining whether Eurobank\u2019s own conduct, as beneficiary under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee, engages the fraud exception. The trial judge concluded that HMOD demanded payment to which it had no right. In my view, that amounts to fraud of a third party that is relevant to the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. Moreover, the trial judge\u2019s conclusions that Eurobank was aware of and participated in HMOD\u2019s fraud are entitled to deference. I conclude, as the majority of the Court of Appeal did, that the trial judge\u2019s decision that the fraud exception applies with respect to the Letter of Counter-Guarantee should not be interfered with.\n[93] Eurobank is the beneficiary of the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. An analysis of whether the fraud exception can apply must focus on whether Eurobank, as beneficiary, engaged in fraud that was brought to the attention of the National Bank.\n[94] Although a letter of credit is autonomous from other contracts involved in a transaction, Angelica-Whitewear makes it plain that the fraud exception can apply if there is fraud in the transaction, even if the fraud affects the letter of credit only indirectly (pp. 72 and 84). This can include fraud by a third party. A third party may, for example, be a person other than the issuer or the beneficiary who forged documents that were given to the beneficiary (see generally United City Merchants (Investments) Ltd. v. Royal Bank of Canada, [1983] 1 A.C. 168 (H.L.)).\n[95] In this case, the scope of the transaction is clear. While the Letter of Counter-Guarantee is an autonomous letter of credit and is as such separate from other contracts, the very text of the Letter of Counter-Guarantee indicates that it is part of a broader transaction. The Letter of Counter-Guarantee and the Letter of Guarantee are, on the very face of the letter in dispute here, interlocking. Indeed, the first four paragraphs of the Letter of Counter-Guarantee reproduce word for word the text of the Letter of Guarantee (A.R., vol. IV, at pp. 114-15). In so doing, it recalls to the parties that its operation is dependent on the triggering of the Letter of Guarantee by a demand for payment by HMOD. While HMOD is technically a third party to the Letter of Counter-Guarantee \u2014 in that it is neither issuer nor beneficiary \u2014 its conduct is a fact upon which the triggering of a demand for payment by Eurobank can be made. Indeed, as the text of the Letter of Counter-Guarantee makes plain, when HMOD calls for payment under the Greek letter, Eurobank has a corresponding right to demand payment under the interlocking Letter of Counter-Guarantee.\n[96] That disputed letter makes the link between the two letters explicit:\nIN CONSIDERATION OF YOU [i.e. Eurobank] ISSUING AT OUR REQUEST THE ABOVEMENTIONED GUARANTEE, WE, NATIONAL BANK OF CANADA HEREBY IRREVOCABLY UNDERTAKE TO REIMBURSE YOU [i.e. Eurobank] ALL AMOUNT(S) CLAIMED BY THE BENEFICIARY OF YOUR GUARANTEE [i.e. HMOD] UP TO BUT NOT EXCEEDING USD 27,736,709.00 (TWENTY-SEVEN MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY-SIX THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED NINE. . .00\/100 UNITED STATES DOLLARS) PLUS COSTS, STAMP DUTIES AND VALUE ADDED TAX AS APPROPRIATE, WITH SAME VALUE RATE AS OF THE DATE OF YOUR PAYMENT, AFTER RECEIPT OF YOUR [i.e. Eurobank] TESTED TELEX\/AUTHENTICATED SWIFT INDICATING THAT YOU [i.e. Eurobank] HAVE RECEIVED FROM THE BENEFICIARY OF YOUR GUARANTEE A DEMAND FOR PAYMENT IN CONFORMITY WITH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF YOUR GUARANTEE. [Emphasis added.]\n(A.R., vol. IV, at p. 118)\n[97] Overall, the text of the Letter of Counter-Guarantee makes it plain that the conduct of HMOD under the Letter of Guarantee falls within the scope of the transaction even though HMOD is a third party to the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. In fact, the Letter of Guarantee is the underlying contract for the Letter of Counter-Guarantee, which means that fraud with respect to the Letter of Guarantee is directly relevant to the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. If that fraud was perpetrated by the beneficiary of the Letter of Guarantee \u2014 who is a third party to the Letter of Counter-Guarantee \u2014 the fraud exception could apply to the Letter of Counter-Guarantee if that letter\u2019s beneficiary is not \u201cinnocent\u201d of the fraudulent conduct (Angelica-Whitewear, at p. 84). Demanding payment under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee in reaction to a demand for payment under the Letter of Guarantee that is known to be fraudulent would therefore amount to fraud that is relevant to the Letter of Counter-Guarantee.\n[98] Before this Court, Eurobank insists that, because Greek courts held that HMOD did not engage in fraud, it is not open to Quebec courts to say otherwise. The Court of Appeal of Athens and the Hellenic Supreme Court decided that HMOD was not bound by its commitment to refrain from demanding payment under the Letter of Guarantee or by Procedural Order No. 11. Counsel for Eurobank went so far as to insist that \u201cthe debate [in this appeal] was rendered moot by the decision by the Athens Court of Appeal\u201d (transcript, at p. 2). While Eurobank initially conceded before the Quebec Court of Appeal that HMOD engaged in fraud, it now says that it is justified in walking back from that concession because that position is inconsistent with judgments of Greek courts.\n[99] With respect, Eurobank is wrong to say that the judgments of Greek courts have any decisive relevance in this case.\n[100] While \u201cforeign judgments are not enforceable in and of themselves\u201d (Kuwait Airways Corp. v. Iraq, 2010 SCC 40, [2010] 2 S.C.R. 571, at para. 20), they may be recognized and declared enforceable under arts. 3155 et seq. C.C.Q. When a foreign judgment has not been recognized and enforced, it may nevertheless be received in Quebec as evidence. In such a case, and as Mainville J.A. correctly observed in the impugned judgment, the foreign judgment provides prima facie proof of its reported facts and of the good application of foreign law, but it is not binding on Quebec courts (see generally C. Pich\u00e9, La preuve civile (6th ed. 2020), at p. 259; G. Goldstein and E. Groffier, Droit international priv\u00e9, t. I, Th\u00e9orie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale (1998), at No. 155).\n[101] When a party applies for recognition and enforcement of a foreign judgment pursuant to arts. 3155 et seq. C.C.Q., the burden falls on the opposing party to show that an exception to the general rule that foreign judgments ought to be recognized and enforced in Quebec applies (Barer v. Knight Brothers LLC, 2019 SCC 13, [2019] 1 S.C.R. 573, at para. 24).\n[102] In this case, no party has sought the recognition and enforcement of the Greek judgments in Quebec. This may have been a deliberate choice on Eurobank\u2019s part given the difficulty it might have faced in light of the public order exception in art. 3155(5) C.C.Q. and the likelihood that this exception would have been raised by opposing parties. The public order exception applies when \u201cthe solution provided by the foreign judgment\u201d cannot \u201cbe harmoniously incorporated into the legal order of the Quebec forum\u201d (R.S. v. P.R., 2019 SCC 49, [2019] 3 S.C.R. 643, at para. 52). As the majority judges in the Quebec Court of Appeal observed in this case, the Greek judgments, particularly those of Judge Kostis of the Athens One-Member First Instance Court and of the Court of Appeal of Athens, might have raised public order concerns because of their inconsistency with the relevant orders of the ICC Arbitral Tribunal. Mainville J.A. wrote that the decision of the Court of Appeal of Athens \u201cessentially stands for the proposition that the Greek State may ignore with impunity both the Interim Order and the Final Award of the ICC Arbitral Tribunal even if it formally undertook to abide by the arbitration process\u201d and identified this as a public order concern (para. 69).\n[103] Mainville J.A. explained, relying on arts. 3155(5) and 3081 C.C.Q., that Quebec courts are not bound to enforce or recognize foreign judgments when the result of doing so is manifestly inconsistent with public order as understood in international relations. I take due note of Mainville J.A.\u2019s analysis of this point, which is amply supported by this Court\u2019s jurisprudence and relevant scholarship (R.S., at paras. 52-53; Beals v. Saldanha, 2003 SCC 72, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 416, at paras. 71-72; Goldstein and Groffier, at No. 166; S. Guillemard and V. A. Ly, \u00c9l\u00e9ments de droit international priv\u00e9 qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (2019), at pp. 64-66). Mindful that the public order exception is understood to be more limited under art. 3155 C.C.Q., I take care to recall that this matter need not be decided here because no application for recognition and enforcement was made.\n[104] Absent a successful application for recognition and enforcement, the Greek judgments are merely evidence that do not bind Quebec courts, and the weight given to them is an issue of fact to which deference is owed on appeal. While none of the parties expressly argued this point, pursuant to art. 2822 C.C.Q., in the law of evidence, a foreign judgment may be treated as a semi-authentic act that is presumptively proof of its contents that may be produced as evidence in Quebec (see Pich\u00e9, at Nos. 341 and 345; Goldstein and Groffier, at No. 155). As Mainville J.A. correctly noted, \u201cwhen foreign judgments are received in evidence without being formally recognized in Quebec, they are prima facie proof of the reported facts, of the good application of the foreign law and of the foreign court\u2019s jurisdiction on the matter\u201d (para. 64).\n[105] In Canadian Forest Navigation Co. v. R., 2017 FCA 39, [2017] 4 C.T.C. 63, a case that Mainville J.A. relied upon, Boivin J.A. explained that \u201cfactual findings contained within [foreign] judgments are facts that cannot be disregarded by a Court\u201d but rejected the idea that \u201cpursuant to article 2822 C.C.Q. these foreign orders are dispositive\u201d (paras. 15 and 19). The weight given to \u201cforeign orders as facts\u201d, as Boivin J.A. recalled, is a matter for the trier of fact to decide, \u201cwith a full evidentiary record at his or her disposal\u201d (para. 20; see also Digiulian v. Succession de Digiulian, 2022 QCCA 531).\n[106] The trial judge and the majority judges at the Court of Appeal plainly saw this and concluded that Bombardier had met its burden. Both the trial judge and the Court of Appeal expressly considered the weight to be given to the decision of Judge Kostis as a matter of fact. Mainville J.A. considered the significance of the decision of the Court of Appeal of Athens, which had been rendered after the trial judgment of Wery J. The trial judge expressly considered how much weight to give the decision of Judge Kostis and opted to give it none. Expressly referring to Judge Kostis\u2019s decision, Mainville J.A. confirmed that finding and, likewise, decided to give \u201cno weight\u201d to the decision of the Court of Appeal of Athens (para. 65). I emphasize that \u201cit is not the role of appellate courts to second-guess the weight to be assigned to the various items of evidence\u201d absent a palpable and overriding error (Housen, at para. 23). Eurobank has failed to show any basis to interfere with the decisions by the courts below to give no weight, as evidence, to the Greek judgments.\n[107] Moreover, as Mainville J.A. observed, a decision to place little or no weight on an unenforceable foreign judgment can be justified if that decision does not give proper consideration to relevant Canadian judgments or if it raises other public order concerns (see paras. 65 and 67-69; see also Beals, at para. 29). While comity is \u201ca useful guiding principle\u201d (Spar Aerospace Ltd. v. American Mobile Satellite Corp., 2002 SCC 78, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 205, at para. 17), it is important to recall that it is also \u201ca balancing exercise\u201d (Pro Swing Inc. v. Elta Golf Inc., 2006 SCC 52, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 612, at para. 27). In this case, a decisive factor was the conclusion of the foreign courts that a party can disregard an order of an arbitral tribunal to which it has agreed to be subject (see Sup. Ct. reasons, at para. 176; C.A. reasons, at para. 69). In the circumstances, it was open to the courts below to give the Greek decisions no weight, as mere facts rather than as executory judgments, in measuring the conduct of HMOD and Eurobank for the purposes of the Letter of Counter-Guarantee.\n[108] For the same reasons as the trial judge and the majority of the Quebec Court of Appeal in respect of the foreign decisions they considered, I would give no evidentiary weight to the judgment of the Hellenic Supreme Court that has been adduced by Eurobank as additional evidence before this Court. I recall that Mainville J.A. properly observed that the decision of the Court of Appeal of Athens \u201cessentially stands for the proposition that the Greek State may ignore with impunity both the Interim Order and the Final Award of the ICC Arbitral Tribunal even if it formally undertook to abide by the arbitration process\u201d (para. 69). The Hellenic Supreme Court ostensibly confirmed that same conclusion. In the certified English translation, quoting from the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Athens with approval, it wrote that \u201c[a]s far as the issuing of interim orders by the International Court of Arbitration and the Superior Court of Quebec respectively are concerned, which prohibited payment of the guarantee letters on an interim basis, it should be noted that as interim decisions of the International Court of Arbitration and the foreign court they were not binding on the Greek State\u201d (Motion to adduce fresh evidence, at p. 67).\n[109] The judgment of the Hellenic Supreme Court thus raises exactly the same public order concern as the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Athens which led to the findings, made respectively by the Quebec Superior Court and Court of Appeal, to give no weight to the decisions of the Greek courts. Even taking account of the new evidence, Eurobank has failed to show any error in the courts below warranting interference on appeal. Moreover, the judgment of the Hellenic Supreme Court, which speaks to the conduct of HMOD under Greek law with respect to the Letter of Guarantee, sheds no light on whether HMOD\u2019s conduct, as a third party to the Letter of Counter-Guarantee, was fraud by a third party by Canadian standards pursuant to Angelica-Whitewear. Nor does that judgment speak usefully to whether Eurobank knew of or participated in that fraud in a manner that is relevant to its demand for payment under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. The judgment of the Hellenic Supreme Court adduced in evidence, like the prior Greek decisions weighed by the courts below, has no probative value in respect to the issues now before this Court.\n[110] Although these judgments might be enforceable in Greece, as I have emphasized, HMOD\u2019s conduct under Greek law is not at issue. Instead, it is HMOD\u2019s conduct under Quebec law with respect to the Letter of Counter-Guarantee that is engaged directly by Bombardier\u2019s petition for an injunction against the National Bank making payment in the Superior Court. Absent an enforceable foreign judgment on the matter, Quebec courts were required to draw their own conclusions, in applying Quebec law, regarding whether HMOD engaged in fraud in the transaction as a third party to the Letter of Counter-Guarantee.\n[111] For the reasons that follow, I am of the view that no reviewable error has been shown in the trial judge\u2019s overall conclusion that HMOD engaged in fraud, as a third party to the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. The appellant has also failed to show a basis for interfering with the trial judge\u2019s view that HMOD\u2019s fraud can be attributed to Eurobank as beneficiary. Eurobank knew of and acted upon HMOD\u2019s fraud and thus is not innocent of that fraud. The fraud exception applies to the Letter of Counter-Guarantee.\n(1) HMOD Engaged in Fraud as a Third Party to the Letter of Counter-Guarantee\n[112] In this case, HMOD is alleged to have engaged in fraud in the transaction rather than fraud in the tendered documents. Le Dain J. emphasized that \u201cfraud in the underlying transaction of such a character as to make the demand for payment under the credit a fraudulent one\u201d may include \u201cany act of the beneficiary of a credit the effect of which would be to permit the beneficiary to obtain the benefit of the credit as a result of fraud\u201d (Angelica-Whitewear, at p. 83; see also L\u2019Heureux and Lacoursi\u00e8re, at pp. 409-10; M. Lemieux, \u201cLes d\u00e9cisions Bombardier Inc. c. Hermes Aero LLC et l\u2019autonomie des cr\u00e9dits standby\u201d (2003), 63 R. du B. 427, at p. 428).\n[113] In the years since Angelica-Whitewear, Canadian courts have emphasized that, in the context of letters of credit, \u201c[f]raud is not simply a legitimate dispute or disagreement over the interpretation of a contract, however one-sided that dispute may appear\u201d (Cineplex Odeon Corp. v. 100 Bloor West General Partner Inc., [1993] O.J. No. 112 (Lexis), 1993 CarswellOnt 2358 (WL) (C.J. (Gen. Div.)), at para. 31 (WL); see also Fiberex Technologies Inc. v. Bank of Montreal, 2015 ABQB 496, [2016] 4 W.W.R. 547, at para. 23; Standard Trust Co. (Liquidation) v. Bank of Nova Scotia, 2001 NFCA 27, 201 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 8, at para. 59). As a Hong Kong court similarly noted, it is well established that \u201c[d]ue to autonomy of the credit, operation of the fraud exception is strictly policed so [that] it . . . is not extended to disputes on the underlying contract\u201d (DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Ltd. v. New Harvest International Development Ltd., [2017] HKCFI 30, at para. 62 (HKLII)). Quebec courts have also recognized that a dispute concerning the underlying contract is not necessarily indicative of fraud (SNC-Lavalin Polska SP. ZOO v. BNP Paris Canada, 2017 QCCS 3694, at para. 40 (CanLII); Bombardier Inc. v. Hermes Aero, 2004 CanLII 7014 (Sup. Ct.), at para. 35; SNC-Lavalin Constructeurs international inc. v. Shariket Kahraba Skikda.spa, 2010 QCCS 3236, at para. 27 (CanLII); Banque Nationale du Canada v. CGU Cie d\u2019assurance du Canada, 2004 CanLII 49434 (Sup. Ct.), at para. 49).\n[114] \u201cFraud\u201d in this context does not refer to fraud in the criminal sense and carries with it a different connotation. Generally, civil or commercial fraud is broader than its criminal counterpart (McGuinness, at \u00a717.342). A key feature of fraud in this context is its effect on the demand for payment by the beneficiary. As authors L\u2019Heureux and Lacoursi\u00e8re observed, [translation] \u201cthe subject matter of the fraud may be either the documents or the underlying transactions (that is, the commercial contract) of such a character as to make the demand for payment under the letter of credit a fraudulent one\u201d (p. 410). If a beneficiary demands payment while knowing that they have no right to be paid under the underlying contract, that conduct may amount to fraud (McGuinness, at \u00a717.338). Whether it does is an issue of mixed fact and law for which deference is owed on appeal. In this case, the essence of HMOD\u2019s fraudulent conduct is that it demanded payment under the Letter of Guarantee when it knew it had no right to do so.\n[115] The bar is nevertheless high. As author Marc Lemieux has explained, the fraud exception is limited to cases of obvious fraud [translation] \u201cto avoid unduly interfering with the commercial utility and efficacy of letters of credit\u201d (p. 433; see also L\u2019Heureux and Lacoursi\u00e8re, at pp. 409-10). A mere absence of good faith may not be sufficient, even if that might lead to civil liability in other contexts. In this context, fraud goes further: it must \u201cimport some aspect of impropriety, dishonesty or deceit\u201d (Cineplex, at para. 31, cited with approval by several courts in Quebec and the common law provinces, including in Royal Bank v. Gentra Canada Investments Inc. (2001), 15 B.L.R. (3d) 25 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 8; OMERS Realty, at para. 45; SNC-Lavalin Polska, at para. 40; Alessandra Yarns, l.l.c. v. Tongxiang Baoding Textile Co., 2015 QCCS 346, at para. 34 (CanLII)). As an Ontario court observed, \u201ca demand for payment is only fraudulent if the claim to the funds is not even colourable as being valid or has absolutely no basis in fact\u201d (Royal Bank v. Gentra Canada Investments Inc. (2000), 1 B.L.R. (3d) 170 (S.C.J.), at para. 56, aff\u2019d (2001), 15 B.L.R. (3d) 25).\n[116] I am mindful that it is a serious matter to describe the conduct of an arm of a foreign state \u2014 and one that is a member of the European Union and a significant actor in international commerce \u2014 as \u201cfraudulent\u201d. It is important to take care, when characterizing the conduct of a foreign state, not to impugn the integrity of a respected player in the international business community. But I insist that the term is used here in the specific context of letters of credit where, under Angelica-Whitewear, fraud includes a demand for payment by a beneficiary when it knew it did so without a right to payment. No further inference should be drawn from the use of the term here and, with due respect for the trial judge, I would not have used epithets such as \u201clegal bullying\u201d or \u201clegal blackmail\u201d here (paras. 175 and 182). For reasons of comity, Canadian courts should be cautious about criticizing the laws of a foreign state even though, as it is best to acknowledge, Canadian and international law sometimes requires them to do so (see generally Nevsun Resources Ltd. v. Araya, 2020 SCC 5, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 166, at para. 50).\n[117] That said, I am of the view that the trial judge\u2019s finding that HMOD engaged in fraud, which is one of mixed fact and law, is entitled to deference. Eurobank has failed to show that the judge\u2019s overall conclusion on this point is the product of palpable and overriding errors. His determination that HMOD engaged in \u201csome measure of impropriety\u201d that could amount to fraud \u2014 which was acknowledged even by the dissenting judge at the Court of Appeal \u2014 is amply supported by the evidence (see paras. 175-76). That said, I do not find it necessary to endorse all of his findings on this point.\n[118] As Mainville J.A. noted, the trial judge took account of evidence of HMOD\u2019s conduct, including evidence that might militate against a finding of fraud. I agree with Mainville J.A. that the trial judge did not make a reviewable error, in particular, on the specific point of the timing of the demand for payment in light of the order of the ICC Arbitral Tribunal that enjoined HMOD from demanding payment. The evidence supports a finding that HMOD engaged in a \u201cfraudulent attempt to circumvent the Interim Order and the Final Award of the ICC Arbitral Tribunal by any and all means, no matter how repugnant they may be\u201d (C.A. reasons, at para. 60).\n[119] Specifically, the evidence indicates that HMOD, a party to the arbitral proceedings, violated Procedural Order No. 11 of the ICC Arbitral Tribunal, which enjoined it from demanding payment under the Letter of Guarantee. In violation of that order and its own undertaking, around one week before the final arbitral award was released, HMOD repeated its demand for payment. After the final award was issued and confirmed by the Court of Appeal of Paris, it became clear that HMOD had no right under the Offsets Contract to the money that it received. Still, HMOD has not returned the money it received from Eurobank under the Letter of Guarantee. In fact, HMOD has taken the position before this Court that it is not required to return the money because Bombardier has not sought repayment directly from it (A.F., at para. 94). This, on its own, supports a finding that HMOD engaged in fraud.\n[120] It is sufficient to observe, as did the trial judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal, that HMOD\u2019s demands for payment in contravention of Procedural Order No. 11 and its own undertaking, including a demand immediately before the final arbitral award was released, can support a finding that it engaged in fraud. For this reason, it is unnecessary to decide whether other aspects of HMOD\u2019s conduct that the trial judge identified amount to fraud.\n[121] I will not comment on the manner in which HMOD demanded payment through the Extrajudicial Invitation-Protest. Although there is some expert evidence on Greek law in the record, this Court should not make original findings with respect to whether HMOD\u2019s Extrajudicial Invitation-Protest was permitted or required under Greek law. Mindful that HMOD is a foreign actor, what it can be fairly criticized for, by Quebec courts in respect of a Quebec letter of credit, is demanding payment in a related letter of credit in contravention of an order of an arbitral tribunal and its own undertaking on the eve of the release of an arbitral award that would pronounce on its right to payment.\n[122] I add that the dissenting judge at the Court of Appeal agreed that HMOD engaged in fraud, specifically based on the fact that HMOD never had the intention to repay the funds the arbitral court determined that it owed (C.A. reasons, at para. 200). He went so far as to assert that \u201c[t]he conduct of HMOD in this matter was, in a word, deplorable\u201d (para. 164). That said, he would not have found that HMOD\u2019s violation of Procedural Order No. 11 amounts to fraud because that order was not capable of being homologated, which means that HMOD\u2019s violation of that order is \u201ca contractual breach, but not a legal one\u201d (para. 184). For two reasons, I disagree.\n[123] First, it is inappropriate to interfere with the trial judge\u2019s finding of mixed fact and law that HMOD engaged in fraud absent a palpable and overriding error. It is trite law that appellate courts must take special care not to make original findings of fact or mixed fact and law unless they can point, with the requisite precision, to an obvious error that impacts the result (see generally Housen).\n[124] The trial judge had the advantage of hearing the evidence first-hand, including the explanations of some of the key actors. The majority judges in the Court of Appeal were rightly careful not to impose their own interpretation of the evidence. Said respectfully, I am of the view that the dissenting judge did not follow that rule. In order to set aside the trial judgment, palpable and overriding errors would have to be shown in respect of each of the judge\u2019s findings as to the sources of HMOD\u2019s fraud. While I fix on the finding in respect of Procedural Order No. 11 as sufficient for dismissing the appeal, other examples present serious challenges to the appellant Eurobank. For example, Eurobank has not succeeded, in my eyes, in showing a reviewable error in the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that HMOD\u2019s withdrawal of its undertaking not to demand payment was fraudulent conduct. Again with the utmost respect, I am unconvinced by the explanation of the dissenting judge for interfering with the trial judge\u2019s conclusion on this point. The characterization that \u201c[t]he undertaking did not have a specific duration\u201d (para. 177) strikes me as an inaccurate interpretation of the promise made by HMOD. In point of fact, HMOD undertook not to demand payment \u201cfor as long as the [arbitration] procedure is ongoing\u201d (A.R., vol. IV, at p. 199). The undertaking did have a specific duration \u2014 until the moment the award was issued \u2014 even if that date was not certain. Be that as it may, the finding of fraud in respect of Procedural Order No. 11 suffices here.\n[125] Second, while it is true that a provisional order of an arbitral tribunal is not susceptible of being homologated, it does not follow that HMOD could not have engaged in fraud by violating Procedural Order No. 11. I agree that a breach of contract, without more, is not fraud. However, a breach of contract, like any other behaviour in a transaction that \u201cimport[s] some aspect of impropriety, dishonesty or deceit\u201d (Cineplex, at para. 31), can amount to fraud. Whether a breach of contract amounts to fraud is a matter of mixed fact and law to which deference is owed on appeal. I add that we are concerned with whether HMOD\u2019s conduct amounts to fraud by a third party under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee, not with whether a provisional order of an arbitral tribunal can be enforced by a court. I agree with the majority judges on appeal that HMOD\u2019s conduct was, as found by the trial judge, an instance of fraud upon which he could rely (C.A. reasons, at paras. 58-60).\n[126] Overall, there is no basis to interfere with the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that HMOD engaged in misconduct that is sufficient to trigger, as the fraud of a third party, the fraud exception in Canadian law. However, I emphasize again that I make no comment as to whether HMOD might have engaged in fraud under Greek law or whether its conduct could bring about any consequences with respect to the Letter of Guarantee before the Greek courts, and I recall that the relevant judgments of those courts have not been recognized as enforceable under Quebec law. For the purposes of the Letter of Counter-Guarantee, given its very terms, it is sufficient to conclude that HMOD\u2019s conduct amounts to fraud of a third party. The remaining issue to be decided is whether Eurobank, as beneficiary, is \u201cinnocent\u201d of that fraud.\n(2) HMOD\u2019s Fraud Became Eurobank\u2019s Own\n[127] As Le Dain J. wrote, the fraud exception is \u201cconfined to fraud by the beneficiary of a credit and should not extend to fraud by a third party of which the beneficiary is innocent\u201d (Angelica-Whitewear, at p. 84). An Ontario court correctly observed that \u201c[i]t is implicit in the foregoing comment that the fraud exception in letter of credit cases might extend to fraud by a third party of which the beneficiary of the letter of credit cannot be said to be innocent\u201d (Royal Bank v. Darlington, 1995 CarswellOnt 2661 (WL), [1995] O.J. No. 1044 (Lexis) (C.J. (Gen. Div.)), at para. 231; see also Global Steel Ltd. v. Bank of Montreal, 1999 ABCA 311, 244 A.R. 341, at para. 21).\n[128] The sense given to conduct of a beneficiary that is not \u201cinnocent\u201d needs to be circumscribed so as not to upset the autonomous character of letters of credit, even where they are interlocking as is the case here. I am mindful that, while an innocent beneficiary is entitled to expect that the fraud of a third party will not be attributed to them because they are not asked to police the underlying transaction, the issuer and their client are equally entitled to expect that the fraud exception may apply if the beneficiary bears responsibility for that fraud as its own. Therefore, the issue is whether the fraud of the third party can fairly be considered as that of the beneficiary.\n[129] A beneficiary ceases to be \u201cinnocent\u201d when they have knowledge of the fraud of the third party and participate in that fraud. When there is both knowledge and participation, the third party\u2019s fraud \u2014 in this case HMOD \u2014 can fairly be attributed to the beneficiary \u2014 here, Eurobank, under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. To be clear, when the fraud of a third party is attributed to the beneficiary, that fraud becomes the beneficiary\u2019s own; this is not indirect or vicarious liability. Attributing the fraud of a third party to the beneficiary is merely an application of the fraud exception to the beneficiary of the relevant letter of credit.\n[130] As is always the case, clear knowledge of an obvious fraud prior to payment by the financial institution is required (see L\u2019Heureux and Lacoursi\u00e8re, at p. 411; B. Crawford et al., The Law of Banking and Payment in Canada (loose-leaf), at \u00a7 13:171). A beneficiary cannot be responsible, in the commercial or civil sense, for fraud of which it had no knowledge (Sarna, at pp. 5-56 and 5-57; see also R. P. Buckley, \u201cThe 1993 Revision of the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits\u201d (1995), 28 Geo. Wash. J. Int\u2019l L. & Econ. 265, at p. 308; E. A. Caprioli, Le cr\u00e9dit documentaire: \u00e9volution et perspectives (1992), at No. 373). This makes good sense because, unfortunately, parties will at times participate in commercial fraud unwittingly. Author Lazar Sarna gives the example of a \u201chidden fraudulent act\u201d such as \u201cthe falsification of the true boarding date by a carrier without the knowledge of the beneficiary\u201d (pp. 5-56 and 5-57).\n[131] However, simply knowing about the fraud of a third party is not sufficient. A beneficiary does not engage in fraud unless they participate in it. As L\u2019Heureux and Lacoursi\u00e8re note, [translation] \u201c[i]t is . . . clear in Canadian and Quebec law that only fraud committed by the beneficiary is recognized, including that of a third party when the beneficiary participated in it\u201d (p. 411; see also Crawford et al., at \u00a7 13:171; Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais Canada v. First Mercantile Investment Corp., 1996 CarswellOnt 4711 (WL), [1996] O.J. No. 4309 (Lexis) (C.J. (Gen. Div.)), at para. 44). Participation can, as in this case, take the form of honouring a demand for payment in improper circumstances. It can also take the form of knowingly presenting fraudulent documents to the issuer. All that is required is some action by the beneficiary that involves them in the fraud of the third party. Where, for example, a beneficiary demands payment, for its own advantage, knowing of the third party\u2019s fraud, that is fraud on an independent measure of which the beneficiary is not innocent.\n[132] Since both knowledge and participation are required, the scope of the fraud exception will be kept appropriately narrow. Beneficiaries can take comfort in knowing that the fraud of a third party will not be attributed to them unless they have actively taken on responsibility for that fraud. A well-intentioned beneficiary that unwittingly facilitates the fraud of a third party or chooses to not participate in the fraud of a third party need not worry that fraud will be attributed to them. Equally, a beneficiary who demands payment where it did not know of the fraud of the third party will remain innocent. Limiting the scope of the fraud exception in this way will protect the reliability of Canadian letters of credit. However, a beneficiary becomes a co-author of the fraud of a third party by knowingly participating in the misconduct and, as a result, will have that fraud attributed to them; in such a circumstance, the fraud exception may rightly apply so that the letter of credit cannot be used to facilitate a clear case of fraud.\n[133] The trial judge held that Eurobank knew \u201cthat HMOD\u2019s conduct constituted clear fraud\u201d (para. 196) because HMOD\u2019s demand was made in contravention of orders of the ICC Arbitral Tribunal and of the Superior Court (para. 197). Mainville J.A. agreed that Eurobank \u201cclearly did\u201d know of HMOD\u2019s fraud (at para. 72), and pointing to the evidence relating to Procedural Order No. 11, he observed that \u201c[i]t is clear in this case that Eurobank had sufficient knowledge of the fraud prior to paying\u201d (para. 71). Hamilton J.A. acknowledged that Eurobank had \u201cnotice\u201d of Procedural Order No. 11 (para. 212). Notwithstanding that knowledge, he concluded that \u201cit was not clear and obvious that [HMOD\u2019s] request was fraudulent\u201d (para. 223).\n[134] With respect, the dissenting judge failed to identify a palpable and overriding error in the trial judge\u2019s conclusion of mixed fact and law that Eurobank knew of and participated in HMOD\u2019s fraud. The trial judge found that Eurobank \u201cdid indeed voluntarily make the payment knowing that HMOD\u2019s conduct constituted clear fraud\u201d (para. 196 (emphasis deleted)). He wrote that Eurobank paid HMOD \u201cin contravention of not one but two orders. One from the ICC Arbitral Tribunal and another from Justice Davis of the Quebec Superior Court\u201d (para. 197), which lends support to his conclusion that Eurobank knew of HMOD\u2019s fraud. More significantly, there is evidence, including testimony from Eurobank\u2019s employees that made the decision to pay HMOD, to support a finding that Eurobank knew that HMOD demanded payment under the Letter of Guarantee in contravention of Procedural Order No. 11 of the ICC Arbitral Tribunal.\n[135] At trial, Dimitri Konstantopoulos, General Director of Corporate Banking at Eurobank, agreed with a proposition put to him that Eurobank was \u201caware that there [was] an ICC ruling against the Ministry of Defense saying \u2018do not request payment under the letter of guarantee\u2019\u201d (A.R., vol. VIII, at p. 50). Athanasios Danis, Director of the Legal Department of Eurobank at the time that payment was made to HMOD, testified that he was aware that Bombardier sought and obtained interim relief from the ICC Arbitral Tribunal that enjoined HMOD from demanding payment under the Letter of Guarantee. He also testified that he had concerns \u201cabout the good faith of HMOD\u201d (p. 64). While a simple absence of good faith is not sufficient to trigger the fraud exception, the testimony from Mr. Konstantopoulos and Mr. Danis indicates that Eurobank knew of the conduct by HMOD that, by Canadian standards, amounts to fraud. In that light, it was open to the trial judge to conclude that Eurobank knew of HMOD\u2019s fraud.\n[136] The dissenting judge agreed that \u201cEurobank obviously knew that the demand [for payment under the Letter of Guarantee] was being made on the eve of the final arbitration award\u201d (C.A. reasons, at para. 217). However, he concluded that Eurobank \u201cdid not know that HMOD expected to lose or intended to keep the funds regardless of the outcome\u201d (para. 217). At that point, \u201cEurobank only had suspicions\u201d (para. 217). While I agree that mere suspicions \u201cshould not be assimilated to knowledge of fraud\u201d (para. 218), I respectfully do not share the view that Eurobank\u2019s knowledge of HMOD\u2019s fraud was a mere suspicion. Eurobank\u2019s employees who made the decision to pay HMOD testified at trial that they knew that HMOD was enjoined from demanding payment under the Letter of Guarantee and that the issuance of the final arbitral award was imminent. Eurobank was not merely suspicious that HMOD demanded payment contrary to Procedural Order No. 11; it clearly knew that this was happening. At the very least, this suggests that Eurobank knew that the demand for payment was made in contravention of at least one order, which, in the circumstances, amounts to clear knowledge of the fraudulent conduct of HMOD.\n[137] Therefore, I see no basis to interfere with the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that Eurobank had clear knowledge of HMOD\u2019s fraud.\n[138] Moreover, I have been shown no palpable and overriding error in the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that \u201cEurobank may not have conceived the fraudulent plot, it may not have supplied the weapons, but it surely participated in pulling the trigger\u201d and that Eurobank \u201cknowingly enabled fraud to produce its fruits\u201d (para. 205). Eurobank actively participated in HMOD\u2019s fraud by paying HMOD in improper circumstances.\n[139] In sum, because Eurobank knew of and participated in HMOD\u2019s fraud, it became the co-author of that fraud and must, for the purposes of the fraud exception, bear responsibility for it. HMOD\u2019s fraud became Eurobank\u2019s own. As the beneficiary of the Letter of Counter-Guarantee, it is Eurobank\u2019s fraud that is actionable before Quebec courts.\n[140] I add that, while the Letter of Counter-Guarantee was issued to ensure that Eurobank would be paid if it had to pay HMOD under the Letter of Guarantee, all Canadian letters of credit are issued subject to the fraud exception. Much like how Eurobank was entitled to rely on the near certainty of being paid in normal circumstances, Bombardier, as the client of the issuing bank, was entitled to rely on the availability of the fraud exception should it apply. Indeed, there is evidence to suggest that the decision to have a letter of credit subject to Quebec law was designed to ensure that the fraud exception be made available for Bombardier\u2019s protection. The structure involving two letters of credit was devised, as Fran\u00e7ois Ouellette, Vice-President of Legal Services and Contracts for the Business Aviation Division of Bombardier, explained at trial, to [translation] \u201cavoid a risk of fraud\u201d (A.R., vol. IX, at p. 9). He testified that, as part of the transaction that involved an international dimension and foreign law which brought uncertainties, Bombardier sought comfort in dealing with a Canadian bank and in knowing that the fraud exception in Canadian law could apply. Eurobank, as a party to the Letter of Counter-Guarantee, took whatever risks this entailed for it as beneficiary of that letter. At trial, Mr. Ouellette said:\n[translation] . . . we at Bombardier . . . we know the law that governs the issuance of and collection on letters of credit under Quebec law, which explains the requirement that a letter of credit issued by a foreign bank be subject to a counter\u2011guarantee by a local bank.\n. . .\n. . . [T]he reason behind our requirement that there be a letter of counter\u2011guarantee was precisely to avoid having to go and fight before the Greek courts. . . . [T]he letter of counter\u2011guarantee also meant that we weren\u2019t subject to a fraudulent collection because under Canadian rules . . . , the exception to collection on a letter of credit is fraud, so the letter of counter\u2011guarantee from the National Bank protected us against any fraud attempt by the Greek government.\n(A.R., vol. IX, at pp. 66 and 99-100)\n[141] Against this backdrop, the fraud exception applies to ensure that Bombardier and the National Bank will not have to assume the losses associated with fraud attributed to Eurobank as its own.\n[142] Finally, Eurobank\u2019s alternative argument that it acted under duress is without foundation. No basis has been shown to interfere with the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that Eurobank\u2019s conduct as beneficiary was voluntary. Eurobank knew of HMOD\u2019s fraud and demanded payment from the National Bank, fully aware of the circumstances. I accept that Eurobank was clearly in a difficult position: it no doubt felt pressure from HMOD, and it no doubt saw the possible risk that, in Canada, it might lose its case on the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. But as the trial judge found, Eurobank did not resist pressure from HMOD \u201cafter considering the risks that resistance would have entailed\u201d (para. 203). Between two options, Eurobank made a choice to demand payment from the National Bank rather than face the consequences of denying payment to HMOD. It did not act involuntarily in so doing. It chose to knowingly participate in fraud under competing pressures. On one hand, it could have refused to participate in HMOD\u2019s fraud which would have prevented it from becoming a co-author of that fraud under Canadian law. On the other hand, it could have exposed itself to well-founded allegations of fraud under Canadian law in order to avoid what seemed to be more serious liability under Greek law. It chose the latter course of conduct. Eurobank, as a Greek bank, might well have made a reasonable business decision in these challenging circumstances, but for our purposes one only needs to observe is that its decision was voluntary and not imposed. Given that Eurobank acted voluntarily, it is not necessary to decide whether duress provides an excuse to the fraud exception more generally. I would note, however, that when pressed at the hearing, Eurobank was unable to point to any authority to support its claim that there is a duress exception to the fraud exception (transcript, at p. 21).\n(3) Conclusion on the Fraud Exception\n[143] I conclude that the fraud exception applies with respect to Eurobank\u2019s demand for payment under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. Given that Eurobank, as the beneficiary of the Letter of Counter-Guarantee, knew of and participated in fraud by HMOD, that fraud can be attributed to it as though it was its own. The requirement that there be fraud by the beneficiary is therefore met. Moreover, there is no question that Eurobank\u2019s fraud was brought to the attention of the National Bank, the issuer of the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. On that basis, the National Bank was rightly enjoined by the trial judge from paying out any amount under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee to Eurobank and the majority of the Court of Appeal made no mistake in confirming that conclusion.\nVI. Impact of the Nullity of the Offsets Contract on the Letter of Counter-Guarantee\n[144] Although most of the trial judge\u2019s analysis focused on the fraud exception, he wrote that \u201c[i]t is difficult to accept in law that the invalidity, ab initio, of the Offsets Contract . . . does not cause the invalidity of the instruments that were issued to guarantee the obligations flowing from said contract\u201d (para. 237). He added that \u201c[i]t is obvious that the Letter of Guarantee that was declared null and void ab initio by the ICC Arbitral Tribunal Final Award which has been homologated by this Court, the Counter-Guarantee must follow suit and that [the National Bank] should be ordered not to pay Eurobank\u201d (para. 240). On that basis, he held that the Letter of Counter-Guarantee is null. A majority of the Court of Appeal upheld this conclusion.\n[145] Respectfully, I would note that the trial judge was mistaken to say that the ICC Arbitral Tribunal declared the Letter of Guarantee to be null because the Offsets Contract is null. In its final award, the ICC Arbitral Tribunal concluded that \u201c[t]he Offsets Contract is declared null and void ab initio, together with its Articles 20 related to Liquidated Damages and 21 related to the Letter of Guarantee\u201d (A.R., vol. VI, at p. 143).\n[146] Eurobank appealed the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that the Letter of Counter-Guarantee is null to the Court of Appeal. The majority upheld this conclusion. Hamilton J.A. would have allowed the appeal because he found that the fraud exception did not apply. In proposing to dismiss the action instituted by Bombardier against Eurobank, he did not include a plain direction as to whether or on what basis he would find the Letter of Counter-Guarantee valid.\n[147] Before this Court, Bombardier argues that the Letter of Counter-Guarantee is null because the Offsets Contract is null. Given the manner in which issues were joined at trial and on appeal, and the fact that this argument was presented as an alternative basis to deciding whether the National Bank should be enjoined from paying Eurobank under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee, I will refrain from deciding the matter. That said, Bombardier\u2019s argument touches on an unsettled point of law that is, in my view, worthy of three comments.\n[148] First, if a beneficiary demands payment under a letter of credit when they know that the underlying contract is null, such conduct might trigger the fraud exception (see Angelica-Whitewear, at p. 83; McGuinness, at \u00a717.338; OMERS Realty, at para. 45). This should not be confused with a dispute regarding the underlying contract (Angelica-Whitewear, at p. 70). Demanding payment pursuant to a contested right is not fraud. By contrast, demanding payment knowing that one has no right to be paid under the underlying contract may well be fraudulent, depending on the circumstances.\n[149] Second, in Quebec law, there is a \u201crequirement, spoken to in art. 1371 C.C.Q., to the effect that it is of the essence of an obligation arising out of a juridical act that there be a cause which justifies its existence\u201d (6362222 Canada inc. v. Prelco inc., 2021 SCC 39, at para. 72). It may well be argued that the objective cause of the obligation to make payment by the issuing bank in a letter of credit may be detached from, and not inherently dependent on, the underlying contract.\n[150] Third, there may be room to argue that, if an underlying contract is contrary to public order, so are the letters of credit arising from it (see A. Peters, \u201cStandby Letters of Credit in Financing Transactions\u201d (1994), 13 Nat. B.L. Rev. 40, at p. 53). But Crawford et al. note the paucity of judicial consideration of the question of whether manifest illegality of the underlying transaction would justify an issuer in refusing to pay on an otherwise conforming demand under a letter of credit (\u00a7 13:176). This suggests to me that the matter need not be decided here, and that it probably should not. Since this appeal can be disposed of by addressing an issue that was fully developed and argued \u2014 the fraud exception \u2014 I would leave these questions for another day.\nVII. Disposition\n[151] On the basis that the fraud exception applies to the Letter of Counter-Guarantee to preclude the National Bank from paying Eurobank under that letter, I would dismiss the appeal with costs payable by the appellant Eurobank.\nThe reasons of Karakatsanis and C\u00f4t\u00e9 JJ. were delivered by\nC\u00f4t\u00e9 J. \u2014\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nParagraph\nI.

Overview\n[152] This appeal requires our Court to consider the proper limits of the fraud exception to the autonomy of demand guarantees in complex international commercial transactions. This case is of great importance for the banking industry since clarity and predictability are required for the efficient operation of these financial instruments.\n[153] The appellant Eurobank Ergasias S.A. is a Greek bank whose predecessor issued a demand guarantee, governed by Greek law (\u201cLetter of Guarantee\u201d), in favour of the appellant Hellenic Ministry of National Defense (\u201cHMOD\u201d). The Letter of Guarantee was secured by a counter\u2011guarantee, governed by Quebec law (\u201cLetter of Counter\u2011Guarantee\u201d), issued by the respondent National Bank of Canada (\u201cNational Bank\u201d) at the request of the respondent Bombardier inc.\n[154] It is alleged that HMOD acted fraudulently by demanding payment under the Letter of Guarantee, to Eurobank\u2019s knowledge, such that Eurobank\u2019s decision to pay was fraudulent for the purposes of the Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee. Invoking the fraud exception, Bombardier petitioned the Quebec courts to, among other things, enjoin National Bank from reimbursing Eurobank under the Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee. An injunction was granted on a provisional basis. Bombardier sought a permanent injunction to the same effect, which was granted by the Quebec Superior Court and upheld, in a divided decision, by the Quebec Court of Appeal.\n[155] I am of the view, like Hamilton J.A. of the Quebec Court of Appeal, that the action instituted by Bombardier against Eurobank and National Bank should be dismissed. To conclude otherwise in the present case requires dismissing as irrelevant the decisions of the Greek courts, which, in my view, cannot be ignored for the determination of this case. International comity is an essential guiding principle when giving a factual effect to or enforcing a foreign decision, and in this case, there is no public policy rationale for not giving weight to the judgments of the Greek courts.\n[156] Taking the judgments of the Greek courts into account, I am of the opinion that the conclusion to be reached is that HMOD\u2019s demand for payment under the Letter of Guarantee was neither fraudulent nor tantamount to fraud. Even had I accepted that HMOD\u2019s conduct was fraudulent or tantamount to fraud, Eurobank would, in my view, be innocent of that fraud. There is an inherent contradiction in the requirement that a reviewing court place itself in the position of the issuing bank at the time of payment to assess whether it had sufficient knowledge of any fraud, but at the exact same time discard the decisions of the courts of competent jurisdiction that were binding on that bank and informing this knowledge. The trial judge\u2019s conclusion that the fraud exception applies as per the requirements established in Bank of Nova Scotia v. Angelica\u2011Whitewear Ltd., [1987] 1 S.C.R. 59, cannot stand. Unlike the majority in the Court of Appeal, I see reviewable errors in the trial judge\u2019s findings and in his ultimate conclusion.\n[157] For the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal.\nII. Factual and Legal Context\nA. The Relevant Contractual Arrangements\n[158] On November 20, 1998, Bombardier and HMOD entered into a procurement contract (\u201cProcurement Contract\u201d) for the manufacturing of 10 CL\u2011415 firefighting amphibious aircraft in addition to other services and equipment, for a total value of US$252,151,899. As a condition of the Procurement Contract, Bombardier was to enter into a second contract with HMOD (\u201cOffsets Contract\u201d). Pursuant to the Offsets Contract, Bombardier agreed to subcontract part of the manufacturing of the aircraft to Greek suppliers.\n[159] In entering into the Offsets Contract, Bombardier agreed to a liquidated damages clause, the amount of which was to be secured by a demand guarantee to be issued by a Greek bank (arts. 20 and 21, reproduced in A.R., vol. IV, at p. 95). The parties agreed that all disputes relating to the Offsets Contract would be submitted to an arbitral tribunal, seated in Paris, under the rules of the International Chamber of Commerce (\u201cICC Arbitral Tribunal\u201d) (art. 25). Like the Procurement Contract, the Offsets Contract was governed by Greek law (art. 28).\n[160] On February 5, 1999, the Letter of Guarantee was issued by Eurobank\u2019s predecessor, ANZ Grindlays Bank Limited, in favour of HMOD to secure the payment of any potential liquidated damages.[1] The Letter of Guarantee was backed by the Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee previously issued by National Bank on January 29, 1999, at Bombardier\u2019s request. It is noteworthy that the Letter of Guarantee is governed by Greek law, while the Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee is governed by Quebec law.\nB. Chronology of Events\n[161] On December 30, 2008, Bombardier filed a request for arbitration before the ICC Arbitral Tribunal, claiming that it was impossible to fulfill some of its obligations under the Offsets Contract. HMOD contested the claim. Neither Eurobank nor National Bank was a party to these proceedings.\n[162] On June 17, 2010, HMOD agreed to reduce the amount of the Letter of Guarantee by half given Bombardier\u2019s partial performance of the Offsets Contract (art. 21.3). The amount currently in issue is US$13,868,354.60.\n[163] On April 2, 2012, HMOD wrote to Bombardier advising it that since it had not satisfied its full obligations under the Offsets Contract, HMOD would be calling for payment on the Letter of Guarantee.\n[164] On April 10, 2012, Bombardier informed HMOD and the ICC Arbitral Tribunal that it would seek interim injunctive relief to prevent HMOD from calling on the Letter of Guarantee until the arbitral award was released.\n[165] On April 20, 2012, HMOD wrote to Bombardier and the ICC Arbitral Tribunal, expressly undertaking not to demand payment under the Letter of Guarantee \u201cfor as long as the [arbitration] procedure is ongoing\u201d and until the final award was rendered (\u201cWritten Undertaking\u201d) (A.R., vol. IV, at p. 199). HMOD provided this Written Undertaking on the assumption that the proceedings would end shortly.\n[166] On August 15, 2012, Bombardier sought permission to amend its arbitration claim to raise an additional issue \u2014 whether the Offsets Contract was null and void for violating European Union competition law. Permission to amend was granted and Bombardier filed a supplemental brief on December 3, 2012. As a result of that amendment, a second hearing had to be scheduled. This caused significant delay in the arbitration proceedings.\n[167] On July 17, 2013, more than 15 months after the Written Undertaking had been provided, HMOD issued a formal decision approving the call on the Letter of Guarantee. It did so in accordance with its sovereign rights, following the applicable administrative procedures.\n[168] On July 29, 2013, Bombardier and HMOD were informed that the ICC Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s award would be rendered by December 31, 2013.\n[169] On July 31, 2013, HMOD sent a letter to Bombardier informing it that it was in default of its obligations under the Offsets Contract and had to pay the penalty (US$13,868,354.60).\n[170] On August 5, 2013, HMOD made a first demand to Eurobank for the immediate payment of the outstanding amount under the Letter of Guarantee.\n[171] On August 13, 2013, at Bombardier\u2019s request, the ICC Arbitral Tribunal issued an interim order enjoining HMOD from demanding any payment under the Letter of Guarantee until its final award was issued (\u201cInterim Order\u201d). Again, neither Eurobank nor National Bank was a party to the proceedings in which the Interim Order was sought.\n[172] The same day, National Bank received an affidavit from Eurobank indicating that although it had received no new demand for payment from HMOD, it expected to receive one. Bombardier then wrote to HMOD seeking assurances that it would comply with the Interim Order.\n[173] On August 14, 2013, HMOD\u2019s counsel replied that they were not in a position to provide a written undertaking that HMOD would comply with the Interim Order. Given this unwillingness to provide such an assurance, Bombardier proceeded with an application for an injunction before Pr\u00e9vost J. of the Quebec Superior Court.\n[174] During the injunction hearing, Bombardier learned that on August 12, 2013, Eurobank had received a second demand for payment under the Letter of Guarantee from HMOD. The demand complied with the terms of the Letter of Guarantee.\n[175] On August 16, 2013, Eurobank made a request to National Bank for payment under the Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee. It made clear that HMOD was insisting that Eurobank pay under the Letter of Guarantee.\n[176] The same day, Pr\u00e9vost J. of the Quebec Superior Court granted Bombardier\u2019s motion for a provisional injunction, which was to remain in force until August 26, 2013, and ordered HMOD to withdraw its demand for payment. Pr\u00e9vost J. also ordered Eurobank to refrain from paying any amount under the Letter of Guarantee and National Bank to refrain from paying any amount under the Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee (2013 QCCS 6892 (\u201cPr\u00e9vost Injunction\u201d)). This injunction was issued on the basis of art. 3138 of the Civil Code of Qu\u00e9bec (\u201cC.C.Q.\u201d) and art. 940.4 of the former Code of Civil Procedure, CQLR, c. C-25 (\u201cC.C.P.\u201d) (essentially equivalent to art. 623 of the Code of Civil Procedure, CQLR, c. C-25.01). The latter provision allows Quebec courts to \u201cgrant provisional measures before or during arbitration proceedings\u201d. To reiterate, only Bombardier and HMOD were parties to the arbitration proceedings.\n[177] On August 20, 2013, Eurobank applied to the Athens One\u2011Member First Instance Court for an injunction compelling HMOD to withdraw its request for payment under the Letter of Guarantee and enjoining HMOD from making any new requests until the ICC Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s final award was issued.\n[178] On August 22, 2013, Judge Pana of the Athens One\u2011Member First Instance Court allowed \u201cthe claimant (temporarily) not to liquidate the Guarantee letter without suffering any legal consequences\/penalties until the hearing of the petition for the interim measures on the hearing date set out below\u201d (\u201cPana Injunction\u201d; A.R., vol. VI, at p. 29).\n[179] The Pr\u00e9vost Injunction, which was to remain in force for only 10 days, expired on August 26, 2013. Bombardier did not seek its renewal until four months later.\n[180] On November 22, 2013, Eurobank\u2019s petition for an injunction was heard on the merits by Judge Kostis of the Athens One\u2011Member First Instance Court. The Pana Injunction was extended until Judge Kostis\u2019s final decision was rendered.\n[181] On December 5, 2013, the ICC Arbitral Tribunal informed Bombardier and HMOD that it had submitted its final award to the ICC Court for approval.\n[182] On December 16, 2013, Judge Kostis rendered his decision and dismissed Eurobank\u2019s petition for an injunction (\u201cKostis Decision\u201d). There was no appeal possible from the Kostis Decision.\n[183] On December 18, 2013, acting on the basis of the Kostis Decision, HMOD presented Eurobank with its third and final demand for payment under the Letter of Guarantee.\n[184] On December 19, 2013, Eurobank informed National Bank that its application for injunctive relief had been dismissed by Judge Kostis. It further explained that the Pana Injunction was therefore no longer in effect and that, given that there was no operative injunction, it had to issue payment to HMOD. Consequently, Eurobank demanded payment under the Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee.\n[185] The same day, Bombardier filed an application for provisional, interlocutory and permanent injunctions.\n[186] On December 20, 2013, Davis J. renewed the Pr\u00e9vost Injunction for a period of 10 days (\u201cDavis Injunction\u201d). The Davis Injunction was also issued on the basis of art. 3138 C.C.Q. and art. 940.4 of the former C.C.P.\n[187] On December 23, 2013, the ICC Arbitral Tribunal informed the parties that its final award had been approved and that it would be communicated to the parties on December 31, 2013.\n[188] The same day, Eurobank contacted HMOD and asked it to reconsider its demand for payment in light of the Davis Injunction. In response, HMOD served Eurobank with a demand letter ordering it to pay in accordance with the Letter of Guarantee without any further delay, failing which HMOD would \u201ctake not only civil but also criminal legal measures\u201d against Eurobank (\u201cExtrajudicial Invitation\u2011Protest\u201d) (A.R., vol. VI, at p. 151 (emphasis deleted)).\n[189] On December 24, 2013, Eurobank paid HMOD US$13,868,354.60 pursuant to the Letter of Guarantee.\n[190] On December 27, 2013, Eurobank reiterated its demand for payment under the Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee.\n[191] On December 31, 2013, the ICC Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s final award was released (\u201cArbitral Award\u201d). It ruled that the \u201cOffsets Contract is declared null and void ab initio, together with its Articles 20 related to Liquidated Damages and 21 related to the Letter of Guarantee\u201d (A.R., vol. VI, at p. 143).\n[192] On January 8, 2014, Schrager J. (as he then was) issued a safeguard order which enjoined National Bank from paying under the Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee until the matter was finally determined by a Quebec court.\n[193] On April 14, 2015, the Arbitral Award was affirmed in all respects by the Paris Court of Appeal.\n[194] On December 24, 2018, Eurobank instituted proceedings before the Athens One\u2011Member First Instance Court against HMOD for unjust enrichment to recover the amount it paid under the Letter of Guarantee.\n[195] On November 29, 2019, the Athens One\u2011Member First Instance Court rendered its decision, finding in favour of Eurobank and ordering HMOD to reimburse the funds.\n[196] On December 8, 2020, that decision was overturned by the Athens Court of Appeal. It found that HMOD was not bound by (1) the Written Undertaking or (2) the Interim Order. Eurobank further appealed that decision to the Hellenic Supreme Court.\n[197] On January 9, 2024, the Hellenic Supreme Court released its decision, confirming the conclusions of the Athens Court of Appeal in full. The decision of the Hellenic Supreme Court was released after the hearing before this Court, while the appeal was under reserve. It is final and cannot be appealed. Eurobank successfully filed a motion for leave to adduce that decision as further evidence before this Court. Given that the decision bears on a \u201cdecisive or potentially decisive\u201d issue, the motion was rightfully granted (Palmer v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759, at p. 775).\nIII. Procedural History\nA. Quebec Superior Court, 2018 QCCS 2127 (Wery J.)\n[198] Bombardier sought an injunction before the Quebec Superior Court to enjoin National Bank from paying any amount under the Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee; it also sought the homologation of the Arbitral Award.\n[199] With respect to Bombardier\u2019s request for an injunction, Wery J. recognized the important principle of autonomy of letters of credit and that it is subject to the fraud exception. He held that HMOD\u2019s conduct amounted to fraud for the following reasons: HMOD had threatened Eurobank with severe consequences if it failed to comply with its demand for payment, the timing of the demand was only days before the Arbitral Award was released, and the demand was made in defiance of both the Interim Order and the Davis Injunction.\n[200] Eurobank argued that, notwithstanding HMOD\u2019s misconduct, it did not act fraudulently because it did everything it could to avoid HMOD\u2019s demand and paid only when HMOD threatened it with severe legal repercussions. In rejecting this argument, Wery J. acknowledged that Eurobank had a difficult choice to make, but, in his view, Eurobank\u2019s decision to pay was wrongful given HMOD\u2019s fraud. Therefore, National Bank was enjoined from paying any amount under the Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee.\n[201] Wery J. homologated the Arbitral Award and ordered HMOD to comply with it. Given that the ICC Arbitral Tribunal had found that the Offsets Contract was null and void ab initio, it followed, according to Wery J., that the instruments issued to guarantee its performance were also null and void.\nB. Quebec Court of Appeal, 2022 QCCA 802\n(1) Mainville J.A., Baudouin J.A. Concurring\n[202] Writing for the majority, Mainville J.A. allowed the appeal only in part so as to strike from Wery J.\u2019s decision the order compelling HMOD to comply with the Arbitral Award. He held that the Quebec Superior Court had no jurisdiction to order HMOD to comply with the Arbitral Award, as it is neither domiciled nor resident in Quebec. He concluded that otherwise Wery J. made no reviewable errors, including with respect to his finding that the Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee was not enforceable in the circumstances of the case.\n[203] Mainville J.A. held that HMOD\u2019s conduct amounted to fraud. He rejected HMOD\u2019s submission that it could not have acted fraudulently given that it complied with the judgments of the Greek courts and with Greek law. He found that public policy considerations compelled him to disregard the Kostis Decision and the judgment of the Athens Court of Appeal. Thus, Wery J. was correct in giving no weight to the Kostis Decision. As a result, Mainville J.A. determined that Eurobank had sufficient knowledge of HMOD\u2019s fraud prior to paying.\n(2) Hamilton J.A., Dissenting\n[204] Hamilton J.A. dissented. He would have allowed the appeal and set aside in part Wery J.\u2019s judgment. He would have dismissed the action instituted by Bombardier against Eurobank and National Bank.\n[205] Hamilton J.A. determined that Wery J. put too heavy a burden on Eurobank. While the record hinted at the possibility of HMOD\u2019s conduct being fraudulent, it did not necessarily follow that Eurobank knew of or participated in that fraud such that it could be attributed as its own.\n[206] The language of the Letter of Guarantee clearly established that (1) HMOD was not required to obtain a judgment confirming that it was owed money before it could call the Letter of Guarantee, and (2) Eurobank could not refuse to pay even if Bombardier had taken any legal action before any court of law in any country.\n[207] While an injunction could be sought to prevent a demand under the Letter of Guarantee, it had to be issued by the right court and for the right reasons. Bombardier did not attempt to obtain an injunction from the Greek courts, which were the courts of competent jurisdiction. The fact was that Judge Kostis refused to issue the injunction sought by Eurobank. No appeal of this decision was possible. In these circumstances, Hamilton J.A. concluded that it was difficult to criticize Eurobank for not having complied with the Interim Order and the Davis Injunction.\n[208] Eurobank knew that HMOD\u2019s fraudulent demand was being made on the eve of the final arbitral award, but it did not know that HMOD expected to lose and that it intended to keep the funds regardless of the outcome. At that stage, Eurobank only had suspicions; Eurobank was diligent, took steps to investigate, and sought an injunction, which was refused. It was not clear or obvious, at that moment, that there was fraud.\n[209] Hamilton J.A. noted that the transaction was supposed to be risk\u2011free for Eurobank and that it should not bear the risk of HMOD\u2019s fraudulent conduct. Bombardier knew, or should have known, that there were risks involved in dealing with a branch of the Greek government, and it assumed those risks in light of the profit that it hoped to gain under the Procurement Contract.\nIV. Issues\n[210] Eurobank raises the following three issues in its factum:\n(1) What are the proper limits to the fraud exception to the autonomous nature of demand guarantees?\n(2) Could the Quebec courts rule that Eurobank\u2019s conduct amounted to bad faith when it abided by the judgments rendered by the Greek courts?\n(3) How is risk to be apportioned between the parties to a complex commercial transaction scheme utilizing demand guarantees?\nV. Analysis\n[211] At the outset of my analysis, I believe that a clarification is in order. Although the parties and the courts below refer to the instruments in dispute as letters of credit, they are best referred to as demand guarantees.\n[212] Letters of credit and demand guarantees are widely used in international commercial transactions. These financial instruments are issued by banks to secure the parties\u2019 performance of their contractual obligations. While letters of credit and demand guarantees are similar in nature and are governed by many of the same principles, they each have a distinct purpose. Letters of credit are designed to secure the fulfillment of the transaction; parties are expected to draw on them as the primary method of payment. Demand guarantees, like standby letters of credit, are contingent in nature. They will be called on only when a contractual obligation is not performed or is partly performed (R. Goode, \u201cAbstract Payment Undertakings in International Transactions\u201d (1996), 22 Brook. J. Int\u2019l L. 1, at pp. 3\u20114).\n[213] The Letter of Guarantee and the Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee are best referred to as demand guarantees in the circumstances. This is so for two reasons. First, the purpose of these instruments is to secure payment under the Offsets Contract\u2019s liquidated damages clause, so they are contingent in nature. They would be called upon only if Bombardier failed to fulfill its offsets obligations. Second, the Letter of Guarantee and the Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee are expressly stated to be subject to the Uniform Rules for Demand Guarantees (1992): \u201cOUR COUNTER\u2011GUARANTEE . . . IS SUBJECT TO THE UNIFORM RULES FOR DEMAND GUARANTEES (ICC PUBLICATION 458)\u201d (A.R., vol. IV, at p. 118).\nA. Demand Guarantees Are Autonomous\n[214] Demand guarantees are contracts established at the request of a principal whereby the guarantor, usually a bank, irrevocably promises to pay the beneficiary on demand, irrespective of any ongoing dispute between the principal and the beneficiary. Like letters of credit, demand guarantees are autonomous. In Angelica\u2011Whitewear, the leading case in Canada on letters of credit, Le Dain J. summarized the rationale behind the principle of autonomy as follows:\nThe fundamental principle governing documentary letters of credit and the characteristic which gives them their international commercial utility and efficacy is that the obligation of the issuing bank to honour a draft on a credit when it is accompanied by documents which appear on their face to be in accordance with the terms and conditions of the credit is independent of the performance of the underlying contract for which the credit was issued. Disputes between the parties to the underlying contract concerning its performance cannot as a general rule justify a refusal by an issuing bank to honour a draft which is accompanied by apparently conforming documents. [Emphasis added; p. 70.]\n[215] This rationale is equally applicable to demand guarantees. Le Dain J. noted in Angelica\u2011Whitewear that the principle of autonomy is reflected in the general provision of the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (1962). It is also reflected in the international rules that govern demand guarantees, that is, the Uniform Rules for Demand Guarantees (1992), as well as their 2011 revision. Articles 2b) and 2c) of the 1992 uniform rules expressly enshrine the principle of autonomy:\nb) Guarantees by their nature are separate transactions from the contract(s) or tender conditions on which they may be based, and Guarantors are in no way concerned with or bound by such contract(s), or tender conditions, despite the inclusion of a reference to them in the Guarantee. The duty of a Guarantor under a Guarantee is to pay the sum or sums therein stated on the presentation of a written demand for payment and other documents specified in the Guarantee which appear on their face to be in accordance with the terms of the Guarantee.\nc) . . . Counter\u2011Guarantees are by their nature separate transactions from the Guarantees to which they relate and from any underlying contract(s) or tender conditions, and Instructing Parties are in no way concerned with or bound by such Guarantees, contract(s) or tender conditions, despite the inclusion of a reference to them in the Counter\u2011Guarantee.\n[216] While the terms and conditions for payment of a demand guarantee reflect the underlying contract, the guarantor undertakes to pay regardless of external facts or events. In this sense, the demand guarantee is independent from the underlying contract (N. L\u2019Heureux and M. Lacoursi\u00e8re, Droit bancaire (5th ed. 2017), at pp. 428\u201129). Indeed, when parties to a commercial transaction agree to use demand guarantees to secure the performance of their obligations, they express their intention to be bound by a \u201cpay now, argue later\u201d structure (J. F. Dolan, \u201cTethering the Fraud Inquiry in Letter of Credit Law\u201d (2006), 21 B.F.L.R. 479, at p. 480 (emphasis added)).\n[217] The guarantor\u2019s obligation to pay is triggered solely on the terms and conditions specified by the principal. These requirements may also be supplemented by the Uniform Rules for Demand Guarantees if they are expressly incorporated. Once the terms and conditions are set, [translation] \u201cthe only control that [the bank, and not the principal,] may exercise is over the regularity of the documents tendered by the beneficiary\u201d (C. Gilbert, \u201cSimilarit\u00e9s et distinctions entre la fraude du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire d\u2019un cr\u00e9dit documentaire et celle du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire d\u2019une garantie de bonne ex\u00e9cution\u201d (1987), 17 R.D.U.S. 585, at p. 590). The guarantor\u2019s role in ensuring, with \u201creasonable care\u201d (Uniform Rules for Demand Guarantees (1992), art. 9), that the tendered documents strictly comply with the terms and conditions of the demand guarantee is [translation] \u201cstrictly financial\u201d (Gilbert, at p. 590). In this regard, Le Dain J. wrote that \u201c[t]he fundamental rule is that the documents must appear on their face, upon reasonably careful examination, to be in accordance with the terms and conditions of the letter of credit\u201d (Angelica\u2011Whitewear, at p. 94 (emphasis in original)).\n[218] The bank\u2019s role as a guarantor is thus simple. The bank must pay when presented with a compliant demand. It cannot investigate the circumstances of the underlying contract to determine whether the obligation secured by the demand guarantee was performed. The bank does not have the specialized skill and experience to be a \u201creferee on matters that divide the parties to the secured contract\u201d (R. F. Bertrams, Bank Guarantees in International Trade (4th ed. rev. 2013), at p. 82). The bank should not and is not expected to \u201center into controversies\u201d between the parties to the underlying contract (Sztejn v. J. Henry Schroder Banking Corp., 31 N.Y.S.2d 631 (Sup. Ct. 1941), at p. 633).\nB. The Fraud Exception to the Principle of Autonomy\n[219] The guarantor\u2019s obligation to pay when presented with a compliant demand is subject to one exception \u2014 fraud. Pursuant to Angelica\u2011Whitewear, the principal has two options to prevent payment under a demand guarantee. First, it can seek an interlocutory injunction from a court of competent jurisdiction to restrain the bank from honouring the demand by establishing a strong prima facie case of fraud. Otherwise, the principal must present sufficient evidence of fraud to the guarantor before payment is made. The guarantor should refuse payment only in the rare cases where it has clear or obvious knowledge of the fraud (Angelica\u2011Whitewear, at p. 84).\n[220] The two rationales behind the fraud exception are to ensure that courts do not endorse fraud and to maintain the commercial utility and efficacy of demand guarantees (R. P. Buckley and X. Gao, \u201cThe Development of the Fraud Rule in Letter of Credit Law: The Journey So Far and the Road Ahead\u201d (2002), 23 U. Pa. J. Int\u2019l. Econ. L. 663, at pp. 664\u201167). The exception must be kept narrow. As Le Dain J. stressed in the context of letters of credit, \u201c[t]he potential scope of the fraud exception must not be a means of creating serious uncertainty and lack of confidence in the operation of letter of credit transactions; at the same time the application of the principle of autonomy must not serve to encourage or facilitate fraud in such transactions\u201d (Angelica\u2011Whitewear, at p. 72). The same can be said for demand guarantees. Parties should not resort to the courts to enjoin banks from paying under a demand guarantee where no strong prima facie case of fraud exists or where clear or obvious evidence of fraud cannot be established.\n(1) Fraud Is a High Bar\n[221] Courts can look to either the tendered documents or the underlying contract to detect fraud (Angelica\u2011Whitewear, at p. 83). However, an allegation of fraud is not an invitation for courts to allow sophisticated commercial parties to refashion their agreement to an \u201cargue now, pay later\u201d structure when the bar is not met (Dolan, at p. 480 (emphasis added)). Fraud is a high bar, and the exception will not apply where the principal can only prove conduct amounting to \u201csomething less than fraud\u201d (Standard Trust Co. (Liquidation) v. Bank of Nova Scotia, 2001 NFCA 27, 201 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 8, at paras. 70\u201172; see also Northern American Trust Co. v. Hospitality Equity Corp., [1995] A.J. No. 1306 (Lexis), 1995 CarswellAlta 1171 (WL) (Q.B.), at para. 31; Johannesen (Re), 2002 ABQB 756, 218 D.L.R. (4th) 148, at para. 47).\n[222] Fraud in this context lacks a precise definition, and Le Dain J. did not provide one in Angelica\u2011Whitewear. On a general level, fraud involves some aspect of [translation] \u201cpublic order\u201d (J. Stoufflet, \u201cFraud in Documentary Credit, Letter of Credit and Demand Guaranty\u201d (2001), 106 Dick. L. Rev. 21, at p. 23). I agree with the intervener, the Canadian Bankers\u2019 Association, that bad faith alone is not enough to establish fraud (I.F., at para. 22). It has to be something more, and it has to be tailored to the specific context of demand guarantees (Bertrams, at p. 373). Cases in which the fraud exception is applied often rely on the definition set out by Blair J. (as he then was) in Cineplex Odeon Corp. v. 100 Bloor West General Partner Inc., [1993] O.J. No. 112 (Lexis), 1993 CarswellOnt 2358 (WL) (C.J. (Gen. Div.)), at paras. 31\u201132 (WL):\nFraud is a straightforward five\u2011letter word, meaning just what it says: \u201cfraud\u201d. Fraud is not simply a legitimate dispute or disagreement over the interpretation of a contract, however one-sided that dispute may appear. While the notion of fraud may elude precise definition, it is a concept well\u2011known to the law, and it must, in my view, import some aspect of impropriety, dishonesty or deceit. In Washburn v. Wright (1913), 31 O.L.R. 138 (App. Div.), Mr. Justice Riddell said, at p. 147.\nBut, suppose the defendant was wrong in this or in any other respect, there is absolutely no evidence of fraud. Fraud is not mistake, error in interpreting a contract; fraud is \u201csomething dishonest and morally wrong, and much mischief is . . . done, as well as much unnecessary pain inflicted, by its use where \u2018illegality\u2019 and \u2018illegal\u2019 are the really appropriate expressions:\u201d Ex p. Watson (1888), 21 Q.B.D. 301, per Wills, J., at p. 309.\nCases where the demand on the letter of credit can be said to be \u201cclearly untrue or false\u201d, or \u201cutterly without justification\u201d, or where it is apparent there is \u201cno right to payment\u201d, all fall within the foregoing principles and must be read in the context of those \u201cfraud\u201d principles: see C.D.N. Research & Development Ltd. v. Bank of Nova Scotia (1980), 18 C.P.C. 62 (Ont. H.C.), at p. 65; Henderson v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce et al. (1982), 40 B.C.L.R. 318 (B.C.S.C.), at p. 320; Edward Owen Engineering Ltd. v. Barclays Bank International Ltd.[, [1978] 1 Q.B. 159 (C.A.)], at p. 169. [Underlining added.]\nAs Blair J. noted, there needs to be some aspect of impropriety, dishonesty or deceit; the case must be one where the demand on the guarantee can be said to be \u201cclearly untrue or false\u201d or \u201cutterly without justification\u201d or where \u201cit is apparent there is \u2018no right to payment\u2019\u201d.\n[223] In this regard, I agree that \u201c[i]f a beneficiary demands payment while knowing that they have no right to be paid under the underlying contract, that conduct may amount to fraud\u201d (Justice Kasirer\u2019s reasons, at para. 114, citing K. McGuinness, The Law of Guarantee (3rd ed. 2013), at \u00a717.338). However, an understanding of the factual context is essential. What may at one time constitute a valid demand may at a later time be deemed invalid. This does not mean that the beneficiary had no right to make its demand for payment at the time of making it. Again, a demand guarantee by its very nature is independent from any underlying dispute. A demand for payment will be fraudulent only if it is apparent to the beneficiary that there was no right to payment when it was presented, for instance because the underlying contract had already been found to be void (see, e.g., OMERS Realty Corp. v. 7636156 Canada Inc. (Trustee in Bankruptcy of), 2020 ONCA 681, 153 O.R. (3d) 271, at para. 45). In the absence of such knowledge, a simple demand for payment under the demand guarantee is neither fraudulent nor tantamount to fraud.\n(2) Clear or Obvious Knowledge of Fraud\n[224] A guarantor is bound to pay under a demand guarantee unless it is specifically enjoined from doing so by a court of competent jurisdiction or unless clear or obvious evidence of the beneficiary\u2019s fraud has been brought to its attention (Angelica\u2011Whitewear, at pp. 84\u201185). To define \u201cclear or obvious knowledge\u201d, it is not useful to compare it with the absence of knowledge. It goes without saying that no knowledge is not \u201cclear or obvious knowledge\u201d. Some knowledge may exist without amounting to \u201cclear or obvious knowledge\u201d. For example, suspicious circumstances are of no legal consequence. The bank must pay when the requirements for payment are otherwise met, regardless of any suspicion (Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Bank of Nova Scotia (1988), 4 O.R. (3d) 100 (H.C.J.), at pp. 119\u201120).\n[225] \u201cClear or obvious knowledge\u201d is also a high standard. The test is not \u201cwhether a court will or may eventually determine that there was fraud, but rather when the [guarantor] looked at the situation, was it clear and obvious to [the guarantor] acting reasonably that there had been a fraud\u201d (Bank of Montreal v. Mitchell (1997), 143 D.L.R. (4th) 697 (Ont. C.J. (Gen. Div.)), at p. 716 (emphasis added), aff\u2019d on appeal (1997), 151 D.L.R. (4th) 574 (Ont. C.A.)). What is \u201cclear or obvious\u201d fraud in a legal sense is not necessarily \u201cclear or obvious\u201d in a commercial sense (M. S. Kurkela, Letters of Credit and Bank Guarantees Under International Trade Law (2nd ed. 2008), at p. 179). That is why, when a court is asked to review the legality of a bank\u2019s decision to honour its obligation to pay pursuant to a demand guarantee, it must place itself in the exact same situation that the bank was in at that time, without resorting to ex post facto reasoning (Angelica\u2011Whitewear, at pp. 100\u2011102).\n[226] The standard must be high for three reasons. First, as the Alberta Court of Appeal recently stated in Pacific Atlantic Pipeline Construction Ltd v. Coastal Gaslink Pipeline Ltd, 2024 ABCA 74, at para. 7 (CanLII):\nThe stricter standard ensures courts do not too readily interfere with the operation of letters of credit and undermine their utility and efficacy. The characteristic that gives letters of credit international commercial utility and efficacy is that they operate independently of disputes about performance of the underlying contract. They are intended to provide beneficiaries a \u201cready means of obtaining prompt payment\u201d. Where a beneficiary presents an issuing bank a draft accompanied by documents that appear on their face to be in accordance with the terms and conditions of the letter of credit, the bank is generally obliged to honour the draft: Angelica\u2011Whitewear at 70\u201173. This autonomy permits \u201cboth assurance and immediacy of payment\u201d: Lazar Sarna, Letters of Credit: The Law and Current Practice, 3rd ed (Toronto: Thomson Reuters, Release 2024-1) at 5:1 (WL Can).\n[227] Second, the standard must be high to ensure that the parties to the underlying transaction, who had the opportunity to assess the risks of the transaction and to negotiate the law applicable to it, do not transfer those risks to the institution securing the transaction. By agreeing to provide a demand guarantee, the principal (here Bombardier) agrees to assume the risk of payment \u201cbeing made notwithstanding that [it] can subsequently establish in litigation or arbitration that the dispute is to be resolved in [its] favour\u201d (Veolia Water Technologies, Inc. v. K+S Potash Canada General Partnership, 2019 SKCA 25, 440 D.L.R. (4th) 129, at para. 43, citing Ouais Group Engineering & Contracting Ltd. v. Saipem SPA, [2013] EWHC 990 (Q.B.), at para. 45). Transferring the risk to the issuing bank would upset its role in this type of transaction. A bank\u2019s only obligation is, and should remain, to strictly abide by the instructions incorporated in the demand guarantee. After all, banks stand to earn only marginal remuneration as guarantors. Their \u201crelatively modest remuneration is based on the assumption that the bank\u2019s task is confined to duties which can be performed quickly, easily and almost mechanically\u201d (Bertrams, at p. 82).\n[228] Third, the standard must be high because when fraud is alleged regarding a demand for payment under a demand guarantee, banks are faced with a dilemma. Making a wrong assessment on whether to honour the demand for payment exposes the bank to a lawsuit by the beneficiary. However, by paying out, the bank risks failing to obtain reimbursement from the principal (P. Ellinger and D. Neo, The Law and Practice of Documentary Letters of Credit (2010), at p. 149). That is why the fraud contemplated by the clear or obvious standard is one [translation] \u201cthat is blatantly apparent\u201d (J.\u2011P. Mattout, Droit bancaire international (4th ed. 2009, at p. 258). Any doubt must benefit the beneficiary: [translation] \u201cFraud must not be open to interpretation; otherwise doubt will necessarily favour the beneficiary\u201d (ibid., at p. 259). As Waller J. observed in Turkiye Is Bankasi AS v. Bank of China, [1996] 2 Lloyd\u2019s Rep. 611 (Q.B.D.), at p. 617:\nIt is simply not for a bank to make enquiries about the allegations that are being made one side against the other. If one side wishes to establish that a demand is fraudulent it must put the irrefutable evidence in front of the bank. It must not simply make allegations and expect the bank to check whether those allegations are founded or not. [Emphasis added.]\n[229] It goes without saying that where allegations and counter\u2011allegations are made regarding fraud, it is not for the bank to make a determination or take sides; otherwise it would find itself \u201centangled in an insoluble conflict of interests\u201d (Bertrams, at p. 81). This task is best reserved for the courts of competent jurisdiction.\n(3) Third\u2011Party Fraud in the Context of Counter\u2011Guarantees\n[230] In Angelica\u2011Whitewear, Le Dain J. wrote that fraud committed by a third party should not prevent an innocent beneficiary from demanding payment on a letter of credit (at p. 84). This statement must be adapted to the present context, which involves a letter of guarantee backed by a counter\u2011guarantee. Indeed, fraud committed by the beneficiary of a letter of guarantee is always third\u2011party fraud for the purposes of the counter\u2011guarantee. I agree that where the guarantor has clear or obvious knowledge of the beneficiary\u2019s fraud under the letter of guarantee but decides to pay nonetheless, that fraud can be attributed to the guarantor.\n[231] What triggers the demand for payment under a counter\u2011guarantee is payment under the guarantee. To determine whether a beneficiary\u2019s demand for payment under a counter\u2011guarantee was fraudulent, a court must look past the clear line of separation between the guarantee and the counter\u2011guarantee. This inquiry must not be transformed, however, into a dispute over the underlying contract (Bombardier Inc. v. Hermes Aero, 2004 CanLII 7014 (Que. Sup. Ct.), at paras. 35 and 40; Banque Nationale du Canada v. CGU Cie d\u2019assurance du Canada, 2004 CanLII 49434 (Que. Sup. Ct.), at para. 49; SNC\u2011Lavalin Constructeurs international inc. v. Shariket Kahraba Skikda.spa, 2010 QCCS 3236, at para. 27 (CanLII); SNC\u2011Lavalin Polska SP. ZOO v. BNP Paris Canada, 2017 QCCS 3694, at paras. 40\u201146 (CanLII)).\nVI. Application\n[232] The issues in the present case can be summarized as follows: Does Eurobank\u2019s conduct prevent it from asking for payment under the Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee? My analysis first focuses on Eurobank\u2019s main argument, which is that in order to answer this question, the Court has to determine, for the purposes of the Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee, whether Eurobank should have made payment under the Letter of Guarantee. Second, I discuss Eurobank\u2019s alternative argument, which is that this Court should consider only whether the demand for payment complies with the relevant terms of the Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee.\nA. The Impact of the Judgments of the Greek Courts for the Purposes of the Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee\n[233] Before reviewing the circumstances of HMOD\u2019s demand for payment and Eurobank\u2019s decision to honour it, I must mark an important departure from the reasoning of the courts below. In my view, and I say this with respect, the trial judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal erred by not giving any \u2014 not even a little \u2014 weight to the judgments of the Greek courts. They simply ignored them.\n[234] At the outset, I acknowledge that the Greek judgments were not formally recognized under art. 3155 C.C.Q. and are therefore not enforceable in Quebec. However, this is irrelevant since the Letter of Guarantee was governed by Greek law and the parties to the Letter of Guarantee were not domiciled in Quebec. There would have been no reason to seek the recognition and enforcement of the Greek judgments because there was simply nothing in these decisions to be enforced in Quebec. Quebec courts have no prima facie jurisdiction over the merits of any dispute arising from the Letter of Guarantee.\n[235] While the Greek judgments are not binding on Quebec courts, in this context, the principle of comity must guide any determination regarding the weight to be given to them (Spar Aerospace Ltd. v. American Mobile Satellite Corp., 2002 SCC 78, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 205, at para. 17). It is important to bear in mind that when foreign judgments are received in evidence without being formally recognized in Quebec, they still make prima facie proof of the reported facts, of the proper application of the foreign law and of the foreign court\u2019s jurisdiction over the matter under art. 2822 C.C.Q. Foreign decisions cannot simply be ignored by Quebec courts (Canadian Forest Navigation Co. v. R., 2017 FCA 39, [2017] 4 C.T.C. 63, at para. 16, quoting H. K\u00e9lada, Reconnaissance et ex\u00e9cution des jugements \u00e9trangers (2013), at p. 37). In the absence of any dispute as to the authenticity of a foreign decision or as to the foreign court\u2019s jurisdiction to render it, Quebec courts must recognize the [translation] \u201cfactual effect\u201d of that decision (G. Goldstein and E. Groffier, Droit international priv\u00e9, t. I, Th\u00e9orie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale (1998), at p. 372; C. Emanuelli, Droit international priv\u00e9 qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (3rd ed. 2001), at No. 327; G. Goldstein and J. A. Talpis, L\u2019effet au Que\u0301bec des jugements e\u0301trangers en matie\u0300re de droits patrimoniaux (1991), at pp. 14\u201116 and 53\u201157; J.\u2011G. Castel, \u201cKuwait Airways Corp. c. Irak, 2010 CSC 40\u201d (2011), 56 McGill L.J. 751, at p. 758). A foreign decision introduced as evidence is a factual constraint on the Quebec courts and should be treated as such; [translation] \u201c[i]t is not about extending the effects that the foreign decision has in a foreign country to Quebec, but about taking the foreign decision into consideration as a fact\u201d (Goldstein and Groffier, at p. 372). It is of fundamental importance to give effect to foreign decisions introduced as evidence because they constitute [translation] \u201ca certain and precise basis of expectations\u201d for the parties upon which they are binding (P. Mayer, V. Heuz\u00e9 and B. Remy, Droit international priv\u00e9 (12th ed. 2019), at No. 372).\n[236] Of course, a trial judge is free to determine the appropriate weight to be given to a foreign decision in light of all of the evidence (see, e.g., Digiulian v. Succession de Digiulian, 2022 QCCA 531). However, a trial judge cannot second\u2011guess the reported facts or the proper application of the foreign law by the foreign court (K\u00e9lada, at pp. 37\u201138, quoting B. Audit and L. D\u2019Avout, Droit international priv\u00e9 (6th ed. 2010), at No. 459; see also Emanuelli, at No. 326; Goldstein and Groffier, at pp. 373\u201174, quoting Bauron v. Davis (1897), 6 B.R. 547, at p. 553). Yet in dismissing the Kostis Decision, the trial judge wrote:\nIt is puzzling that Justice Kostis had come to the conclusion that \u201cit [could] not be speculated that third Respondent [Eurobank] made a commitment for the non-forfeiture of the Letter of Guarantee, while being duly represented with respect to such commitment\u201d. As we have seen, the proof of HMOD\u2019s commitment not to draw on the Letter of Guarantee was out there in writing.\nIt\u2019s even more confusing that Justice Kostis could have come to that conclusion in his six\u2011page ruling, when one considers that his colleague Justice Pana had arrived at a completely different conclusion in [her] detailed and well\u2011crafted 30\u2011page ruling as regards HMOD\u2019s conduct . . . .\nThe merits did not bring any new light that would bring this Court to another conclusion. HMOD\u2019s conduct did constitute fraud under the exception rule to the autonomy of letters of credit.\n. . .\nThat ruling, which was essentially of a procedural nature had decided that the conditions of an interlocutory injunctive order had not been met in this case, because the claimant would not suffer irreparable harm that could not be repaired by damages from a solvent party like the Hellenic Ministry of Defence (HMOD).\nConsequently, HMOD\u2019s Extrajudicial Invitation Protest ordered Eurobank to \u201ccomply with the judgment\u201d that had ordered nothing to Eurobank.\nEurobank did nothing before this Court nor the Greek courts after it received HMOD\u2019s Extrajudicial Invitation Protest. It is also difficult to accept that Eurobank could not have gone back before the Greek courts as soon as the ICC Arbitral Tribunal Final Award was handed down or that it could not have been able to take action to recuperate the money it had paid to HMOD, even if the task might have been long and difficult. The judgment of Justice Kostis was based on the very premise that HMOD was a solvent defendant, as a member of the European Union and that it would be in a position to reimburse Eurobank if damages were granted by the Greek courts. Once the ICC Arbitral Tribunal Final Award had declared the Offsets Contract null and void, it makes little doubt that the Greek courts would have had no choice but to draw the inescapable consequence thereof and to refuse to order payment to HMOD or ultimately condemn the latter to reimburse Eurobank . . . . [Emphasis in original; paras. 189\u2011202 (CanLII).]\n[237] There was no dispute as to the authenticity of the Kostis Decision. It is also undisputed that the Greek courts had jurisdiction over the Letter of Guarantee given that the parties were domiciled in Greece and given that it was governed by Greek law (Offsets Contract, art. 28; Procurement Contract, art. 35.5, reproduced in A.R., vol. IV, at p. 65). While it was open to the trial judge to determine the weight to be given to the Kostis Decision as a fact informing whether HMOD\u2019s conduct was fraudulent, the trial judge could not consider the \u201cmerits\u201d of the decision in doing so. However, that is precisely what he did: \u201cThe merits did not bring any new light that would bring this Court to another conclusion\u201d (para. 191). In disregarding the Kostis Decision on the basis of its merits, the trial judge went against the rule codified in art. 2822 C.C.Q., which provides that a decision \u201cpurporting to be issued by a competent foreign public officer makes proof of its content against all persons\u201d. Contrary to the position of my colleague on this point, this, in my view, amounts to an error of law. In these circumstances, the trial judge had to give the Kostis Decision a \u201cfactual effect\u201d, and he committed an error of law in giving it none.\n[238] I am also of the view, contrary to my colleague\u2019s position, that the trial judge made reviewable errors, i.e., palpable and overriding errors, in disregarding the Kostis Decision.\n[239] First, the trial judge misread the Pana Injunction and, as a result, unduly criticized the Kostis Decision that dismissed Eurobank\u2019s application for an interlocutory injunction. The trial judge found that it was \u201cpuzzling\u201d and \u201ceven more confusing that Justice Kostis could have come to [the] conclusion [to dismiss Eurobank\u2019s application for injunctive relief] in his six\u2011page ruling, when one considers that his colleague Justice Pana had arrived at a completely different conclusion in [her] detailed and well\u2011crafted 30\u2011page ruling as regards HMOD\u2019s conduct\u201d (paras. 189\u201190). With respect, that finding by the trial judge was patently wrong. As HMOD explains, Judge Pana\u2019s ruling was confined to four lines on the last page of the document (A.F., at paras. 64\u201166). The remaining 28 pages reproduced Eurobank\u2019s application in its entirety. Judge Pana did not make any finding or ruling regarding HMOD\u2019s conduct in those four lines:\nThe court accepts the request for preliminary injunction.\nThe court allows [Eurobank] (temporarily) not to liquidate the Guarantee letter without suffering any legal consequences\/penalties until the hearing of the petition for the interim measures on the hearing date set out below.\n(A.R., vol. VI, at p. 29)\nThis error was overriding. It led the trial judge to dismiss as irrelevant the Kostis Decision when considering whether HMOD\u2019s third and final demand for payment was fraudulent and whether Eurobank\u2019s decision to pay amounted to participation in that fraud.\n[240] Second, it was simply wrong for the trial judge to determine that Eurobank could not rely on the Kostis Decision to justify its decision to pay under the Letter of Guarantee on the basis that Judge Kostis \u201chad not ordered Eurobank to pay\u201d (para. 198). The fundamental nature of demand guarantees must be kept in mind, namely their autonomy from the underlying contract. Under a demand guarantee, a bank has a near absolute obligation to pay the agreed sum on presentation of a compliant written demand. The Letter of Guarantee is an irrevocable and definite undertaking to pay. In light of the objective and spirit of such a letter, Eurobank had no choice but to pay unless it was specifically enjoined from doing so \u2014 and as per the Kostis Decision, it was not.\n[241] Third, the trial judge clearly erred when he held that, in light of the Arbitral Award, \u201cGreek courts would have had no choice but to draw the inescapable consequence thereof and to refuse to order payment to HMOD or ultimately condemn the latter to reimburse Eurobank\u201d (para. 202). Irrespective of the fact that this assertion inappropriately questions the merits of the Kostis Decision and shows ex post facto reasoning, it was simply wrong to determine that the Arbitral Award resulted in this \u201cinescapable consequence\u201d. Eurobank\u2019s claim against HMOD in Greece was dismissed by both the Athens Court of Appeal and the Hellenic Supreme Court in decisions which confirmed, albeit indirectly, the Kostis Decision. The Athens Court of Appeal concluded that HMOD could call on the letter when it did. HMOD was no longer bound by the Written Undertaking at the time, it could not be bound by the Interim Order, and its demand was validly presented before any judgment of the ICC Arbitral Tribunal had been released (A.R., vol. III, at p. 104). The Athens Court of Appeal suggested that even though Eurobank was not entitled to repayment, Bombardier could seek recourse for unjust enrichment against HMOD once the Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee was paid out (pp. 103\u20115). The Hellenic Supreme Court confirmed the Athens Court of Appeal\u2019s conclusions in full and dismissed Eurobank\u2019s claim (Hellenic Supreme Court decision, reproduced in motion to adduce fresh evidence, at pp. 51\u201181).\n[242] One ground of appeal raised by Eurobank before the Quebec Court of Appeal related to the trial judge\u2019s treatment of the Kostis Decision. In support of its position, Eurobank filed the Athens Court of Appeal\u2019s decision as new evidence. Mainville J.A. reviewed this decision but ultimately refused to give it any weight, confirming the trial judge\u2019s treatment of the Kostis Decision. In doing so, Mainville J.A. repeated the trial judge\u2019s error of law under art. 2822 C.C.Q. and the three palpable and overriding errors that I have identified (para. 65 (CanLII), citing Sup. Ct. reasons, at paras. 189\u201191). He also stated that \u201cpublic policy considerations may compel a Quebec court to disregard a foreign law or a foreign judgment\u201d (para. 67). In his view, the outcome reached by the Athens Court of Appeal was inconsistent with public order as understood in international relations, and the Greek judgments were rendered in contravention of the principles of reciprocity, order, and fairness. He concluded that the public order exception in arts. 3081 and 3155(5) C.C.Q. prevented the Kostis Decision from being recognized and enforced in Quebec.\n[243] Respectfully, Mainville J.A. erred in doing so. Articles 3081 and 3155(5) C.C.Q. cannot serve as a basis for disregarding the \u201cfactual effect\u201d of the Greek judgments. Nor can the \u201cbalancing exercise\u201d governing the recognition and enforcement of foreign decisions at common law, because that exercise is already codified in art. 3155(5) C.C.Q. (Pro Swing Inc. v. Elta Golf Inc., 2006 SCC 52, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 612, at paras. 27 and 30). Eurobank did not ask for Greek law to apply, but for the Greek judgments to be given a \u201cfactual effect\u201d. Article 3081 C.C.Q., which codifies the public order exception to the choice of law rules established in Book Ten of the C.C.Q., is of no relevance (Goldstein and Groffier, at p. 267; Emanuelli, at No. 464). Further, no party sought the recognition or enforcement of the Greek judgments in Quebec under art. 3155 C.C.Q. The \u201cfactual effect\u201d of a judgment is [translation] \u201cindependent\u201d from its recognition or enforcement in Quebec (J.\u2011G. Castel, Droit international priv\u00e9 qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (1980), at p. 846; Goldstein and Talpis, at p. 57; Goldstein and Groffier, at p. 372). The exception in art. 3155(5) C.C.Q. does not apply.\n[244] Importing the public order exception or other similar considerations into the assessment of the weight to be given to a foreign decision as a factual constraint is unsupported by any authority and is contrary to the text and purpose of art. 2822 C.C.Q. In conducting such an assessment, Quebec courts cannot question whether the foreign decision should be a fact on the basis of public policy considerations. It is either a fact or not. If it is a fact, it is an important one, especially when it binds the parties and informs their behaviour. Giving a \u201cfactual effect\u201d to a foreign decision is very different from applying foreign law, recognizing that decision, or incorporating its solution into Quebec\u2019s legal order.\n[245] Even if I were to accept that public policy considerations can inform the weight to be given to the Greek judgments as evidence, I would be of the view that none apply. The Kostis Decision was absolutely central to understanding HMOD\u2019s and Eurobank\u2019s conduct at the time of payment. Yet Mainville J.A. did not mention any public policy considerations for disregarding it. When considering the weight to be given to the decision of the Athens Court of Appeal, he wrote that it should be disregarded because it \u201cstands for the proposition that the Greek State may ignore with impunity both the Interim Order and the Final Award of the ICC Arbitral Tribunal even if it formally undertook to abide by the arbitration process, and even if the Final Award was confirmed in all its aspects by the Court of Appeal for Paris\u201d (para. 69).\n[246] With respect, I disagree with that approach. At this juncture, it is important to note that the Arbitral Award was not relevant to Eurobank\u2019s claim for unjust enrichment \u2014 which turns on whether HMOD had a right to call on the Letter of Guarantee at the time of payment \u2014 and, as a result, was properly not considered by the Athens Court of Appeal. Moreover, it would be inappropriate to attribute fraud to Eurobank for HMOD\u2019s alleged breach of the Interim Order given that Eurobank was not a party to the arbitration proceedings. This rationale, if applicable, should not be used to determine the evidentiary weight to be given to the Greek judgments, especially the Kostis Decision, in assessing Eurobank\u2019s conduct.\n[247] It is also important to keep in mind that public order as understood in international relations is of \u201cnarrow application\u201d and is \u201cmore limited\u201d than its domestic counterpart (Beals v. Saldanha, 2003 SCC 72, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 416, at para. 75; R.S. v. P.R., 2019 SCC 49, [2019] 3 S.C.R. 643, at para. 53; see also S. Guillemard and V. A. Ly, \u00c9l\u00e9ments de droit international priv\u00e9 qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (2019), at p. 62; Emanuelli, at No. 298). Consideration of public order is not an invitation for Quebec courts to \u201cconsider the merits of the decision or of the foreign law\u201d (R.S., at para. 52; see also Barer v. Knight Brothers LLC, 2019 SCC 13, [2019] 1 S.C.R. 573, at para. 26). Foreign decisions can be disregarded only if the consequences of attributing evidentiary weight to them \u201cwould be so inconsistent with certain of the underlying values of the Quebec legal system as to be incapable of being incorporated into it\u201d (R.S., at para. 52). As I explain below, any breach of the Interim Order or of the Arbitral Award is merely contractual. Contrary to my colleague, I am of the view that an alleged contractual breach, which alone does not amount to fraud, does not create \u201cclear conflicts\u201d with, is not \u201cmanifestly inconsistent\u201d with and does not constitute a \u201cserious\u201d divergence from Quebec public order as understood in international relations (R.S., at paras. 53\u201154; see also Justice Kasirer\u2019s reasons, at para. 108). The consequences of attributing evidentiary weight to the decisions of the Athens Court of Appeal and of the Hellenic Supreme Court are not [translation] \u201cshocking\u201d (Guillemard and Ly, at p. 61), nor do they \u201coffend our sense of morality\u201d (Beals, at para. 75). Again, giving a \u201cfactual effect\u201d to a foreign decision is different from incorporating the solution it provides into Quebec\u2019s legal order. Public order as understood in international relations cannot justify disregarding the decisions of the Athens Court of Appeal and of the Hellenic Supreme Court.\n[248] Mainville J.A. criticized the Greek courts for failing to give weight to the Quebec orders. With respect, he erred in doing so for the following reasons. First, the Quebec orders sought to govern the conduct of Greek parties under the Letter of Guarantee, which is expressly stated to be subject to Greek law (not Quebec law). Any dispute arising from the Letter of Guarantee was squarely within the jurisdiction of the Greek courts. In accordance with the principle of comity, it was for the Quebec courts to show deference to and respect for the jurisdiction of the Greek courts over the Letter of Guarantee (Morguard Investments Ltd. v. De Savoye, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 1077, at p. 1095). Second, one of the parties was not the usual litigant but a branch of the Greek government with sovereign rights, which it had decided to exercise. Third, it is doubtful that the Greek courts actually failed to give the appropriate weight to the Quebec orders. At the time the Kostis Decision was rendered, the only relevant Quebec order was the Pr\u00e9vost Injunction, which had already lapsed. Further, Judge Kostis had already ruled on the dispute by the time that the Davis Injunction was rendered. The Athens Court of Appeal and the Hellenic Supreme Court gave the appropriate weight to the Davis Injunction. They took it into account as a factual constraint on HMOD and Eurobank, while recognizing that it was not enforceable or binding in Greece, and rightly so.\n[249] Furthermore, I agree with Hamilton J.A. that the decision to grant the Quebec orders in the first place was questionable (paras. 184\u201185). Any injunction granted under art. 940.4 C.C.P. must be grounded in one of the jurisdiction\u2011conferring provisions of Book Ten of the C.C.Q. (F. Bachand, L\u2019intervention du juge canadien avant et durant un arbitrage commercial international (2005), at No. 397). The Quebec orders were issued on the basis of art. 3138 C.C.Q., which provides that Quebec courts may order provisional or conservatory measures even if they have no jurisdiction over the merits of the dispute. Under that provision, courts should rarely, if ever, issue extraterritorial injunctions: [translation] \u201c[w]here there is an absence of jurisdiction over the merits, . . . the possible extraterritorial effect of the enforcement of [provisional or conservatory] measures will directly come into play in the decision to order them or not\u201d (G. Goldstein, Droit international priv\u00e9, vol. 2, Comp\u00e9tence internationale des autorit\u00e9s qu\u00e9b\u00e9coises et effets des d\u00e9cisions \u00e9trang\u00e8res (Art. 3134 \u00e0 3168 C.c.Q.) (2012), at p. 101 (emphasis in original); see also J. A. Talpis, with the collaboration of S. L. Kath, \u201cIf I am from Grand\u2011M\u00e8re, Why Am I Being Sued in Texas?\u201d Responding to Inappropriate Foreign Jurisdiction in Quebec\u2011United States Crossborder Litigation (2001), at p. 18; Bachand, at no 397). In this case, the Quebec courts could validly enjoin National Bank from paying under the Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee, assuming that there was a strong prima facie case of fraud. However, they could not validly enjoin HMOD or Eurobank from acting under the Letter of Guarantee. Interestingly, the majority of the Court of Appeal set aside the trial judge\u2019s conclusion ordering HMOD to comply with the Arbitral Award because the trial judge had no jurisdiction in this regard (C.A. reasons, at para. 46). The same reasoning should have applied to the provisional measures sought by Bombardier. In circumstances like in the instant case, it is not open to the Quebec courts to order the Greek state to act in a particular way, especially where sovereign rights are concerned.\n[250] No public policy consideration can justify disregarding the Greek judgments. I agree with Eurobank that, \u201c[a]s a bank domiciled in Greece, judgments rendered in Greece regarding [its] operations in Greece are obviously binding upon it, no matter where else those judgments might (or might not) be recognized and enforced\u201d (A.F., at para. 178 (emphasis omitted)). However, the Quebec orders and the Interim Order were not enforceable in Greece. Any concerns about order and fairness arise from the Quebec courts\u2019 unwillingness to give weight, as factual constraints, to the Greek judgments by which the parties are and were bound. As the late J.\u2011G. Castel wisely pointed out, \u201c[p]rotecting the justified expectations of the parties is an objective that is particularly important in private international law cases involving international business transactions, as \u2018it would be unfair and improper to hold a person liable under the local law of one state when he had justifiably molded his conduct to conform to the requirements of another state\u2019\u201d (\u201cThe Uncertainty Factor in Canadian Private International Law\u201d (2007), 52 McGill L.J. 555, at pp. 558\u201159, quoting American Law Institute, Restatement of the Law, Second: Conflict of Laws 2d (1971) at \u00a76.g). This is especially true with respect to the Kostis Decision, which was contemporaneous with the facts of the present case.\n[251] In my view, the courts below could not ignore the Kostis Decision in light of both art. 2822 C.C.Q. and the circumstances of this case. Nor could the decisions of the Athens Court of Appeal and of the Hellenic Supreme Court be disregarded insofar as they confirm the Kostis Decision. Had these judgments been duly considered as facts informing HMOD\u2019s and Eurobank\u2019s conduct for the purposes of assessing whether the fraud exception applies to the Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee, the only possible conclusion in the present case would have been that HMOD\u2019s demand under the Letter of Guarantee and Eurobank\u2019s decision to pay were valid.\nB. HMOD\u2019s Demand for Payment Was Neither Fraudulent Nor Tantamount to Fraud\n[252] I will now address the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that the requirements for the fraud exception, established in Angelica\u2011Whitewear, were met. In light of all of the evidence, which I emphasize includes the Greek judgments, I am of the view that his conclusion cannot stand. The standard for fraud is a high one.\n(1) HMOD\u2019s Written Undertaking\n[253] In considering whether HMOD\u2019s conduct was fraudulent, the trial judge emphasized that HMOD went \u201cagainst its word\u201d when it demanded payment under the Letter of Guarantee (paras. 171\u201177). This was an error because he ignored the words of the Written Undertaking, the context in which it was provided, and the fact that it had been validly withdrawn at the time of HMOD\u2019s demand. In other words, he failed to interpret the Written Undertaking as a whole.\n[254] The Written Undertaking has eight paragraphs, which shed light on its context. The trial judge\u2019s conclusion ignores the first seven, which clearly state that HMOD retained all of its legal rights, including its sovereign rights under Greek public law, to draw on the Letter of Guarantee. The relevant paragraphs of the Written Undertaking read as follows:\n2. The right of [HMOD] to unilaterally impose penalties to the supplier, when the latter refuses to or does not perform appropriately his contractual obligations, is clearly provided and described both in the presidential decree governing the said contract (p.d. 284\/1989), and the contractual clauses themselves.\n3. Such right of [HMOD] is inextricably connected with the exercise of public power; the penalties that are unilaterally imposed by the administration, in execution of contractual clauses, have the character of personal administration acts that can be challenged only before the Greek administrative courts.\n4. [Bombardier] may neither forbid [HMOD] to, nor prevent it in any way from exercising its said sovereign right, namely to calculate and impose penalties, when the conditions set by law and contract concur.\n7. . . . we reiterate that [HMOD] has not contemplated, on the contrary it has denied and is denying any and all claims raised by Bombardier Inc, which you represent. We also remind that we have expressly reserved all our legal rights, and we advise you once more that, always within the context of the arbitration procedure, we do not waive our sovereign rights.\n8. In any case, given that the Hearing before the International Arbitration Court has been set for the 25th-29th of June 2012, and therefore trial termination is anticipated, our office explicitly declares that we shall wait for the decision of the International Arbitration Court which has the power to settle in a manner that is binding for the parties, the substantial matters that have arisen from disputes that are subject to its jurisdiction, and that we shall not proceed to imposing any penalties against your client, for as long as the procedure is ongoing, which (procedure) has in any case been initiated according to the law and the contract. [Emphasis added.]\n(A.R., vol. IV, at pp. 197\u201199)\n[255] These paragraphs all serve to preserve HMOD\u2019s \u201clegal rights\u201d, including its sovereign rights, to demand payment under the Letter of Guarantee, and the trial judge erred in casting them aside as meaningless. By failing to interpret the Written Undertaking as a whole, the trial judge went against the clear rule of art. 1427 C.C.Q. that \u201c[e]ach clause of a contract [must be] interpreted in light of the others so that each is given the meaning derived from the contract as a whole.\u201d\n[256] On this point, I reach the same conclusions as Hamilton J.A. I also note that Judge Kostis, the Athens Court of Appeal, and the Hellenic Supreme Court interpreted the Written Undertaking in the same way. Judge Kostis expressly considered the Written Undertaking; he concluded that it could not \u201cbe speculated that [HMOD] made a commitment for the non\u2011forfeiture of the letter of guarantee\u201d (A.R., vol. VI, at p. 76). The Athens Court of Appeal similarly concluded that HMOD\u2019s Written Undertaking did not create \u201cany false expectations on the part of [Bombardier]\u201d, given what HMOD explained in these paragraphs (A.R., vol. III, at p. 102). The Hellenic Supreme Court confirmed this conclusion (p. 66).\n[257] The trial judge also ignored the important conditions set out in paras. 4, 7 and 8 of the Written Undertaking.\n[258] The first sentence of para. 8 is of great importance. It confirms that the Written Undertaking was provided on the assumption that the arbitration hearing would proceed in June 2012 and would conclude shortly thereafter. The Written Undertaking was provided on April 20, 2012, before Bombardier raised its new issue regarding the validity of the Offsets Contract under art. 34 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, [2012] O.J. C. 326\/47. As a result of this new issue, the arbitration proceedings were delayed for another year. The circumstances in which the Written Undertaking was provided had changed significantly: the hearing was extended well beyond June 2012, and termination was no longer \u201canticipated\u201d in the same way. Clearly, the condition under which HMOD promised not to draw on the Letter of Guarantee no longer applied.\n[259] I agree with Hamilton J.A. that HMOD could validly withdraw its undertaking. As he noted, HMOD did so by putting Bombardier in default on July 31, 2013. This means that when HMOD demanded payment on December 18, 2013, the Written Undertaking was no longer in effect. Drawing on the Letter of Guarantee in this context cannot be a basis for a finding of fraud.\n[260] The Athens Court of Appeal reached the same conclusion, holding that \u201cthere exists no doubt regarding [HMOD\u2019s] intentions not to [draw on the Letter of Guarantee] in the context of the hearing already started before the [ICC]\u201d (A.R., vol. III, at p. 104). Once a new argument was made, there was no longer any obligation for HMOD to refrain from exercising its sovereign rights. The Athens Court of Appeal concluded: \u201cIn view of said facts, it was not proved whatsoever by any evidence that the behaviour of [HMOD] during forfeiture and payment to [HMOD] of the [Letter of Guarantee] was evidently abusive\u201d (p. 105).\n[261] The Hellenic Supreme Court was of the same view. It acknowledged that HMOD \u201cvoluntarily and in good faith agreed\u201d not to call the Letter of Guarantee while the arbitration proceedings were ongoing (p. 73). However, the Written Undertaking was provided on the assumption that \u201ca decision on that matter was expected to be issued by the end of 2012\u201d (ibid.). When Bombardier raised its new argument about the validity of the Offsets contract, it \u201cchanged the scope of the proceedings\u201d (ibid.). The context in which the Written Undertaking was provided changed. The Hellenic Supreme Court recognized that. As a result, it concluded that \u201cin the case at hand there was no abusive or fraudulent exercise of [HMOD]\u2019s right to request seizure of the guarantee letter payable on first demand for reasons relating to the underlying relationship between it and the debtor, a Canadian company, nor its obligation to compensate [Eurobank] on that ground\u201d (ibid., at p. 70). Indeed, paras. 4, 7 and 8 of the Written Undertaking are clear that HMOD reserved its rights and that the Written Undertaking itself was not absolute.\n(2) HMOD\u2019s Breach of the Provisional Orders\n[262] The trial judge held that HMOD\u2019s demand for payment was made in contravention of the Interim Order and of the Davis Injunction.\n[263] The context of each order is important. Both the Interim Order and the Davis Injunction were granted on the basis of the Written Undertaking, which I, like Hamilton J.A., have concluded was validly withdrawn. To obtain an injunction enjoining a beneficiary from calling for payment on a letter of guarantee, the applicant must establish \u201ca strong prima facie case\u201d that the beneficiary is \u201cexpressly disentitled\u201d from demanding payment (Veolia Water Technologies, at para. 43; see also Pacific Atlantic Pipeline Construction Ltd v. Coastal Gaslink Pipeline Ltd, 2023 ABKB 736, at para. 46 (CanLII), aff\u2019d 2024 ABCA 74, at paras. 6\u20117 and 9\u201110 (CanLII); Sirius International Insurance Co. (Publ.) v. FAI General Insurance Ltd., [2003] EWCA Civ 470, [2003] 1 W.L.R. 2214, rev\u2019d on other grounds [2004] UKHL 54, [2004] 1 W.L.R. 3251; Simic v. New South Wales Land and Housing Corporation, [2016] HCA 47, 260 C.L.R. 85).\n[264] In Pacific Atlantic Pipeline, the principal applied for an injunction to enjoin the beneficiary from drawing on a standby letter of credit. The chambers judge considered a \u201cverbal forbearance agreement\u201d pursuant to which the beneficiary had agreed not to draw on the letter of credit pending arbitration. The chambers judge acknowledged that the beneficiary had made representations that it would not draw on the instrument, but concluded that these representations did not rise to the level of certainty that a strong prima facie case requires (para. 59). While each case is factually distinct, what is common to all of them is the high bar to establish that there is legal certainty that the beneficiary intended not to draw on the instrument and that this undertaking applied at all relevant times.\n[265] In my view, the high bar that a strong prima facie case requires was not met for the Interim Order or for the Davis Injunction. This is because the Written Undertaking was validly withdrawn at the time. In fact, five days before HMOD called for payment under the Letter of Guarantee, HMOD notified Bombardier by letter that it intended to do so. HMOD attached the formal ministerial decision to that letter. Furthermore, the Written Undertaking expressly reserved HMOD\u2019s rights, including its sovereign rights, and it was provided in the context that the arbitration was expected to end in June 2012. But these circumstances changed when Bombardier raised a new argument in August 2012.\n[266] Regardless of whether the Interim Order should have been issued, it is essential to characterize the nature of the breach of that order in determining the legal consequences that should flow from it. The Interim Order was issued by the ICC Arbitral Tribunal at Bombardier\u2019s request on August 13, 2013. The Tribunal found that Bombardier had a prima facie (I note, not a strong prima facie) case for interim measures in light of the Written Undertaking given by HMOD. All parties acknowledge that the Interim Order was not and could not be enforced by the Greek courts \u2014 or by the Quebec courts (2013 QCCS 6892, at para. 5 (CanLII)). Such a breach is not equivalent to a breach of a court order. That being said, it is true that HMOD and Bombardier had agreed that the ICC Arbitral Tribunal would have jurisdiction over any dispute that might arise between them. They were contractually bound to comply with any conservatory and interim measures ordered by the Tribunal. Therefore, HMOD\u2019s breach of the Interim Order was a contractual breach. This alone does not amount to fraud.\n[267] As for the Quebec orders, HMOD presented its third and final demand for payment on December 18, 2013, i.e., at a time when there was no injunction enjoining it from doing so. Indeed, the Pr\u00e9vost Injunction had expired on August 26, 2013, and the Davis Injunction was not issued until December 20, 2013, after the demand for payment had been presented by HMOD. That demand for payment was a logical continuation of the demand of August 12, 2013, that had been suspended by the Pana Injunction. Therefore, it was an error to conclude that HMOD\u2019s demand on December 18, 2013, was in contravention of a Quebec injunction. The Davis Injunction only ordered HMOD to withdraw its demand for payment after the fact. Again, the Davis Injunction was not enforceable in Greece, and it is doubtful that it should have been issued in the first place.\n[268] Consequently, it was an error to conclude that HMOD\u2019s conduct was fraudulent or tantamount to fraud on the basis of either the Interim Order or the Davis Injunction. Neither an alleged breach of contract nor an alleged failure to comply with non\u2011binding injunctions can ground a finding of fraud in the circumstances of this case. This was also the view of the Athens Court of Appeal, which was further confirmed by the Hellenic Supreme Court (A.R., vol. III, p. 104; Hellenic Supreme Court decision, at pp. 67 and 69).\n(3) The Timing of HMOD\u2019s Demand for Payment\n[269] Another point of concern for the trial judge was the timing of HMOD\u2019s demand (paras. 182\u201184). It may be tempting to look at HMOD\u2019s conduct after the fact and determine that it engaged in some kind of fraud. Its failure to repay the money that it obtained under the Letter of Guarantee, even after the Offsets Contract was found to be null and void, is certainly questionable. I must not, however, engage in impermissible reasoning by looking at HMOD\u2019s conduct today and inferring fraud from it. Rather, I must limit myself to what occurred before the payment under the Letter of Guarantee, without the benefit of hindsight. As long as the underlying contract is valid, a beneficiary is entitled to demand payment under a demand guarantee. Indeed, the consequences of a call on a demand guarantee \u201ccan be harsh, draconian and abrupt\u201d without amounting to fraud (Royal Bank of Canada v. Darlington, [1995] O.J. No. 1044 (Lexis), 1995 CarswellOnt 2661 (WL) (C.J. (Gen. Div.)), at para. 181).\n[270] It is essential to keep in mind that the formal ministerial decision to call the Letter of Guarantee was made on July 17, 2013. The first demand for payment was presented on August 5, 2013, after a demand letter had been sent to Bombardier on July 31, 2013. Eurobank refused to honour the demand because it did not comply with the terms and conditions of the Letter of Guarantee. The second demand for payment was made on August 12, 2013, but the Pana Injunction, which was issued after that demand was made, prevented Eurobank from paying. No new demand was presented while the Pana Injunction was in force. With respect, and as I explained above, the trial judge erred in not giving weight to the Greek judgments. The Kostis Decision, which set aside the temporary Pana Injunction, was central to HMOD\u2019s decision to reiterate its demand for payment under the Letter of Guarantee. HMOD reiterated its demand for payment only once the Kostis Decision was rendered in its favour and the Pana Injunction was no longer in effect.\n[271] That third and final demand for payment was presented on December 18, 2013, only two days after the Kostis Decision, which triggered the presentation of that demand, was rendered. The demand for payment as well as the Extrajudicial Invitation\u2011Protest clearly stated that HMOD was drawing on the Letter of Guarantee pursuant to Judge Kostis\u2019s conclusions regarding the allegations of fraud (A.R., vol. VI, at pp. 79 and 149\u201150). It was totally unjustified \u2014 to say the least \u2014 for the trial judge to write that, in exercising its rights under Greek law and the Letter of Guarantee, \u201cHMOD utilized what appears to be nothing short than legal blackmail and extortion in order to force Eurobank to pay\u201d (para. 182 (emphasis added)).\n[272] On the face of the Letter of Guarantee, it is clear that HMOD could validly demand payment under it despite any objection by Bombardier or any legal action before any court of law:\nPURSUANT TO THE ABOVE, WE, ANZ GRINDLAYS BANK LIMITED, ATHENS SUPPLY THE REQUIRED LETTER OF GUARANTEE FOR THE SUPPLIER AND THUS UNDERTAKE THE OBLIGATION TO PAY YOU AFTER YOUR PREMIER AND SIMPLE REQUEST IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WITH NO ADDITIONAL PROOFS EXCEPT YOUR STATEMENT THAT THE SUPPLIER DID NOT CORRECTLY FULFILL HIS OBLIGATIONS TO PROVIDE THE AFOREMENTIONED OFFSETS WITHIN THE TIME LIMIT PROVIDED BY ARTICLE 5 PARAGRAPH 5.1 AND ARTICLE 19 OF THE ABOVE OFFSETS CONTRACT, THE WHOLE AMOUNT OF THE LETTER OF GUARANTEE WITHIN (3) THREE WORKING DAYS AFTER THE DATE OF RECEIVING YOUR DEMAND, REGARDLESS OF ANY OBJECTION AND\/OR ANY KIND OF ARGUMENTS OF THE SUPPLIER, ANY LEGAL ACTION TAKEN BY THE SUPPLIER BEFORE ANY COURT OF LAW IN ANY COUNTRY AND WITHOUT YOU HAVING TO RESORT TO A COURT OF LAW OF ARBITRATION. [Emphasis added.]\n(A.R., vol. IV, at p. 112)\n[273] Since Judge Kostis dismissed Eurobank\u2019s application for an injunction, the conclusion, from HMOD\u2019s perspective, was that it had a valid contractual right to draw on the Letter of Guarantee.\n[274] When placed in its context, as is required by both the law and the facts of this case, HMOD\u2019s decision to draw on the Letter of Guarantee does not meet the high threshold for fraud. Though HMOD acted against the Interim Order by presenting a demand and against the Davis Injunction by not withdrawing that demand, neither the Interim Order nor the Davis Injunction was enforceable in Greece. HMOD clearly acted pursuant to the Kostis Decision when it demanded payment under the Letter of Guarantee. On the basis of the Kostis Decision, it cannot be said that HMOD\u2019s demand was \u201cclearly untrue or false\u201d or \u201cutterly without justification\u201d or that it was \u201capparent there was no right to payment\u201d.\n[275] I agree with Hamilton J.A. that the trial judge erred in finding fraud on the basis of HMOD\u2019s conduct, that is, its alleged breach of the Written Undertaking, the Interim Order, and the Davis Injunction, as well as the timing of its demand. However, with respect, I do not agree with Hamilton J.A. that fraud can be inferred from HMOD\u2019s decision not to repay Eurobank after losing before the ICC Arbitral Tribunal (paras. 200\u2011201). Any finding regarding HMOD\u2019s intention to repay or not is speculative and is insufficient to ground a finding of fraud. Rather, its decision not to repay should be considered in light of the fact that the Arbitral Award had not yet been homologated in Greece. It could not be taken for granted that the Arbitral Award would be homologated in Greece and that HMOD would not comply with it if homologated. In this regard, I agree with Mainville J.A. that the trial judge had no jurisdiction to order HMOD to comply with the Arbitral Award (para. 46). At the time of the hearing before our Court, Bombardier had not yet sought the homologation of the Arbitral Award in Greece.\nC. Even if HMOD\u2019s Conduct Was Fraudulent or Tantamount to Fraud, Eurobank Was Innocent of That Fraud\n[276] I now turn to the question of whether, if I were to accept that HMOD\u2019s conduct was fraudulent or tantamount to fraud for the purposes of the Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee, the fraud exception would apply in the circumstances. I am of the view that, in light of all of the evidence, Eurobank (the beneficiary) has to be considered innocent of HMOD\u2019s (the third party) alleged fraud for the purposes of the Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee. Again, the Kostis Decision was central to Eurobank\u2019s decision to honour HMOD\u2019s demand for payment. When the Kostis Decision is taken into account, the only conclusion that can be drawn is that Eurobank did not have clear or obvious knowledge of fraud and did not participate in it. There is an inherent contradiction in the requirement that a reviewing court, in assessing whether a bank had sufficient knowledge of any fraud, place itself in the position of the issuing bank at the time of payment, but at the same time discard the decisions of courts of competent jurisdiction that were binding on that bank at the time.\n(1) Eurobank\u2019s Knowledge\n[277] When a beneficiary of a demand guarantee has committed fraud, that fraud will not be attributed to the guarantor unless it is established that the guarantor had clear or obvious knowledge of that fraud. \u201cClear\u201d in this context has been described as \u201cunambiguous, easily understood, manifest, not confused and not doubtful\u201d, while \u201cobvious\u201d means \u201ceasily seen or recognised or understood, palpable, indubitable\u201d (Royal Bank of Canada, at para. 209). Put simply, the fraud must be [translation] \u201cblatantly apparent\u201d (Mattout, at p. 258).\n[278] In assessing whether Eurobank had clear or obvious knowledge of the alleged fraud, our Court must place itself in the exact same situation that Eurobank was in by \u201cstanding in [its] shoes\u201d (Kurkela, at pp. 179\u201180; Unicredito Italiano S.P.A., Hong Kong Branch v. Alan Chung Wah Tang, [2002] HKCFI 339, at para. 32 (HKLII). Thus, I must confine myself to the facts as Eurobank knew them on December 24, 2013, the date when payment was made. Relying on information that Eurobank did not have at the time would be an error. For example, Eurobank did not know whether HMOD would be successful in the arbitration proceedings or what HMOD would do if it were to lose.\n[279] The trial judge determined that Eurobank paid under the Letter of Guarantee \u201cin full knowledge\u201d of HMOD\u2019s fraud (para. 210). He relied on the fact that Eurobank knew of the Written Undertaking as well as HMOD\u2019s decision to draw on the Letter of Guarantee in contravention of the Interim Order and of the Davis Injunction. It is undisputed that Eurobank had knowledge of these facts; however, they cannot ground the conclusion that Eurobank had clear or obvious knowledge of fraud. Let me explain.\n[280] After HMOD demanded payment under the Letter of Guarantee on August 5, 2013, Eurobank instituted its own proceedings for injunctive relief before the Athens First Instance Court. That application was ultimately dismissed on its merits by Judge Kostis on December 16, 2013. Eurobank, HMOD, Bombardier, and National Bank were all represented in these proceedings and presented their evidence as to the alleged fraud. Through this process, Judge Kostis was made aware of the arbitration proceedings, the Interim Order, the Pr\u00e9vost Injunction, and the Written Undertaking. Despite all of this, Judge Kostis determined that there were no grounds for granting the injunction: \u201c. . . this does not render the behavior of [HMOD], who defends its rights, abusive; nor can such a behavior be speculated to be abusive . . .\u201d (A.R., vol. VI, at p. 75). He refused to enjoin Eurobank from paying under the Letter of Guarantee.\n[281] Eurobank was then faced with a judgment from a court of competent jurisdiction (I stress, the only court of competent jurisdiction for the purposes of the Letter of Guarantee), which found that HMOD could validly draw on the Letter of Guarantee. The Kostis Decision, as a factual constraint, is a determinative element in the analysis of Eurobank\u2019s \u201cclear or obvious knowledge\u201d. Eurobank had knowledge of HMOD\u2019s alleged fraudulent conduct; Eurobank and the other parties presented the Greek court with evidence as it existed at the time. However, Judge Kostis still held that HMOD could validly call on the letter because there was no reason to conclude that any fraudulent act had been committed. I fail to understand how it can be concluded that Eurobank had knowledge of fraud, let alone clear or obvious knowledge.\n[282] After the Kostis Decision was rendered, HMOD reiterated its demand for payment on December 18, 2013. Eurobank subsequently contacted National Bank, informing it that it had no choice but to pay. It is clear from these exchanges that Eurobank was under the \u2014 in my view, correct \u2014 impression that HMOD was making its demand pursuant to the Kostis Decision. Indeed, Eurobank explained to National Bank that its application for injunctive relief had been dismissed by Judge Kostis. It further explained that the Pana Injunction was therefore no longer in effect. Given that there was no binding injunction, it had to issue payment to HMOD: \u201cUNDER THE TERMS OF [THE LETTER OF GUARANTEE] AND APPLICABLE GREEK LAW WE HAVE THE OBLIGATION TO PAY THE BENEFICIARY THE AMOUNT OF US$13,868,354.40 WITHIN THREE WORKING DAYS . . .\u201d (A.R., vol. VI, at p. 84).\n[283] After the Davis Injunction was granted on December 20, 2013, Eurobank even contacted HMOD, asking it to reconsider its demand for payment in light of that injunction (A.R., vol. VI, at pp. 173\u201176). This was on December 23, 2013. In response, HMOD served Eurobank with the Extrajudicial Invitation\u2011Protest, ordering it, under penalty of both civil and criminal sanctions, to make payment under the Letter of Guarantee. \u201cThese were serious sanctions and Eurobank, as a Greek bank, was exposed to them\u201d (C.A. reasons, at para. 215). In the Extrajudicial Invitation\u2011Protest, HMOD wrote that the Davis Injunction could not be enforced in Greece given the opposite judgment rendered by Judge Kostis. Moreover, HMOD stressed that \u201cthe Greek courts would lack the jurisdiction to make a judgment upon a case of interim measures and provisional injunction order for non\u2011payment of a letter of guarantee payable on demand, with the Canadian State as defendant party and beneficiary of the letter of guarantee and a Canadian Bank as debtor\u201d (A.R., vol. VI, at p. 150).\n[284] It was in this context that Eurobank had to make its decision. From Eurobank\u2019s reasonable perspective (Mitchell, at p. 716), the Kostis Decision and the Extrajudicial Invitation\u2011Protest would have dissipated any knowledge of fraud that it may have had. Indeed, Eurobank had specifically pleaded before the Greek courts in the summer of 2013 that HMOD\u2019s \u201cexercise of its right for the payment of the Letter of Guarantee [was] and continue[s] to be obviously abusive, in bad faith\u201d (A.R., vol. VI, at p. 19). But Eurobank lost on this. So any remaining suspicions that Eurobank may have had became of no moment. This is certainly not \u201cclear or obvious knowledge\u201d where fraud \u201cis blatantly apparent\u201d. I agree with Hamilton J.A. that such suspicions do not rise to the level of clear or obvious knowledge (paras. 217\u201118; Banco Nacional, at pp. 119\u201120).\n(2) Eurobank\u2019s Alleged Participation\n[285] The trial judge determined that Eurobank participated in HMOD\u2019s fraud by choosing to pay in \u201ccontravention of not one but two orders\u201d, i.e., the Interim Order and the Davis Injunction (para. 197). Although Eurobank \u201cdid not collude in any way\u201d in HMOD\u2019s alleged fraud, the trial judge nevertheless determined that it \u201cknowingly enabled fraud to produce its fruits\u201d (paras. 196 and 205). He found that Eurobank had the choice of either complying with these two orders or complying with HMOD\u2019s Extrajudicial Invitation-Protest. From Eurobank\u2019s decision to comply with the latter, the trial judge inferred fraudulent participation.\n[286] It is true that Eurobank\u2019s decision to pay was \u201cvoluntary\u201d (Sup. Ct. reasons, at para. 196). However, the voluntariness of the payment is not the appropriate inquiry. When a bank pays under a demand guarantee, it always does so voluntarily. What matters is whether Eurobank was enjoined from paying by a court of competent jurisdiction on a prima facie case of fraud or whether it was presented with clear or obvious evidence of fraud and chose to pay nonetheless, neither of which, as I have concluded, was the case. What amounts to mere suspicions of \u201cimproper circumstances\u201d does not meet this threshold. The difficulty in this case is that there were conflicting orders from different courts and from an arbitral tribunal. The reality is that the only order that was enforceable against Eurobank, i.e., the Kostis Decision, did not enjoin it from paying. There was no \u201cchoice\u201d to be made.\n[287] While the trial judge determined that the Kostis Decision, in refusing injunctive relief, had not expressly ordered Eurobank to pay, the fundamental nature of demand guarantees must be kept in mind. As I have explained, under a demand guarantee, a bank is obliged to pay on presentation of a written demand for payment that complies with the terms and conditions of the guarantee. It is an irrevocable and definite undertaking to pay. The terms of the Letter of Guarantee itself reflect this principle:\n. . . REGARDLESS OF ANY OBJECTION AND\/OR ANY KIND OF ARGUMENTS OF THE SUPPLIER, ANY LEGAL ACTION TAKEN BY THE SUPPLIER BEFORE ANY COURT OF LAW IN ANY COUNTRY AND WITHOUT YOU HAVING TO RESORT TO A COURT OF LAW OF ARBITRATION. [Emphasis added.]\n(A.R., vol. IV, at p. 112)\n[288] This language makes clear that Eurobank could not refuse payment without improperly exceeding its role as a guarantor and entering into the parties\u2019 arena. It could be prevented from paying under the Letter of Guarantee only if an injunction on a strong prima facie case of fraud was issued by a court of competent jurisdiction. Eurobank sought that injunction, temporarily succeeded, then permanently failed. Bombardier \u2014 not National Bank \u2014 took action, but it instituted proceedings before a court that had no jurisdiction to enjoin Eurobank, or HMOD for that matter, regarding the Letter of Guarantee.\n[289] The trial judge held that Eurobank should have chosen to comply with the Davis Injunction and the Interim Order instead of the Kostis Decision and the Extrajudicial Invitation\u2011Protest. In my view, it is simply not reasonable to have expected Eurobank, when faced with this so\u2011called \u201cchoice\u201d, to comply with orders that were not enforceable against it. The Davis Injunction was not enforceable in Greece, and it is doubtful that it, like the Pr\u00e9vost Injunction, should have been issued in the first place. As for the Interim Order, Eurobank was not part of the arbitration proceedings and could not be bound by it (Desputeaux v. \u00c9ditions Chouette (1987) inc., 2003 SCC 17, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 178, at para. 62). It is noteworthy that the Athens Court of Appeal and Hellenic Supreme Court concluded that Eurobank had no choice but to pay. Payment had to be made under the Letter of Guarantee given its autonomous nature and the fact that there was no operative injunction. The Kostis Decision had dismissed Eurobank\u2019s application for injunctive relief, and the Davis Injunction and the Interim Order were not binding in Greece (Hellenic Supreme Court decision, at p. 67, citing with approval the Athens Court of Appeal decision, reproduced in A.R., vol. III, at pp. 100\u2011102). I could not say it better than Hamilton J.A. did: \u201c. . . it is important that the injunction be sought from the right court and for the right reason\u201d (para. 210).\n[290] In my view, Eurobank\u2019s conduct was that of an innocent beneficiary under the Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee. Eurobank played the role that it undertook to play pursuant to the Letter of Guarantee. It did not participate in any fraud, nor did it have clear or obvious knowledge of HMOD\u2019s alleged fraud at the time of payment. Given that the requirements for the fraud exception were not met, the autonomy of demand guarantees \u2014 their governing principle and raison d\u2019\u00eatre \u2014 had to prevail.\n(3) The Apportionment of Risk Between the Parties\n[291] I cannot accept Bombardier\u2019s argument that it was for Eurobank to bear the risks of payment in this context. It is clear from the text of the Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee that Eurobank did not assume any risk by undertaking to pay under the Letter of Guarantee, except in very narrow circumstances. It is also clear that Eurobank complied with the strict conditions stated in the Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee:\nIN CONSIDERATION OF YOU ISSUING AT OUR REQUEST THE ABOVEMENTIONED GUARANTEE, WE, NATIONAL BANK OF CANADA HEREBY IRREVOCABLY UNDERTAKE TO REIMBURSE YOU ALL AMOUNT(S) CLAIMED BY THE BENEFICIARY OF YOUR GUARANTEE UP TO BUT NOT EXCEEDING USD 27,736,709.00 (TWENTY-SEVEN MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY-SIX THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED NINE. . .00\/100 UNITED STATES DOLLARS) PLUS COSTS, STAMP DUTIES AND VALUE ADDED TAX AS APPROPRIATE, WITH SAME VALUE RATE AS OF THE DATE OF YOUR PAYMENT, AFTER RECEIPT OF YOUR TESTED TELEX\/AUTHENTICATED SWIFT INDICATING THAT YOU HAVE RECEIVED FROM THE BENEFICIARY OF YOUR GUARANTEE A DEMAND FOR PAYMENT IN CONFORMITY WITH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF YOUR GUARANTEE. [Emphasis added.]\n(A.R., vol. IV, at p. 118)\n[292] Once Eurobank complied with HMOD\u2019s demand and paid under the Letter of Guarantee, National Bank was obliged to honour Eurobank\u2019s demand for payment under the Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee. The parties agreed to this causal chain of demands and payments, which was predicated on a \u201cpay now, argue later\u201d structure.\n[293] Eurobank was not a party to the Offsets Contract. It is not rational from a commercial perspective that Eurobank, as the institution simply securing the transaction, would be the one stuck with the risk arising from that transaction. As I have explained, this conclusion would upset the role of banks in this type of transaction. While Bombardier suggests before this Court that the decision to have a counter\u2011guarantee subject to Quebec law was designed to ensure that the fraud exception would be available, there is evidence to suggest that the Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee was instead required by Eurobank to mitigate any risk on its part. In addition, it is standard commercial practice for local banks securing transactions between local and foreign actors to seek security from a foreign bank instead of dealing directly with the foreign party (L\u2019Heureux and Lacoursi\u00e8re, at pp. 430\u201131; Mattout, at pp. 241\u201144; Kurkela, at p. 14; Bertrams, at pp. 118\u201119; Ellinger and Neo, at p. 335; Droit bancaire: Institutions, comptes, op\u00e9rations, services (8th ed. 2010), by J. Stoufflet, at No. 880). By ensuring that the Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee was secured by a bank that was local for Bombardier, Eurobank expected to be paid. It made sure that it would not have to deal with onerous proceedings in Quebec should any dispute regarding payment arise.\n[294] Since the requirements for the fraud exception are not met, this leaves only the Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee. As Eurobank argues, it complied with the only obligation that it had under the Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee \u2014 it indicated to National Bank that it had received a compliant demand for payment from HMOD. The conditions and formalities of the letter were respected; nothing in this context can prevent National Bank from honouring this demand. Respecting the autonomy of the Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee and considering it independently from the underlying dispute leads to the conclusion that National Bank is obligated to honour the demand for payment presented by Eurobank.\nD. Impact of the Declaration of Nullity of the Offsets Contract on the Letters of Guarantee and Counter\u2011Guarantee\n[295] As an alternative argument in support of its application, Bombardier asks this Court to enjoin National Bank from paying under the Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee because the Offsets Contract was \u201cdeclared null and void ab initio\u201d by the ICC Arbitral Tribunal (A.R., vol. VI, at p. 143). This position is premised on two arguments.\n[296] First, Bombardier argues that Eurobank cannot be paid under the Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee because it must be deemed to have never existed under art. 1422 C.C.Q. (R.F., at paras. 121 and 128). The trial judge upheld this argument at first instance as follows: \u201cIt is obvious that the Letter of Guarantee that was declared null and void ab initio by the ICC Arbitral Tribunal Final Award which has been homologated by this Court, the Counter\u2011Guarantee must follow suit and that [National Bank] should be ordered not to pay Eurobank\u201d (para. 240). With respect, he erred in stating this. The ICC Arbitral Tribunal declared only the relevant clauses of the Offsets Contract void ab initio, not the Letter of Guarantee. Moreover, such a statement by the trial judge runs contrary to the well\u2011established principle of autonomy. Where the contract underlying a demand guarantee is found to be null, the guarantee is not as a result invalid for being contrary to public order under art. 1411 C.C.Q. Under a demand guarantee, the bank agrees to pay on simple request, regardless of any underlying dispute. That obligation is \u201cseparate and distinct\u201d from the underlying contract (G. B. Graham and B. Geva, \u201cStandby Credits in Canada\u201d (1984) 9 Can. Bus. L.J. 180, at p. 189; L\u2019Heureux and Lacoursi\u00e8re, at pp. 428\u201129). The nullity of the Offsets Contract does not make the cause of National Bank\u2019s obligation to pay disappear under art. 1371 C.C.Q. The Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee therefore remains valid.\n[297] Second, Bombardier argues that the Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee should not be enforceable because the Offsets Contract was illegal (R.F., at paras. 126\u201127). In the present case, it is not necessary to discuss this argument at length since at the time Eurobank paid under the Letter of Guarantee and presented its demand under the Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee, the Arbitral Award had not been rendered. Furthermore, Eurobank was not a party to the arbitration proceedings and was not able to assess whether HMOD would win or lose. Imposing an unprecedented illegality exception would be to treat Eurobank \u201cunfairly\u201d after it \u201cperformed [its] part of the bargain\u201d (L. Sarna, Letters of Credit: The Law and Current Practice (3rd ed. (loose\u2011leaf)), at p. 5\u201116.1). Eurobank should not be on the hook for the nullity of the Offsets Contract. Securing the transaction was supposed to be risk\u2011free for Eurobank. Its aversion to risk was the very reason for the issuance of the Letter of Counter\u2011Guarantee. Ultimately, \u201c[t]he risk was Bombardier\u2019s and it must assume it\u201d (C.A. reasons, at para. 230).\n[298] In any event, the enforceability of the Arbitral Award against HMOD remains unsettled. Indeed, the Arbitral Award has not yet been homologated in Greece, so one cannot speculate as to the final result.\nVII. Conclusion\n[299] I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgments rendered on appeal and in first instance, and dismiss the action instituted by Bombardier against Eurobank and National Bank, the whole with costs to Eurobank throughout.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, Karakatsanis and C\u00f4t\u00e9 JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant Eurobank Ergasias S.A.: Renno Vathilakis inc., Montr\u00e9al.\nSolicitors for the appellant the General Directorate for Defense Armaments and Investments of the Hellenic Ministry of National Defense: Angelopoulos Attorneys, Laval.\nSolicitors for the respondent Bombardier inc.: Norton Rose Fulbright Canada, Montr\u00e9al; Bombardier inc., Dorval.\nSolicitors for the respondent the National Bank of Canada: Woods, Montr\u00e9al.\nSolicitors for the intervener: Gowling WLG (Canada), Montr\u00e9al.\n[1] ANZ Grindlays Bank Limited was replaced by New TT Hellenic Postbank S.A. and finally by Eurobank Ergasias S.A. It is important to note that although Eurobank has replaced ANZ Grindlays and Postbank, it is not Eurobank\u2019s conduct that is discussed in this judgment, but that of its predecessor. Eurobank was not involved when the payment to HMOD under the Letter of Guarantee was made in December 2013.\n",

They were divided into four different groups for separate trials. The accused in group 1, who were to be tried first, filed a motion for a stay of proceedings under s. 24(1) of the Charter on the basis that the police investigation and operation that led to the court proceedings against them were vitiated by an abuse of process. Specifically, they alleged that an accumulation of infringements of their constitutional rights under ss. 8 and 10(b) of the Charter met the threshold for establishing an abuse of process in the residual category for all of them, even though several of them were not the victims of any of these infringements. The accused in groups 2, 3 and 4 filed motions similar to the one filed by group 1.\nThe first instance judge entered a stay of proceedings for all of the accused in group 1. He held that the police practice of postponing the exercise by the accused of the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay until they were taken to the police station infringed the right of all of the accused in that group under s. 10(b) of the Charter . Relying on the cumulative effect of these infringements, which he considered to be the most serious ones, and other infringements and violations of the prescribed procedures, the judge held that there had been an abuse of process in the residual category. Groups 2, 3 and 4 and the Crown agreed that the decision rendered with respect to group 1 was applicable to those groups, and a stay of proceedings was also entered for them. The Court of Appeal allowed the Crown\u2019s appeals, set aside the two judgments and ordered that a new trial be held, including a new hearing on the motion, on the ground that some of the accused did not have standing to obtain a stay of proceedings and that the first instance judge had failed to determine whether each accused\u2019s s. 10(b) right had been infringed before finding an abuse of process under s. 7. The accused appeal to the Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Wagner C.J. and Karakatsanis, Martin, Kasirer, Jamal and O\u2019Bonsawin JJ.: It is appropriate to hold a new trial for group 1 and for groups 2, 3 and 4, including new hearings on the motions for a stay of proceedings. All of the accused had standing to apply for a stay of proceedings under s. 24(1) of the Charter even though some of them were not the victims of any of the infringements constituting the alleged abuse of process or of any breach of trial fairness. However, the first instance judge erred in failing to determine whether each accused\u2019s right under s. 10(b) of the Charter had been infringed, a determination that had to be made in order to decide whether the allegation of abuse of process in the residual category was well founded. The first instance judge also erred in entering a stay of proceedings for all of the accused without first considering whether there were less drastic remedies that could have fully redressed the prejudice to the integrity of the justice system that he thought he had identified.\nTwo types of state conduct meet the threshold for establishing abuse of process: conduct that compromises trial fairness (\u201cmain category\u201d) and conduct that, without necessarily threatening the fairness of the accused\u2019s trial, nevertheless undermines the integrity of the justice system (\u201cresidual category\u201d). Abuse of process in the main category engages the Charter provisions aimed at protecting trial fairness for accused persons, namely ss. 8 to 14 of the Charter , as well as the principles of fundamental justice set out in s. 7. Abuse of process in the residual category, on the other hand, engages only the principles of fundamental justice in s. 7 of the Charter , which protect accused persons from any state conduct that is unfair or vexatious to such a degree that it contravenes fundamental notions of justice and thus undermines the integrity of the justice system, regardless of the impact of the conduct on the accused\u2019s other constitutional rights or on the fairness of their trial. When abuse of process is found in either category and a Charter guarantee has been infringed, s. 24(1) of the Charter gives a court of competent jurisdiction the power to grant such remedy as it considers appropriate and just in the circumstances. A stay of proceedings will be ordered only where the situation meets the high threshold of being one of the clearest of cases. This requires three conditions to be met: (1) there must be prejudice to the accused\u2019s right to a fair trial or to the integrity of the justice system that will be manifested, perpetuated or aggravated through the conduct of the trial or by its outcome; (2) there must be no alternative remedy capable of redressing the prejudice; (3) where there is still uncertainty over whether a stay of proceedings is warranted after steps 1 and 2, the court is required to balance the interests in favour of granting a stay against the interest that society has in having a final decision on the merits.\nAn accused has standing to apply for a remedy under s. 24(1), including a stay of proceedings, where the accused\u2019s allegations set out the essential elements that will have to be shown in order to establish that one of their Charter rights has been infringed. The existence of directly personal prejudice is not one of the essential elements that must be shown to establish an infringement of the s. 7 right on the basis of an abuse of process in the residual category. Impairment of the accused\u2019s other rights or of the fairness of their trial, although relevant, is not determinative, because the type of prejudice addressed by the principles of fundamental justice in s. 7 goes well beyond personal prejudice; all that must be found is that there is state conduct with repercussions on a larger scale, that is, conduct that causes prejudice to the integrity of the justice system in the eyes of society.\nHowever, for a court to find that an accused\u2019s s. 7 right has been infringed as a result of an abuse of process in the residual category, there must be a sufficient causal connection between the abusive conduct and the proceedings against the accused. This connection will be considered sufficient where the criminal proceedings against the accused are tainted by the abusive conduct, which will be the case where abusive conduct occurred in the course of the investigation or police operation targeting the accused or the criminal proceedings against them. This requirement is consistent with the purpose of the doctrine of abuse of process in the residual category, which is to enable courts to protect the integrity of the justice system by dissociating themselves from state conduct that constitutes an abuse of the judicial process. It is also consistent with the applicable framework for granting a stay of proceedings under s. 24(1), whose three cumulative conditions allow for the screening of applications for stays of proceedings to ensure that this remedy is available only in the clearest of cases, which excludes cases in which the proceedings against the accused are not already tainted by abusive conduct.\nWhen an infringement of s. 7 of the Charter is alleged together with an infringement of one or more procedural guarantees, the order of priority that a court should follow will depend on the factual record, on the nature of the Charter rights at play and on how they intersect. In the abuse of process context, both s. 7 and the specific procedural guarantees in ss. 8 to 14 of the Charter are intended to protect individuals from conduct that is vexatious to such a degree that it contravenes fundamental notions of justice and thus undermines the integrity of the justice system. Section 7 plays a role complementary to that of ss. 8 to 14 by providing residual protection against abuse of process that goes beyond the protection offered by the specific guarantees in ss. 8 to 14 . It is therefore not uncommon for s. 7 of the Charter to be invoked at the same time as one or more other procedural guarantees. Indeed, abusive state conduct may take all sorts of forms, and abuse of process in the residual category can be based on an accumulation of incidents or state misconduct. Furthermore, there is no reason why such incidents or misconduct cannot take the form of infringements of a procedural Charter guarantee and, consequently, why the alleged abuse of process cannot result from an accumulation of infringements of one or more guarantees. It follows that the frameworks for analyzing s. 7 and ss. 8 to 14 can coexist, and it is entirely appropriate to use the framework developed for the purposes of s. 7 to analyze any accumulation of infringements of one or more procedural guarantees in order to determine whether the infringements as a whole meet the threshold for establishing abuse of process, that is, prejudice to the integrity of the justice system. Of course, the framework applicable to each of these guarantees will remain relevant in determining whether the infringements making up the accumulation of infringements actually occurred. In fact, this determination will logically have to be made before the court decides whether there has been an abuse of process in the residual category.\nIn this case, each of the accused has standing to apply for a remedy under s. 24(1) of the Charter , since all of them assert that they were directly targeted by the police investigation and operation that resulted in the alleged abusive conduct. The abuse of process alleged by the accused results from an accumulation of infringements of rights guaranteed by ss. 8 and 10(b) of the Charter that reflects a situation of blatant disregard for their rights by the police. In these circumstances, the framework developed for the purposes of s. 7 of the Charter for analyzing abuse of process in the residual category should be adopted to determine whether the alleged infringements as a whole meet the threshold for establishing abuse of process. However, this exercise makes it necessary to apply the framework for each of the provisions at issue, ss. 8 and 10(b), to determine whether the allegations of infringements are well founded. Once each of the alleged infringements has been examined, it will then be possible to determine whether all of the infringements, considered together, amount to conduct that is vexatious to such a degree that it contravenes fundamental notions of justice and thus undermines the integrity of the justice system.\nThe first instance judge in this case erred in law in finding that the allegations that the s. 10(b) right to retain and instruct counsel without delay had been infringed were well founded with respect to all of the accused in group 1 solely on the basis of the police practice of systematically postponing the exercise of this right without first considering the particular circumstances of each arrest. The first instance judge had to correctly apply the s. 10(b) framework in relation to each of the accused and draw the necessary conclusions, which he did not do. This error on its own justifies holding a new hearing on the motion for a stay of proceedings for group 1, because the first instance judge\u2019s conclusion that the right of the accused to retain and instruct counsel without delay had been infringed was an essential underpinning of his ultimate conclusion that the s. 7 right of the accused in group 1 had been infringed as a result of an abuse of process in the residual category. Since the fate of the accused in groups 2, 3 and 4 depends on the fate of those in group 1, new hearings must also be held on the motion for a stay of proceedings for groups 2, 3 and 4.\nLastly, the first instance judge erred in entering a stay of proceedings for all of the accused without considering less drastic remedies for each of them. The three conditions that must be met for a stay of proceedings to be granted are cumulative, and none of them is optional. The judge failed to ensure that the second condition was met in this case.\nPer Rowe J.: There is agreement with the majority as to the result and in large measure as to its statement of the law and its application of the law in the instant case. However, greater clarity is warranted with respect to the methodology to be used when an accused seeks a stay of proceedings under s. 24(1) of the Charter for alleged infringements of their rights protected under ss. 8 to 14 and also seeks a stay under s. 24(1) for abuse of process under s. 7. Courts should apply a consistent approach to the analysis where s. 7 and ss. 8 to 14 of the Charter are relied on by an accused in order to obtain a stay of proceedings. The appropriate order of operations is as follows: where a right under ss. 8 to 14 is relied on, along with s. 7, reviewing courts should address the specific right first, including (if necessary) under s. 1 ; and if there is no infringement of the specific right, or if the infringement is justified under s. 1 , only then should reviewing courts have regard to s. 7, and, if necessary, s. 1 once again.\nCases Cited\nBy O\u2019Bonsawin J.\nConsidered: R. v.

Overview\n[1] The courts have a duty to protect the integrity of the justice system by dissociating themselves from state conduct that constitutes an abuse of the judicial process. This type of abusive conduct may take all sorts of forms. In this case, the alleged abuse of process is unusual in that it results from an accumulation of infringements of the rights guaranteed by ss. 8 and 10(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , infringements of which several but not all of the 31 appellants were the victims. These infringements allegedly occurred in the course of a large\u2011scale police investigation and operation known as [translation] \u201cProject Nandou\u201d that led to the arrest of the 31 appellants.\n[2] The unusual nature of the alleged abuse of process raises two main questions. The first relates to the standing of the appellants who, for one reason or another, were not the victims of any of the infringements constituting the abuse or of any breach of trial fairness. In the absence of any personal prejudice, it must be asked whether these appellants were entitled to apply for a remedy under s. 24(1) of the Charter .\n[3] The Superior Court answered this question in the affirmative and, after finding that there had been an abuse of process in the residual category under s. 7 of the Charter , entered a stay of proceedings for all of the appellants under s. 24(1). On appeal, the Quebec Court of Appeal ordered a new trial for all of the appellants on the ground that the Superior Court had failed to ascertain whether each of them had standing to obtain a stay of proceedings. The Court of Appeal was of the view that if the Superior Court had done so, it would have concluded that some appellants did not have standing to obtain a remedy under s. 24(1).\n[4] The Court of Appeal was also of the view that ascertaining the appellants\u2019 standing required the Superior Court to determine whether each appellant\u2019s right under s. 10(b) of the Charter had been infringed, which it had not done. Moreover, standing had to be ascertained before the Superior Court considered whether there had been an abuse of process in the residual category under s. 7. This layering of analytical frameworks raises the second main question in this appeal: What approach should a court take in determining whether there has been an abuse of process in the residual category that, while falling under s. 7 of the Charter , nonetheless results from an accumulation of infringements of other Charter rights? Indeed, what needs to be considered is how to reconcile the relevant frameworks, that is, the s. 7 framework and the frameworks for ss. 8 and 10(b) of the Charter .\n[5] For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal, partly for the reasons given by the Court of Appeal. Unlike that court, I am of the view that all of the appellants have standing to apply for a remedy under s. 24(1) of the Charter even though some of them were not the victims of any of the infringements constituting the alleged abuse of process or of any breach of trial fairness. However, I agree with the Court of Appeal that the Superior Court had to determine whether each appellant\u2019s right under s. 10(b) of the Charter had been infringed and that it failed to do so, thereby committing a reviewable error. In light of the appellants\u2019 arguments, that determination had to be made in order to decide whether the infringements as a whole met the threshold for abuse of process in the residual category. This is therefore a situation in which the frameworks for ss. 8 and 10(b) of the Charter are complementary to the s. 7 framework. Finally, I am of the view that the Superior Court also erred in entering a stay of proceedings for all of the appellants without first considering less drastic remedies that could have fully redressed the prejudice to the integrity of the justice system that it thought it had identified. These errors justify holding new trials, including new hearings on the appellants\u2019 motion for a stay of proceedings and for the exclusion of evidence.\nII. Factual Background\n[6] The police operation at the centre of this appeal arose out of an investigation known as \u201cProject Nandou\u201d that began in November 2014 in the districts of Trois\u2011Rivi\u00e8res, Qu\u00e9bec and Chicoutimi. The investigation concerned allegations of organized trafficking in narcotics, mainly cannabis.\n[7] At the end of the investigation, on March 29, 2016, a first information was laid against the majority of the appellants. It charged them with having committed various indictable offences related to production of and trafficking in narcotics. Some of the appellants were also charged with criminal organization offences. After the information was laid, a number of arrest and search warrants were issued.\n[8] A large\u2011scale police operation was planned. More than 250 police officers were to take part in it. A preparatory meeting, led by Detective Toussaint, was organized to arrange how the operation would unfold. During that meeting, the detective reiterated the importance of respecting the right of those arrested to retain and instruct counsel without delay as guaranteed by s. 10(b) of the Charter . However, he gave no indication of when the exercise of that right should be facilitated. He said he had assumed that the arresting officers knew the rules and would know when to do so.\n[9] The operation got under way the morning of March 31, 2016, shortly before 7:00 a.m. The 31 appellants were almost all arrested at their residences in the first few minutes of the operation. The others were arrested at various locations later the same day or during the days that followed.\n[10] All of the appellants acknowledge that they were informed of their right to retain and instruct counsel without delay at the time they were arrested. However, the evidence shows that they did not all respond in the same way: many indicated a desire to exercise their right as soon as they were informed of it, some did not ask to exercise their right until they were at the police station, and the others said that they did not wish to retain and instruct counsel or that they had already done so.\n[11] In the end, out of the appellants who were arrested the morning of March 31, 2016, and who indicated a desire to immediately exercise their right to retain and instruct counsel without delay, only one was given an opportunity to do so while in the police vehicle. The others had to wait until they arrived at the police station. The time between being arrested and being given an opportunity to contact counsel ranged from 23 minutes to 1 hour and 6 minutes, depending on the case. No one was questioned during that time. It should also be noted that one of the appellants arrested later in the day or during the days that followed surrendered himself to the authorities at the courthouse while accompanied by his lawyer and that another of them was arrested at the airport, where he retained and instructed counsel.\n[12] In the course of the Project Nandou investigation, the police obtained a number of warrants under the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C\u201146 , and the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act , S.C. 1996, c. 19 . Most of the warrants were authorized in the district of Trois\u2011Rivi\u00e8res, but some were executed in another judicial district without being endorsed in that district.\n[13] Forty\u2011four of the warrants obtained were general warrants authorized under s. 487.01 of the Criminal Code , and 40 of them required the police to give notice of a covert search to the persons concerned before the date specified in the warrant. Twenty of those warrants were executed, but no notice was given for any of them by the specified date.\n[14] Following a preliminary inquiry, the 31 appellants were ordered to stand trial and later divided into 4 different groups for separate trials. On March 16, 2018, the seven appellants in group 1, who were to be tried first, filed a motion for a stay of proceedings and for the exclusion of evidence with the Superior Court. The motion contained several allegations relating to the police investigation and operation that had led to them being arrested and charged, three of which remain relevant in this appeal:\n(i) failure to facilitate the requested access to counsel at the first reasonably available opportunity during the police operation on March 31, 2016, which allegedly resulted in the infringement of the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay guaranteed by s. 10(b) of the Charter ;\n(ii) failure to give notice of a covert search within the allotted time, which allegedly resulted in the infringement of the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure guaranteed by s. 8 of the Charter ;\n(iii) execution of search warrants outside the judicial district of the authorizing justices without the warrants being endorsed within the meaning of the former s. 487(2) of the Criminal Code , which also allegedly resulted in the infringement of the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure guaranteed by s. 8 of the Charter .\n[15] During the hearing on their motion, the appellants in group 1 alleged that the accumulation of these infringements, some of them planned and intended by the police, reflected a situation of blatant disregard for their rights, met the threshold for establishing abuse of process and left the court with no choice but to stay the proceedings against each of them. That being said, the appellants did not focus on the breaches of trial fairness which would have resulted from the infringements, and they acknowledged that some of the infringements affected only part of the group and could not justify a stay of proceedings on their own.\nIII. Judicial History\nA. Quebec Superior Court, 2018 QCCS 6155 (Dumas J.)\n[16] On August 27, 2018, the Superior Court judge granted the motion brought by the appellants in group 1 and stayed the proceedings against them. Dealing with the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay, the Superior Court judge found from the evidence that when an appellant indicated a desire to contact counsel, [translation] \u201cthe systematic reply was that this would be done later\u201d at the police station (para. 75 (CanLII)), even though there was no evidence that the police had examined the situation before postponing the exercise of the right to counsel. In the judge\u2019s view, that practice infringed the right of all of the appellants in group 1 to retain and instruct counsel without delay because it [translation] \u201camounts to a reverse onus\u201d (para. 84; see also para. 196): the police officers should have assessed whether the immediate exercise of the appellants\u2019 right to counsel was feasible as soon as the appellants asked to exercise it, and not only when they insisted on exercising it at the scene.\n[17] He added that while police officers do not have to allow a person under arrest to use a seized telephone and are not required to provide their own cell phones, there is no reason why they cannot be equipped with inexpensive cell phones to lend to such persons.\n[18] The Superior Court judge then considered the failure by the police to give notice of a covert search within the allotted time. He rejected the Crown\u2019s argument that the disclosure of evidence could substitute for the notice of a covert search required in the warrants, finding rather that this position amounted to saying that [translation] \u201cdespite a specific order by a justice, no notice of a covert search will be given if the search does not yield concrete results and the person is not charged\u201d (para. 131). In his view, this position arose from [translation] \u201cinstitutional laxity\u201d (para. 131).\n[19] With regard to the warrants authorized in the judicial district of Trois\u2011Rivi\u00e8res and executed in other districts, the Superior Court judge held that they should have been endorsed in those other judicial districts before being executed. If this had been the only infringement shown, he would have found that it was an error made in good faith, but in the circumstances it had to be added to the other breaches already identified.\n[20] Relying on the cumulative effect of these infringements and violations of the prescribed procedures, the most serious of which were the infringements relating to the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay, the Superior Court judge held that there had been an abuse of process in the residual category. He found that the case involved a [translation] \u201csystemic and persistent problem\u201d and infringements that could bring the administration of justice into disrepute (paras. 216 and 219), which were so extreme that they justified entering a stay of proceedings for the seven appellants in group 1. In his opinion, continuing the proceedings would perpetuate the prejudice to the integrity of the justice system caused by the abuse and would encourage the police to carry on acting as they had in this case.\nB. Quebec Superior Court, 2019 QCCS 6006 (Dumas J.)\n[21] On September 5 and 6, 2018, the other three groups of appellants (groups 2, 3 and 4) filed motions similar to the one filed by group 1. After conferring with one another, the appellants in groups 2, 3 and 4 and the Crown consented to the evidence and arguments on group 1\u2019s motion being entered for the hearing on the motions brought by groups 2, 3 and 4. Without waiving their right to appeal, those parties also agreed that the decision regarding group 1 was applicable to groups 2, 3 and 4.\n[22] For the reasons given in the judgment rendered with respect to group 1 on August 27, 2018, and in light of the admissions made by the parties at the hearing, the Superior Court judge stayed the proceedings against the appellants in groups 2, 3 and 4 on May 7, 2019.\nC. Quebec Court of Appeal, 2021 QCCA 1317, 75 C.R. (7th) 74 (Thibault, Hogue and Beaupr\u00e9 JJ.A.)\n[23] On September 3, 2021, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeals, set aside the two judgments rendered by the Superior Court and ordered that a new trial be held, including a new hearing on the motion for a stay of proceedings and for the exclusion of evidence, before a different judge. In its analysis, the Court of Appeal began by noting that because the rules on standing (it used the French term \u201cqualit\u00e9 pour agir\u201d) (para. 55) provide that a remedy can be granted only to a person whose own constitutional rights have been infringed, it was therefore necessary to assess the situation of each appellant on a case\u2011by\u2011case basis. The Court of Appeal found that the Superior Court judge had erred in adopting an approach that led him to enter a stay of proceedings for all of the appellants without first assessing whether the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay guaranteed to each of them by s. 10(b) of the Charter had been infringed. It also noted that some of the appellants had said that they did not wish to speak to counsel after being informed of their right, while others had had an opportunity to do so immediately after being arrested.\n[24] The Court of Appeal also identified several errors of law in the analysis of the \u201cimplementational\u201d component of the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay and held that the Superior Court judge had erred by imposing a more onerous duty on the police than the law imposed on them.\n[25] Finally, turning to the remedy granted, the Court of Appeal held that the Superior Court judge had erred in failing to consider less drastic remedies that could have sufficed to redress the abuse of process he had found in this case.\nIV. Issues\n[26] The resolution of the appeal requires an answer to the following four questions:\nA. Did the appellants all have standing to apply for a remedy under s. 24(1) of the Charter ?\nB. Did the Superior Court judge err in finding that there had been an abuse of process in the residual category?\nC. Did the Superior Court judge err in entering a stay of proceedings for all of the appellants?\nD. Could the Crown raise, before the Court of Appeal, the Superior Court judge\u2019s failure to consider the particular circumstances of the arrest of each appellant in groups 2, 3 and 4 after consenting to judgment?\nIn my view, the four questions must be answered in the affirmative.\nV. Analysis\n[27] The law on abuse of process is well settled. The \u201ckey point\u201d is that abuse of process \u201crefers to Crown conduct that is egregious and seriously compromises trial fairness and\/or the integrity of the justice system\u201d (R. v. Anderson, 2014 SCC 41, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 167, at para. 50). As the preceding passage suggests, two types of state conduct meet the threshold for establishing abuse of process: conduct that compromises trial fairness (\u201cmain category\u201d) and conduct that, without necessarily threatening the fairness of the accused\u2019s trial, nevertheless undermines the integrity of the justice system (\u201cresidual category\u201d) (Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Tobiass, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 391, at para. 89; R. v. Regan, 2002 SCC 12, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 297, at para. 55; R. v. Nixon, 2011 SCC 34, [2011] 2 S.C.R. 566, at para. 36; R. v. Babos, 2014 SCC 16, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 309, at para. 31; see also Brind\u2019Amour v. R., 2014 QCCA 33, at para. 53).\n[28] While there is no actual \u201cright against abuse of process\u201d in the Charter , different guarantees will be engaged depending on the circumstances (R. v. O\u2019Connor, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 411, at para. 73). Abuse of process in the main category engages the Charter provisions aimed primarily at protecting trial fairness for accused persons, namely ss. 8 to 14, as well as the principles of fundamental justice set out in s. 7. Abuse of process in the residual category, on the other hand, engages only the principles of fundamental justice in s. 7, which protect accused persons from any state conduct that, while not caught by ss. 8 to 14, is nevertheless unfair or vexatious to such a degree that it contravenes fundamental notions of justice and thus undermines the integrity of the justice system (O\u2019Connor, at para. 73; Tobiass, at para. 89; Regan, at para. 50; Nixon, at para. 41; Babos, at para. 31).\n[29] When abuse of process is found in either category and a Charter guarantee has been infringed, s. 24(1) of the Charter gives a court of competent jurisdiction the power to grant \u201csuch remedy as [it] considers appropriate and just in the circumstances\u201d. A wide range of remedies is available to the court (see, e.g., O\u2019Connor, at para. 77). However, a stay of proceedings is by far the remedy most sought by victims of abuse of process. Since it has been characterized as the \u201cultimate remedy\u201d (Tobiass, at para. 86), a stay of proceedings will be ordered only where the situation meets the high threshold of being one of the \u201cclearest of cases\u201d (O\u2019Connor, at para. 69). This requires three conditions to be met:\n(1) there must be prejudice to the accused\u2019s right to a fair trial or to the integrity of the justice system that \u201cwill be manifested, perpetuated or aggravated through the conduct of the trial, or by its outcome\u201d (Regan, at para. 54; Babos, at para. 32);\n(2) there must be no alternative remedy capable of redressing the prejudice (Regan, at para. 54; Babos, at para. 32);\n(3) where there is still uncertainty over whether a stay of proceedings is warranted after steps 1 and 2, the court is required to balance the interests in favour of granting a stay, such as denouncing misconduct and preserving the integrity of the justice system, against \u201cthe interest that society has in having a final decision on the merits\u201d (Regan, at para. 57; Babos, at para. 32).\n[30] This legal framework has been refined by this Court over a period of several decades and has been applied in a variety of circumstances. Even so, this is the first time an appeal to the Court has raised the question of how the law on abuse of process in the residual category applies to a group of accused persons, all of whom apply for a stay of proceedings on the ground that an accumulation of infringements of Charter rights, of which several but not all of them were the victims, causes prejudice to the integrity of the justice system.\n[31] Indeed, all of the appellants applied for a stay of proceedings under s. 24(1) of the Charter on the basis that the police investigation and operation that led to the court proceedings against them were vitiated by an abuse of process in the residual category. Specifically, they alleged that an accumulation of infringements of their constitutional rights under ss. 8 and 10(b) of the Charter met the threshold for establishing an abuse of process in the residual category for all of them, even though several of them were not the victims of any of these infringements or of any breach of trial fairness. This type of allegation raises two main questions.\n[32] The first question, focused on by the Crown and the Court of Appeal, relates to the standing of the appellants whose rights under ss. 8 and 10(b) of the Charter were not infringed and who were not the victims of any breach of trial fairness. In the absence of any personal prejudice, it must be asked whether these persons have standing to apply for a remedy under s. 24(1) of the Charter .\n[33] The second question relates to the analytical framework that the Superior Court judge had to apply in determining whether there had been an abuse of process in the residual category that, while falling under s. 7 of the Charter , nonetheless resulted from an accumulation of infringements of ss. 8 and 10(b). When several provisions of the Charter are invoked together, what needs to be considered is how to reconcile the relevant frameworks, that is, the s. 7 framework and the frameworks for ss. 8 and 10(b) of the Charter . After this question has been answered, it will then have to be determined whether the Superior Court judge correctly applied the proper framework before finding that there had been an abuse of process in the residual category.\n[34] In addition to these two main questions, the Crown argues that the Superior Court judge erred in entering a stay of proceedings for all of the appellants without considering less drastic remedies for each of them, and the appellants argue that the Crown was precluded from raising, on appeal, the Superior Court judge\u2019s failure to consider the particular circumstances of the arrest of each appellant in groups 2, 3 and 4 after agreeing that the decision rendered with respect to group 1 was applicable to them.\n[35] The following sections address these four questions, beginning with standing.\nA. Did the Appellants All Have Standing to Apply for a Remedy Under Section 24(1) of the Charter ?\n[36] The appellants submit that they all have standing to apply for a remedy under s. 24(1) of the Charter because an accused does not need to have suffered a [translation] \u201cdirectly personal\u201d infringement of a constitutional right in order for their right under s. 7 of the Charter to be infringed as a result of an abuse of process in the residual category (A.F., at para. 27). According to them, this category concerns [translation] \u201cthe prejudice caused to the integrity of the justice system and address[es] the situation in which an accused, without being directly targeted by the abusive conduct or affected by the prejudice resulting from it, is nonetheless the subject of a prosecution involving such conduct\u201d (para. 53). In other words, an accused can in some cases [translation] \u201cmake an abuse of process claim without having to show that the conduct in question directly affects them\u201d (para. 56). For the purposes of standing, s. 24(1) of the Charter requires only [translation] \u201cthat a person be charged, or that their right to life, liberty and security of the person otherwise be jeopardized, in a context where oppressive or vexatious state conduct related to the investigation or court proceedings concerning the person impinges on the integrity of the justice system to such a degree that s. 7 of the Charter is infringed\u201d (para. 72).\n[37] The Crown, for its part, argues that in order to have standing to apply for a remedy under s. 24(1), an accused must allege a personal infringement of one of their Charter rights. An accused who applies for a stay of proceedings on the basis of an abuse of process in the residual category must allege an infringement of their s. 7 right. To be able to do so, the accused does not need to have been personally targeted by the abusive state conduct but must be able to show that the conduct in question had a [translation] \u201csufficient impact\u201d on them (R.F., at para. 72). According to the Crown, the Court of Appeal was therefore correct in stating that the Superior Court judge had erred in failing to look at the situation of each appellant individually, especially with regard to the \u201cimplementational\u201d component of the right to counsel. That was the only way to determine whether the abusive conduct had had a sufficient impact on each of them for the purposes of s. 7.\n[38] For the reasons that follow, I conclude that all of the appellants had standing to apply for a stay of proceedings under s. 24(1). An accused has standing to apply for a remedy under s. 24(1) where they allege that one of their Charter rights has been infringed. The s. 7 right is one of these rights. It protects accused persons from abuse of process in the residual category. This type of abuse of process occurs where state conduct is unfair or vexatious to such a degree that it contravenes fundamental notions of justice and thus undermines the integrity of the justice system, regardless of its impact on the accused\u2019s other constitutional rights or on the fairness of their trial.\n[39] However, this does not mean that every accused will have standing to apply for a remedy under s. 24(1) of the Charter on the basis of any abusive state conduct, no matter what the causal connection between that conduct and the proceedings against them. To have standing, the accused must allege that the abusive conduct tainted the police investigation or operation targeting them or the court proceedings against them. In this case, each of the appellants meets this requirement, since all of them assert that they were directly targeted by the police investigation and operation that resulted in the alleged abusive conduct.\n[40] Each of these elements is explained further in the paragraphs that follow. Before discussing them, however, I believe it is important to clear up some terminological confusion.\n(1) Confusion Between \u201cInt\u00e9r\u00eat Pour Agir\u201d and \u201cQualit\u00e9 Pour Agir\u201d\n[41] In their respective factums, the Crown and the appellants use the French legal terms \u201cint\u00e9r\u00eat pour agir\u201d and \u201cqualit\u00e9 pour agir\u201d interchangeably (R.F., at paras. 16\u201117 and 53\u201154; A.F., at paras. 67\u201168). The Court of Appeal seems to have done the same (paras. 45 and 55). It is true that this Court has sometimes used these two terms, or their derivatives, in the same judgment to refer to the same idea, that is, to what in English is called \u201cstanding\u201d or \u201clocus standi\u201d (see, e.g., Finlay v. Canada (Minister of Finance), [1986] 2 S.C.R. 607, at pp. 615\u201118; Canadian Council of Churches v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1992] 1 S.C.R. 236, at p. 243; Brunette v. Legault Joly Thiffault, s.e.n.c.r.l., 2018 SCC 55, [2018] 3 S.C.R. 481, at paras. 10\u201111).\n[42] In this case, it is the appellants\u2019 \u201cint\u00e9r\u00eat pour agir\u201d (standing) that is being challenged by the Crown, not the \u201cqualit\u00e9\u201d (capacity) in which they are acting, because each of them is acting in their own name and not in a particular \u201ccapacity\u201d for one or more other persons (see, e.g., Brunette, at para. 2). Indeed, the Crown is disputing the appellants\u2019 right to \u201cseek particular relief\u201d from a court, namely a stay of proceedings under s. 24(1) of the Charter , and to obtain a judgment on the merits of their application seeking this relief (Finlay, at p. 635; T. A. Cromwell, Locus Standi: A Commentary on the Law of Standing in Canada (1986), at pp. 7 and 9). This right is generally reserved to those who have a \u201csufficient interest\u201d in obtaining the relief sought (Brunette, at para. 12). As will be explained more fully below, the \u201cinterest\u201d or standing of an accused is considered sufficient for the purposes of an application under s. 24(1) where the accused is alleging an infringement of any of their Charter rights.\n(2) Standing Under Section 24(1) of the Charter Is Accorded to Accused Persons Alleging That Their Own Rights Have Been Infringed\n[43] The starting point in determining whether a person has standing to apply for a remedy under s. 24(1) of the Charter is the text of this provision, which reads as follows:\n24 (1) Anyone whose rights or freedoms, as guaranteed by this Charter , have been infringed or denied may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to obtain such remedy as the court considers appropriate and just in the circumstances.\n[44] The Court has interpreted this text and has found it to mean that a person has standing to apply for a remedy under s. 24(1) where the person is \u201calleging a violation of their own constitutional rights\u201d (R. v. Albashir, 2021 SCC 48, at para. 33; R. v. Ferguson, 2008 SCC 6, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 96, at para. 61; see also R. v. Edwards, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 128, at para. 55; R. v. Rahey, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 588, at p. 619; R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., [1985] 1 S.C.R. 295, at p. 313). In other words, a person\u2019s standing will be considered sufficient only if they are alleging an infringement of any of their Charter rights.\n[45] Some decisions have suggested, on the basis of a literal interpretation of the text of s. 24, that an accused has standing to apply for a remedy under this provision and to obtain a judgment on the merits of the application only if the accused establishes that one of their Charter rights has been infringed (see, e.g., Edwards, at para. 45(1.) and (3.)). That interpretation conflates standing to bring proceedings with the merits of a claim (Cromwell, at p. 2; F. Bachand, \u201cLe droit d\u2019agir en justice\u201d (2020), 66 McGill L.J. 109, at pp. 110\u201111; K. Roach, Constitutional Remedies in Canada (2nd ed. (loose\u2011leaf)), at \u00a7 5:10). In Finlay, this Court stated that it is essential to distinguish between standing, or the right to seek particular relief, and the entitlement to such relief (p. 635). This distinction was eloquently clarified by Scheibel J. in R.L. Crain Inc. v. Couture (1983), 6 D.L.R. (4th) 478 (Sask. Q.B.):\n. . . the establishment of a violation of rights is prerequisite to the obtaining of a remedy. It is not a prerequisite to the commencing of a s. 24(1) application. There should be no doubt that in order to bring a s. 24(1) application it is necessary only that the applicant allege that his rights have been infringed or denied. [Emphasis added; p. 517.]\n[46] Indeed, the focus when it comes to standing is on the allegations made by the person seeking a remedy under s. 24(1) of the Charter . These allegations must set out the essential elements that will have to be shown in order to establish an infringement of at least one of the applicant\u2019s Charter rights. If they do so, the applicant will have standing to apply for a remedy under s. 24(1).\n[47] The Court of Appeal found that standing could be accorded only to the appellants who were alleging an infringement of their own right to retain and instruct counsel without delay or, although the court did not expressly refer to it, their own right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure (paras. 55 and 59). In other words, it held that the appellants who did not allege that at least one of their rights under s. 8 or 10(b) of the Charter had been infringed did not have standing to apply for a stay of proceedings under s. 24(1) (paras. 58\u201159). With respect, I cannot agree with that position, because it disregards the allegation of abuse of process in the residual category.\n[48] All of the appellants alleged an infringement of their right under s. 7 of the Charter on the basis of an abuse of process in the residual category (A.R., vol. XI, at pp. 101\u20112). It is true that they argued that the abuse resulted from an accumulation of infringements of the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure and the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay (A.R., vol. I, at pp. 150, 154\u201155 and 158; see also A.R., vol. X, at pp. 55\u201156). It is also true that, on the face of the record, some of the appellants could not reasonably allege that they had been the victims of either of these infringements, or possibly even both. However, this did not prevent any appellant from having standing to apply to a court for a stay of proceedings under s. 24(1) of the Charter and to obtain a judgment from the court on the merits of their application if they had duly alleged all the essential elements that had to be shown in order to establish an infringement of their s. 7 right on the basis of an abuse of process in the residual category.\n[49] I agree with the appellants that the existence of directly personal prejudice is not one of these essential elements. As will be explained more fully below, this Court has repeatedly recognized that an infringement of s. 7 of the Charter may result solely from the fact that state conduct causes prejudice to the integrity of the justice system, irrespective of whether the conduct had an impact on the other rights of the person alleging it or on the fairness of their trial.\n(3) Section 7 of the Charter Protects Accused Persons From State Conduct That Undermines the Integrity of the Justice System, Regardless of Whether There Is Personal Prejudice\n[50] Indeed, under the residual category of abuse of process, \u201cprejudice . . . is better conceptualized as an act tending to undermine society\u2019s expectations of fairness in the administration of justice\u201d (Nixon, at para. 41). As L\u2019Heureux\u2011Dub\u00e9 J. noted in O\u2019Connor, the residual category of abuse of process\ndoes not relate to conduct affecting the fairness of the trial or impairing other procedural rights enumerated in the Charter , but instead addresses the panoply of diverse and sometimes unforeseeable circumstances in which a prosecution is conducted in such a manner as to connote unfairness or vexatiousness of such a degree that it contravenes fundamental notions of justice and thus undermines the integrity of the judicial process. [para. 73]\n[51] In other words, impairment of the accused\u2019s other rights or of the fairness of their trial, \u201calthough relevant, is not determinative\u201d (Nixon, at para. 41), because the type of prejudice addressed by the principles of fundamental justice in s. 7 goes well beyond personal prejudice (O\u2019Connor, at para. 64). All that must be found is that there is state conduct with repercussions on a larger scale, that is, conduct that causes prejudice to the integrity of the justice system in the eyes of society.\n[52] Of course, the personal prejudice resulting from an alleged abuse of process in the residual category will not be without significance when it comes time to determine whether the abuse in question occurred. In fact, breaches of the fairness of an accused\u2019s trial are often inseparable from and in addition to prejudice to the integrity of the justice system (O\u2019Connor, at para. 64; see also R. v. Scott, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 979, at p. 1007).\n[53] However, the fact remains that an accused\u2019s s. 7 right may be infringed as a result of state conduct that meets the threshold for establishing an abuse of process in the residual category without the accused having suffered any personal prejudice, such as another of their constitutional rights being impaired or the fairness of their trial being compromised.\n[54] This does not mean that every accused will have standing to apply for a remedy under s. 24(1) on the basis of any state conduct that undermines the integrity of the justice system, regardless of the causal connection between the abusive conduct and the proceedings against them. For a court to find that an accused\u2019s right under s. 7 of the Charter has been infringed as a result of an abuse of process in the residual category, there must be a \u201csufficient causal connection\u201d between the abusive conduct and the proceedings against the accused (Canada (Attorney General) v. Bedford, 2013 SCC 72, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 1101, at paras. 75\u201178). It is this connection to which I now turn.\n(4) The Proceedings Against the Accused Must Have Been Tainted by the Abusive State Conduct\n[55] In my opinion, the causal connection between, on the one hand, the state conduct that undermines the integrity of the justice system and, on the other, the engagement of the accused\u2019s interests protected by s. 7 of the Charter , that is, life, liberty and security of the person, will be considered sufficient where the criminal proceedings against the accused are \u201ctainted\u201d (in French, entach\u00e9es) by the abusive conduct (see R. v. Conway, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1659, at p. 1667).\n[56] The proceedings against an accused will be regarded as tainted where abusive conduct occurred in the course of the proceedings or in the course of a police investigation or operation that targeted the accused or otherwise served to gather evidence to prove that the accused was guilty of the charge or charges laid against them. Obviously, the abusive conduct need not have had an impact on the accused\u2019s other Charter rights or on the fairness of their trial in order to meet this requirement. It need only have occurred in the course of the investigation or police operation targeting the accused or the criminal proceedings against them. In the absence of this connection, I have difficulty seeing how the accused\u2019s life, liberty and security of the person are engaged by the abusive conduct.\n[57] This requirement is consistent with the purpose of the doctrine of abuse of process in the residual category, which is to enable courts to protect the integrity of the justice system by dissociating themselves from state conduct that constitutes an abuse of the judicial process (D. M. Paciocco, \u201cThe Stay of Proceedings as a Remedy in Criminal Cases: Abusing the Abuse of Process Concept\u201d (1991), 15 Crim. L.J. 315, at p. 338). When there is no connection between the abusive conduct and the proceedings against the accused, the fact that the court dissociates itself from the conduct will not have the effect of preserving the integrity of the justice system.\n[58] This requirement is also consistent with the applicable framework for granting a stay of proceedings under s. 24(1) of the Charter . This framework, which involves three cumulative conditions, is used to screen applications for stays of proceedings to ensure that this remedy is available only in the \u201cclearest of cases\u201d, which excludes cases in which the proceedings against the accused are not already tainted by abusive conduct.\n[59] This can be confirmed simply by looking at the first condition, which reflects the fact that a stay of proceedings is a prospective remedy (Tobiass, at para. 91; Regan, at para. 54). This condition is aimed at preventing the perpetuation of prejudice to the integrity of the justice system that, if left alone, will continue to trouble the parties and the community as a whole in the future (O\u2019Connor, at para. 75; Tobiass, at para. 91; Regan, at para. 54; Nixon, at para. 42; Babos, at para. 35). To this end, the court must ask whether \u201cproceeding in light of the impugned conduct would do further harm to the integrity of the justice system\u201d (Babos, at para. 38). This question cannot be divorced from the specific context of the court proceedings against each accused, since those are the proceedings for which a stay is sought (Paciocco, at p. 341). In other words, to meet the first condition for establishing that a stay of proceedings is an appropriate remedy, the accused must satisfy the court that carrying on with the proceedings against them would in itself do further harm to the integrity of the justice system.\n[60] But it is only where the proceedings against an accused are tainted by abusive conduct that the accused can argue that refusing to stay the proceedings will manifest, perpetuate or aggravate prejudice to the integrity of the justice system, as required by s. 24(1) of the Charter . Conversely, where the proceedings against the accused are not first tainted by abusive state conduct, the accused\u2019s application for a stay of proceedings under s. 24(1) on the basis of the abuse will have no chance of success. For this reason, it is entirely logical and desirable that such an accused not have standing to apply for a stay of proceedings under s. 24(1) on the basis of that conduct.\n[61] Finally, the condition requiring that the proceedings be tainted by abusive conduct is consistent with the case law. In R. v. Castro, 2001 BCCA 507, 47 C.R. (5th) 391, the British Columbia Court of Appeal had to determine whether the accused Mr. Castro and his co\u2011accused had standing to apply for a stay of proceedings on the basis of an abuse of process in the residual category in a context where there was only an indirect connection between the abusive conduct and the court proceedings against them. The case concerned two related investigations: Project Escudo and Project Eye Spy. The latter was an undercover operation targeted at money laundering and drug trafficking. It led to Mr. Castro being identified as a possible drug trafficker. Project Escudo was then put in place to target Mr. Castro directly and was conducted in parallel with Project Eye Spy. The Crown argued that the accused, including Mr. Castro, did not have standing to assert the illegality of the transactions conducted as part of Project Eye Spy because Mr. Castro and his co\u2011accused were not alleging that they had participated in those transactions (para. 26). The Court of Appeal rejected that argument on the ground that the proceedings against Mr. Castro and his co\u2011accused were tainted by the abusive police conduct associated with Project Eye Spy:\nIn summary, the appellants have standing to argue the illegality of the police conduct in Project Eye Spy because it was intended to produce and in fact produced evidence directly leading to the appellants\u2019 prosecution. The conduct formed a sufficiently close link with the prosecution that it can be reasonably argued that the prosecution is tainted with illegality. Whether this amounts to an abuse of process requiring a stay will be for the judge who hears the matter to decide in light of all the circumstances, including the legal opinions. [Emphasis added; para. 39.]\n[62] Babos provides another illustration. In that case, one of the three forms of misconduct that Mr. Babos alleged against the Crown in support of his application for a stay of proceedings under s. 24(1) of the Charter for abuse of process in the residual category was a Crown attorney\u2019s use of improper means to obtain the medical records of his co\u2011accused, Mr. Piccirilli, from the detention centre where the latter was being held pending trial. Even though that conduct was not directed at Mr. Babos and did not affect the proceedings against him in any way, it occurred during his criminal proceedings, and no one questioned the fact that, like Mr. Piccirilli, he had standing to allege it in support of his application for a stay of proceedings.\n[63] It follows that one of the essential elements that must be shown for an accused to establish that their right under s. 7 of the Charter has been infringed as a result of an abuse of process in the residual category is that the abusive conduct tainted the proceedings against them. An accused who does not allege expressly or implicitly that the abusive state conduct tainted the proceedings against them will therefore not have standing to apply for a remedy under s. 24(1) on the basis of such conduct.\n(5) Application to the Facts\n[64] In this case, all of the appellants alleged that the police conduct they characterized as abusive had tainted the proceedings against them. Indeed, all of the misconduct alleged by each of them \u2014 (i) failure to facilitate the requested access to counsel at the first reasonably available opportunity during the police operation on March 31, 2016, (ii) failure to give notice to the persons against whom a covert search warrant was executed, contrary to the terms of the warrant, and (iii) failure to have the warrants endorsed before they were executed outside the district of Trois\u2011Rivi\u00e8res \u2014 took place in the course of the police investigation and operation known as Project Nandou, which directly targeted all of the appellants and served to gather evidence to prove their guilt.\n[65] That being said, having standing is only the first step in an application under s. 24(1) of the Charter . Whether there was an abuse of process in the residual category remains an open question. However, before addressing this question, I believe it will be useful to clarify the analytical framework that applies where the existence of an abuse of process in the residual category contrary to s. 7 is based on allegations that there has been an accumulation of infringements of other Charter rights, in this case the rights guaranteed by ss. 8 and 10(b).\nB. Did the Superior Court Judge Err in Finding That There Had Been an Abuse of Process in the Residual Category?\n(1) The Analytical Framework That Applies Where Abuse of Process in the Residual Category Results From the Infringement of Other Charter Rights\n[66] In O\u2019Connor, this Court stated that both s. 7 of the Charter and the specific procedural guarantees set out in ss. 8 to 14 are intended to protect the individual interest of accused persons in a fair trial as well as the integrity of the justice system as a whole (paras. 64 and 73). In doing so, the Court did not recognize any \u201cright against abuse of process\u201d in the Charter . It preferred to state that, \u201c[d]epending on the circumstances, different Charter guarantees may be engaged\u201d (para. 73).\n[67] Sometimes, the Charter \u2019s specific procedural guarantees will be the best fit for remedying abuse of process. For example, where an accused alleges that misconduct by the Crown has prejudiced their ability to have a trial within a reasonable time, the application should be dealt with by applying the framework for s. 11(b) of the Charter (O\u2019Connor, at para. 73).\n[68] Where none of the specific procedural guarantees addresses the alleged misconduct, this Court has established that s. 7 of the Charter acts as a safeguard and provides accused persons with additional protection from state conduct that affects trial fairness in other ways and from \u201cresidual\u201d conduct that otherwise undermines the integrity of the justice system (Nixon, at para. 36). In this sense, s. 7 plays a role complementary to that of ss. 8 to 14 by providing residual protection against abuse of process that goes beyond the protection offered by the specific guarantees in ss. 8 to 14. This role has also been recognized many times by the Court outside the abuse of process context (R. v. J.J., 2022 SCC 28, at para. 113; R. v. Darrach, 2000 SCC 46, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 443, at para. 24; R. v. White, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 417, at para. 44; R. v. Mills, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 668, at paras. 72 and 76; R. v. Pearson, [1992] 3 S.C.R. 665, at p. 688; R. v. Seaboyer, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577, at p. 603; Thomson Newspapers Ltd. v. Canada (Director of Investigation and Research, Restrictive Trade Practices Commission), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 425, at pp. 537\u201138).\n[69] It is therefore not uncommon for s. 7 of the Charter to be invoked at the same time as one or more other procedural guarantees. This will be the case, for example, where alleged abusive state conduct involves more than just the infringement of a procedural guarantee set out in ss. 8 to 14. Indeed, abusive state conduct may take all sorts of forms. This Court has also specifically recognized that there may be cases in which \u201cthe nature and number of incidents, though individually unworthy of a stay, will require one when considered together\u201d (Babos, at para. 73). This statement applies equally at the stage of determining whether abuse of process has occurred. Abuse of process in the residual category can thus result from an accumulation of incidents or state misconduct. Furthermore, there is no reason why such incidents or misconduct cannot take the form of infringements of a procedural Charter guarantee and, consequently, why the alleged abuse of process cannot result from an accumulation of infringements of one or more guarantees.\n[70] In these circumstances, how are the relevant analytical frameworks to be reconciled? This Court has attempted in the past to establish the order of priority it should follow when an infringement of s. 7 of the Charter is alleged together with an infringement of one or more procedural guarantees (R. v. Harrer, [1995] 3 S.C.R. 562, at para. 13; Canada (Attorney General) v. Whaling, 2014 SCC 20, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 392, at para. 76; J.J., at paras. 213 and 327), but because these provisions are \u201cinextricably\u201d intertwined (Seaboyer, at p. 603; Mills, at para. 69; J.J., at para. 114) and complementary, the Court preferred to find as follows:\nThe appropriate methodology for assessing multiple Charter breaches alleged by the accused may depend on the factual record, the nature of the Charter rights at play, and how they intersect. This Court has repeatedly affirmed that the methodology for assessing multiple alleged Charter breaches is highly context\u2011 and fact\u2011specific . . . .\n(J.J., at para. 115)\n[71] It bears repeating that, in the abuse of process context, both s. 7 and ss. 8 to 14 of the Charter are intended to protect individuals from conduct that is unfair or vexatious to such a degree that it contravenes fundamental notions of justice and thus undermines the integrity of the justice system (O\u2019Connor, at paras. 64 and 73). It follows that the frameworks for analyzing these provisions can coexist. Indeed, it is entirely appropriate to use the framework for abuse of process in the residual category developed for the purposes of s. 7 to analyze any accumulation of infringements of one or more procedural guarantees in order to determine whether the infringements as a whole meet the threshold for establishing abuse of process, that is, prejudice to the integrity of the justice system.\n[72] Of course, the framework applicable to each of these procedural guarantees will remain relevant in determining whether the infringements making up the accumulation of infringements actually occurred. In fact, this determination will logically have to be made before the court decides whether there has been an abuse of process in the residual category. In this way, the frameworks coexist, those for the procedural guarantees being intertwined with the s. 7 framework.\n[73] Before turning to the framework applicable in this case, I want to reiterate that proof of one or more infringements is not necessary to establish an abuse of process in the residual category, because the focus with this type of abuse is on conduct that undermines the integrity of the justice system, regardless of whether it breaches other Charter rights.\n(2) The Framework Applicable in This Case\n[74] In this case, the abuse of process alleged by the appellants results from an accumulation of infringements of Charter rights, specifically the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure and the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay, that reflects a situation of blatant disregard for their rights by the police (A.R., vol. X, at pp. 55\u201156; A.R., vol. XI, at pp. 15, 70\u201171 and 108\u20119). The appellants do not focus on any breach of trial fairness resulting from these infringements. Further, they acknowledge that the infringements in question, considered individually, cannot justify the remedy they seek, namely a stay of the proceedings against them (Sup. Ct. reasons (2018), at paras. 5, 133 and 150). Rather, they allege that the accumulation of infringements and the police disregard for their rights that it reflects caused prejudice to the integrity of the justice system.\n[75] In these circumstances, the framework developed for the purposes of s. 7 of the Charter for analyzing abuse of process in the residual category should be adopted to determine whether the alleged infringements as a whole meet the threshold for establishing abuse of process. However, this exercise makes it necessary to apply the framework for each of the provisions at issue, ss. 8 and 10(b), to determine whether the allegations of infringements are well founded. Only once each of the alleged infringements has been examined will it then be possible to determine whether all of the infringements, considered together, amount to conduct that is vexatious to such a degree that it contravenes fundamental notions of justice and thus undermines the integrity of the justice system.\n[76] I pause here for a moment. The appellants argue that certain infringements were [translation] \u201cplanned and intended\u201d and that the accumulation of these infringements reflects \u201cblatant disregard\u201d for their rights (A.R., vol. I, at p. 96). The appellants also describe the alleged infringements of the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay as being [translation] \u201csystematic\u201d (p. 92). Needless to say, the deliberate and widespread nature of one or more infringements of Charter rights is relevant in determining whether the threshold for establishing abuse of process in the residual category is met.\n[77] Indeed, the Court has previously recognized the relevance of these two factors under the framework for s. 24(2) of the Charter at the stage of determining the seriousness of the Charter \u2011infringing conduct (R. v. Harrison, 2009 SCC 34, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 494, at paras. 22 and 25; R. v. Grant, 2009 SCC 32, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 353, at para. 75; R. v. McColman, 2023 SCC 8, at para. 58). It is true that s. 24(2) is analytically distinct from ss. 8 and 10(b) in the sense that it comes into play only at the remedy stage, after an infringement has been found. However, the fact remains that the primary concern under s. 24(2), namely public confidence in the administration of justice (Grant, at paras. 67\u201168), intersects with the interest protected by s. 7 when it comes to abuse of process in the residual category, namely the integrity of the justice system (O\u2019Connor, at para. 61).\n(3) Application to the Facts\n[78] The Superior Court judge held that the police had committed an accumulation of infringements of the rights of the appellants in group 1 under ss. 8 and 10(b) of the Charter and that, when considered together and in their entire context, these infringements revealed a \u201csystemic and persistent problem\u201d (Sup. Ct. reasons (2018), at para. 216) that was extremely serious and met the threshold for establishing abuse of process in the residual category and warranting a stay of proceedings (paras. 210, 217 and 219\u201120, quoting Brind\u2019Amour, at para. 93). In the paragraphs that follow, I will consider whether the Superior Court judge erred in arriving at that conclusion. For this purpose, I will apply the analytical framework for each of the rights relied upon, starting \u2014 as the Superior Court and the Court of Appeal did \u2014 with the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay. Once all the allegations of infringements have been examined, I will be able to assess whether the identified infringements as a whole meet the threshold for abuse of process in the residual category under s. 7 of the Charter .\n[79] Before I begin, I think it is helpful to reiterate that \u201c[a]ppellate intervention is warranted only where a trial judge misdirects him or herself in law, commits a reviewable error of fact, or renders a decision that is \u2018so clearly wrong as to amount to an injustice\u2019\u201d (Babos, at para. 48, quoting R. v. Bellusci, 2012 SCC 44, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 509, at para. 19; Regan, at para. 117; Tobiass, at para. 87; R. v. Bjelland, 2009 SCC 38, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 651, at paras. 15 and 51).\n(a) Right to Retain and Instruct Counsel Without Delay\n(i) Applicable Law\n[80] Section 10(b) of the Charter provides that everyone has the right on arrest or detention \u201cto retain and instruct counsel without delay and to be informed of that right\u201d. In R. v. Bartle, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 173, Lamer C.J. summarized the three duties that this provision imposes on the police:\n(1) to inform the detainee of his or her right to retain and instruct counsel without delay and of the existence and availability of legal aid and duty counsel;\n(2) if a detainee has indicated a desire to exercise this right, to provide the detainee with a reasonable opportunity to exercise the right (except in urgent and dangerous circumstances); and\n(3) to refrain from eliciting evidence from the detainee until he or she has had that reasonable opportunity (again, except in cases of urgency or danger).\n(p. 192, citing R. v. Manninen, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1233, at pp. 1241\u201142; R. v. Evans, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 869, at p. 890; R. v. Brydges, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 190, at pp. 203\u20114.)\n[81] The purpose of these three duties is to protect any person whose detention puts them in a situation of vulnerability relative to the state (R. v. Suberu, 2009 SCC 33, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 460, at paras. 2 and 40\u201141). While under the control of the police, the person suffers a deprivation of liberty and is at risk of involuntary self\u2011incrimination (R. v. Taylor, 2014 SCC 50, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 495, at para. 22, citing Bartle, at p. 191).\n[82] Although the first duty is triggered immediately upon detention (Suberu, at para. 41), the second and third duties arise only if the detainee indicates a desire to exercise their right to counsel. Where this is the case, the police are under a constitutional obligation to facilitate access to counsel at the first reasonably available opportunity and to refrain from eliciting evidence from the detainee until that time (Manninen, at pp. 1241\u201142; Taylor, at paras. 24 and 26).\n[83] Whether the delay between the time a detainee indicates a desire to exercise their right and the time the detainee exercises it is reasonable is a factual and highly contextual inquiry (Taylor, at para. 24). Barriers to access or \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d that justify briefly suspending the exercise of the right cannot be assumed; they must be proved (para. 33; R. v. Mian, 2014 SCC 54, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 689, at para. 74; R. v. Strachan, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 980, at pp. 998\u201199). The burden is always on the Crown to prove the circumstances, exceptional or not, that make the delay reasonable (Taylor, at para. 24).\n[84] Before applying these principles to the facts, I think it necessary to reiterate that the law does not as yet impose a specific duty on police officers to provide their own telephones to detainees or to have inexpensive devices on hand so that detainees can exercise their right to retain and instruct counsel without delay (Taylor, at paras. 27\u201128).\n(ii) Application to the Facts\n[85] The Superior Court judge held [translation] \u201cthat the right to counsel and the right to be informed of that right were infringed\u201d (Sup. Ct. reasons (2018), at para. 85) for all of the appellants in group 1 because the evidence revealed a \u201csystematic\u201d police practice of postponing the exercise by these persons of their right to retain and instruct counsel without delay until they were taken to the police station, without first considering the particular circumstances of each arrest (para. 75).\n[86] The Crown argues that the Court of Appeal properly identified errors of law in the analysis that led the Superior Court judge to that conclusion. The Crown submits that the judge erred as regards the scope of the police duties and that his finding of a \u201csystematic\u201d infringement flowed directly from that error.\n[87] The appellants, on the other hand, argue that the Superior Court judge made no reviewable error and that it was rather the Court of Appeal that erred by interfering with his findings of mixed fact and law in the absence of palpable and overriding errors.\n[88] For the reasons that follow, I am of the view that the Superior Court judge erred in law in finding that the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay of all of the appellants in group 1 had been infringed.\n[89] My conclusion is deferential to the findings of fact made by the Superior Court judge. He found that four of the seven appellants in group 1 expressed a desire to immediately exercise their right to retain and instruct counsel without delay but were told that the right would be exercised at the police station, even though the police did not first consider whether, in the circumstances, the right could be exercised immediately (Sup. Ct. reasons (2018), at paras. 49\u201154, 58\u201159 and 68). When asked why one of the appellants was not given an opportunity to retain and instruct counsel at the scene, the arresting officer replied as follows:\n[translation] . . . that\u2019s not the normal practice. That\u2019s not the way it\u2019s normally done. Normally, we go directly to headquarters and then have the person contact counsel within, you know, a reasonable time, and directly at headquarters, not at the scene with everyone who\u2019s around, as a matter of confidentiality too. [Emphasis added.]\n(A.R., vol. IV, at p. 29; see also Sup. Ct. reasons (2018), at paras. 54 and 57.)\n[90] In addition, as the Superior Court judge noted, the detective in charge of the \u201carrest\u201d component during the preparatory meeting for the officers who were to take part in the police operation on March 31, 2016, had in fact been involved approximately two months earlier in an arrest in respect of which his colleague had been criticized for replying [translation] \u201cin a somewhat automatic manner\u201d, to a detainee who had expressed his intention to exercise his right to retain and instruct counsel without delay, that the right would be exercised at the police station (para. 70, quoting R. v. Martel, C.Q. Trois\u2011Rivi\u00e8res, Nos. 400\u201101\u2011064968\u2011118, 400\u201101\u2011064969\u2011116, 400\u201101\u2011064970\u2011114, January 27, 2016, reproduced in A.R., vol. III, at p. 1).\n[91] In these circumstances, the Superior Court judge could find that there was a police practice amounting to a \u201creverse onus\u201d (Sup. Ct. reasons (2018), at para. 84) whereby the police officers refused to consider the immediate exercise of the right to counsel unless the detainee specifically requested it. That finding resulted from the Superior Court judge\u2019s exclusive assessment of the facts and is entitled to deference.\n[92] However, I am of the view that the existence of that practice, without more, did not permit the Superior Court judge to infer, as he did, that the right of the seven appellants in group 1 to retain and instruct counsel without delay had been infringed.\n[93] First of all, one of the seven appellants in group 1, Mr. Chounlamountry, was given an opportunity to exercise his right to counsel at the scene and declined to do so (Sup. Ct. reasons (2018), at para. 55), while two others, Mr. Girard and Mr. Mailhot, did not ask to exercise this right at the scene (paras. 56 and 62). In the case of Mr. Girard, the Superior Court judge found from the evidence that he had said he [translation] \u201cwould want\u201d to exercise his right to counsel later (para. 56). It can therefore be seen simply from reading the Superior Court judge\u2019s findings that the duty to implement the right to counsel was not even triggered for at least three of the appellants in group 1.\n[94] Moreover, although I agree with the Superior Court judge that the practice he identified is improper, this does not mean that it results in an automatic breach of any of the three duties arising from the right to counsel guaranteed by s. 10(b) of the Charter .\n[95] This Court has already recognized that, as a general rule, the police may not assume in advance that it will be impracticable for them to facilitate access to counsel. On the contrary, they must be mindful of the particular circumstances of the detention and take proactive steps to turn the right to counsel into access to counsel (Taylor, at para. 33). This is the case because the detainee\u2019s ability to exercise their right depends entirely on the police (para. 25).\n[96] That being said, the fact that a police officer assumes in advance that it will be reasonable to delay the implementation of the right to counsel, without regard to the circumstances of the detention, will not in itself entail an infringement of this right. After all, the central question remains whether the delay was reasonable having regard to all of the circumstances, whether those circumstances were considered by the police or not. However, the fact that the police assume the delay will be reasonable will make it much more difficult for the Crown to show that it was in fact reasonable.\n[97] Taylor provides an illustration of this principle. In that case, this Court had to determine whether the failure of two police officers to facilitate Mr. Taylor\u2019s access to counsel during the 20 to 30 minutes between his admission to hospital and the time a first set of blood samples was taken was an infringement of his right to retain and instruct counsel without delay. Both officers had completely forgotten about their duty to ensure that Mr. Taylor could exercise his right at the first reasonably available opportunity. Far from concluding that the oversight was in itself an infringement of s. 10(b) of the Charter , this Court focused instead on how the oversight affected the determination of the reasonableness of the failure:\nThe result of the officers\u2019 failure to even turn their minds that night to the obligation to provide this access, meant that there was virtually no evidence about whether a private phone call would have been possible, and therefore no basis for assessing the reasonableness of the failure to facilitate access. [para. 35]\n[98] Yet one officer had testified that because of the hospital setting Mr. Taylor was in, there was \u201cabsolutely no way\u201d that he could have contacted counsel in a confidential manner (para. 30). However, the Court gave little weight to her testimony, for the following reason:\n. . . this retrospective imputation of impracticability is of limited relevance given her acknowledgement that she was only there to track the blood samples and whether such access was possible was not part of her duties there. As a result, she too made no inquiries of the hospital staff. [para. 30]\n[99] Since there was no evidence justifying the failure, this Court came to the conclusion that Mr. Taylor\u2019s right to counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter had been infringed before the first set of blood samples was taken (para. 37).\n[100] It follows from the foregoing that the fact that the police postpone the exercise of a detainee\u2019s right to retain and instruct counsel without delay until the detainee has been taken to the police station, without first considering the particular circumstances of the arrest, does not in itself entail an infringement of the right guaranteed by s. 10(b) of the Charter . The central question remains whether the delay in facilitating access to counsel (in Taylor, it was a failure to facilitate such access (para. 35)) was reasonable in the circumstances. This is a question of fact that must be decided on the basis of the evidence in the record (paras. 24 and 32\u201133).\n[101] In this case, as the Court of Appeal properly noted, the Superior Court judge did not, with all due respect, analyze the reasonableness of the delay between the time the appellants in group 1 indicated a desire to exercise their right to counsel and the time they were able to exercise it. His reasons dealing with the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay of the four appellants in group 1 who expressed their intention to exercise it immediately after being informed of it make no mention of the time that three of them had to wait before being able to call their counsel (Sup. Ct. reasons (2018), at paras. 49\u201154, 58\u201161 and 68).\n[102] In addition, the Superior Court judge\u2019s reasons make only a passing reference to certain circumstances that were relevant to assessing the reasonableness of the delay, such as the fact that a search was in progress, the proximity of the police station, the police officers\u2019 safety, the presence of a telephone at the scene and issues relating to the confidentiality of any call made, without ever analyzing how these circumstances affected the reasonableness of the delay. In the case of one of the four appellants in question, the reasons do not even refer to any of these circumstances (para. 68). I will add that nowhere in the reasons is any account taken of the fact that accomplices were arrested at the same time.\n[103] It is true that the Superior Court judge wrote the following at para. 77 of his reasons:\n[translation] In contrast to the situation encountered in R. v. Strachan, which had to be stabilized before the accused could exercise his constitutional right, there is no evidence of such a situation in this case. No effort was made to enable the accused to contact counsel.\n[104] With respect, that paragraph does not decide the issue of the reasonableness of the time waited by the four appellants in group 1 who expressed their intention to exercise their right to counsel immediately. While the need to stabilize the scene of the arrest is one of the exceptional circumstances that justify briefly postponing the exercise of this right (Strachan, at pp. 998\u201199), it is not the only factor to be considered in assessing the reasonableness of delay.\n[105] In light of the foregoing, I conclude that the Superior Court judge erred in law in finding that the allegations that the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay had been infringed were well founded with respect to all of the appellants in group 1 solely on the basis of the police practice of systematically postponing the exercise of this right without first considering the particular circumstances of each arrest. This error explains why the Superior Court judge held that the right of three appellants to retain and instruct counsel without delay had been infringed even though they had either already exercised their right or deferred its exercise after being duly informed of it. This error also explains why the judge failed to analyze the reasonableness of the delay between the time the other four appellants in group 1 indicated a desire to exercise their right to counsel and the time they were able to exercise it.\n[106] Since the appellants decided to base their abuse of process claim on an accumulation of infringements, including the infringement of the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay, the Superior Court judge had to correctly apply the s. 10(b) framework in relation to each of them and draw the necessary conclusions, which he did not do.\n[107] Of course, the improper police practice identified earlier itself constitutes state misconduct that is relevant in determining whether there was an abuse of process in the residual category. However, at this stage, it is impossible to say whether the Superior Court judge considered the mere existence of this misconduct to be as serious as the accumulation of infringements of the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay that he thought he had identified. After all, the time between being arrested and being given an opportunity to contact counsel ranged from 23 minutes to 1 hour and 6 minutes, depending on the case, and the impact of the police practice on trial fairness was uncertain at best (Sup. Ct. reasons (2018), at paras. 189\u201191). In these circumstances, a case\u2011by\u2011case determination of whether the right guaranteed by s. 10(b) of the Charter had been infringed took on greater importance in ascertaining the seriousness of the improper police practice and, ultimately, the existence of an abuse of process in the residual category.\n[108] The error of law made by the Superior Court judge dictates the outcome of the appeal for the appellants in group 1, because the judge was of the view that the infringements of the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay were the most serious infringements (Sup. Ct. reasons (2018), at para. 184). In contrast, he characterized the failure to have the warrants executed outside the district of Trois\u2011Rivi\u00e8res endorsed as an [translation] \u201cerror made in good faith\u201d (para. 152) and specified that the failure to give notice of a covert search within the allotted time \u201cwould not on its own have made it possible to stay the proceedings\u201d (para. 133). In these circumstances, it is unnecessary to consider the Superior Court judge\u2019s findings with respect to these infringements of the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure. As the Court of Appeal recognized, the Superior Court judge\u2019s failure to assess the reasonableness of the delay before each appellant in group 1 was given an opportunity to contact counsel justifies, [translation] \u201con its own\u201d, holding a new hearing on the motion for a stay of proceedings and for the exclusion of evidence for group 1 (para. 56). This is because the Superior Court judge\u2019s conclusion that the right of the appellants in group 1 to retain and instruct counsel without delay had been infringed was an essential underpinning of his ultimate conclusion that their right under s. 7 of the Charter had been infringed as a result of an abuse of process in the residual category. Setting aside the first conclusion therefore amounts to setting aside the second.\n(b) Conclusion\n[109] In light of the reasons set out above, I conclude, as the Court of Appeal did, that the Superior Court judge erred in holding that the right of all of the appellants in group 1 to retain and instruct counsel without delay had been infringed. Because the infringements of this right were, in his view, the most serious ones, his conclusion that the appellants in group 1 were the victims of an abuse of process in the residual category must be set aside.\n[110] Since the Superior Court judge did not carry out the individualized analysis required by s. 10(b) of the Charter to determine whether the right of the appellants in group 1 to retain and instruct counsel without delay had been infringed, this Court is faced with the choice of affirming the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment ordering a new hearing on their motion or taking on the role of trier of fact. Given the highly circumstantial nature of the analysis, I am of the view that it is in the interests of justice for there to be a new hearing on the motion brought by the appellants in group 1.\n[111] The question of whether the same holds true for the motion brought by the appellants in groups 2, 3 and 4 will be discussed below. Before answering this question, I consider it necessary to point out another error made by the Superior Court judge at the stage of determining the appropriate remedy for the appellants in group 1, in case it is held again, after the new hearing on the motion, that the threshold for establishing abuse of process in the residual category is met.\nC. Did the Superior Court Judge Err in Entering a Stay of Proceedings for All of the Appellants?\n[112] A stay of proceedings has been characterized as the \u201cultimate remedy\u201d (Tobiass, at para. 86) because of its finality:\nIt is ultimate in the sense that it is final. Charges that are stayed may never be prosecuted; an alleged victim will never get his or her day in court; society will never have the matter resolved by a trier of fact.\n(Regan, at para. 53)\n[113] For these reasons, and as I noted above, this drastic remedy will be granted only where the situation meets the high threshold of being one of the \u201cclearest of cases\u201d (O\u2019Connor, at para. 69). This requires the following three conditions to be met:\n(1) there must be prejudice to the accused\u2019s right to a fair trial or to the integrity of the justice system that \u201cwill be manifested, perpetuated or aggravated through the conduct of the trial, or by its outcome\u201d (Regan, at para. 54; Babos, at para. 32);\n(2) there must be no alternative remedy capable of redressing the prejudice (Regan, at para. 54; Babos, at para. 32);\n(3) where there is still uncertainty over whether a stay of proceedings is warranted after steps 1 and 2, the court is required to balance the interests in favour of granting a stay, such as denouncing misconduct and preserving the integrity of the justice system, against \u201cthe interest that society has in having a final decision on the merits\u201d (Regan, at para. 57; Babos, at para. 32).\n[114] These conditions are cumulative, and none of them is optional. With respect, I am of the view that the Superior Court judge failed to ensure that the second condition was met in this case.\n[115] The motion brought by the appellants in group 1 specifically sought an order excluding an entire list of evidence if a stay of proceedings was not obtained for all of them (A.R., vol. I, at pp. 158\u201159; A.R., vol. XI, at p. 169; A.R., vol. XII, at p. 1; see also A.R., vol. XX, at pp. 18\u201120).\n[116] Yet the Superior Court judge never mentioned this alternative to a stay of proceedings in his analysis at the stage of determining the appropriate remedy (Sup. Ct. reasons (2018), at paras. 178\u2011222). He simply stated that [translation] \u201ca stay of proceedings is the appropriate remedy in this case\u201d (para. 217).\n[117] This may have been so, but it still had to be explained why a remedy short of a stay of proceedings could not redress the prejudice to the integrity of the justice system that the judge thought he had identified (see, e.g., Brind\u2019Amour, at paras. 102\u20113).\n[118] I would add that this failure to consider lesser remedies is especially significant in a context where several accused persons apply for a remedy under s. 24(1) of the Charter on the basis of the same abuse of process that affected them in different ways. In such circumstances, the court may very well conclude that the remedy that would fully redress the prejudice to the integrity of the justice system caused by the abuse involves individualized orders. After all, it is important to remember that\nthe Charter has now put into judges\u2019 hands a scalpel instead of an axe \u2014 a tool that may fashion, more carefully than ever, solutions taking into account the sometimes complementary and sometimes opposing concerns of fairness to the individual, societal interests, and the integrity of the judicial system.\n(O\u2019Connor, at para. 69)\nD. Could the Crown Raise, Before the Court of Appeal, the Superior Court Judge\u2019s Failure to Consider the Particular Circumstances of the Arrest of Each Appellant in Groups 2, 3 and 4 After Consenting to Judgment?\n[119] Lastly, the appellants maintain that the outcome of the appeal of those in groups 2, 3 and 4 is independent of the outcome of the appeal of those in group 1. Indeed, they argued before us that the Crown should not have been permitted to make, with respect to the judgment entering a stay of proceedings for the appellants in groups 2, 3 and 4, the same arguments it made in relation to the judgment entering a stay of proceedings for the appellants in group 1. More specifically, they contend that the Crown should have been precluded from raising the Superior Court judge\u2019s failure to consider the particular circumstances of the arrest of each appellant in groups 2, 3 and 4 in determining whether their right to retain and instruct counsel without delay had been infringed. Since the Crown explicitly [translation] \u201cinvited\u201d the Superior Court judge to decide the motions brought by those groups \u201cwithout further formalities\u201d, the appellants submit that it could not be permitted to take a new position on appeal and to criticize the judge for not conducting a case\u2011by\u2011case analysis (A.F., at para. 92). They say that this change of position on appeal is contrary to the principle of fairness and to the guarantee against double jeopardy in s. 11(h) of the Charter .\n[120] In support of their argument, the appellants rely on R. v. Barton, 2019 SCC 33, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 579, which sets out the Crown\u2019s duty not to advance a new theory of liability on appeal for reasons of procedural fairness. In Barton, Moldaver J., writing for the majority, stated the following at para. 47:\nOut of concerns over fairness to the accused and in particular the principle against double jeopardy, which is enshrined in s. 11( h ) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , the Crown is barred from securing a new trial by advancing a new theory of liability for the first time on appeal (see Wexler v. The King, [1939] S.C.R. 350; Savard v. The King, [1946] S.C.R. 20, at pp. 33\u201134, 37 and 49; R. v. Penno, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 865, at pp. 895\u201196; R. v. Egger, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 451, at p. 481). Moreover, as Doherty J.A. explained in Varga, \u201c[d]ouble jeopardy principles suffer even greater harm where the arguments advanced on appeal contradict positions taken by the Crown at trial\u201d (p. 793). In short, \u201c[a] Crown appeal cannot be the means whereby the Crown puts forward a different case than the one it chose to advance at trial\u201d (ibid.).\n[121] In response, the Crown argues that it did not change its position on appeal or invite the Superior Court judge to decide the motion of groups 2, 3 and 4 without further formalities. I agree with the Crown. According to the transcript of the hearing on May 7, 2019, both the appellants and the Crown agreed that the decision rendered for group 1, that is, the stay of proceedings, was applicable to groups 2, 3 and 4, after first consenting to the evidence and arguments from the hearing on group 1\u2019s motion being entered in the record for the motion brought by groups 2, 3 and 4. In doing so, the parties were not inviting the judge to decide the motion without further formalities. Rather, they were recognizing the fact that identical evidence and arguments would lead to an identical judgment. It seems that this approach involved an efficient use of judicial resources.\n[122] Above all, not only did the Crown never waive its right to appeal, but it can be seen from the exchanges between the parties and the Superior Court judge during the hearing on May 7, 2019, that everyone knew the Crown would appeal the judgment to be rendered for groups 2, 3 and 4 and that the appeal would be joined to the appeal from the first judgment concerning group 1, which had already been commenced through the filing of a notice of appeal (A.R., vol. XII, at pp. 199\u2011200; see also A.R., vol. II, at p. 55, para. 32, reproducing the Crown\u2019s brief before the Court of Appeal dated August 22, 2019, stating that the initial brief with respect to the appellants in group 1 had been filed on March 25, 2019, or a little more than a month before the hearing on May 7, 2019). The appellants were therefore neither taken by surprise nor prejudiced.\n[123] I therefore dismiss this ground of appeal. The Crown was permitted to raise the Superior Court judge\u2019s failure to consider the particular circumstances of the arrest of each appellant in groups 2, 3 and 4. For the reasons given above, I conclude that the Superior Court judge erred in law in holding that the allegations that the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay had been infringed were well founded with respect to the appellants in groups 2, 3 and 4. This error is also determinative of the outcome of the appeal filed by the appellants in groups 2, 3 and 4, and it requires that one or more new hearings be held on their motion for a stay of proceedings and for the exclusion of evidence.\nVI. Conclusion\n[124] For the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss the appeal. It is appropriate to hold new trials before a different judge, including new hearings on the motions for a stay of proceedings and for the exclusion of evidence.\nThe following are the reasons delivered by\nRowe J. \u2014\n[125] I am in agreement with the reasons of Justice O\u2019Bonsawin as to the result and in large measure as to her statement of the law and its application in the circumstances of this case. However, to the extent that this case provides guidance as to the methodology to be used when an accused seeks a stay of proceedings under s. 24(1) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms for alleged infringements of their rights protected under ss. 8 to 14 (in this instance, under s. 10(b)), and also seeks a stay under s. 24(1) for abuse of process under s. 7, I am concerned that greater clarity is warranted. It is for this purpose that I set out the brief reasons that follow.\n[126] The Court has not been consistent in its approach to how the legal analysis should be sequenced when an accused seeks a stay under s. 7 and under ss. 8 to 14 (R. v. J.J., 2022 SCC 28, at para. 115). In some cases, the Court has stated that where one of the \u201cLegal Rights\u201d under ss. 8 to 14 are relied on, as well as the broader right under s. 7, the specific right should be addressed first (Canada (Attorney General) v. Whaling, 2014 SCC 20, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 392, at para. 76; see also R. v. Harrer, [1995] 3 S.C.R. 562, at para. 13; R. v. G\u00e9n\u00e9reux, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 259, at p. 310; R. v. Pearson, [1992] 3 S.C.R. 665, at p. 688). In other cases, the Court dealt with s. 7 first. For example, in R. v. Pan, 2001 SCC 42, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 344, Justice Arbour, writing for the Court, stated that \u201cit is unnecessary in the present case to address the appellants\u2019 arguments concerning ss. 11( d ) and 11( f ) of the Charter . I agree with the Court of Appeal that the alleged Charter violations in the present appeals are more properly dealt with under s. 7 of the Charter and that nothing would be gained by also analysing the alleged violations under ss. 11(d) or 11(f)\u201d (para. 79; see also R. v. Cawthorne, 2016 SCC 32, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 983, at para. 35). Sometimes, the Court\u2019s approach varies within the same case. For example, in R. v. St-Onge Lamoureux, 2012 SCC 57, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 187, Cromwell J.\u2019s reasons, dissenting in part, dealt with some claims under s. 7 and some claims under s. 11 on the basis that the challenged provisions in that case \u201cmost directly engage[d]\u201d one section or the other (para. 125).\n[127] This lack of a settled methodology can generate further issues, notably by importing factors that are relevant to one section into the consideration of another section where such factors (arguably) are not relevant. It is unclear whether and, if so, to what extent this is so in the present case (see my colleague\u2019s reasons, at paras. 66-77, 80-84, 94-108 and 109-10). I do not suggest that my colleague is in error in her analysis; rather I am saying that it is unclear as to what \u201cdrives\u201d the analysis.\n[128] This is not an isolated instance. Rather, in this Court\u2019s jurisprudence it has not always been clear on which basis courts conclude there is an infringement. For example, in R. v. Babos, 2014 SCC 16, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 309, the alleged abuse of process was based on ss. 7, 8 and 11(d). The trial judge concluded that all these rights were infringed without conducting an analysis of each; no guidance was offered by this Court as its analysis dealt only with remedy. See also R. v. MacDonnell, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 305.\n[129] Courts should apply a consistent approach to the analysis where s. 7 and ss. 8 to 14 of the Charter are relied on by an accused in order to obtain a stay of proceedings. In my view, the following sequence reflects the appropriate order of operations:\n(a) Where a right under ss. 8 to 14 is relied on, along with s. 7, the specific right should be addressed first, including (if necessary) under s. 1;\n(b) If there is no infringement of the specific right, or if the infringement is justified under s. 1, only then should reviewing courts have regard to s. 7 and, if necessary, s. 1 once again.\n[130] The reasons of Justice O\u2019Bonsawin can be read as consistent with the foregoing, but are also capable of being understood as applying a \u201cblended\u201d analysis under ss. 10(b) and 7. It is this uncertainty as to methodology that I have sought to address in these brief reasons.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Desjardins C\u00f4t\u00e9, Montr\u00e9al; Lebrun Provencher, Trois\u2011Rivi\u00e8res.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Director of Criminal and Penal Prosecutions, Qu\u00e9bec.\nSolicitor for the intervener the Director of Public Prosecutions: Public Prosecution Service of Canada, Montr\u00e9al.\nSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Ontario: Crown Law Office \u2014 Criminal, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Quebec: Minist\u00e8re de la Justice du Qu\u00e9bec \u2014 Direction du droit constitutionnel et autochtone, Qu\u00e9bec.\nSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of British Columbia: Attorney General of British Columbia \u2014 Criminal Appeals and Special Prosecutions, Victoria.\nSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Alberta: Alberta Crown Prosecution Service \u2014 Appeals and Specialized Prosecutions Office, Calgary.\nSolicitor for the intervener the Criminal Lawyers\u2019 Association (Ontario): Andrew Burgess, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the intervener Association qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise des avocats et avocates de la d\u00e9fense: Roy & Charbonneau, Qu\u00e9bec.\nSolicitors for the intervener Association des avocats de la d\u00e9fense de Montr\u00e9al\u2011Laval\u2011Longueuil: Cabinet d\u2019avocats Novalex inc., Montr\u00e9al; Poupart, Touma, Montr\u00e9al.\n",

F. 31, s. 12(1).\nA CBC journalist requested access to 23 mandate letters that the Premier of Ontario delivered to each of his ministers shortly after forming government in 2018. The letters set out the Premier\u2019s views on policy priorities for the government\u2019s term in office. Cabinet Office declined the journalist\u2019s request. It claimed the letters were exempt from disclosure under the Cabinet records exemption in s. 12(1) of Ontario\u2019s Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (\u201cFIPPA\u201d), which protects, in its opening words, the confidentiality of records that would reveal the \u201csubstance of deliberations\u201d of Cabinet or its committees. The CBC appealed to the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario (\u201cIPC or Commissioner\u201d), who found that the letters were not exempt and ordered their disclosure. On judicial review, the Divisional Court found that the IPC\u2019s decision was reasonable and a majority of the Court of Appeal agreed.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the order of the IPC set aside.\nPer Wagner C.J. and Karakatsanis, Rowe, Martin, Jamal and O\u2019Bonsawin JJ.: The mandate letters are protected from disclosure under s. 12(1) of FIPPA. The opening words of s. 12(1) demand a substantive analysis of the requested record and its substance to determine whether disclosure of the record would shed light on Cabinet deliberations. Statutory text, purpose, and context lead inexorably to the conclusion that the mandate letters are protected from disclosure under s. 12(1)\u2019s opening words. The mandate letters reflect the view of the Premier on the importance of certain policy priorities and mark the initiation of a fluid process of policy formulation within Cabinet. The letters are revealing of the substance of Cabinet deliberations.\nFreedom of information legislation strikes a balance between the public\u2019s need to know and the confidentiality the executive requires to govern effectively. All such legislation across Canada balances these two essential goals through a general right of public access to government\u2011held information subject to exemptions or exclusions \u2014 including those for Cabinet records or confidences. In Ontario, s. 12(1) of FIPPA exempts a list of records, as well as any other records that would reveal the substance of deliberations of Cabinet or its committees. The legislative context shows that this exemption was a critical part of the balance the legislature struck between public access to information and necessary spheres of government confidentiality. But beyond legislation, Cabinet confidentiality is protected as a matter of constitutional convention. Because s. 12(1) was designed to preserve the secrecy of Cabinet\u2019s deliberative process, the constitutional dimension of Cabinet secrecy is crucial context in interpreting s. 12(1).\nIn Canada\u2019s constitutional democracy, the confidentiality of Cabinet deliberations is a precondition to responsible government because it enables collective ministerial responsibility. Responsible government is a fundamental principle of Canada\u2019s system of government and the most important non-federal characteristic of the Canadian Constitution. Cabinet secrecy derives from the collective dimension of ministerial responsibility, which requires that ministers be able to speak freely when deliberating without fear that what they say might be subject to public scrutiny. This is necessary so ministers do not censor themselves in policy debate, and so ministers can stand together in public, and be held responsible as a whole, once a policy decision has been made and announced. These purposes are referred to as the candour and solidarity rationales for Cabinet confidentiality. There is also a third rationale for the convention of Cabinet confidentiality: it promotes the efficiency of the collective decision-making process. Thus, Cabinet secrecy promotes candour, solidarity, and efficiency, all in aid of effective government.\nThe prerogative to determine when and how to announce Cabinet decisions is grounded in the harmful impact that premature disclosure of policy priorities can have on the deliberative process. The efficiency of the deliberative process justifies keeping Cabinet proceedings confidential until a final decision is made and announced. Publicizing Cabinet\u2019s decision-making process before the formulation and announcement of a final decision would increase the public pressure that stakeholders put on ministers and give rise to partisan criticism from their political opponents; this scrutiny would ultimately paralyze the collective decision-making process. The substance of Cabinet deliberations also encompasses discussion of when and how to communicate government priorities.\nCabinet\u2019s deliberative process consists of discussion, consultation, and policy formulation between the Premier, individual ministers, and Cabinet as a whole. The first minister, as head of Cabinet, enjoys extensive powers within Cabinet\u2019s deliberative process. In many regards, the role and activities of the Premier are inseparable from Cabinet and its deliberations. First ministers preside over Cabinet, set Cabinet agendas, determine Cabinet\u2019s membership and internal structure, set Cabinet procedures, and have the right to identify the consensus and determine what Cabinet has decided. Agenda\u2011setting, which occurs at an early stage, is a crucial part of the decision-making process. Though deliberative processes have changed over time at both the provincial and federal levels, the critical role of agenda-setting and the central involvement of the first minister in this exercise have remained constant. Not all stages of Cabinet\u2019s deliberative process take place sitting around the Cabinet table behind a closed door. The decision-making process in Cabinet extends beyond formal meetings of Cabinet or its committees. The priorities communicated to ministers by the Premier at the outset of governance are the initiation of Cabinet\u2019s deliberative process, and will be revealing of the substance of Cabinet deliberations when compared against subsequent government action.\nIn approaching assertions of Cabinet confidentiality, administrative decision makers and reviewing courts must be attentive to the vital importance of public access to government-held information but also to Cabinet secrecy\u2019s core purpose of enabling effective government, and its underlying rationales of efficiency, candour, and solidarity. They must also be attentive to the dynamic nature of executive decision-making, the function of Cabinet itself and its individual members, the role of the Premier, and Cabinet\u2019s prerogative to determine when and how to announce its decisions.\nIn the instant case, it is not necessary to resolve the issue of standard of review, as the same conclusion follows regardless of whether the standard of review of the IPC\u2019s decision is correctness or reasonableness. The narrow zone of protection for Cabinet deliberations created by the IPC\u2019s interpretation and application of s. 12(1) is not justified, even on the more deferential standard of reasonableness. The IPC failed to give meaningful weight to the legal and factual context, including traditions and constitutional conventions concerning Cabinet confidentiality, the role of the Premier, and the fluid, dynamic nature of the Cabinet decision-making process. As a result, the IPC\u2019s narrow interpretation of the \u201csubstance of deliberations\u201d was unreasonable, as was his application of the provision to the mandate letters.\nPer C\u00f4t\u00e9 J.: There is agreement with the majority\u2019s interpretation of s. 12(1) of FIPPA, and with its conclusion that the mandate letters at issue are exempt from disclosure under that provision. However, there is disagreement with the majority\u2019s statement that it is not necessary to resolve the question of the applicable standard of review.\nThe Court has recognized that correctness review is necessary to resolve general questions of law \u2014 such as the appropriateness of limits on solicitor-client privilege and the scope of parliamentary privilege \u2014 that are of fundamental importance and broad applicability, with significant legal consequences for the justice system as a whole. The scope of Cabinet privilege is not a question particular to Ontario\u2019s specific regulatory regime and there is no principled reason why Cabinet privilege should be treated any differently \u2014 or is any less important to the legal system as a whole \u2014 than solicitor\u2011client privilege or parliamentary privilege. The scope of Cabinet privilege is a question of central importance to the legal system as a whole. It must be reviewed for correctness because courts, when conducting a reasonableness review, cannot provide the single determinate answer that such questions require.\nIn the instant case, there is disagreement with the majority that the same conclusion follows regardless of whether the standard of review is correctness or reasonableness. The Commissioner\u2019s reasons were intelligible and transparent and a number of relevant factors weigh in favour of the Commissioner\u2019s interpretation of s. 12(1). The fact that the majority would have reached a different conclusion does not make the Commissioner\u2019s decision unreasonable. A court conducting reasonableness review must focus on the decision the administrative decision maker actually made, including the justification offered for it, and not on the conclusion the court itself would have reached. The majority fails to apply this methodology in practice.\nHowever, there is agreement with the majority\u2019s interpretation of the scope of Cabinet privilege, which is the correct interpretation, and with its conclusion that the mandate letters are exempt from disclosure under s. 12(1). The \u201csubstance of deliberations\u201d encompasses Cabinet\u2019s deliberative process from beginning to end, including directives and policy priorities communicated by the Premier to individual ministers. By concluding otherwise, the Commissioner adopted an incorrect interpretation.\nCases Cited\nBy Karakatsanis J.\nApplied: Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v.

Introduction\n[1] Freedom of information (FOI) legislation strikes a balance between the public\u2019s need to know and the confidentiality the executive requires to govern effectively. Both are crucial to the proper functioning of our democracy. This appeal concerns the balance between these two foundational principles.\n[2] Access to information promotes transparency, accountability, and meaningful public participation. Without adequate knowledge of what is going on, legislators and the public can neither hold government to account nor meaningfully contribute to decision making, policy formation, and law making. In this way, FOI legislation is intended not to hinder government but to \u201cimprove the workings of government\u201d by making it \u201cmore effective, responsive and accountable\u201d to both the legislative branch and the public (Dagg v. Canada (Minister of Finance), [1997] 2 S.C.R. 403, at para. 63).\n[3] However, in our Westminster system of government, the executive \u2014 like the judicial and legislative branches \u2014 also requires certain spheres of confidentiality to fulfill its constitutional role. Each of the executive, legislative branch, and judiciary play \u201ccritical and complementary roles in our constitutional democracy\u201d and \u201ceach branch will be unable to fulfill its role if it is unduly interfered with by the others\u201d (Ontario v. Criminal Lawyers\u2019 Association of Ontario, 2013 SCC 43, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 3, at para. 29). Thus, constitutional conventions flow from the separation of powers and protect the spheres of confidentiality needed for a government institution \u201cto perform its constitutionally-assigned functions\u201d (British Columbia (Attorney General) v. Provincial Court Judges\u2019 Association of British Columbia, 2020 SCC 20, [2020] 2 S.C.R. 506 (B.C. Judges), at para. 66). Just as legislative privilege protects the ability of elected representatives to act on the will of the people (Chagnon v. Syndicat de la fonction publique et parapublique du Qu\u00e9bec, 2018 SCC 39, [2018] 2 S.C.R. 687), and deliberative secrecy preserves the independence of the judiciary (MacKeigan v. Hickman, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 796, at pp. 830-31), Cabinet confidentiality grants the executive the necessary latitude to govern in an effective, collectively responsible manner (Babcock v. Canada (Attorney General), 2002 SCC 57, [2002] 3 S.C.R. 3, at para. 15). Cabinet secrecy is \u201cessential to good government\u201d (ibid.), as it promotes deliberative candour, ministerial solidarity, and governmental efficiency by protecting Cabinet\u2019s deliberations (B.C. Judges, at paras. 95-97; Carey v. Ontario, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 637, at pp. 658-59).\n[4] All FOI legislation across Canada balances these two essential goals through a general right of public access to government-held information subject to exemptions or exclusions \u2014 including those for Cabinet records or confidences. This appeal implicates that balance in relation to the Cabinet records exemption in s. 12(1) of Ontario\u2019s Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.31 (FIPPA). Section 12(1) exempts a list of records, as well as any other records that would reveal the \u201csubstance of deliberations\u201d of Cabinet or its committees. The interpretation of \u201csubstance of deliberations\u201d by the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario (IPC or Commissioner) is at the heart of this case.\n[5] The access to information dispute in this appeal arises out of a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) journalist\u2019s request to access 23 letters that the Premier of Ontario delivered to each of his ministers shortly after forming government in 2018 (Letters). These Letters, commonly called \u201cmandate letters\u201d, set out the Premier\u2019s views on policy priorities for the government\u2019s term in office. Cabinet Office declined the journalist\u2019s request, claiming the Letters were exempt from disclosure under s. 12(1) of FIPPA.\n[6] The CBC appealed to the IPC, who found that the Letters were not exempt and ordered their disclosure (Order PO-3973, 2019 CanLII 76037). On judicial review, the Ontario Divisional Court found that the IPC\u2019s decision was reasonable and a majority of the Ontario Court of Appeal agreed (2020 ONSC 5085, 93 Admin. L.R. (6th) 1; 2022 ONCA 74, 160 O.R. (3d) 481). In dissent, Lauwers J.A. would have found that the decision was unreasonable for several reasons, but mainly because it eroded the sphere of Cabinet privilege that s. 12(1) is designed to preserve.\n[7] As I shall explain, I conclude that the IPC\u2019s decision was unreasonable. The Commissioner paid careful attention to the text of the legislation and considered some of the purposes of Cabinet confidentiality. His reasons were intelligible and transparent. But he did not engage meaningfully with the legal and factual context against which s. 12(1) operates \u2014 in particular, constitutional conventions and traditions surrounding Cabinet confidentiality and Cabinet\u2019s decision-making process, including the role of the Premier within that process. Cabinet confidentiality creates conditions necessary to ensure an effective government. The Commissioner did not consider a key rationale underlying the convention: promoting the efficiency of the collective decision-making process. His failure to grapple with the broader constitutional dimension of Cabinet confidentiality led him to an overly narrow interpretation of s. 12(1). He excluded \u201coutcomes\u201d of the deliberative process, without regard for the impact that premature disclosure of policy priorities at an early stage of the process may have on the efficient workings of government.\n[8] Moreover, even on the Commissioner\u2019s interpretation of s. 12(1), his application of the standard to the Letters was unreasonable. The IPC\u2019s characterization of the Letters as containing only non-exempt \u201ctopics\u201d or final \u201coutcomes\u201d of the Premier\u2019s deliberative process did not account for the broader context of the Cabinet\u2019s deliberative process. For one, as head of Cabinet, the Premier\u2019s deliberations cannot be artificially segmented from those of Cabinet. And far from being mere \u201ctopics\u201d like items on an agenda, the Letters reflect the views of the Premier on the importance of certain policy priorities, and mark the initiation of a fluid process of policy formulation within Cabinet. The Letters are revealing of the substance of Cabinet deliberations, both on their face and when compared against what government actually does.\n[9] I would allow the appeal and set aside the decision of the IPC.\nII. Reasons of the IPC\n[10] Before the IPC, Cabinet Office submitted the Letters should be protected for three reasons: (1) the Letters were placed on the agenda of Cabinet\u2019s initial meeting, provided to each minister during the meeting, and the Premier\u2019s key messages on policy initiatives would have been discussed at that meeting; (2) the Letters reveal the deliberations of the Premier in setting policy priorities for Cabinet, which are inherently part of the deliberative process of Cabinet; and (3) disclosure of the Letters would reveal the substance of future Cabinet deliberations because many priorities outlined in the Letters require deliberation by Cabinet and its committees before implementation (paras. 26-29). Cabinet Office submitted that prematurely disclosing policy initiatives could endanger free and frank discussion of these initiatives in future Cabinet meetings, and stressed the prerogative of the Premier \u201cto determine the manner and timing by which the government will disclose its policy priorities\u201d (paras. 30 and 32).\n[11] The IPC found the Letters were not protected by s. 12(1) and ordered they be disclosed. The IPC began by examining the purpose of the Cabinet records exemption, given two underlying rationales for preserving the confidentiality of Cabinet deliberations: ministerial candour and solidarity. He found that the purpose was \u201cto promote the free and frank discussion among Cabinet members of issues coming before them for decision, without concern for the chilling effect that might result from disclosure of their statements or the material on which they are deliberating\u201d (para. 86).\n[12] The IPC rejected the CBC\u2019s argument that \u201csubstance of deliberations\u201d should be restricted to records revealing discussion of the pros and cons of a course of action. He recognized that \u201cthe exemption may extend more generally to include Cabinet members\u2019 views, opinions, thoughts, ideas and concerns\u201d expressed in the deliberative process and to documents that \u201cwere intended to serve, or did serve, as . . . the basis for discussions by Cabinet as a whole\u201d (paras. 98 and 113; see also paras. 116, 119 and 131). The IPC noted that, generally, \u201c[s]ection 12(1) is designed to protect deliberative communications occurring within\u201d Cabinet\u2019s policy-making process, not the \u201coutcomes\u201d of that process (i.e. the decisions themselves) or mere \u201csubjects\u201d or \u201ctopics\u201d of deliberation (paras. 92 and 104). Still, he recognized that topics or subject matters will be exempt where \u201cthe context or other additional information would permit the reader to draw accurate inferences\u201d as to Cabinet deliberations (para. 100, quoting Order PO-1725, 1999 CanLII 14318 (Ont. I.P.C.), at p. 16). Later in his decision, the IPC relied on past precedent interpreting s. 12(1)(a) to hold that records not falling within the specific exemptions at s. 12(1)(a) to (f) will only qualify for protection where it is likely disclosure \u201cwould permit accurate inferences to be drawn as to actual Cabinet deliberations at a specific Cabinet meeting\u201d (paras. 94, 101 and 121).\n[13] In the application, the IPC held the Letters were not protected because nothing suggested they were intended to serve, or served, as the basis for discussions by Cabinet as a whole (paras. 113-14). At most, the Letters indicate topics that may have arisen during a Cabinet meeting, or the subject matter of unspecified policy initiatives that may be considered in future meetings (paras. 115 and 119). Moreover, rather than being revealing of the views, opinions, thoughts, ideas, and concerns of ministers, the IPC held that the Letters represent \u201cthe end point of the Premier\u2019s formulation of the policies and goals to be achieved by each Ministry\u201d \u2014 or, \u201cthe product of his deliberations\u201d \u2014 and fell outside the ambit of s. 12(1) (paras. 132 and 134; see also para. 79).\nIII. Analysis\n[14] Section 12(1) protects the confidentiality of records that \u201cwould reveal the substance of [Cabinet] deliberations\u201d. Similar exemptions are found in FOI legislation across the country.[1] The opening words of s. 12(1) provide that \u201c[a] head shall refuse to disclose a record where the disclosure would reveal the substance of deliberations\u201d of Cabinet or its committees. The paragraphs of the provision protect listed records, which need not meet the standard set out in s. 12(1)\u2019s opening words to qualify for protection. Section 12(1) is reproduced in full in the attached Appendix. Only the opening words of the provision are at issue.\n[15] Here, the sole issue is whether the public should have access to the Premier\u2019s mandate letters. This turns on the IPC\u2019s interpretation of the opening words of s. 12(1) and its application on these facts. The parties submit that this Court should review the IPC\u2019s decision for reasonableness. We are not bound by that agreement as a \u201creviewing judge\u2019s selection and application of the standard of review is reviewable for correctness\u201d (Northern Regional Health Authority v. Horrocks, 2021 SCC 42, at para. 10; Agraira v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2013 SCC 36, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 559, at paras. 45-47).\n[16] We note, however, that the case was argued and decided by the courts below based on reasonableness review. Dissenting at the Court of Appeal, Lauwers J.A. raised, without deciding, serious questions as to whether the standard of review ought to be correctness in this case given the constitutional conventions and associated traditions and practices engaged by s. 12(1) (paras. 106-8). In this case, the same conclusion follows regardless of whether the standard of review is correctness or reasonableness. The narrow zone of protection for Cabinet deliberations created by the IPC\u2019s interpretation and application of s. 12(1) is not justified, even on the more deferential standard of reasonableness. In light of this conclusion and considering that the parties had not raised the issue of the applicable standard of review before this Court, it is not necessary to finally resolve the issue here. We therefore make no comment about the \u201cthorny question\u201d raised by Lauwers J.A. (at para. 108) and proceed on the basis of reasonableness review.\n[17] Reasonableness review focuses both on the decision maker\u2019s reasoning process and the outcome (Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653, at paras. 83-84). A reasonable decision is \u201cjustified in relation to the constellation of law and facts that are relevant to the decision\u201d; the legal and factual contexts thus \u201coperate as constraints on the decision maker in the exercise of its delegated powers\u201d (para. 105). Relevant contextual constraints may include \u201cthe governing statutory scheme; other relevant statutory or common law; the principles of statutory interpretation; the evidence before the decision maker . . .; the submissions of the parties; the past practices and decisions of the administrative body; and the potential impact of the decision on the individual\u201d (para. 106).\n[18] In conducting reasonableness review, reviewing judges must \u201cbe attentive to the application by decision makers of specialized knowledge\u201d and \u201cinstitutional expertise and experience\u201d (para. 93; see also paras. 232-34). Judges must not reweigh and reassess the evidence considered by the decision maker, absent a fundamental misapprehension or failure to account for some aspect of the evidence (paras. 125-26). Reasonableness review thus entails deference to the decision maker, and, throughout, I examine the reasons offered by the IPC in light of the parties\u2019 arguments and the context of the proceedings.\n[19] The appellant Attorney General of Ontario submits the IPC\u2019s decision was unreasonable on several bases, including: (1) the IPC\u2019s interpretation of s. 12(1) is inconsistent with the purpose of the exemption to broadly protect Cabinet confidentiality, in line with tradition and constitutional convention; (2) the IPC unreasonably established a heightened test for s. 12(1) in requiring evidence that the Letters were connected to \u201cactual Cabinet deliberations at a specific Cabinet meeting\u201d; and (3) the IPC erred in concluding that the Letters were not exempt because they were \u201coutcomes\u201d of the Premier\u2019s deliberative process, or mere \u201ctopics\u201d and \u201csubjects\u201d of Cabinet meetings.\n[20] The respondent CBC seeks to uphold the IPC\u2019s decision, noting that the IPC was alive to the purpose of the exemption and reasonably concluded that disclosure of the Letters would not impair that goal. The CBC contends that the IPC\u2019s decision did not turn on whether \u201cactual\u201d deliberations occurred at a \u201cspecific\u201d Cabinet meeting. Rather, it was driven by a lack of evidence the Letters would disclose the substance of any deliberations at any Cabinet meeting. The CBC also argues that the IPC recognized that \u201coutcomes\u201d of a deliberative process may be exempt where they would permit accurate inferences to be drawn as to the substance of Cabinet\u2019s deliberations, and reasonably found the Letters did not meet this test. As mandated by the statutory process, the CBC made its submissions without the benefit of viewing the Letters, which had been disclosed only to the IPC and reviewing judges in these proceedings.\n[21] As I will explain, I agree with the Attorney General of Ontario that the Commissioner did not adequately grapple with the broader legal and factual context in interpreting s. 12(1). As a result, he unreasonably rejected the arguments of Cabinet Office as to the impact that disclosure of the Letters would have on Cabinet\u2019s deliberative process. The legal and factual constraints operating on s. 12(1) implicate constitutional conventions and traditions governing Cabinet confidentiality and Cabinet\u2019s deliberative process. Given the centrality of such traditions and conventions to the proper functioning of our democracy, it was vital that the IPC\u2019s decision meaningfully consider this context. His failure to do so led him to an unreasonably narrow interpretation of s. 12(1) and caused him to mischaracterize the Letters themselves.\n[22] I proceed by assessing the reasonableness of the IPC\u2019s interpretation of s. 12(1) against the legislation and the legal backdrop of Cabinet confidentiality. I then assess the Commissioner\u2019s characterization of the Letters, given the context advanced by Cabinet Office about the deliberative process and the role of the Premier.\nA. The IPC\u2019s Interpretation of Section 12(1)\n[23] A reasonable decision is justified in relation to the salient aspects of the statute\u2019s text, context, and purpose, in line with the modern principle of statutory interpretation (Vavilov, at paras. 117-22). A minor omission of some element of text, context, or purpose is unlikely to be a basis for finding the decision unreasonable. Still, a court will intervene where \u201cthe omitted aspect of the analysis causes the reviewing court to lose confidence in the outcome reached by the decision maker\u201d (para. 122).\n[24] In my view, the IPC\u2019s decision demonstrates careful regard for the text of s. 12(1) \u2014 for example, noting the meaning of the words \u201csubstance\u201d, \u201cdeliberations\u201d, \u201cincluding\u201d, and \u201cwould\u201d in the provision (paras. 9, 90-97 and 111). The IPC also noted FOI legislation\u2019s general purpose of facilitating democracy (para. 106), and accounted for two of the purposes of Cabinet confidentiality: candour and solidarity (para. 87). But the IPC was not attentive to important legal context surrounding the exemption, which must inform the interpretation of its purpose and text. This omission led the IPC to an overly narrow interpretation of the exemption\u2019s purpose and scope.\n[25] The parties submit that the purposes informing the legislation were key considerations to the IPC\u2019s interpretation of s. 12(1). FIPPA was enacted in 1987 based on recommendations made by the Ontario Commission on Freedom of Information and Individual Privacy, headed by Commissioner D. Carlton Williams, in 1980. As the IPC observed, FIPPA creates a general right of public access to government information, subject to necessary exemptions which are limited and specific (para. 107, citing s. 1(a)).\n[26] The legislative context shows FIPPA\u2019s Cabinet records exemption was a critical part of the balance the legislature struck between public access to information and necessary spheres of government confidentiality (see Legislative Assembly of Ontario, Official Report of Debates (Hansard), No. 21, 1st Sess., 33rd Parl., July 12, 1985, at pp. 753-55 (Hon. Ian G. Scott) (recognizing that FIPPA required \u201cbalanc[ing]\u201d of competing interests and that the Cabinet records exemption protected \u201ccentral institutions of representative government\u201d)). In contemplating the enactment of FOI legislation in Ontario, the official report of the Williams Commission recognized that changes to access to government information practices had to be compatible with the province\u2019s traditions and the constitutional conventions related to the effective functioning of Cabinet (Commission on Freedom of Information and Individual Privacy, Public Government for Private People: The Report of the Commission on Freedom of Information and Individual Privacy (1980) (Williams Report), at pp. 83 and 85).\n[27] Beyond legislation, Cabinet confidentiality is protected as a matter of constitutional convention, or the rules of behavior established by government institutions that are not enforced by the courts, but are considered binding by those who operate the Constitution (A. Heard, Canadian Constitutional Conventions: The Marriage of Law & Politics (2nd ed. 2014), at p. 5; see also Reference re Resolution to amend the Constitution, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 753, at p. 880). Because s. 12(1) was designed to preserve the secrecy of Cabinet\u2019s deliberative process, the constitutional dimension of Cabinet secrecy was crucial context in interpreting s. 12(1).\n[28] In our constitutional democracy, the confidentiality of Cabinet deliberations is a precondition to responsible government because it enables collective ministerial responsibility. Responsible government is a fundamental principle of our system of government (OPSEU v. Ontario (Attorney General), [1987] 2 S.C.R. 2, at p. 38) and the \u201cmost important non-federal characteristic of the Canadian Constitution\u201d (P. W. Hogg and W. K. Wright, Constitutional Law of Canada (5th ed. Supp.), at \u00a7 9:3). Government is \u201cresponsible\u201d in that the executive is accountable to, and must maintain the confidence of, the legislative assembly (\u00a7 9:1; Heard, at p. 90). Cabinet ministers are both individually responsible for their own conduct and respective departments, and collectively responsible for government policy and action (G. White, Cabinets and First Ministers (2005), at pp. 15-16).\n[29] Cabinet secrecy derives from the collective dimension of ministerial responsibility (Y. Campagnolo, \u201cThe Political Legitimacy of Cabinet Secrecy\u201d (2017), 51 R.J.T.U.M. 51, at p. 59). Collective ministerial responsibility requires that ministers be able to speak freely when deliberating without fear that what they say might be subject to public scrutiny (IPC reasons, at paras. 86-87 and 97). This is necessary so ministers do not censor themselves in policy debate, and so ministers can stand together in public, and be held responsible as a whole, once a policy decision has been made and announced. These purposes are referred to by scholars as the \u201ccandour\u201d and \u201csolidarity\u201d rationales for Cabinet confidentiality (see Campagnolo (2017), at pp. 66-72). At base, Cabinet confidentiality promotes executive accountability by permitting private disagreement and candour in ministerial deliberations, despite public solidarity (ibid.; see also N. d\u2019Ombrain, \u201cCabinet secrecy\u201d (2004), 47 Can. Pub. Admin. 332, at p. 336).\n[30] Scholars also refer to a third rationale for the convention of Cabinet confidentiality: it promotes the efficiency of the collective decision-making process (see Campagnolo (2017), at p. 68). Thus, Cabinet secrecy promotes candour, solidarity, and efficiency, all in aid of effective government. This objective is also reflected in the jurisprudence of this Court. In Carey, this Court observed that the very purpose of the confidentiality is the proper functioning of government (pp. 664, 670-71 and 673). In Babcock, McLachlin C.J. stated: \u201cCabinet confidentiality is essential to good government\u201d (para. 15). And in John Doe v. Ontario (Finance), 2014 SCC 36, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 3, this Court noted that exposure of policy priorities at an early stage of the deliberative process to journalists or political opponents \u201cis combustible material liable to fuel a fire that could quickly destroy governmental credibility and effectiveness\u201d (para. 44, quoting Canadian Council of Christian Charities v. Canada (Minister of Finance), [1999] 4 F.C. 245, at para. 31).\n[31] Cabinet confidentiality is therefore \u201cnot just a convenient political dodge; it is essential to effective government\u201d (see White, at p. 139; see also p. 138). Our jurisprudence focuses broadly on the value of deliberative secrecy to the effective operation of government institutions, including Cabinet. It also recognizes that too much openness can impair that aim (see Babcock, at para. 18; Ontario (Public Safety and Security) v. Criminal Lawyers\u2019 Association, 2010 SCC 23, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 815 (Criminal Lawyers\u2019 Association 2010), at para. 40; B.C. Judges, at para. 96; see also John Doe, at para. 44; Williams Report, at p. 235).\n[32] The IPC demonstrated appreciation for the import of the candour and solidarity rationales supporting Cabinet confidentiality, citing this Court\u2019s decision in Babcock (see para. 87). These rationales informed the IPC\u2019s articulation of the purpose of s. 12(1) as \u201cpromot[ing] the free and frank discussion among Cabinet members of issues coming before them for decision, without concern for the chilling effect that might result from disclosure of their statements or the material on which they are deliberating\u201d (para. 86). But the IPC\u2019s engagement with the convention of Cabinet confidentiality essentially stopped there (see para. 87). Despite the submissions of Cabinet Office that disclosure of the mandate Letters could harm the efficacy of the Cabinet decision-making process (A.R., vol. III, at pp. 101-2), the Commissioner did not engage with a core purpose of Cabinet secrecy to promote the efficiency of the collective decision making, nor with the ultimate goal of this constitutional convention: effective government. This was critical context to interpreting s. 12(1).\n[33] Ministerial candour and solidarity are components of effective governance, to be sure, but they are only part of the foundation on which Cabinet confidentiality and effective governance rests \u2014 and thus the legal context within which s. 12(1) operates. To reasonably interpret the opening words of s. 12(1), it was therefore critical that the IPC fully consider the function of Cabinet within our system of government, and the bounds of confidentiality necessary for it to discharge that function effectively (see Criminal Lawyers\u2019 Association 2010, at para. 40; C.A. reasons, at para. 163). The IPC\u2019s failure to do so was material. It led him to: (1) ascribe an overly narrow purpose to s. 12(1); and (2) neglect important arguments made by Cabinet Office that informed the scope of the exemption.\n[34] First, had the IPC recognized that the fundamental focus of deliberative secrecy is effective government, the Commissioner could not have framed the purpose to focus only on \u201cfree and frank discussion among Cabinet members\u201d. Rather, as Lauwers J.A. noted, a contextual interpretation of s. 12(1) instructs that the provision more broadly aims to establish the confidentiality necessary for the executive to function effectively (paras. 187 and 208).\n[35] Second, had the IPC framed the purpose of s. 12(1) more broadly, he may not have rejected a central argument from Cabinet Office going to the scope of s. 12(1). Cabinet Office argued that, along with ensuring ministerial candour and solidarity, Cabinet secrecy also helps to ensure the deliberative process runs efficiently by preserving the confidentiality of deliberations until a final decision has been made and announced (IPC reasons, at paras. 30-32; A.R., vol. III, at pp. 90, 101-2, 228 and 232). In this Court, Cabinet Office and the intervener the Canadian Civil Liberties Association submitted that the Cabinet secrecy convention is aimed at the efficiency of the deliberative process (A.F., at paras. 11 and 54; I.F., at paras. 7-8). This argument rests on the third rationale underlying the convention of Cabinet secrecy. Lord Reid famously explained the value of Cabinet confidentiality to government efficiency in Conway v. Rimmer, [1968] A.C. 910 (H.L.), at p. 952, in words quoted with approval by this Court in Carey, at pp. 658-59:\n[The premature disclosure of Cabinet secrets] would create or fan ill-informed or captious public or political criticism. The business of government is difficult enough as it is, and no government could contemplate with equanimity the inner workings of the government machine being exposed to the gaze of those ready to criticise without adequate knowledge of the background and perhaps with some axe to grind.\n[36] The prerogative to determine when and how to announce Cabinet decisions is grounded in the harmful impact that premature disclosure of policy priorities can have on the deliberative process. As Professor Campagnolo explains, as a matter of convention, the efficiency of the deliberative process justifies \u201ckeeping Cabinet proceedings confidential until a final decision is made and announced by ministers\u201d (Behind Closed Doors: The Law and Politics of Cabinet Secrecy (2021), at p. 26). Publicizing Cabinet\u2019s decision-making process before the formulation and announcement of a final decision \u201cwould increase the public pressure that stakeholders put on ministers and give rise to partisan criticism from their political opponents\u201d; this scrutiny \u201cwould ultimately paralyze the collective decision-making process\u201d (p. 26).\n[37] Because the IPC largely did not engage with this important argument, he did not acknowledge Cabinet Office\u2019s submission that determining \u201cwhen and how\u201d to communicate policy priorities to the public and opposition parties is itself an important part of Cabinet\u2019s deliberative process (A.R., vol. III, at p. 103 (emphasis added); see also White, at pp. 22-23). Materials presented to Cabinet seeking a decision on a policy matter invariably include a communications strategy, which also requires Cabinet deliberation and approval (see, e.g., Privy Council Office, A drafter\u2019s guide to cabinet documents (2013), at pp. 6, 11 and 27). Cabinet may charge individual ministers with public communications related to their respective portfolios. And as a matter of tradition, Cabinet often makes important announcements of policy decisions in the Legislative Assembly (Williams Report, at p. 286).\n[38] That is what happened in this case. The day after the Letters were distributed to Cabinet ministers, the Lieutenant Governor delivered the new government\u2019s Speech from the Throne in the Ontario Legislative Assembly, setting out the government\u2019s agenda for the legislative session (Office of the Premier, A Government for the People: Speech from the Throne, July 12, 2018 (online)). Certain policy priorities named in the Letters were announced, while others were kept confidential. And the priorities that were announced were framed at a high level of generality not necessarily reflective of their description in the Letters. Clearly, government\u2019s desire to make information public is not relevant to the question of whether that information is protected. However, it shows how the substance of Cabinet deliberations also encompasses discussion of when and how to communicate government priorities.\n[39] The failure to engage meaningfully with Cabinet Office\u2019s arguments about the fundamental underpinnings of Cabinet confidentiality had implications for the IPC\u2019s interpretation of the scope of s. 12(1). The IPC concluded that \u201coutcomes\u201d of the deliberative process are not encompassed by the opening words of s. 12(1), full stop, without acknowledging that an important part of Cabinet confidentiality is government\u2019s prerogative to decide how and when to announce policy priorities (see para. 104). Because the IPC ultimately characterized the Letters as non-exempt outcomes or products of the Premier\u2019s deliberative process, as I explain below, this omission was material.\n[40] As Vavilov makes clear, failing to meaningfully grapple with central arguments raised by the parties is a marker of unreasonableness (para. 128); and overlooking a salient part of statutory context is unreasonable where the decision maker may have arrived at a different interpretation had it considered the key element (para. 122).\nB. The IPC\u2019s Application of Section 12(1) to the Letters\n[41] In considering how the exemption applied to the Letters, the IPC\u2019s reasons also did not sufficiently engage with important conventions and traditions surrounding the Cabinet decision-making process, including the role of the Premier within that process.\n[42] Before the IPC, Cabinet Office relied on IPC precedent recognizing that constitutional conventions surrounding the Premier make his role of establishing the priorities and agenda for Cabinet inseparable from the deliberations of Cabinet (A.R., vol. III, at pp. 92-94, citing Order PO-1725). Also, in arguing that disclosure of the Letters would reveal the substance of future Cabinet deliberations, Cabinet Office stressed that, given conventions and practice, \u201cmany of the policy priorities assigned to each minister in the mandate letters will require each minister to develop an operational, legislative or financial policy proposal that would return to [Cabinet] and its committees for decision-making before implementation\u201d (A.R., vol III., at p. 100). Cabinet Office submitted that Cabinet deliberations occur on a \u201ccontinuum\u201d and that the mandate Letters \u201cinitiate a continuing deliberative process at Cabinet that necessarily extends beyond the initial Cabinet meeting\u201d (IPC reasons, at para. 27).\n[43] The IPC held that the Letters were not revealing of the Premier\u2019s deliberations nor of future Cabinet deliberations. The Commissioner concluded that the Letters did not disclose the substance of the Premier\u2019s deliberations because they were the \u201cend point\u201d or \u201cproduct\u201d of his deliberative process. As to future Cabinet deliberations, the IPC stated that where a record does not fall within the specific categories of records listed at s. 12(1)(a) to (f), it will be protected only \u201cwhere . . . the context or additional information would permit accurate inferences to be drawn as to actual deliberations at a specific Cabinet meeting\u201d (para. 110).\n[44] I agree with the CBC that, on a generous reading of the reasons, the IPC did not understand the deliberative process to be limited to discussions at a specific meeting of Cabinet. Still, the IPC rejected Cabinet Office\u2019s argument that the Letters start a continuing deliberative process in part because Cabinet Office had not shown that the priorities discussed in the Letters would be discussed at a future Cabinet meeting (para. 116). And, as to those priorities which the IPC accepted would return to Cabinet, the IPC found they were also non-exempt because they were mere topics that did not reveal the substance of deliberations.\n[45] In my view, this reasoning and the conclusions the Commissioner drew about the Letters are not justifiable, given two key contextual constraints: the nature of the Cabinet decision-making process and the Premier\u2019s role as head of Cabinet within that process. These constitutional conventions run counter to the IPC\u2019s reasoning. I shall explain.\n[46] To begin, Cabinet\u2019s deliberative process consists of discussion, consultation, and policy formulation between the Premier, individual ministers, and Cabinet as a whole \u2014 informed by the advice of civil servants every step along the way. The first minister, as head of Cabinet, enjoys extensive powers within Cabinet\u2019s deliberative process by convention. In many regards, the role and activities of the Premier are inseparable from Cabinet and its deliberations. First ministers preside over Cabinet, set Cabinet agendas, determine Cabinet\u2019s membership and its internal structure (e.g., the number, nature, and membership of Cabinet committees), set Cabinet procedures, and have the right to identify the consensus and determine what Cabinet has decided (Hogg and Wright, at \u00a7\u00a7 9:5-9:6).\n[47] As this Court recognized in John Doe, \u201cthe policy-making process include[s] false starts, blind alleys, wrong turns, changes of mind, the solicitation and rejection of advice, and the re-evaluation of priorities and the re-weighing of the relative importance of the relevant factors as a problem is studied more closely\u201d (para. 44, quoting Canadian Council of Christian Charities, at para. 31). In other words, the process is dynamic, fluid, and continues to evolve as leadership changes hands. Cabinet enjoys tremendous flexibility in terms of its organization, its processes, and its composition (White, at p. 34).\n[48] Agenda-setting, which occurs at an early stage, is \u201ca crucial part\u201d of the decision-making process (S. Brooks, Canadian Democracy (9th ed. 2020), at p. 241). The role of the first minister and of Cabinet in establishing the government\u2019s policy and budget priorities \u201cis institutionalized through the formal structure of cabinet decision-making\u201d (ibid.). Though deliberative processes have changed over time at both the provincial and federal levels, the critical role of agenda-setting and the central involvement of the first minister in this exercise have remained constant.\n[49] The dynamic and fluid nature of Cabinet\u2019s deliberative process also means that not all stages of the process take place sitting around the Cabinet table behind a closed door. The decision-making process in Cabinet extends beyond formal meetings of Cabinet or its committees, and encompasses \u201c[o]ne-on-one conversations in the corridors . . ., in the [first minister\u2019s] office . . ., over the phone, or however and wherever they may take place\u201d (Brooks, at p. 242). As Professor Brooks writes, \u201c[n]o organization chart can capture this informal but crucial aspect\u201d of the deliberative process, nor the centrality of the first minister\u2019s role within it (ibid.).\n[50] The IPC ostensibly recognized the role of the Premier in Cabinet\u2019s decision-making process, citing past IPC precedent which recognized that \u201cby virtue of the Premier\u2019s unique role in setting the priorities and supervising the policy making, legislative and administrative agendas of Cabinet, the deliberations of the Premier . . . cannot be separated from the deliberations of the Cabinet as a whole\u201d (para. 23, quoting Order PO-1725, at pp. 14-16). Still, a number of the IPC\u2019s conclusions conflict with the role of the Premier within Cabinet and the nature of the Cabinet decision-making process \u2014 both of which are essential elements of the statutory context surrounding s. 12(1) (see Vavilov, at para. 120).\n[51] For one, in characterizing the Letters as non-exempt outcomes of the Premier\u2019s deliberative process, the IPC drew an artificial dichotomy between the Premier\u2019s deliberative process, and the rest of Cabinet\u2019s (see, e.g., para. 132). That dichotomy not only contradicts past IPC precedent, but, more important, runs counter to the constitutional role of the Premier as first minister in Cabinet.\n[52] The priorities communicated to ministers by the Premier at the outset of governance are the initiation of Cabinet\u2019s deliberative process, and are subject to change. Ministers may seek to persuade the Premier and the rest of Cabinet that priorities should be added, abandoned, or approached in a different way (see, e.g., H. Bakvis, \u201cPrime Minister and Cabinet in Canada: An Autocracy in Need of Reform?\u201d (2000), 35:4 J. Can. Stud. 60, at pp. 65-66 (discussing the important role of individual ministers and their ability to shape the government\u2019s priorities)). Moreover, the Premier may revise priorities at any point throughout the process \u2014 whether due to Cabinet colleagues\u2019 views, advice from civil servants, or events and changing circumstances.\n[53] The Letters on their face contain communications between the Premier and Cabinet ministers about policy priorities, many if not most of which would require decisions from Cabinet, both as to their substance and as to how they should be communicated to the public. Cabinet \u201cformulates and carries out all executive policies,\u201d and all major government policy matters are forwarded to Cabinet for decision (Hogg and Wright, at \u00a7 9:5; M. Schacter and P. Haid, Cabinet Decision-Making in Canada: Lessons and Practices (1999), at p. 1; see also Brooks, at p. 236). There is no basis in convention or past precedent to separate the Premier\u2019s role in this process from the rest of Cabinet. Disclosure of the Premier\u2019s initial priorities, when compared against later announcements of government policy and what government actually accomplished, would reveal the substance of what happened during Cabinet\u2019s deliberative process. The IPC\u2019s characterization of the Letters as \u201cthe end point of the Premier\u2019s formulation of the policies and goals to be achieved by each Ministry\u201d, or \u201cthe product of his deliberations\u201d was thus beside the point, and an unreasonable basis upon which to deny protection under s. 12(1) (paras. 132 and 134 (emphasis added); see also para. 79).\n[54] Relatedly, to the extent the IPC required evidence linking the Letters to \u201cactual Cabinet deliberations at a specific Cabinet meeting\u201d, that approach was unreasonable. Such a requirement is far too narrow and does not account for the realities of the deliberative process, including the Premier\u2019s priority-setting and supervisory functions, which are not necessarily performed at a specific Cabinet meeting and may occur throughout the continuum of Cabinet\u2019s deliberative process. Accordingly, it would be unreasonable for the Commissioner to establish a heightened test for exemption from disclosure that would require evidence linking the record to \u201cactual Cabinet deliberations at a specific Cabinet meeting\u201d.\n[55] I agree with the CBC that the IPC did not adopt this test throughout his reasons. Still, his focus on actual deliberations at a specific Cabinet meeting underscored his finding that the fact that some policy priorities \u201cmay never return to Cabinet at all or . . . may be altered or amended in significant . . . ways\u201d was a \u201cdeficiency\u201d in Cabinet Office\u2019s continuum argument and meant that the Letters could not be exempted in their entirety (para. 121). This determination was unreasonable because it did not account for the fact that disclosure of early policy priorities not acted on, or changed in significant ways before implementation, would be revealing of the substance of Cabinet deliberations \u2014 whether the decision to abandon or alter the priority was the decision of Cabinet, its committees, or the Premier.\n[56] Finally, the IPC concluded that the Letters were not exempt because even the priorities that would return to Cabinet in the future constituted mere \u201ctopics\u201d or subject matters of potential future deliberations. This conclusion, too, was tainted by a failure to evaluate the Letters in context. The IPC stated that topics or subject matters of Cabinet deliberations will not be protected under s. 12(1) unless their disclosure would permit accurate inferences to be drawn as to the substance of those deliberations (paras. 99-101). However, the IPC did not consider the broader context in discerning whether the Letters met his test.\n[57] As noted, the Letters are communications between the Premier and his Cabinet colleagues relating to policy priorities that are or will be before Cabinet; they cannot be written off as mere \u201ctopics\u201d like general items on an agenda. The Letters reveal the Premier\u2019s initial views on priorities for the new government \u2014 priorities subject to change as the deliberative process unfolds. The communication of the Premier\u2019s initial views to other members of Cabinet are part of Cabinet\u2019s decision-making process, and will be revealing of the substance of Cabinet deliberations when compared against subsequent government action. This context is crucial. And it mitigates the IPC\u2019s concern that exempting priorities contained in mandate letters would result in the exemption \u201cencompass[ing] any record that was not placed or intended to be placed before Cabinet if it contains information that Cabinet Office claims may become the subject of a future Cabinet meeting\u201d (para. 118). The IPC\u2019s characterization of the Letters as mere topics thus rested on a fundamental misapprehension of the factual and legal context, ran counter to the text of the Letters and was unreasonable (see Vavilov, at para. 126).\nC. Conclusion\n[58] In sum, the IPC failed to give meaningful weight to the legal and factual context, including traditions and constitutional conventions concerning Cabinet confidentiality, the role of the Premier, and the fluid, dynamic nature of the Cabinet decision-making process. The IPC\u2019s lack of appreciation for the contextual constraints bearing upon its decision led him to unreasonable interpretive approaches and conclusions. He characterized the Letters as outcomes of the Premier\u2019s deliberative process; found they were mere topics that did not permit accurate inferences as to Cabinet deliberations; and required evidence from Cabinet Office to show that disclosure of the Letters would permit accurate inferences to be drawn as to \u201cactual Cabinet deliberations at a specific Cabinet meeting\u201d (para. 100; see also paras. 116-17). As a result, the IPC\u2019s narrow interpretation of the \u201csubstance of deliberations\u201d was unreasonable. And even on his understanding of the provision, his application of the provision to the Letters was unreasonable. The Letters, along with the representations of Cabinet Office, were clearly sufficient to establish the Letters fell within s. 12(1). The IPC\u2019s decision ordering disclosure must be set aside.\n[59] I would add this. There can be no doubt that, as the CBC submits, public access to government-held information is vital to our democratic process (see R.F., at para. 49, citing John Doe, at para. 41). As this Court noted in Dagg, \u201cwithout an adequate knowledge of what is going on\u201d, neither legislators nor the public can hope to hold government accountable or contribute to the policy-making process (para. 61, quoting D. C. Rowat, \u201cHow Much Administrative Secrecy?\u201d (1965), 31 Can. J. of Econ. and Pol. Sci. 479, at p. 480). Still, FIPPA contemplates that, where engaged, other weighty public interests \u2014 whether national security, personal privacy, or the confidentiality of Cabinet deliberations \u2014 are important enough to outweigh the public\u2019s interest in access to information (see FIPPA, ss. 16, 20 and 21).\n[60] Given the key role Cabinet confidentiality plays in the proper functioning of our Westminster system of government, cases about its proper scope raise important issues for the stability and legitimacy of our democracy. Cabinet confidentiality both enables the proper functioning of responsible government by promoting collective ministerial accountability to the legislature and affords the executive the operational space it needs to function effectively (B.C. Judges, at paras. 65-67 and 96; Carey, at p. 659; see also Criminal Lawyers\u2019 Association 2010, at para. 40). These functions are crucial both to the principle of responsible government and to the separation of powers. Spheres of confidentiality insulated from \u201cundue external interference\u201d are essential to the executive\u2019s ability to \u201cperform its constitutionally-assigned functions\u201d (B.C. Judges, at paras. 66 and 96).\n[61] In approaching assertions of Cabinet confidentiality, administrative decision makers and reviewing courts must be attentive not only to the vital importance of public access to government-held information but also to Cabinet secrecy\u2019s core purpose of enabling effective government, and its underlying rationales of efficiency, candour, and solidarity. They must also be attentive to the dynamic and fluid nature of executive decision making, the function of Cabinet itself and its individual members, the role of the Premier, and Cabinet\u2019s prerogative to determine when and how to announce its decisions.\n[62] Such an approach reflects the opening words of s. 12(1), which mandate a substantive analysis of the requested record and its substance to determine whether disclosure of the record would shed light on Cabinet deliberations, rather than categorically excluding certain types of information from protection. Thus, \u201cdeliberations\u201d understood purposively can include outcomes or decisions of Cabinet\u2019s deliberative process, topics of deliberation, and priorities identified by the Premier, even if they do not ultimately result in government action. And decision makers should always be attentive to what even generally phrased records could reveal about those deliberations to a sophisticated reader when placed in the broader context. The identification and discussion of policy priorities in communications among Cabinet members are more likely to reveal the substance of deliberations, especially when considered alongside other available information, including what Cabinet chooses to do.\n[63] As to remedy in this case, where \u201cthe interplay of text, context and purpose leaves room for a single reasonable interpretation\u201d, it \u201cwould serve no useful purpose\u201d to remit the question to the original decision maker (Vavilov, at para. 124). Here, statutory text, purpose, and context lead inexorably to the conclusion that the Letters are protected from disclosure under s. 12(1)\u2019s opening words. I would not remit the matter to the IPC.\n[64] I would allow the appeal and set aside the order of the IPC, with costs to the appellant payable by the CBC. The private record of proceedings filed with this Court will remain in the Court file but shall be confidential, sealed, and not form part of the public record.\nThe following are the reasons delivered by\nC\u00f4t\u00e9 J. \u2014\nI. Introduction\n[65] I agree with my colleague\u2019s interpretation of s. 12(1) of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.31 (\u201cAct\u201d), and with her conclusion that the mandate letters at issue are exempt from disclosure under that provision. However, I do not agree that \u201cthe same conclusion follows regardless of whether the standard of review is correctness or reasonableness\u201d (para. 16). Indeed, according to Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653, \u201c[r]easonableness review is methodologically distinct from correctness review\u201d (para. 12; Mason v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2023 SCC 21, at para. 58). For the reasons I explain below, I would consider the issue raised in this appeal \u2014 the scope of Cabinet privilege \u2014 to be a general question of law of central importance to the legal system as a whole. I would therefore review the Information and Privacy Commissioner\u2019s decision on a standard of correctness.\nII. Standard of Review\n[66] A reviewing judge\u2019s selection and application of the standard of review are reviewable for correctness (Northern Regional Health Authority v. Horrocks, 2021 SCC 42, at para. 10). As my colleague notes, this Court held in Agraira v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2013 SCC 36, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 559, that an appellate court \u201c\u2018step[s] into the shoes of the lower court\u2019 such that the \u2018appellate court\u2019s focus is, in effect, on the administrative decision\u2019\u201d (para. 46, quoting Merck Frosst Canada Ltd. v. Canada (Health), 2012 SCC 3, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 23, at para. 247 (emphasis deleted)). Our Court is not bound by the standard of review applied in the lower courts, nor is it bound by the parties\u2019 agreement with respect to the applicable standard of review. It performs its own review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision (see Horrocks, at para. 10, citing D. J. M. Brown, with the assistance of D. Fairlie, Civil Appeals (loose\u2011leaf), at \u00a7 14:45).\n[67] Following the teachings of Vavilov, \u201ca reviewing court must be prepared to derogate from the presumption of reasonableness review where respect for the rule of law requires a singular, determinate and final answer to the question before it\u201d (para. 32). The applicable standard of review is an essential question, one that my colleague \u2014 and Lauwers J.A. \u2014 have deemed serious (see Karakatsanis J.\u2019s reasons, at para. 16; 2022 ONCA 74, 160 O.R. (3d) 481, at paras. 106\u20118). Therefore, I cannot agree that \u201cit is not necessary to finally resolve\u201d the question of the applicable standard of review (Karakatsanis J.\u2019s reasons, at para. 16). In my view, the scope of Cabinet privilege falls within the already existing Vavilov category of general questions of law of central importance to the legal system as a whole. This question is thus subject to correctness review. Let me explain.\n[68] In Vavilov, our Court recognized that \u201ccorrectness review is necessary to resolve general questions of law that are of \u2018fundamental importance and broad applicability\u2019, with significant legal consequences for the justice system as a whole or for other institutions of government\u201d (para. 59). Our Court provided specific examples of this kind of question: \u201c. . . when an administrative proceeding will be barred by the doctrines of res judicata and abuse of process (Toronto (City), at para. 15); the scope of the state\u2019s duty of religious neutrality (Saguenay, at para. 49); the appropriateness of limits on solicitor\u2011client privilege (University of Calgary, at para. 20); and the scope of parliamentary privilege (Chagnon, at para. 17)\u201d (para. 60).\n[69] There is no principled reason why Cabinet privilege should be treated any differently \u2014 or is any less important to the legal system as a whole \u2014 than solicitor\u2011client privilege or parliamentary privilege. Writing for the majority of the Court in Chagnon v. Syndicat de la fonction publique et parapublique du Qu\u00e9bec, 2018 SCC 39, [2018] 2 S.C.R. 687, my colleague noted that parliamentary privilege helps preserve the separation of powers and plays an important role in our Westminster model of parliamentary democracy (para. 1). This is echoed in her consideration of the importance of Cabinet privilege in this case, which implicates constitutional traditions and conventions \u201ccrucial to the proper functioning of our democracy\u201d (para. 1; see also paras. 3, 7, 21, 27\u201128 and 60). Indeed, \u201c[j]ust as legislative privilege protects the ability of elected representatives to act on the will of the people\u201d, she states, citing Chagnon, \u201cCabinet confidentiality grants the executive the necessary latitude to govern in an effective, collectively responsible manner\u201d (para. 3).\n[70] The scope of Cabinet privilege is not a question particular to Ontario\u2019s specific regulatory regime (see Vavilov, at para. 61; Canadian National Railway Co. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2014 SCC 40, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 135, at para. 60). As my colleague notes, similar exemptions are found in freedom of information legislation across the country (para. 14). This is evidenced by the Commissioner\u2019s reliance on the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in O\u2019Connor v. Nova Scotia (Minister of the Priorities and Planning Secretariat), 2001 NSCA 132, 197 N.S.R. (2d) 154, in contrast to the different approach taken by the British Columbia Court of Appeal in Aquasource Ltd. v. Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Commissioner (B.C.) (1998), 111 B.C.A.C. 95. Further, courts must determine the scope of Cabinet privilege, including under s. 39 of the Canada Evidence Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. C\u20115 , when dealing with questions of admissibility of evidence. Indeed, my colleague\u2019s interpretation of the purpose of Cabinet privilege is largely based on common law jurisprudence or jurisprudence concerning freedom of information legislation from other jurisdictions (see, e.g., paras. 3 and 31). This confirms the wide\u2011ranging implications of decisions on the nature and scope of Cabinet privilege.\n[71] For these reasons, I would find that the scope of Cabinet privilege is a question of central importance to the legal system as a whole that requires a final and determinate answer. In both Chagnon and Alberta (Information and Privacy Commissioner) v. University of Calgary, 2016 SCC 53, [2016] 2 S.C.R. 555, our Court relied on constitutional dimensions in identifying parliamentary privilege and solicitor\u2011client privilege as questions of law of central importance (see Chagnon, at paras. 1\u20114 and 23\u201125; University of Calgary, at para. 20). As a result, it is unnecessary to decide whether the constitutional overlay in this case also places this question within the separate Vavilov category of constitutional questions (see C.A. reasons, at para. 108).\nIII. A \u201cReasons First\u201d Approach\n[72] As I stated at the beginning of these reasons, I do not agree that the same conclusion follows regardless of whether the standard of review is correctness or reasonableness. It must never be forgotten that \u201c[r]easonableness review is methodologically distinct from correctness review\u201d (Vavilov, at para. 12; Mason, at para. 58). General questions of law of central importance to the legal system as a whole must be reviewed for correctness because courts, when conducting a reasonableness review, cannot provide the single determinate answer that such questions require (Vavilov, at para. 62). Thus, whether the standard of review is correctness or reasonableness will dictate the kind of review that a court is entitled to undertake, namely whether the review will put the \u201creasons first\u201d or whether the court will conduct a de novo analysis (Vavilov, at paras. 83\u201184 and 116).\n[73] What distinguishes reasonableness review from correctness review \u201cis that the court conducting a reasonableness review must focus on the decision the administrative decision maker actually made, including the justification offered for it, and not on the conclusion the court itself would have reached in the administrative decision maker\u2019s place\u201d (Vavilov, at paras. 15 and 83; Mason, at para. 8). A principled approach to reasonableness review is one which puts the administrative decision maker\u2019s reasons first (Vavilov, at para. 83; see Mason, at paras. 58\u201163). \u201cThe role of courts . . . is to review, and they are, at least as a general rule, to refrain from deciding the issue themselves\u201d (Vavilov, at para. 83 (emphasis in original)). Reviewing judges are not to fashion their own yardstick and then use that yardstick to measure what the decision maker did.\n[74] With respect, my colleague fails to apply this methodology in practice. She conducts her own interpretation of s. 12(1), and of the importance and nature of Cabinet privilege, and then measures it against that of the Commissioner. The fact that my colleague would have reached a different conclusion than that of the Commissioner does not make the Commissioner\u2019s decision unreasonable. However, on the basis of my colleague\u2019s reasons, which in my view involve a de facto correctness review, I conclude that the Commissioner\u2019s decision is incorrect.\nIV. Analysis\n[75] I agree with my colleague\u2019s interpretation of the scope of Cabinet privilege, which is the correct interpretation, and with her conclusion that the mandate letters are exempt from disclosure under s. 12(1). The \u201csubstance of deliberations\u201d encompasses Cabinet\u2019s deliberative process from beginning to end, including directives and policy priorities communicated by the Premier to individual ministers. By concluding otherwise, the Commissioner adopted an incorrect interpretation. However, I am concerned that my colleague, in applying a standard of reasonableness, has not afforded the Commissioner\u2019s reasons the deference which, time and again, our Court has said such reasons deserve (see Kanthasamy v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 SCC 61, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 909, at para. 112, per Moldaver J., dissenting; Vavilov, at paras. 13, 15, 83 and 99; Mason, at para. 60).\n[76] My colleague conducts her own interpretation of the scope of Cabinet privilege under s. 12(1) (see paras. 1\u20114, 24\u201133, 36, 46\u201149 and 59\u201162) and uses her conclusions as a yardstick against which to measure the Commissioner\u2019s decision. For example, my colleague refers to three rationales for the convention of Cabinet confidentiality: \u201c. . . candour, solidarity, and efficiency . . .\u201d (para. 30). She finds that the Commissioner considered the first two of these rationales but that he \u201cdid not engage with a core purpose of Cabinet secrecy to promote the efficiency of the collective decision making\u201d or with the ultimate goal of effective government (para. 32). However, this third rationale of \u201cefficiency\u201d, while an important tenet of Cabinet privilege, has not been articulated by our Court as such. As a result, I do not agree that it was unreasonable for the Commissioner to not address a concept that is fully expressed only in scholarly authority (see Karakatsanis J.\u2019s reasons, at paras. 30 and 36, citing Y. Campagnolo, \u201cThe Political Legitimacy of Cabinet Secrecy\u201d (2017), 51 R.J.T.U.M. 51, at p. 68, and Y. Campagnolo, Behind Closed Doors: The Law and Politics of Cabinet Secrecy (2021), at p. 26).\n[77] After her comprehensive discussion of the purpose of Cabinet privilege, my colleague finds that it was \u201ccritical that the [Commissioner] fully consider the function of Cabinet within our system of government, and the bounds of confidentiality necessary for it to discharge that function effectively\u201d (para. 33). In my view, the Commissioner did exactly that, referring to this Court\u2019s consideration of the issue in Babcock v. Canada (Attorney General), 2002 SCC 57, [2002] 3 S.C.R. 3:\nCabinet Office and the appellant each make submissions on the interpretation of the opening words of section 12(1). Both accept that these words should be interpreted in light of their underlying purpose to promote the free and frank discussion among Cabinet members of issues coming before them for decision, without concern for the chilling effect that might result from disclosure of their statements or the material on which they are deliberating. This purpose is reflected in several authorities referred to by the parties, including in the following passage from Babcock v. Canada (Attorney General) cited by Cabinet Office:\nThe British democratic tradition which informs the Canadian tradition has long affirmed the confidentiality of what is said in the Cabinet room, and documents and papers prepared for Cabinet discussions. The reasons are obvious. Those charged with the heavy responsibility of making government decisions must be free to discuss all aspects of the problems that come before them and to express all manner of views, without fear that what they read, say or act on will later be subject to public scrutiny . . . . If Cabinet members\u2019 statements were subject to disclosure, Cabinet members might censor their words, consciously or unconsciously. They might shy away from stating unpopular positions, or from making comments that might be considered politically incorrect.\n(Order PO\u20113973, 2019 CanLII 76037, at para. 86, quoting Babcock, at para. 18)\n[78] At para. 87, the Commissioner justified his reading of Babcock as follows:\nI note that Babcock involved an appeal from the dismissal of an application brought in the course of a civil law suit to compel the production of records that had been certified by the Clerk of the Privy Council to be Cabinet confidences under s. 39 of the Canada Evidence Act . The purpose underlying s. 39 described by the Court in Babcock is not, as Cabinet Office suggests (see paragraph 47 of this Order), to shield Cabinet ministers from questions or comments from members of the public regarding public policy or other matters that are or may become the subject of Cabinet deliberations. Rather, the concern expressed in Babcock is to protect the substance of the deliberations themselves from being revealed by the disclosure of records and exposing those deliberations to public comment and criticism with the potential for adverse effects on Cabinet members\u2019 candour and solidarity. All of the other authorities I have been referred to in this connection support the same view. [Emphasis in original.]\n[79] My colleague says that the Commissioner\u2019s \u201cengagement with the convention of Cabinet confidentiality essentially stopped there\u201d (para. 32). Respectfully, I cannot agree. After his consideration of Babcock, the Commissioner returned to the underlying purposes of the Act and the Cabinet records exemption \u2014 and the function of Cabinet within our system of government \u2014 throughout his analysis (see, e.g., paras. 97, 102 and 105\u20118). He did not \u201cneglect\u201d important arguments made by Cabinet Office (Karakatsanis J.\u2019s reasons, at para. 33). He simply rejected them, and I could not agree more with my colleague when she acknowledges that the Commissioner\u2019s reasons were intelligible and transparent (para. 7). The fact that my colleague disagrees with his interpretation, as do I, does not make it unreasonable.\n[80] In her conclusion, my colleague finds that the interplay of statutory text, context and purpose leads \u201cinexorably\u201d to a single reasonable interpretation of s. 12(1) (para. 63). It may sometimes become clear that relevant factors weigh \u201cso overwhelmingly\u201d in favour of a particular interpretation that it is the only reasonable interpretation of the provision (Vavilov, at para. 124, citing with approval Nova Tube Inc.\/Nova Steel Inc. v. Conares Metal Supply Ltd., 2019 FCA 52).\n[81] However, in this case, there are a number of relevant factors weighing in favour of the Commissioner\u2019s interpretation, many of which my colleague does not consider in her review of his reasoning process. The Commissioner relied on, among other things, the stated purposes of the legislation (see paras. 106\u20118); the principle that \u201cexemptions from the right of access should be limited and specific\u201d (s. 1(a)(ii) of the Act); our Court\u2019s decisions in Babcock and Dagg v. Canada (Minister of Finance), [1997] 2 S.C.R. 403; appellate jurisprudence across the country, notably O\u2019Connor; and a significant body of past administrative decisions. All of these factors lend support to his interpretation.\n[82] As Sossin J.A. noted for the majority of the Court of Appeal, the Ontario Information and Privacy Commissioners\u2019 consistency in their long\u2011standing approach to their governing statute may be taken as an indicator of the reasonableness of the Commissioner\u2019s decision (paras. 49\u201150). I agree. With respect, I have serious concerns with finding a decision that follows decades of administrative jurisprudence \u2014 including O\u2019Connor, which is arguably the leading appellate decision on balancing access to information with Cabinet privilege \u2014 to be unreasonable. Nonetheless, that is the effect of my colleague\u2019s decision in this case.\nV. Summary and Disposition\n[83] While I agree with my colleague\u2019s interpretation of s. 12(1), it is exactly that \u2014 her interpretation. Correctness review, in addition to being required by Vavilov, serves to eliminate my concerns about the lack of deference accorded to the Commissioner. My colleague\u2019s interpretation of s. 12(1) of the Act is correct; the requested letters are exempt from disclosure under that provision. I would therefore allow the appeal and set aside the Commissioner\u2019s decision.\nAPPENDIX\nFreedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.

Parliament enacting statute establishing national standards to protect Indigenous children and affirming Indigenous peoples\u2019 inherent right of self\u2011government in relation to child and family services \u2014 Whether statute is ultra vires Parliament\u2019s jurisdiction under Constitution of Canada \u2014 Constitution Act, 1867, s. 91(24) \u2014 Act respecting First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis children, youth and families, S.C. 2019, c. 24 .\nIn keeping with its commitments relating to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (\u201cDeclaration\u201d), which has been incorporated into Canada\u2019s domestic positive law, and in response to the calls to action made by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, Parliament enacted the Act respecting First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis children, youth and families (\u201cAct\u201d). The Act establishes national standards and provides Indigenous peoples with effective control over their children\u2019s welfare. In ss. 9 to 17, it sets out national standards and principles, which establish a normative framework for the provision of culturally appropriate child and family services that applies across the country. In ss. 8(a) and 18(1), it affirms that the inherent right of self\u2011government recognized and affirmed by s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 includes legislative authority in relation to Indigenous child and family services. As well, the Act establishes a framework within which Indigenous groups, communities or peoples may exercise the jurisdiction affirmed in ss. 8 (a) and 18(1) of the Act. It also specifies how its provisions and the jurisdiction it affirms will interact with other laws. Section 21 incorporates by reference the laws made by Indigenous groups, communities or peoples and gives them the force of law as federal law, and s. 22(3) states for greater certainty that the laws of Indigenous groups, communities or peoples prevail over provincial laws to the extent of any conflict or inconsistency.\nFollowing the Act\u2019s enactment, the Attorney General of Quebec referred the question of its constitutional validity to the Quebec Court of Appeal, asking whether the Act is ultra vires Parliament\u2019s jurisdiction under the Constitution of Canada. The Court of Appeal held that the Act is constitutionally valid except for ss. 21 and 22(3), provisions that give the laws of Indigenous groups, communities or peoples priority over provincial laws. In its view, these provisions exceed Parliament\u2019s jurisdiction because they impermissibly alter Canada\u2019s constitutional architecture. The Attorney General of Quebec and the Attorney General of Canada appeal from the opinion given by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld: The appeal of the Attorney General of Quebec should be dismissed, and the appeal of the Attorney General of Canada should be allowed.\nThe Act as a whole is constitutionally valid. The essential matter addressed by the Act involves protecting the well\u2011being of Indigenous children, youth and families by promoting the delivery of culturally appropriate child and family services and, in so doing, advancing the process of reconciliation with Indigenous peoples. The Act falls squarely within Parliament\u2019s legislative jurisdiction over \u201cIndians, and Lands reserved for the Indians\u201d under s. 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867 .\nParliament embarked on a process of legislative reconciliation by means of an innovative statute. Under this statute, Indigenous governing bodies and the Government of Canada will work together to remedy the harms of the past and create a solid foundation for a renewed nation\u2011to\u2011nation relationship in the area of child and family services, binding the Crown in its dealings with the country\u2019s Indigenous peoples. In this way, Parliament not only immediately meets the commitment made by Canada to implement the Declaration and respond to the call to action of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, but also avoids the uncertainties of constitutional negotiations, the slowness of treaty settlements and the inevitable conflicts associated with court settlements.\nThere are two stages in determining the constitutional validity of a law. At the first stage of the analysis, which involves characterizing the law, a court identifies the purpose and effects of the law in order to determine its main thrust or dominant characteristic. In looking at the purpose of the law, the court considers both intrinsic evidence, such as the law\u2019s preamble, provisions and title, and extrinsic evidence, such as parliamentary debates. In looking at effects, the court must be concerned with legal effects, which flow directly from the provisions of the law itself, and practical effects, which are the side effects flowing from the law\u2019s application. Next, at the second stage of the analysis, the court classifies the law by reference to the heads of power listed in ss. 91 and 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867 .\nGiven that the question referred to the Court of Appeal in this case did not relate to any specific provision of the Act, it is the Act in its entirety that must be first characterized and then classified. To begin with, the pith and substance of the Act flows from an examination of its aims and effects. The pith and substance of the Act, taken in its entirety, is to protect the well\u2011being of Indigenous children, youth and families by promoting the delivery of culturally appropriate child and family services and, in so doing, to advance the process of reconciliation with Indigenous peoples.\nFirst, the intrinsic evidence taken as a whole suggests that the Act\u2019s overarching purpose is to protect the well\u2011being of Indigenous children, youth and families in three interwoven ways: affirming Indigenous communities\u2019 jurisdiction in relation to child and family services; establishing national standards applicable across Canada; and implementing aspects of the Declaration in Canadian law. Second, the purpose identified from the intrinsic evidence is confirmed by the extrinsic evidence. Excerpts from the debates point to the seriousness of the problem of overrepresentation of Indigenous children in child and family services systems. They also clarify how the Act\u2019s fundamental purpose is closely linked to the three aims identified from the intrinsic evidence. Affirming the legislative authority of Indigenous groups, communities and peoples and adopting national standards were viewed as an integral part of implementing aspects of the Declaration. Similarly, the affirmation of legislative authority was also seen to sit comfortably alongside the national standards articulated by Parliament, because Indigenous communities had been participants in formulating the standards and were expected to be participants in implementing them thereafter. The three elements are aims that are mutually reinforcing to protect the well\u2011being of Indigenous children, youth and families.\nThe legal effect of the Act is to establish a uniform scheme for protecting the well\u2011being of Indigenous children, youth and families through the affirmation of Indigenous legislative authority, through national standards and through concrete implementation measures. Practically speaking, the Act may reasonably be expected to protect the well\u2011being of Indigenous children, youth and families and to advance reconciliation with Indigenous peoples. It is reasonable to expect that Indigenous children and families will receive services that are more appropriate to their cultural realities, which will reduce the overrepresentation of Indigenous children in child and family services settings. It is also reasonable to think that the Act will help avoid the waste of time and resources involved in prolonged litigation or negotiations over whether and, if so, to what extent a particular Indigenous group, community or people has jurisdiction in relation to child and family services. The effects of the three interrelated categories of provisions are along the same lines.\nThe provisions affirming the right of self\u2011government have substantive legal effects because of the relationship that exists between legislation and government. The logical corollary of parliamentary sovereignty is that Parliament and the legislatures may bind the Crown through legislation. In conjunction with s. 7 of the Act, which expressly makes the Act binding on the Crown in right of Canada or of a province, Parliament\u2019s binding affirmation about the scope of s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 binds the federal government to the position it has affirmed as a matter of statutory positive law. Parliament undertakes to act as though Indigenous peoples enjoy an inherent right of self\u2011government in relation to child and family services and ensures that the Crown also undertakes to act in accordance with its position by expressly binding the Crown through s. 7. Insofar as the affirmation in s. 18(1) of the Act is found in a law that is constitutionally valid under s. 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867 , Parliament\u2019s affirmation and the Crown\u2019s corollary undertaking have effect. The combined operation of ss. 7, 8(a) and 18(1) of the Act could also have other legal effects by requiring the Crown to act as though the principle of the honour of the Crown is engaged. With regard to practical effects, the affirmation performs the pedagogical or educational function of the law. It may in part be viewed as a step toward changing or adjusting the culture underlying the actions of the federal and provincial governments and may help to inculcate new attitudes or approaches that will further promote a culture of respect for and reconciliation with Indigenous peoples in Canada.\nThe provisions setting out national standards establish a normative framework for the provision of culturally appropriate child and family services that applies across the country. Some of these principles guide the courts\u2019 interpretation of the Act and the administration of the Act by governments. This normative framework is binding on federal and provincial providers of such services, as well as on Indigenous providers in certain cases. Pending the full realization of Indigenous jurisdiction as recognized, many of the national standards laid down may, on a practical level, operate to ensure that the child and family services provided in relation to Indigenous children are culturally appropriate for them and are in their best interests. It may reasonably be expected that the standards that are preventive will lessen the historical propensity of child welfare systems to apprehend Indigenous children and thus that they will help such children remain, where possible, in the environment they are from. As for the standards that come into play after a decision has been made to place a child, they are likely capable of reducing the disproportionate mass placement of Indigenous children outside their families and their communities. Addressing overrepresentation protects the well\u2011being of Indigenous children, youth and families.\nThe provisions setting out concrete implementation measures facilitate the adoption by Indigenous groups, communities or peoples of legislative measures in relation to child and family services. An anticipated practical effect of the Act is to make Canadian law more consistent with the Declaration. The Act also puts in place mechanisms to facilitate and encourage, from a forward\u2011looking perspective, the negotiation of agreements between the Crown and Indigenous communities. It may also be anticipated that the Act\u2019s provisions will advance reconciliation with Indigenous peoples and accelerate certain aspects of this process of reconciliation. It may be expected that Canada will move closer to the goal of establishing and maintaining a mutually respectful relationship between Indigenous and non\u2011Indigenous peoples.\nWith regard to the second stage of the analysis, which involves classifying the Act, Parliament\u2019s jurisdiction under s. 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867 is a sound basis for its enactment. Binding the federal government to the affirmation set out in s. 18(1), establishing national standards and facilitating the implementation of the laws of Indigenous groups, communities or peoples are all measures that are within Parliament\u2019s powers under s. 91(24). The Act does not alter Canada\u2019s constitutional architecture.\nFirst of all, the incidental effects of the national standards on the provinces\u2019 exercise of their powers, including on the work of their public servants, have no impact on the Act\u2019s constitutional validity. The national standards are within federal jurisdiction and can accordingly be binding on the provincial governments. The double aspect doctrine allows for the concurrent application of both federal and provincial legislation in relation to the same fact situation.\nMoreover, nothing prevents Parliament from affirming that Indigenous peoples\u2019 inherent right of self\u2011government recognized and affirmed by s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 includes legislative authority in relation to child and family services. In doing so, Parliament is not unilaterally amending s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 . Rather, it is stating in the Act, through affirmations that are binding on the Crown, its position on the content of this constitutional provision, which the division of powers and the separation of powers do not prevent it from doing. The correctness of its position does not have to be determined to answer the reference question, and the classification of the affirmation under one of the heads of power in the Constitution Act, 1867 must, in the context of this question, be determined by the classification of the Act as a whole.\nIt is also constitutionally open to Parliament to use anticipatory incorporation by reference of provisions adopted by other entities as a legislative drafting technique if Parliament has the legislative jurisdiction required to enact the law it seeks to referentially incorporate. Here, through s. 21, Parliament has validly incorporated by reference the laws, as amended from time to time, of Indigenous groups, communities or peoples in relation to child and family services. Parliament has independent legislative authority to enact such laws pursuant to its jurisdiction over Indians and lands reserved for the Indians under s. 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867 . Therefore, s. 21 of the Act, which is simply an incorporation by reference provision, does not alter the architecture of the Constitution either.\nLastly, it is equally open to Parliament to affirm that the laws of Indigenous groups, communities or peoples will prevail over other laws in the event of a conflict. Section 22(3) of the Act is simply a legislative restatement of the doctrine of federal paramountcy, under which the provisions of a valid federal law prevail over conflicting or inconsistent provisions of a provincial law. Although paramountcy is a judicial doctrine whose scope and application are matters for the courts rather than Parliament or the legislatures, this does not prevent Parliament from declaring its understanding of federal paramountcy. It is ultimately for the courts to adjudicate any alleged conflict between federal law and provincial law and to make any necessary declaration of paramountcy. Therefore, the s. 22(3) paramountcy provision does not alter the architecture of the Constitution.\nCases Cited\nReferred to: Canada (Attorney General) v.

Introduction\n[1] In an order in council made on December 18, 2019, the Government of Quebec gave the province\u2019s Attorney General a mandate to challenge, through a reference to the Court of Appeal, the constitutionality of the Act respecting First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis children, youth and families , S.C. 2019, c. 24 (\u201cAct \u201d), on the ground that it exceeds the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada. Stating that the federal statute [translation] \u201craises fundamental constitutional issues with regard particularly to the division of legislative powers and the constitutional architecture of Canada\u201d, the government referred the following constitutional question to the Quebec Court of Appeal:\n[translation] Is the Act respecting First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis children, youth and families ultra vires the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada under the Constitution of Canada?\n(Order in council 1288\u20112019, (2020) 152 G.O. II, 154, at p. 155)\nIn answer to this question, the Court of Appeal held that the Act is constitutionally valid except for ss. 21 and 22(3), provisions that give the laws of Indigenous groups, communities or peoples priority over provincial laws and, as a result, exceed Parliament\u2019s jurisdiction.\n[2] With the same question before it, this Court is of the opinion that the Act as a whole is constitutionally valid. It falls within Parliament\u2019s legislative jurisdiction over \u201cIndians, and Lands reserved for the Indians\u201d under s. 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867 . Since it concerns relationships within Indigenous families and the control exercised by Indigenous communities over Indigenous children, the impugned Act relates first and foremost to what is called Indigeneity or \u201cIndianness\u201d, that is, Indigenous peoples as Indigenous peoples, which requires its classification under s. 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867 .\n[3] The Act is part of a broader legislative program introduced by Parliament to achieve reconciliation with First Nations, the Inuit and the M\u00e9tis \u201cthrough renewed nation\u2011to\u2011nation, government\u2011to\u2011government and Inuit\u2011Crown relationships based on recognition of rights, respect, cooperation and partnership\u201d (preamble). The framework serving as the foundation for this reconciliation initiative by Parliament is the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, G.A. Res. 61\/295, U.N. Doc. A\/RES\/61\/295 (\u201cDeclaration\u201d or \u201cUNDRIP\u201d), adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 2007. That international instrument provides that \u201cIndigenous peoples, in exercising their right to self\u2011determination, have the right to autonomy or self\u2011government in matters relating to their internal and local affairs\u201d (art. 4). Among the matters dealt with in the Declaration, the provisions setting out \u201cthe right of indigenous families and communities to retain shared responsibility for the upbringing . . . and well\u2011being of their children, consistent with the rights of the child\u201d (preamble; see also art. 14) are of particular relevance to this reference. The Declaration also refers to the right of Indigenous peoples to transmit their histories, languages and cultures to future generations (art. 13(1)), in addition to emphasizing the right not to be subjected to any act of violence, including \u201cforcibly removing children of the group to another group\u201d (art. 7(2)).\n[4] While the Declaration is not binding as a treaty in Canada, it nonetheless provides that, for the purposes of its implementation, states have an obligation to take, \u201cin consultation and cooperation with indigenous peoples, . . . the appropriate measures, including legislative measures, to achieve the ends\u201d of the Declaration (art. 38). Recognized by Parliament as \u201ca universal international human rights instrument with application in Canadian law\u201d, the Declaration has been incorporated into the country\u2019s positive law by the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act , S.C. 2021, c. 14 (\u201cUNDRIP Act \u201d), s. 4(a). This statute recognizes that the Declaration \u201cprovides a framework for reconciliation\u201d (preamble); s. 5 of the same statute requires the Government of Canada, in consultation and cooperation with Indigenous peoples, to take \u201call measures necessary to ensure that the laws of Canada are consistent with the Declaration\u201d. The statute\u2019s preamble expressly provides that the implementation of the Declaration in Canada \u201cmust include concrete measures to address injustices\u201d facing, among others, Indigenous youth and children.\n[5] The Act challenged in this reference is therefore directly in keeping with Canada\u2019s commitment to \u201cimplementing the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples\u201d, as the first recital of its preamble confirms. The preamble to the Act also refers to the calls to action of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada asking governments to \u201cimplement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples as the framework for reconciliation\u201d (Honouring the Truth, Reconciling for the Future: Summary of the Final Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada (2015), at p. 191, call to action No. 43). This echoes one of the calls for justice of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (see Reclaiming Power and Place: The Final Report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (2019), vol. 1b, at pp. 167\u2011218). At the centre of this process of reconciliation, the Act specifically addresses the harm caused to Indigenous children and their families. Its preamble states that \u201cParliament recognizes the legacy of residential schools and the harm, including intergenerational trauma, caused to Indigenous peoples by colonial policies and practices\u201d. In the preamble, Parliament also recognizes the \u201cdisruption\u201d that Indigenous women and girls have experienced in their lives in relation to child services and \u201cthe importance of reuniting Indigenous children with their families and communities from whom they were separated in the context of the provision of child and family services\u201d. To achieve these aims, Parliament affirms the need \u201cto respect the diversity of all Indigenous peoples, including the diversity of their laws\u201d, and \u201cto eliminate the over\u2011representation of Indigenous children in child and family services systems\u201d.\n[6] Parliament embarked on this process of legislative reconciliation in favour of Indigenous children by taking an [translation] \u201cunusual\u201d approach, as the Court of Appeal put it (2022 QCCA 185, at para. 515 (CanLII)). Section 8 sets out the three elements of the Act \u2019s purpose, which are all distinct legal avenues that are combined into an organic whole and have the same reconciliatory purpose: the affirmation for Canada, made by Parliament and binding on the Crown, of the vitality of Indigenous peoples\u2019 legislative authority in relation to child and family services, and the provision of such services on the basis of national standards. First, the Act \u2019s purpose is to \u201caffirm the inherent right of self\u2011government, which includes jurisdiction in relation to child and family services\u201d (s. 8(a)). This affirmation relates to what the Act calls the \u201claws\u201d of Indigenous groups, communities or peoples, and it expresses the idea that these would be the most appropriate laws to govern the situation of Indigenous children and families. Second \u2014 and somewhat in counterpoint to the first purpose mentioned \u2014 the Act sets out \u201cprinciples applicable, on a national level, to the provision of child and family services in relation to Indigenous children\u201d (s. 8(b)). The development by Parliament of national legislative standards to protect Indigenous children is a direct response to the fourth call to action made by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Third, the Act \u2019s purpose is also to \u201ccontribute to the implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples\u201d (s. 8(c)). Again, this purpose responds to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission\u2019s call for the Government of Canada to develop an action plan and other concrete measures to achieve the objectives of the Declaration.\n[7] The three elements of the purpose set out in s. 8 reflect Parliament\u2019s openness to using three different types of legal norms that will be interwoven in this framework for reconciliation to ensure the well\u2011being of Indigenous children: the legislative authority of Indigenous peoples in relation to child and family services, the legislative provisions enacted by Parliament to establish national standards, and the international standards referred to in the Declaration. The metaphor of \u201cbraiding\u201d together these three types of norms has been helpfully proposed to explain how the Declaration should be implemented in Canada, so as to \u201cwork out how state law and Indigenous law could be interwoven, with guidance from international law, to form a single, strong rope\u201d (G. Christie, \u201cIndigenous Legal Orders, Canadian Law and UNDRIP\u201d, in UNDRIP Implementation: Braiding International, Domestic and Indigenous Laws (2017), 48, at p. 48; see also O. Fitzgerald and R. Schwartz, \u201cIntroduction\u201d, ibid., 1, at p. 3).\n[8] Announced in s. 8 and carried out by the Act as a whole, Parliament\u2019s effort to braid this \u201crope\u201d with three strands constitutes the specific framework for reconciliation when it comes to Indigenous child and family services, in the spirit of the Declaration. Canada\u2019s commitment to implementing the Declaration and responding to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission\u2019s call to action is thus met immediately; this avoids the uncertainties of constitutional negotiations, the slowness of treaty settlements entered into on a piecemeal basis by the Crown and each of the various Indigenous communities concerned, and the inevitable conflicts associated with court settlements (on this point, see the explanations given by K. Wilkins, \u201cStrategizing UNDRIP Implementation: Some Fundamentals\u201d, in J. Borrows et al., eds., Braiding Legal Orders: Implementing the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (2019), 177).\n[9] Nothing prevents Parliament from affirming, as it does in s. 18(1) of the Act , that Indigenous peoples have jurisdiction to make laws in relation to child and family services. This \u201caffirmation\u201d, through which Parliament declares that the inherent right of self\u2011government recognized and affirmed by s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 includes \u201clegislative authority\u201d in relation to Indigenous child and family services, certainly represents a legislative commitment that Parliament must honour in its conduct toward Indigenous peoples. Furthermore, nothing prevents Parliament from declaring, as it does in s. 7, that this commitment, like the others made toward Indigenous peoples in the Act for the protection of children, \u201cis binding\u201d on His Majesty. This is of signal importance, because no enactment is binding on His Majesty or affects His Majesty or His Majesty\u2019s rights or prerogatives in any manner, except as mentioned or referred to in the enactment, as is the case with s. 7 (see Interpretation Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. I\u201121, s. 17 ; Wilkins, at p. 184, citing Canada (Attorney General) v. Thouin, 2017 SCC 46, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 184, at paras. 1 and 19\u201121). It is equally open to Parliament to affirm that the laws of Indigenous groups, communities or peoples will prevail over other laws in the event of a conflict. Moreover, it is clear that issues relating to the scope of s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 and to the application of the doctrine of federal paramountcy are ultimately matters for the courts under Canadian law, not the legislative branch, since they raise questions of constitutional interpretation. Plainly, Parliament may not, by enacting an ordinary statute, amend the Constitution, including the rights protected by s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 , or alter the division of powers in the Constitution Act, 1867 . That being said, Parliament\u2019s jurisdiction under s. 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867 is a sound basis for enacting federal legislation that contains such affirmations and imposes such obligations on His Majesty, just as it is a sound basis for imposing national standards for child and family services for Indigenous children (s. 8b)). Contrary to what the Attorney General of Quebec argues, this in no way undermines the \u201cconstitutional architecture\u201d of Canada.\nII. Context\n[10] For most of Canada\u2019s history, lawmakers have wrongly employed a policy of assimilation aimed at \u201clifting [Indigenous peoples] out of [their] condition of tutelage and dependence, and . . . prepar[ing] [them] for a higher civilization\u201d (Annual Report of the Department of the Interior for the Year Ended 30th June, 1876, reproduced in Sessional Papers, vol. X, No. 7, 4th Sess., 3rd Parl., 1877, No. 11, at p. xiv, quoted in Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, vol. 1, Looking Forward, Looking Back (1996), at p. 277; see also The Final Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, vol. 1, Canada\u2019s Residential Schools: The History, Part 1 \u2014 Origins to 1939 (2015), at pp. 107\u20119). This history, which includes the residential schools policy, the \u201cSixties Scoop\u201d and the harm and intergenerational trauma that resulted therefrom, is detailed in several reports published in recent decades (see, e.g., The Final Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, vol. 1, Canada\u2019s Residential Schools: The History, Part 1 \u2014 Origins to 1939 and The History, Part 2 \u2014 1939 to 2000 (2015); Reclaiming Power and Place: The Final Report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (2019), vol. 1a).\n[11] The effects of these government policies are still being felt today. \u201cIn tandem with the residential school system, the child welfare system . . . became a site of assimilation and colonization by forcibly removing children from their homes and placing them with non\u2011Indigenous families\u201d (Final Report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, vol. 1a, at p. 282). The statistics on the overrepresentation of Indigenous children in child welfare systems are quite simply staggering. According to 2016 census data, about 7.7 percent of children under the age of 15 in Canada are Indigenous, but they represent 52.2 percent of children in foster care in private homes (Indigenous Services Canada, The Government of Canada announces the coming into force of an Act respecting First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis children, youth and families, September 10, 2019 (online)).\n[12] Over time, Canada has abandoned its policy of assimilation in favour of a policy of reconciliation. Parliament established the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada and gave it a dual mandate to \u201creveal to Canadians the complex truth about the history and the ongoing legacy of the church\u2011run residential schools\u201d and to \u201cguide and inspire a process of truth and healing, leading toward reconciliation within Aboriginal families, and between Aboriginal peoples and non\u2011Aboriginal communities, churches, governments, and Canadians generally\u201d (Honouring the Truth, Reconciling for the Future, at p. 23).\n[13] The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada issued several calls to action relating to the welfare of Indigenous children. Notably, in call to action No. 4, the Commission\ncall[s] upon the federal government to enact Aboriginal child\u2011welfare legislation that establishes national standards for Aboriginal child apprehension and custody cases and includes principles that:\ni. Affirm the right of Aboriginal governments to establish and maintain their own child\u2011welfare agencies.\nii. Require all child\u2011welfare agencies and courts to take the residential school legacy into account in their decision making.\niii. Establish, as an important priority, a requirement that placements of Aboriginal children into temporary and permanent care be culturally appropriate.\n(Honouring the Truth, Reconciling for the Future, at pp. 143\u201144)\nThe Commission also called upon governments to adopt and implement the UNDRIP in its entirety as a \u201cframework for reconciliation\u201d (Honouring the Truth, Reconciling for the Future, at pp. 187\u201191, calls to action Nos. 43\u201144).\n[14] In 2016, Canada made a commitment internationally to support the UNDRIP \u201cwithout qualification\u201d and to implement it (C. Bennett, Speech delivered at the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, New York, May 10, 2016 (online)). The UNDRIP gives particular recognition to \u201cthe right of indigenous families and communities to retain shared responsibility for the upbringing, training, education and well\u2011being of their children, consistent with the rights of the child\u201d (preamble). It states in arts. 3 and 4, respectively, that Indigenous peoples have the right to \u201cfreely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development\u201d, as well as the right, in exercising their right to self\u2011determination, \u201cto autonomy or self\u2011government in matters relating to their internal and local affairs\u201d. Article 7(2) of the UNDRIP states that \u201cIndigenous peoples have the collective right to live in freedom, peace and security as distinct peoples and shall not be subjected to any act of genocide or any other act of violence, including forcibly removing children of the group to another group.\u201d Article 13(1) of the UNDRIP recognizes that Indigenous peoples have \u201cthe right to revitalize, use, develop and transmit to future generations their histories, languages, oral traditions, philosophies, writing systems and literatures\u201d, a right that is reinforced by the correlative duty of states to take measures to ensure that it is protected (art. 13(2)). Further, art. 38 of the UNDRIP provides that \u201cStates in consultation and cooperation with indigenous peoples, shall take the appropriate measures, including legislative measures, to achieve the ends of th[e] Declaration.\u201d\n[15] In 2021, Parliament enacted the UNDRIP Act , s. 4(a) of which affirms the Declaration \u201cas a universal international human rights instrument with application in Canadian law\u201d. It is therefore through this Act of Parliament that the Declaration is incorporated into the country\u2019s domestic positive law. In s. 4(b), the statute states that its purpose is also to \u201cprovide a framework for the Government of Canada\u2019s implementation of the Declaration\u201d. In s. 5, it provides that the \u201cGovernment of Canada must, in consultation and cooperation with Indigenous peoples, take all measures necessary to ensure that the laws of Canada are consistent with the Declaration\u201d. Further, s. 6(2)(b) provides that the minister responsible for the statute must prepare and implement an action plan, which must include \u201cmeasures related to monitoring, oversight, recourse or remedy or other accountability measures with respect to the implementation of the Declaration\u201d. More generally, in the preamble to this statute, Parliament emphasized the Government of Canada\u2019s commitment to \u201ctaking effective measures \u2014 including legislative, policy and administrative measures \u2014 at the national and international level, in consultation and cooperation with Indigenous peoples, to achieve the objectives of the Declaration\u201d. Parliament also referred in the preamble to the call for it to implement the UNDRIP made by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in its calls to action and by the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls in its calls for justice.\n[16] The call for lawmakers to pass legislation affirming self\u2011government for Indigenous peoples and facilitating the exercise of these rights has been echoed in other contexts. Internationally, for example, the importance of such measures has been repeatedly pointed out (see, e.g., UNDRIP, art. 38; United Nations, General Assembly, Report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people, S. James Anaya, U.N. Doc. A\/HRC\/9\/9, August 11, 2008; United Nations, Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Statement upon conclusion of the visit to Canada by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples, James Anaya, October 15, 2013 (online)).\n[17] Taking legislative measures of this kind has been described as being part of a process that some have termed \u201clegislative reconciliation\u201d, that is, the enactment of legislation \u201cto respect, promote, protect, and accommodate inherent rights through mechanisms or frameworks elaborated upon within the statute\u201d (see N. S. W. Metallic, \u201cAboriginal Rights, Legislative Reconciliation, and Constitutionalism\u201d (2023), 27:2 Rev. Const. Stud. 1, at p. 5). In other words, legislation of this kind does not purport to be the source of the rights in question, but rather proceeds on the premise that these rights exist. Similar initiatives have also been described as \u201crecognition legislation\u201d, including in the Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, vol. 2, Restructuring the Relationship (1996), at p. 314 (see also S. Grammond, \u201cRecognizing Indigenous Law: A Conceptual Framework\u201d (2022), 100 Can. Bar Rev. 1, at pp. 20\u201121).\n[18] Certain legislative initiatives predicated on the recognition of Indigenous rights have been adopted. For instance, the Indigenous Languages Act , S.C. 2019, c. 23 , begins by stating in its preamble that \u201cthe recognition and implementation of rights related to Indigenous languages are at the core of reconciliation with Indigenous peoples and are fundamental to shaping the country, particularly in light of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada\u2019s Calls to Action\u201d.\nIII. Overview of the Act\n[19] In keeping with its commitments relating to the UNDRIP, Parliament decided to enact innovative legislation that establishes national standards and provides Indigenous peoples with effective control over their children\u2019s welfare. From the outset, Parliament recognizes in the Act \u2019s preamble itself that a comprehensive reform of Indigenous child and family services is needed to address the overrepresentation of children in family services systems. This reform, which includes an affirmation of Indigenous peoples\u2019 jurisdiction in relation to such services, will be an important step on the path to reconciliation. The purpose of the Act includes affirming the inherent right of self\u2011government (s. 8(a)) and, as s. 9(2) specifies, the Act is to be interpreted in accordance with the principle of \u201ccultural continuity\u201d for Indigenous peoples. Parliament places the child at the centre of this idea of cultural continuity for obvious reasons: ensuring that Indigenous peoples themselves exercise control over child services will help to avoid the intergenerational trauma and assimilation policies of the past (see the preamble). The fact that a child resides with members of his or her family and community strengthens the transmission of Indigenous culture and often promotes the child\u2019s best interests (s. 9(2)). Of course, a legislative affirmation regarding the interpretation to be given to a constitutional norm is not binding on the courts.\n[20] The collaboration between Indigenous peoples and government bodies that led to the enactment of the Act , which contains express declaratory provisions, highlights Parliament\u2019s firm commitment to establishing a new legislative structure for reconciliation. Under this framework created by the Act , Indigenous governing bodies and the Government of Canada will work together to remedy the harms of the past and create a solid foundation for a renewed nation\u2011to\u2011nation relationship in the area of child and family services, binding the Crown in its dealings with the country\u2019s Indigenous peoples.\n[21] The Act therefore represents one more step toward reconciliation. Indeed, its preamble expressly acknowledges much of the context set out above. It states that the Act is intended to \u201cimplemen[t] the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples\u201d, to recognize \u201cthe legacy of residential schools and the harm, including intergenerational trauma, caused to Indigenous peoples by colonial policies and practices\u201d, and to respond to the calls to action made by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada.\n[22] Section 8 states that the purpose of the Act is to\n(a) affirm the inherent right of self\u2011government, which includes jurisdiction in relation to child and family services;\n(b) set out principles applicable, on a national level, to the provision of child and family services in relation to Indigenous children; and\n(c) contribute to the implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.\nThese three interwoven elements of the purpose can be found in various places in the Act , which \u201cis binding on Her Majesty in right of Canada or of a province\u201d (s. 7).\n[23] For instance, the affirmation of the inherent right of self\u2011government made in s. 8(a) also appears in s. 18(1):\nAffirmation\n18 (1) The inherent right of self\u2011government recognized and affirmed by section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 includes jurisdiction in relation to child and family services, including legislative authority in relation to those services and authority to administer and enforce laws made under that legislative authority.\n[24] This affirmation is also reflected in s. 2 of the Act , which requires that the Act be interpreted in a way that upholds all rights under s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 . Indeed, Parliament states in s. 2 that the Act \u201cis to be construed as upholding the rights of Indigenous peoples recognized and affirmed by section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 , and not as abrogating or derogating from them\u201d.\n[25] Further, the \u201cprinciples applicable, on a national level,\u201d referenced in s. 8(b) find expression in ss. 9 to 17, which establish national standards for the provision of child and family services in relation to Indigenous children. Section 9 states that the Act \u201cis to be interpreted and administered in accordance with the principle of the best interests of the child\u201d and emphasizes the principles of cultural continuity and substantive equality. Section 10(3) sets out the factors to be considered in determining the best interests of an Indigenous child. Section 11 provides that child and family services are to be provided in a manner that takes into account a child\u2019s needs and culture, allows the child to know his or her family origins, and promotes substantive equality. Section 12(1) requires a service provider to give notice to a child\u2019s parent and the relevant Indigenous governing body before taking any significant measure in relation to the child. Section 13 establishes the right of the parents, the care provider and the Indigenous governing body to make representations in the context \u201cof a civil proceeding in respect of the provision of child and family services in relation to an Indigenous child\u201d. Section 14 prioritizes preventive care, including prenatal services. Section 15 prohibits apprehending an Indigenous child \u201csolely on the basis of his or her socio\u2011economic conditions\u201d. Sections 16 and 17 establish an order of priority for the placement of a child, \u201cto the extent that it is consistent with the best interests of the child\u201d.\n[26] As well, the Act establishes a framework within which Indigenous groups, communities or peoples may exercise the jurisdiction affirmed in ss. 8(a) and 18(1). The Act provides that Indigenous governing bodies intending to exercise such jurisdiction may give notice to and request to enter into coordination agreements with the responsible federal minister and the provincial governments concerned (s. 20(1) and (2)). When they enter into such an agreement, or when they make reasonable efforts to do so during a period of one year after their request, their \u201claw, as amended from time to time . . . also has, during the period that the law is in force, the force of law as federal law\u201d (s. 21(1)). The provisions respecting child and family services in the laws made by Indigenous groups, communities or peoples apply \u201cin relation to an Indigenous child except if the application of the provision[s] would be contrary to the best interests of the child\u201d (s. 23).\n[27] The Act also specifies how its provisions and the jurisdiction it affirms will interact with other laws. First, s. 19 states that \u201c[t]he Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms applies to an Indigenous governing body in the exercise of jurisdiction in relation to child and family services on behalf of an Indigenous group, community or people.\u201d Second, s. 3 stipulates that the provisions of existing treaties or self\u2011government agreements that contain provisions respecting child and family services prevail over the Act \u2019s provisions to the extent of any conflict or inconsistency. Third, ss. 21(3) and 22(1) state that the only federal legislative provisions that prevail over the laws of Indigenous groups, communities or peoples made as a result of entering into a coordination agreement or after a year of reasonable efforts to enter into such an agreement are ss. 10 to 15 of the Act and the provisions of the Canadian Human Rights Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. H\u20116 . Fourth, with respect to provincial laws, s. 22(3) states, \u201c[f]or greater certainty\u201d, that the laws of Indigenous groups, communities or peoples made pursuant to a coordination agreement or after a year of reasonable efforts to enter into such an agreement prevail over provincial laws to the extent of any conflict or inconsistency. Where there is no conflict or inconsistency, however, the Act provides that nothing in it affects the application of any provincial statute or regulation (s. 4). Finally, s. 24(1) of the Act sets out how to resolve cases in which there is a conflict or inconsistency, in relation to an Indigenous child, between the laws of two Indigenous groups, communities or peoples.\nIV. The Reference Question\n[28] Following the Act\u2019s enactment, the Attorney General of Quebec referred the following question to the Quebec Court of Appeal:\nIs the Act respecting First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis children, youth and families ultra vires the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada under the Constitution of Canada?\n[29] This question involves determining whether Parliament had jurisdiction to enact the Act . To answer this question, we must also address the objections raised to the effect that the Act alters Canada\u2019s constitutional architecture. One of the recitals in the order in council concerning the reference mentions this specific aspect:\n[translation] Whereas this federal statute raises fundamental constitutional issues with regard particularly to the division of legislative powers and the constitutional architecture of Canada;\n(Order in council 1288\u20112019, at p. 154)\nV. Opinion of the Quebec Court of Appeal (2022 QCCA 185)\n[30] In answer to the question of whether the Act is ultra vires Parliament, the Court of Appeal found that it is not, except for ss. 21 and 22(3) of the Act , which impermissibly alter Canada\u2019s constitutional architecture.\n[31] In its analysis, the Court of Appeal divided the Act into two parts: [translation] \u201cPart I\u201d, including the establishment of national standards, and \u201cPart II\u201d, including the affirmation of jurisdiction and the provisions relating to incorporation by reference and paramountcy.\n[32] The Court of Appeal began by observing that [translation] \u201c[t]his legislative initiative was evidently guided by the [UNDRIP]\u201d (para. 27). In light of this relationship along with the purpose and effects of the Act , the court concluded that the pith and substance of the Act is [translation] \u201cto protect and ensure the well\u2011being of Aboriginal children, families and peoples by promoting culturally appropriate child services, with the aim of putting an end to the overrepresentation of Aboriginal children in child services systems\u201d (para. 333). As a result, the Act [translation] \u201cis a valid exercise of federal jurisdiction over Aboriginal peoples\u201d (para. 355). This is so despite the Act \u2019s potential incidental effects on the work of provincial public servants and despite the provinces\u2019 previous legislative initiatives in this area (paras. 347\u201149).\n[33] The Court of Appeal held that Parliament [translation] \u201ccan regulate and delineate Aboriginal rights\u201d and \u201cdefine the scope of those rights\u201d (para. 448) and that this does not amount to amending the Constitution, because it is the courts that will have the last word in this regard. In its view, all of what it called \u201cPart II\u201d would be invalid if the affirmation in s. 18(1) were incorrect. This part [translation] \u201cis based solely on the premise that s. 35 recognizes and affirms the right to Aboriginal self\u2011government\u201d (para. 437). [translation] \u201cIf s. 35 does not include this right, then Part II of the Act must be declared unconstitutional as a whole, because the premise on which it is based is invalid\u201d (para. 453). The Court of Appeal therefore found that it had to consider whether the right of self\u2011government in relation to child and family services is an Aboriginal right recognized and affirmed by s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 .\n[34] The Court of Appeal stated that the test from R. v. Van der Peet, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 507, should be adapted in the context of a claimed generic right of self\u2011government. It reasoned that the claimed Aboriginal right of self\u2011government includes at least the right of self\u2011regulation in relation to child and family services (paras. 486\u201194). [translation] \u201c[I]t is a generic right that extends to all Aboriginal peoples\u201d (para. 494).\n[35] The Court of Appeal then held that ss. 21 and 22(3) were invalid because they would have the effect of unilaterally amending the Constitution by giving the laws of Indigenous groups, communities or peoples priority over provincial laws (paras. 538, 541 and 543\u201144). The court explained that laws made in reliance on the s. 35 right of self\u2011government [translation] \u201care not federal laws enacted under s. 91 and subject to the doctrine of federal paramountcy, but rather Aboriginal laws that serve Aboriginal imperatives\u201d (para. 540).\nVI. Appeals\n[36] The Attorney General of Quebec and the Attorney General of Canada appeal from the opinion given by the Quebec Court of Appeal. The Attorney General of Quebec argues that the entire Act is ultra vires Parliament because it impermissibly intrudes on certain areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction, especially the province\u2019s power to direct its own agencies, and because the Act represents an attempt to unilaterally amend the Constitution. The Attorney General of Canada counters that the Act constitutes a valid exercise of Parliament\u2019s legislative authority under s. 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867 . He also submits that the incorporation by reference and paramountcy provisions are not problematic because incorporation by reference is a long\u2011accepted legislative technique and the paramountcy provision merely states for greater certainty what constitutional law already provides.\nVII. Analysis\n[37] There are two stages in determining the constitutional validity of a law: identifying its pith and substance and then classifying it by reference to the heads of power listed in ss. 91 and 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867 (Murray\u2011Hall v. Quebec (Attorney General), 2023 SCC 10, at para. 22, citing Reference re Genetic Non\u2011Discrimination Act, 2020 SCC 17, [2020] 2 S.C.R. 283, at para. 26).\n[38] The following analysis concerns the Act as a whole. This means that, in determining the Act \u2019s constitutional validity, we are not distinguishing between what the attorneys general have called Part I (ss. 1 to 17, except s. 8(a)) and Part II (ss. 8(a) and 18 to 26). Given that the question referred to the Quebec Court of Appeal did not relate to any specific provision of the Act , it is therefore the Act in its entirety that must be first characterized and then classified.\nA. Characterization: What Is the Pith and Substance of the Act?\n(1) Analytical Framework\n[39] At the first stage of the analysis, which involves characterizing the law, a court identifies the purpose and effects of the law in order to determine its main thrust or dominant characteristic (References re Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, 2021 SCC 11 (\u201cGreenhouse Gas References\u201d), at para. 51, citing Desgagn\u00e9s Transport Inc. v. W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 Canada Inc., 2019 SCC 58, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 228, at para. 31). In looking at the purpose of the law, the court considers both intrinsic evidence, such as the law\u2019s preamble and provisions, and extrinsic evidence, such as Hansard and the minutes of parliamentary committees (Greenhouse Gas References, at para. 51, citing Kitkatla Band v. British Columbia (Minister of Small Business, Tourism and Culture), 2002 SCC 31, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 146, at para. 53, and Canadian Western Bank v. Alberta, 2007 SCC 22, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 27). In looking at effects, the court is concerned with legal effects, which flow directly from the provisions of the law itself, and practical effects, which are the \u201cside\u201d effects flowing from the law\u2019s application (Greenhouse Gas References, at para. 51, citing Kitkatla, at para. 54, and R. v. Morgentaler, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 463, at p. 480).\n[40] While it is helpful to consider the context in which the law was enacted, the law itself must remain at the centre of the characterization exercise. As Kasirer J. noted in Reference re Genetic Non\u2011Discrimination Act, \u201cthe court\u2019s inquiry into pith and substance must be anchored in the text of the impugned legislation\u201d (para. 165). Moreover, \u201cthe pith and substance of a challenged statute or provision should capture the law\u2019s essential character in terms that are as precise as the law will allow\u201d (Greenhouse Gas References, at para. 52, citing Reference re Genetic Non\u2011Discrimination Act, at para. 32).\n(2) Pith and Substance of the Act\n[41] In our view, the Act protects the well\u2011being of Indigenous children, youth and families by promoting the delivery of culturally appropriate child and family services and, in so doing, advances the process of reconciliation with Indigenous peoples. This is the Act \u2019s pith and substance, which flows from the purpose and effects of this legislation.\n(a) Purpose of the Act\n(i) Intrinsic Evidence\n[42] A law\u2019s preamble and purpose clauses can be considered to determine the purpose of the law in question (Greenhouse Gas References, at paras. 51 and 59). Here, s. 8 sets out the three elements of the Act \u2019s purpose, which the Act \u2019s preamble assists in interpreting.\n[43] First, the Act \u2019s purpose is to \u201caffirm the inherent right of self\u2011government, which includes jurisdiction in relation to child and family services\u201d (s. 8(a)). The preamble places this purpose in a broader context, stating that \u201cParliament affirms the right to self\u2011determination of Indigenous peoples, including the inherent right of self\u2011government, which includes jurisdiction in relation to child and family services\u201d. This affirmation is repeated in the substantive provisions of the Act (s. 18(1) ) and grounds Parliament\u2019s recognition of the laws of Indigenous groups, communities or peoples. To this end, the Act seeks \u201cto achiev[e] reconciliation with First Nations, the Inuit and the M\u00e9tis through renewed nation\u2011to\u2011nation, government\u2011to\u2011government and Inuit\u2011Crown relationships based on recognition of rights, respect, cooperation and partnership\u201d (preamble).\n[44] Second, the Act \u2019s purpose is to set out national standards for the provision of child and family services in the Indigenous context (s. 8(b) and preamble) in order to ensure respect for the dignity of Indigenous children. The preamble indeed emphasizes the importance of this step, noting that \u201cthe Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada\u2019s Calls to Action calls for the federal, provincial and Indigenous governments to work together with respect to the welfare of Indigenous children and calls for the enactment of federal legislation that establishes national standards for the welfare of Indigenous children\u201d. The preamble\u2019s reference to call to action No. 4 suggests that Parliament\u2019s intention with respect to the national standards was not to impose them unilaterally, without regard for the perspective of Indigenous groups, communities or peoples. Indeed, the preamble sets out the Government of Canada\u2019s commitment to \u201cengaging with Indigenous peoples and provincial governments to support a comprehensive reform of child and family services that are provided in relation to Indigenous children\u201d. The Act therefore supports the view that the intention is for the national standards to be developed collaboratively and applied across the country to \u201chelp ensure that there are no gaps in the services that are provided in relation to [Indigenous children], whether they reside on a reserve or not\u201d (preamble).\n[45] Third, the Act \u2019s purpose is to \u201ccontribute to the implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples\u201d (s. 8(c)). Parliament chose to give particular importance to this aim by beginning the Act \u2019s preamble with a reference to the Government of Canada\u2019s commitment to implementing aspects of the UNDRIP. The text of the Act also suggests that Parliament intended the Act as a whole to be a concrete legislative measure to implement the UNDRIP in Canadian law.\n[46] Moreover, this Court has stated that \u201c[a] law\u2019s title . . . is an important form of intrinsic evidence\u201d (Reference re Genetic Non\u2011Discrimination Act, at para. 35; see also Greenhouse Gas References, at para. 58). In this case, the title \u201cAn Act respecting First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis children, youth and families \u201d confirms that Indigenous children, youth and families are the Act \u2019s main concern. The preamble sets out a large number of aims with respect to these persons: to \u201creunit[e] Indigenous children with their families and communities\u201d, to \u201caddress [their] needs\u201d in order to ensure that \u201cthere are no gaps in the services that are provided in relation to them\u201d, to \u201celiminate [their] over\u2011representation . . . in child and family services systems\u201d, and to \u201csupport [their] dignity and well\u2011being . . . as well as the achievement of their full potential\u201d. These aims all reflect the Act \u2019s fundamental purpose, which is to promote the well\u2011being of Indigenous children, youth and families.\n[47] Taken as a whole, the intrinsic evidence suggests that the purpose of the Act is to protect the well\u2011being of Indigenous children, youth and families. This overarching purpose has three elements: affirming Indigenous communities\u2019 jurisdiction in relation to child and family services; establishing national standards applicable across Canada; and implementing aspects of the UNDRIP in Canadian law. As the extrinsic evidence of Parliament\u2019s intention makes plain, however, these three elements are interwoven.\n(ii) Extrinsic Evidence\n[48] The purpose identified from the intrinsic evidence is confirmed by the extrinsic evidence, including various excerpts from Hansard. These excerpts first point to the seriousness of the problem of overrepresentation of Indigenous children in child and family services systems, a problem that many described as a \u201chumanitarian crisis\u201d during the debates (House of Commons Debates, vol. 148, No. 392, 1st Sess., 42nd Parl., March 19, 2019, at p. 26135 (Hon. S. O\u2019Regan); House of Commons Debates, vol. 148, No. 409, 1st Sess., 42nd Parl., May 3, 2019, at pp. 27325 (D. Vandal) and 27350 (A. Virani)). Indeed, at second reading of Bill C\u201192, the Minister of Indigenous Services, referring to the fact that Indigenous children make up 52 percent of those in care in child welfare systems even though less than 8 percent of Canada\u2019s population is Indigenous, said that this \u201cstatistic is horrifying [and] appalling\u201d (House of Commons Debates, March 19, 2019, at p. 26135). We noted above that the preamble to the Act reflects a commitment to comprehensively reviewing the approach previously taken to child welfare. The Minister made comments to the same effect, noting that the \u201cwestern and urban model\u201d must be reconsidered, for otherwise \u201cwe will continue to cause serious harm to individuals and communities\u201d (ibid.). In this respect, the extrinsic evidence confirms that the Act \u2019s purpose is fundamentally directed at protecting the well\u2011being of Indigenous children, youth and families.\n[49] The debates also clarify how the fundamental purpose of the Act \u2014 promoting the well\u2011being of Indigenous children, youth and families \u2014 is closely linked to the three aims identified from the intrinsic evidence.\n[50] First, the Minister of Indigenous Services stated that the bill was intended to provide a \u201cclear\u201d affirmation of \u201cthe inherent right of first nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis to exercise their own jurisdiction in relation to child and family services\u201d (House of Commons Debates, vol. 148, No. 425, 1st Sess., 42nd Parl., June 3, 2019, at p. 28448). He emphasized the importance of this affirmation, saying:\nNow is the time to follow through on our promises to indigenous children, families and communities. Our promise is that the same old broken system that needlessly separates so many children from their families, that removes them from their culture, that cuts them off from their land and their language, not be allowed to continue and that we affirm and recognize that indigenous families know what is best for indigenous children.\n. . .\n. . . [Indigenous peoples] have always had this right, and now we are recognizing and affirming it. We are making it a reality and allowing them the opportunity to come up with effective, local, grassroots solutions to those problems. We know that they will be more effective. [Emphasis added.]\n(ibid., at pp. 28449\u201150)\n[51] Second, with respect to the national standards sought by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in its call to action No. 4, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Indigenous Services noted that the standards are meant to ensure that \u201call services for first nation, Inuit and M\u00e9tis children are provided in a manner that takes into account the individual child\u2019s needs, including the need to be raised with a strong connection to the child\u2019s family, culture, language and community\u201d (House of Commons Debates, May 3, 2019, at p. 27324). He also emphasized the fact that not only were the standards articulated during an extensive engagement process involving some 2,000 individuals and community, regional and national organizations, but they could be \u201cbuilt upon and adapted by [Indigenous] communities to meet their unique cultures as well as their unique traditions\u201d (ibid.).\n[52] Third, the extrinsic evidence also confirms that the Act was intended to implement certain aspects of the UNDRIP in Canadian law and that this implementation was seen as closely linked to both the affirmation of Indigenous peoples\u2019 right of self\u2011government and the establishment of national standards for the provision of child and family services in relation to Indigenous children. For example, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada and to the Minister of Democratic Institutions stated that the concept of \u201cinherent jurisdiction\u201d is \u201cfundamental to . . . UNDRIP\u201d (House of Commons Debates, May 3, 2019, at p. 27353). Likewise, at third reading of the bill, Member of Parliament Mike Bossio noted that the national standards are themselves \u201caligned with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples\u201d (House of Commons Debates, June 3, 2019, at p. 28459).\n[53] The extrinsic evidence thus reveals that the various elements of the Act \u2019s purpose were considered to be interwoven. Affirming the legislative authority of Indigenous groups, communities and peoples and adopting national standards were viewed as an integral part of implementing aspects of the UNDRIP. Similarly, the affirmation of Indigenous legislative authority was also seen to sit comfortably alongside the national standards articulated by Parliament, because Indigenous communities had been participants in formulating the standards and were expected to be participants in implementing them thereafter. Thus, each of the three elements of the Act \u2019s purpose set out in s. 8 is bound up in the other two. They are aims that are mutually reinforcing to protect the well\u2011being of Indigenous children, youth and families. The section that follows examines the legal and practical effects of the Act in the pursuit of these interwoven aims.\n(b) Effects of the Act\n(i) Legal Effects\n[54] A law\u2019s legal effects are discerned from its provisions by asking \u201chow the legislation as a whole affects the rights and liabilities of those subject to its terms\u201d (Greenhouse Gas References, at para. 70, quoting Morgentaler, at p. 482).\n[55] In this case, the Act \u2019s provisions may be loosely grouped into three categories, which are necessarily interrelated: (1) provisions affirming the right of self\u2011government; (2) provisions establishing national standards; and (3) provisions setting out concrete implementation measures. Taken together, the provisions in these three categories create a uniform national scheme for protecting the well\u2011being of Indigenous children, youth and families.\n1. Provisions Affirming the Right of Self\u2011Government\n[56] Sections 8(a) and 18(1) contain affirmations about the scope of s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 that are binding on the Crown (s. 7). These affirmations have substantive legal effects. This is because of certain basic postulates concerning the relationship that exists between legislation and government, which we will set out below before turning to how these postulates inform the interpretation of the Act \u2019s legal effects.\n[57] One fundamental postulate of our constitutional architecture is parliamentary sovereignty (see, e.g., Reference re Pan\u2011Canadian Securities Regulation, 2018 SCC 48, [2018] 3 S.C.R. 189, at paras. 56\u201158). This general principle of parliamentary sovereignty in Canada is explained as follows by Professors Hogg and Wright: \u201cNot only may the Parliament or a Legislature, acting within its allotted sphere of competence, make any law it chooses, it may repeal any of its earlier laws\u201d (P. W. Hogg and W. K. Wright, Constitutional Law of Canada (5th ed. Supp.), at \u00a7 12:9 (footnote omitted)). The logical corollary of this postulate is that Parliament and the legislatures may bind the Crown through legislation (see, e.g., P. W. Hogg, P. J. Monahan and W. K. Wright, Liability of the Crown (4th ed. 2011), at pp. 396\u201197). They may do so expressly or by necessary implication (IBEW v. Alberta Government Telephones, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 318, at pp. 326\u201130). Through this power to bind the Crown, parliamentary sovereignty is thus exercised over government actors of all sorts. By imposing limits on these actors through legislation that is binding on the Crown, lawmakers can shape how public powers are exercised (Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick, 2008 SCC 9, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 190, at para. 28; see also H. Brun, G. Tremblay and E. Brouillet, Droit constitutionnel (6th ed. 2014), at paras. IX.39\u2011IX.41). Government actors are bound by legislative limits imposed on them by Parliament and the legislatures, subject to constitutional imperatives. It is in light of these foundational principles that the legal effects of ss. 8(a) and 18(1) must be interpreted.\n[58] Here, s. 7 expressly makes the Act binding on the Crown in right of Canada or of a province. This provision therefore \u201cclearly lift[s]\u201d the rule that \u201c[n]o enactment is binding on Her Majesty or affects Her Majesty or Her Majesty\u2019s rights or prerogatives in any manner\u201d (Thouin, at para. 20; Interpretation Act , s. 17 ). The question, for the purposes of analyzing the Act \u2019s constitutional validity, is what the legal effects of ss. 8(a) and 18(1) are when these provisions are considered in conjunction with s. 7. As the Court of Appeal noted, [translation] \u201c[a]dmittedly, the process is unusual. Of course, when drafting laws, legislatures naturally act on the basis of their belief in what the Constitution allows them to do, but express legislative affirmation of the meaning or scope of a constitutional provision is out of the ordinary\u201d (para. 222). Indeed, the Court of Appeal noted that this declaratory approach is [translation] \u201cuncommon, if not unusual\u201d (para. 515). This reference provides an opportunity to explain the legal effects of these provisions.\n[59] By enacting a binding affirmation, Parliament has bound the federal government to the position it has affirmed as a matter of statutory positive law (see, e.g., Wilkins, at pp. 184\u201185). This is because, as explained above, government actors are bound by laws that create, structure and limit their powers. The obligation imposed by s. 7 is a statutory one. It binds the Crown, both federal and provincial, because it \u201cclearly lift[s]\u201d Crown immunity in a statute that is constitutionally valid under s. 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867 (see Thouin, at para. 20).\n[60] It is true that Parliament affirms, in the Act , the inherent right of self\u2011government, a right that, as specified in the preamble, includes jurisdiction in relation to child and family services. Parliament also states in s. 2 that the Act is to be construed as upholding the rights of Indigenous peoples recognized and affirmed by s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 , and not as abrogating or derogating from them. Although Parliament cannot bind the courts \u2014 in their capacity as guardians of the Constitution \u2014 or the provinces as regards the definitive interpretation to be given to s. 35, these legislative affirmations are very meaningful on the ground, where issues relating to the well\u2011being of children are decided. By setting out its understanding of the scope of this constitutional provision in s. 18(1) of the Act , Parliament undertakes to act as though Indigenous peoples enjoy an inherent right of self\u2011government in relation to child and family services. Moreover, by making this affirmation expressly binding on the Crown through s. 7, Parliament ensures that the Crown also undertakes to act in accordance with its position that this right of self\u2011government was recognized. The fact remains, of course, that all actors in the system, including the provinces, can go to court to challenge Parliament\u2019s understanding of the scope of the rights recognized and affirmed by s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 . Indeed, it is quite possible that a province\u2019s reading of s. 35 will differ from the one indicated in s. 18(1) of the Act . Ultimately, it is the courts that will have the last word on the scope of s. 35, given its constitutional nature.\n[61] Insofar as the affirmation in s. 18(1) is found in a law that is constitutionally valid under s. 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867 , Parliament\u2019s affirmation and the Crown\u2019s corollary undertaking have effect. Parliament\u2019s affirmation that the government intends to act in accordance with its position that child services fall under an inherent right of self\u2011government also seems to be consistent with the policy put in place by the federal government in this regard as a result of the outcome of the 1992 Charlottetown Accord (see the explanations given by P. W. Hogg and M. E. Turpel, \u201cImplementing Aboriginal Self\u2011Government: Constitutional and Jurisdictional Issues\u201d (1995), 74 Can. Bar Rev. 187, at p. 189).\n[62] Accordingly, one effect of s. 7 of the Act is that the federal government can now no longer assert, in any proceedings or discussions, that there is no Indigenous right of self\u2011government in relation to child and family services. Although few legislative frameworks have thus far circumscribed the Crown\u2019s actions with respect to Indigenous peoples (J. Promislow and N. Metallic, \u201cRealizing Aboriginal Administrative Law\u201d, in C. M. Flood and P. Daly, eds., Administrative Law in Context (4th ed. 2022), 129, at p. 141), Parliament has now established such a constraint through this statutory affirmation that is binding on His Majesty.\n[63] The combined operation of ss. 7 , 8 (a) and 18(1) of the Act could also have other legal effects by requiring the Crown to act as though the principle of the honour of the Crown is engaged. As the Court noted in the context of a treaty, the honour of the Crown is \u201calways at stake\u201d when it deals with Indigenous peoples (R. v. Badger, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 771, at para. 41). As its name suggests, the principle of the honour of the Crown refers to the \u201cspecial relationship that requires that the Crown act honourably in its dealings with Aboriginal peoples\u201d (Mikisew Cree First Nation v. Canada (Governor General in Council), 2018 SCC 40, [2018] 2 S.C.R. 765, at para. 21, citing Manitoba Metis Federation Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2013 SCC 14, [2013] 1 S.C.R. 623, at para. 67, and B. Slattery, \u201cAboriginal Rights and the Honour of the Crown\u201d (2005), 29 S.C.L.R. (2d) 433, at p. 436).\n[64] It is open to Parliament to affirm, as it has in s. 18(1), what it considers to be the constitutional requirements for reconciliation, even if it cannot, by doing so, unilaterally amend the Constitution. By linking the affirmation in s. 18(1) to s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 , particularly its first subsection, Parliament has nevertheless intentionally embarked on a particular path to reconciliation. Indeed, it has set out, in an ordinary statute, its understanding of the scope of a constitutional provision, and it has done so while ensuring that the Crown is bound to act on the basis of this same understanding, that is, in accordance with the legislative affirmation that the inherent right of self\u2011government has constitutional status and with the idea that, from a jurisdictional standpoint, this right includes the jurisdiction of Indigenous governing bodies in relation to child and family services. The honour of the Crown is thus engaged.\n[65] The affirmation in ss. 8(a) and 18(1) will inform the context and content of the resulting obligations, as if this affirmation was enshrined in the Constitution. As the Court has explained, \u201c[the Constitution] is at the root of the honour of the Crown\u201d (Manitoba Metis, at para. 70). Under the Act, the government formally undertakes to act in accordance with the position that this right has constitutional status (see Manitoba Metis, at paras. 69\u201170). The honour of the Crown is not a mere \u201cincantation\u201d, but rather \u201cfinds its application in concrete practices\u201d; it \u201cgives rise to different duties in different circumstances\u201d (Haida Nation v. British Columbia (Minister of Forests), 2004 SCC 73, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 511, at paras. 16 and 18, quoted in Mikisew Cree, at para. 24). As the Court stated in Manitoba Metis, \u201cthe honour of the Crown requires that the Crown: (1) takes a broad purposive approach to the interpretation of the promise; and (2) acts diligently to fulfill it\u201d (para. 75).\n[66] The fact that s. 7 of the Act requires the Crown to act as though the right of self\u2011government described in s. 18(1) had been proved therefore implies that the Crown must take a broad approach to the interpretation of this right and must act diligently to implement it, as long as this affirmation is part of the law in force. The fact is that the legislative affirmation regarding the scope of s. 35 \u201crepresents a promise of rights recognition, and \u2018[i]t is always assumed that the Crown intends to fulfil its promises\u2019\u201d, in this case the promise to act as though Indigenous peoples\u2019 right of self\u2011government in relation to child and family services were recognized, while awaiting a formal court ruling on the question (Haida Nation, at para. 20, quoting Badger, at para. 41).\n2. Provisions Establishing National Standards\n[67] The national standards and principles set out in ss. 9 to 17 of the Act establish a normative framework for the provision of culturally appropriate child and family services that applies across the country. Under s. 7, this normative framework is binding on federal and provincial providers of such services, as well as on Indigenous providers in certain cases (s. 22(1)).\n[68] Some of these principles guide the courts\u2019 interpretation of the Act and the administration of the Act by governments. These include the best interests of the child (s. 9(1)), cultural continuity (s. 9(2)) and substantive equality (s. 9(3)).\n[69] The standard relating to the principle of the best interests of an Indigenous child, in particular, is described in considerable detail (s. 10). The Act specifies certain circumstances in which this principle must be a primary consideration or the paramount consideration in decisions or actions in relation to an Indigenous child (s. 10(1)). It also sets out a non\u2011exhaustive list of relevant factors that must be considered in determining the best interests of an Indigenous child, including \u201cthe importance to the child of preserving the child\u2019s cultural identity and connections to the language and territory of the Indigenous group, community or people to which the child belongs\u201d (s. 10(3)(d)).\n[70] Other provisions directly govern the delivery of child and family services in relation to Indigenous children, irrespective of the nature of the services provided (ss. 11 to 15.1). Some of these standards are procedural in nature. For instance, in certain circumstances the provisions require service providers to give notice to a child\u2019s parents and the relevant Indigenous governing body (s. 12). A right to make representations in civil proceedings in respect of the provision of child and family services in relation to an Indigenous child is also created (s. 13). Other standards govern the nature of the child and family services that are provided in relation to Indigenous children. For example, service providers are required in some circumstances to give priority to preventive care (s. 14) and are prohibited from apprehending a child \u201csolely on the basis of his or her socio\u2011economic conditions, including poverty, lack of adequate housing or infrastructure or the state of health of his or her parent or the care provider\u201d (s. 15). Further, before apprehending an Indigenous child, the service provider is required to demonstrate that reasonable efforts have been made to have the child continue to reside with his or her parents or another adult family member, unless immediate apprehension is consistent with the child\u2019s best interests (s. 15.1).\n[71] Finally, the Act establishes a priority order and related standards to govern the placement of Indigenous children by federal and provincial service providers (ss. 16 and 17).\n3. Provisions Setting Out Concrete Implementation Measures\n[72] The Act creates various mechanisms to facilitate the exercise of Indigenous peoples\u2019 right of self\u2011government (ss. 20 to 24). In this regard, the Act provides that an Indigenous governing body may enter into a coordination agreement with the federal and provincial governments (s. 20(2)). Such an agreement may concern any measure related to the exercise of the right of self\u2011government by the Indigenous group, community or people on whose behalf the governing body is acting. Moreover, where such an agreement is entered into \u2014 or where reasonable efforts have been made to enter into one \u2014 the law related to the agreement has the force of law as federal law (s. 21(1)) and prevails over the vast majority of federal legislation (s. 22(1)).\n[73] The Act affirms as well that the laws of Indigenous groups, communities or peoples have independent normative force in Canadian law. Section 21(1) states that these laws \u201calso\u201d have \u201cthe force of law\u201d regardless of whether they are incorporated as federal law. In addition, it is confirmed by s. 20(1) and (2) that an Indigenous group, community or people may exercise its \u201clegislative authority in relation to child . . . services\u201d without having entered into a coordination agreement. Both the federal government and the provincial governments are bound by this legislative recognition (s. 7).\n[74] Lastly, the Act provides for several other mechanisms that accompany the affirmation set out in s. 18(1), including the favoured process for resolving conflicts between two laws of different Indigenous groups, communities or peoples (s. 24). Essentially, these mechanisms facilitate the adoption by Indigenous groups, communities or peoples of legislative measures in relation to child and family services.\n(ii) Practical Effects\n[75] The usefulness of practical effects in characterizing the Act is relative, because the Act was enacted only recently and its \u201cactual or predicted\u201d effects, to use the language of Morgentaler (at p. 483), cannot be determined with precision. However, it is reasonable to expect that Indigenous children and families will receive services that are more appropriate to their cultural realities (see, e.g., Public Inquiry into the Administration of Justice and Aboriginal People, Report of the Aboriginal Justice Inquiry of Manitoba, vol. 1, The Justice System and Aboriginal People (1991), c. 14). This in turn may reasonably be expected to reduce the overrepresentation of Indigenous children in child and family services settings and to help protect the well\u2011being of Indigenous children, youth and families.\n[76] It is reasonable to think that the Act will help avoid the \u201cwaste of time and resources\u201d involved in prolonged litigation or negotiations over whether and, if so, to what extent a particular Indigenous group, community or people has jurisdiction in relation to child and family services (see, e.g., Metallic, at pp. 14 and 20\u201122). In this way, the Act may be a practical means of advancing reconciliation with Indigenous peoples. Constitutional litigation and negotiated settlements also undoubtedly remain essential tools for moving reconciliation forward. They are not, however, the only path. Legislative initiatives designed to advance reconciliation are also possible and, in certain respects, may have advantages.\n[77] Certain practical advantages of proceeding through legislation rather than through the courts and constitutional litigation are apparent. Avoiding the need to prove an Aboriginal right on the basis of judicially devised tests can skip over \u201cyears, if not decades\u201d of litigation during which Indigenous children and families \u201ccontinue to suffer as the status quo continues\u201d (R.F., Aseniwuche Winewak Nation of Canada, at para. 87; R.F., First Nations Child & Family Caring Society of Canada, at para. 94; see also I.F., Indigenous Bar Association in Canada, at para. 18; I.F., M\u00e9tis National Council et al., at para. 10). Avoiding a whole cycle of litigation \u201callows Indigenous groups and the Crown to use their time and resources to focus on the actual substance of the issue: caring for children\u201d (I.F., Carrier Sekani Family Services Society et al., at para. 11). As this Court has recognized, \u201c[t]rue reconciliation is rarely, if ever, achieved in courtrooms\u201d (Clyde River (Hamlet) v. Petroleum Geo\u2011Services Inc., 2017 SCC 40, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 1069, at para. 24). It is for this reason that the Court has encouraged reconciliation efforts outside of the courts (Delgamuukw v. British Columbia, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 1010, at para. 186).\n[78] In a similar way, the legislative process chosen by Parliament may have advantages over negotiated settlements. As scholars have recognized, \u201cmodern treaties have typically required years, if not decades, of very expensive negotiations\u201d (see, e.g., Wilkins, at p. 184). Legislative initiatives can proceed more quickly, with less expense and with a wider scope (ibid.; see also Metallic, at p. 14).\n[79] Thus, the Act has the expected practical effects of helping to protect the well\u2011being of Indigenous children, youth and families and advancing reconciliation with Indigenous peoples. The practical effects of the three interrelated categories of provisions considered above are along the same lines.\n1. Provisions Affirming the Right of Self\u2011Government\n[80] The affirmation performs, as a practical effect, what scholars call the [translation] \u201cpedagogical, educational function\u201d of the law (J. Carbonnier, Flexible droit: pour une sociologie du droit sans rigueur (10th ed. 2001), at p. 155). Through this function, laws [translation] \u201cplay a part in forming mores, which will be internalized and sublimed into ethics\u201d (Carbonnier, at p. 157). With this function in mind, it is plain that legislation does not simply lay down a \u201cset of orders or directions or commands\u201d; it also establishes \u201ca set of topics, a set of terms in which those topics can be discussed, and some general directions as to the process of thought and argument by which the statute is to be applied\u201d (J. B. White, \u201cRhetoric and Law: The Arts of Cultural and Communal Life\u201d, in J. B. White, Heracles\u2019 Bow: Essays on the Rhetoric and Poetics of the Law (1985), 28, at p. 41).\n[81] The affirmation contained in the Act may in part be viewed as a step toward changing or adjusting the culture underlying the actions of the federal and provincial governments (see Christie, at p. 51). But through statutes and their preambles, Parliament \u201c[also] engage[s] in dialogue with both courts and society\u201d, as Professor Kent Roach said about the use of preambles (\u201cThe Uses and Audiences of Preambles in Legislation\u201d (2001), 47 McGill L.J. 129, at p. 159). In a pedagogical spirit, Parliament has used the Act to communicate to the courts and society its position that the law must recognize the importance of Indigenous self\u2011government in relation to child and family services. Thus, the \u201cunusual\u201d use of affirmations of the right of self\u2011government can be explained in part by the fact that Parliament is attempting to persuade other institutions to adopt the position it has now embraced. In areas where Parliament cannot order, direct or command institutions to adopt its position, this pedagogical function may nevertheless, in time, help to inculcate new attitudes or approaches that will further promote a culture of respect for and reconciliation with Indigenous peoples in Canada.\n[82] Whether and, if so, how this initiative will unfold is beyond the courts\u2019 institutional capacity to assess. But it is an anticipated practical effect that helps in understanding the \u201cessential matter\u201d that the Act seeks to address.\n2. Provisions Establishing National Standards\n[83] It is possible that Indigenous groups, communities or peoples will not wish to exercise the jurisdiction affirmed in s. 18 of the Act immediately. In this and other regards, Parliament seeks to \u201crespect the diversity of all Indigenous peoples\u201d (Act , preamble). As with other aspects of reconciliation, the full realization of Indigenous jurisdiction as recognized in the Act \u201cwill take some time\u201d (Honouring the Truth, Reconciling for the Future, at p. vi). On a practical level, however, many of the national standards laid down may operate to ensure that the child and family services provided in the interim in relation to Indigenous children are culturally appropriate for them and are in their best interests.\n[84] Some of the standards are preventive, which means that they come into play before any important decision is made or any action is taken in the provision of child and family services in relation to an Indigenous child. It may reasonably be expected that these standards will lessen the historical propensity of child welfare systems to apprehend Indigenous children and thus that they will help such children remain, where possible, in the environment they are from (see, e.g., The Final Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, vol. 5, Canada\u2019s Residential Schools: The Legacy (2015), at p. 55). Other standards come into play after a decision has been made to place a child. These standards are likely capable of reducing the disproportionate mass placement of Indigenous children outside their families and their communities. Addressing overrepresentation protects the well\u2011being of Indigenous children, youth and families.\n3. Provisions Setting Out Concrete Implementation Measures\n[85] The concrete implementation measures provided for in the Act must be interpreted in light of the UNDRIP. In keeping with the obligations imposed on it by the country\u2019s positive law, the Government of Canada \u201cmust, in consultation and cooperation with Indigenous peoples, take all measures necessary to ensure that the laws of Canada are consistent with the Declaration\u201d (UNDRIP Act , s. 5 ). To this end, the minister \u201cmust . . . prepare and implement an action plan to achieve the objectives of the Declaration\u201d (s. 6(1)) and prepare an annual report on the progress made in fulfilling this obligation (s. 7(1)). The first annual progress report discussing these measures emphasized the link between the Act and the broader commitment to implementing the UNDRIP (Department of Justice Canada, Annual progress report on implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act (2022), at pp. 15, 34\u201136 and 39\u201141).\n[86] There is little doubt that an anticipated practical effect of the Act is to make Canadian law more consistent with the UNDRIP. As scholars have noted, the UNDRIP speaks to the connection between child and family services and Indigenous peoples\u2019 rights (see, e.g., S. Grammond, \u201cFederal Legislation on Indigenous Child Welfare in Canada\u201d (2018), 28:1 J.L. & Soc. Pol\u2019y 132, at p. 133). Indeed, the preamble to the UNDRIP is explicit in this regard: the General Assembly recognized \u201cthe right of indigenous families and communities to retain shared responsibility for the upbringing, training, education and well\u2011being of their children, consistent with the rights of the child\u201d. Several of the rights set out in the UNDRIP express aspects of this right. For instance, art. 4 sets out the right of Indigenous peoples to autonomy or self\u2011government in matters relating to their internal and local affairs. Article 7 affirms, among other things, the right of Indigenous peoples not to be subjected to the forcible removal of children to another group. Article 13 recognizes the right of Indigenous peoples to transmit their cultures to future generations and the correlative duty of states to take effective measures to ensure that this right is protected.\n[87] Further, art. 38 declares that \u201cStates in consultation and cooperation with indigenous peoples, shall take the appropriate measures, including legislative measures, to achieve the ends of [the UNDRIP].\u201d The Government of Canada has made a commitment to take such measures (UNDRIP Act , preamble). The Act is one more step toward living up to this commitment.\n[88] Moreover, it should be noted that this initiative by Parliament is consistent, in two ways, with the idea already put forward by this Court that \u201c[w]hile Aboriginal claims can be and are pursued through litigation, negotiation is a preferable way of reconciling state and Aboriginal interests\u201d (Clyde River, at para. 24, quoting Haida Nation, at para. 14; see also R. v. Desautel, 2021 SCC 17, at para. 87). Indeed, not only is the Act the result of a long process of consultation and cooperation with Indigenous peoples, but it also puts in place mechanisms to facilitate and encourage, from a forward\u2011looking perspective, the negotiation of agreements between the Crown and Indigenous communities (see Act, ss. 20 to 22 ).\n[89] It may also be anticipated that the Act \u2019s provisions setting out concrete measures to implement the aspects of the UNDRIP related to Indigenous children will advance reconciliation with Indigenous peoples. As the preamble to the UNDRIP Act recognizes, the \u201cTruth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada calls upon federal, provincial, territorial and municipal governments to fully adopt and implement the Declaration as the framework for reconciliation\u201d. This call was echoed by the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (Final Report, vol. 1b, at p. 177, call for justice 1.2(v)). It may be expected that, by taking concrete measures in this regard, Canada will move closer to the goal of \u201cestablishing and maintaining a mutually respectful relationship between Aboriginal and non\u2011Aboriginal peoples in this country\u201d (Honouring the Truth, Reconciling for the Future, at p. 6).\n[90] Even though the Act is expected to accelerate certain aspects of the process of reconciliation, it is still important to recognize that reconciliation is a long\u2011term project. It will not be accomplished in a single sacred moment, but rather through a continuous transformation of relationships and a braiding together of distinct legal traditions and sources of power that exist (see J. Leclair, \u201cZeus, Metis and Athena: The Path Towards the Constitutional Recognition of Full\u2011Blown Indigenous Legal Orders\u201d (2023), 27:2 Rev. Const. Stud. 77; cf. H. Cyr, Canadian Federalism and Treaty Powers: Organic Constitutionalism at Work (2009), at pp. 37\u201138; see also J. Borrows, \u201cRevitalizing Canada\u2019s Indigenous Constitution: Two Challenges\u201d, in UNDRIP Implementation: Braiding International, Domestic and Indigenous Laws (2017), 20).\n(c) Conclusion on the Pith and Substance of the Act\n[91] In sum, the purpose of the Act is to protect the well\u2011being of Indigenous children, youth and families in three interwoven ways: affirming Indigenous communities\u2019 jurisdiction in relation to child and family services; establishing national standards applicable across Canada; and implementing aspects of the UNDRIP in Canadian law. The legal effect of the Act is to establish a uniform scheme for protecting the well\u2011being of Indigenous children, youth and families through the affirmation of Indigenous legislative authority, through national standards and through concrete implementation measures. Practically speaking, the Act may reasonably be expected to protect the well\u2011being of Indigenous children, youth and families and to advance reconciliation with Indigenous peoples. The pith and substance of the Act flows from the examination of these aims and effects.\n[92] In our view, these factors imply that the essential matter addressed by the Act involves protecting the well\u2011being of Indigenous children, youth and families by promoting the delivery of culturally appropriate child and family services and, in so doing, advancing the process of reconciliation with Indigenous peoples. The affirmation of Indigenous legislative authority, the national standards and the concrete measures to implement aspects of the UNDRIP are all integral parts of this unified whole.\nB. Classification Under Section 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867\n[93] The Act falls squarely within s. 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867 . Binding the federal government to the affirmation set out in s. 18(1), establishing national standards and facilitating the implementation of the laws of Indigenous groups, communities or peoples are all measures that are within Parliament\u2019s powers under s. 91(24).\n[94] The jurisdiction provided for in s. 91(24) is broad in scope and relates first and foremost to what is called \u201cIndianness\u201d or Indigeneity, that is, Indigenous peoples as Indigenous peoples.\n[95] The foregoing is sufficient to conclude that the Act is intra vires Parliament under its jurisdiction over \u201cIndians\u201d. However, the Attorney General of Quebec has raised other objections to the constitutional validity of the Act , which we reject for the reasons that follow.\n(1) Sections 1 to 17 of the Act Need Not Be Classified Under Section 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867\n[96] The Attorney General of Quebec argues that the pith and substance of ss. 1 to 17 of the Act is to determine, through the adoption of minimum national standards, how provincial jurisdiction over youth protection is to be exercised in relation to Indigenous children. He also contends that these standards interfere with the work of the provincial public service, whose independence is essential to the existence of two levels of government that are coordinate, with no subordination of one to the other. Essentially, he argues, the provinces are being told how they must provide child services to Indigenous peoples within their borders. For the reasons that follow, the Attorney General of Quebec\u2019s position cannot be accepted.\n[97] It is trite law that Parliament can bind the Crown in right of the provinces (see, e.g., Attorney\u2011General for British Columbia v. Canadian Pacific Railway, [1906] A.C. 204 (P.C.); see also Brun, Tremblay and Brouillet, at paras. IX.95\u2011IX.96; Hogg and Wright, at \u00a7 10:21). However, Parliament can do so only within areas of federal jurisdiction.\n[98] The minimum national standards are within federal jurisdiction and can accordingly be binding on the provincial governments. The double aspect doctrine allows for \u201cthe concurrent application of both federal and provincial legislation\u201d in relation to the \u201csame fact situation\u201d (Reference re Securities Act, 2011 SCC 66, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 837, at para. 66 (emphasis in original); Greenhouse Gas References, at para. 129). Youth protection in the Indigenous context has a double aspect, since it can be approached from two different perspectives: protection of the ties between Indigenous families and communities, in a spirit of cultural survival, under s. 91(24) (Canadian Western Bank, at para. 61; see also Natural Parents v. Superintendent of Child Welfare, [1976] 2 S.C.R. 751, at p. 787, per Beetz J.); or child and family services and youth protection, under s. 92(13) and (16) (NIL\/TU,O Child and Family Services Society v. B.C. Government and Service Employees\u2019 Union, 2010 SCC 45, [2010] 2 S.C.R. 696, at paras. 36\u201140, per Abella J., and at paras. 74\u201178, per McLachlin C.J. and Fish J., concurring; see also J. Woodward, Aboriginal Law in Canada (loose\u2011leaf), at \u00a7 4:16). While the provinces are generally \u201cthe keeper[s] of constitutional authority over child welfare\u201d (NIL\/TU,O, at para. 24), the federal government also has jurisdiction to legislate in relation to child and family services for Indigenous children. As Professors Hogg and Wright have noted, \u201c[i]f s. 91(24) merely authorized Parliament to make laws for Indians which it could make for non\u2011Indians, then the provision would be unnecessary\u201d (\u00a7 28:2).\n[99] Child welfare in the Indigenous context is not only a field in which Parliament and the provinces can act, but also one in which concerted action by them is necessary. The importance of cooperation in this area between these two levels of government is illustrated, for example, by Jordan\u2019s Principle, according to which intergovernmental disputes may not interfere with the right of Indigenous children to access the same services as other children in Canada. With regard to such disputes, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission noted that the federal government and the provincial governments have historically tended to shift responsibility for Indigenous child welfare services to one another (Honouring the Truth, Reconciling for the Future, at pp. 142\u201143). However, today it is recognized that providing such services is the responsibility of both levels of government, which must act in a concerted fashion (House of Commons Debates, vol. 142, No. 31, 2nd Sess., 39th Parl., December 5, 2007, at p. 1780 (S. Blaney)). Since there is overlapping federal and provincial jurisdiction with respect to Indigenous children, it was entirely open to Parliament to legislate as it did (see, e.g., Grammond (2018), at pp. 137\u201138).\n[100] We would add that while the provinces are validly bound by the national standards, these standards are not so precise and inflexible that they regulate all aspects of the provision of child and family services in the Indigenous context. Given the degree of generality with which these standards have been formulated, provincial public servants retain significant discretion in making decisions concerning Indigenous children. Moreover, the national standards apply to all service providers, whether they are provincial public servants or not. Finally, far from interfering with provincial initiatives, the national standards appear to be largely complementary to them. Indeed, the example of the Youth Protection Act, CQLR, c. P\u201134.1 (\u201cYPA\u201d), many of whose provisions bear a striking similarity to the national standards, is instructive in this regard.\n[101] The remarks made about the Act by the Deputy Minister, Department of Indigenous Services, during the proceedings of the Standing Committee on Indigenous and Northern Affairs are particularly enlightening. The Deputy Minister noted on that occasion that Parliament\u2019s approach had been inspired by the child welfare initiatives taken by Quebec in relation to Indigenous children, including the amendments made to the YPA by the National Assembly of Quebec. He stated the following:\nWe\u2019re using the results of the work that Quebec is already doing with indigenous people, particularly on the principles. We could end up with very positive approaches in Quebec, which wouldn\u2019t necessarily be changed by the legislation. The legislation doesn\u2019t call into question the positive aspects. Instead, it sets minimum standards. Moreover, in many cases, we have the impression that these standards are already being met or even exceeded.\n(House of Commons, Standing Committee on Indigenous and Northern Affairs, Evidence, No. 146, 1st Sess., 42nd Parl., April 30, 2019, at p. 9)\n[102] The various principles set out in Chapter V.1 of the YPA, which is entitled \u201cProvisions Specific to Indigenous People\u201d, including the principle of cultural continuity, are in line with the national standards. Both the Act and the YPA envision the concept of well\u2011being of Indigenous children on the basis of the idea that \u201cIndigenous persons are best suited to meet the needs of their children in the manner that is the most appropriate\u201d (YPA, preamble).\n[103] It follows from all of the foregoing that the national standards have only \u201cincidental\u201d effects on the provinces\u2019 exercise of their powers, including on the work of their public servants. As this Court has reiterated many times, effects of this kind have no impact on the constitutional validity of the legislation from which they arise (Canadian Western Bank, at para. 28, quoting Global Securities Corp. v. British Columbia (Securities Commission), 2000 SCC 21, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 494, at para. 23).\n(2) Sections 8(a) and 18(1) and the Associated Provisions Do Not Purport to Amend the Constitution\n[104] In this reference, the Attorney General of Quebec also submits that the Act is ultra vires because Parliament cannot itself, through legislation, establish the existence of an Indigenous right under s. 35, determine its scope or define its content. The Attorney General maintains that, to have full effect, the affirmations found in various places in the Act require either an amendment to the Constitution or prior judicial recognition. In this regard, the Quebec Court of Appeal was of the view that the Act is based expressly on the premise that Indigenous peoples\u2019 right of self\u2011government is recognized and affirmed by s. 35(1), and that this right includes child and family services. According to the Court of Appeal, given that such a right does indeed exist, the Act is thus constitutionally valid, subject to the provisions on the incorporation of laws of Indigenous groups, communities or peoples into federal law and on federal paramountcy.\n[105] The Attorney General of Quebec states that what he calls [translation] \u201cPart II\u201d of the Act represents an attempt to amend the Constitution unilaterally. In particular, he claims that, through ss. 8 and 18 to 26 of the Act , Parliament has tried to create a third level of government, thereby accomplishing unilaterally what many rounds of constitutional negotiations failed to entrench. He shares the Court of Appeal\u2019s view that the affirmations [translation] \u201crais[e] some questions, particularly with respect to the division of powers between the legislative and judicial branches\u201d (para. 515).\n[106] It is, of course, true that Parliament does not have the power to amend s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 unilaterally. On this point, it should be noted that s. 35.1 commits the federal and provincial governments to the principle that any amendment to s. 35 (among other provisions) will be preceded by a first ministers\u2019 conference convened by the Prime Minister of Canada (s. 35.1(a)). Further, representatives of the Indigenous peoples of Canada will be invited to participate in the discussions on agenda items related to any proposed amendment (s. 35.1(b)). More generally, Part V of the Constitution Act, 1982 sets out the amending formulas that apply in respect of different aspects of the Constitution. Only s. 44 provides for the possibility of unilateral amendments by Parliament, which must be \u201cin relation to the executive government of Canada or the Senate and House of Commons\u201d. But even with regard to the bodies referred to in s. 44, Parliament\u2019s power to amend unilaterally is not without limits (Reference re Senate Reform, 2014 SCC 32, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 704, at para. 48). Moreover, as in other contexts, Parliament acting alone cannot shield a constitutional amendment from the requirements of the Constitution by asserting that the amending provision is declaratory (Reference re Supreme Court Act, ss. 5 and 6, 2014 SCC 21, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 433, at paras. 105\u20116). Thus, it is evident that Parliament cannot amend s. 35 unilaterally.\n[107] However, in this case, Parliament is not unilaterally amending s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 . Rather, it is stating in the Act , through affirmations that are binding on the Crown (s. 7), its position on the content of this constitutional provision. Section 8(a) provides that the purpose of the Act is to \u201caffirm the inherent right of self\u2011government, which includes jurisdiction in relation to child and family services\u201d. Likewise, under the heading \u201cAffirmation\u201d, s. 18(1) states that the \u201cinherent right of self\u2011government recognized and affirmed by section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 includes jurisdiction in relation to child and family services\u201d. The words \u201caffirm\u201d and \u201cincludes\u201d in ss. 8(a) and 18(1) do not convey any intention to amend s. 35, nor could they have this effect. Instead, they \u201cstate as a fact\u201d (Canadian Oxford Dictionary (2nd ed. 2004), sub verbo \u201caffirm\u201d) Parliament\u2019s position on the scope of s. 35. The affirmations take this position [translation] \u201cas true\u201d (Le Grand Robert de la langue fran\u00e7aise (electronic version), sub verbo \u201caffirmer\u201d), without any need for an amendment. Thus, the effect of these provisions is to affirm, not to amend.\n[108] While the word \u201caffirmed\u201d (\u201cconfirm\u00e9\u201d in French) is also used in ss. 16.1(2) and 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 , the above discussion must not be read as identifying the meaning of these two provisions or as altering this Court\u2019s jurisprudence. Here, the focus is on the language used in the Act and on the question of whether Parliament had legislative jurisdiction to enact it.\n[109] An affirmation is not an amendment, even if the subject of the affirmation is a provision of the Constitution. As this Court has stated in different contexts, the Constitution \u201cis not some holy grail which only judicial initiates of the superior courts may touch\u201d (Cooper v. Canada (Human Rights Commission), [1996] 3 S.C.R. 854, at para. 70, per McLachlin J., dissenting, quoted with approval in Nova Scotia (Workers\u2019 Compensation Board) v. Martin, 2003 SCC 54, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 504, at para. 29). For this reason, \u201c[c]ourts do not hold a monopoly on the protection and promotion of rights and freedoms; Parliament also plays a role in this regard and is often able to act as a significant ally for vulnerable groups\u201d (R. v. Mills, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 668, at para. 58).\n[110] Here, Parliament has affirmed its position on the content of s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 . It is clear that, in this case, this affirmation is set out not in the Constitution but in an ordinary statute. The division of powers and the separation of powers provided for in the Constitution \u2014 between Parliament and the legislatures, in the former case, and between legislative bodies and the judiciary, in the latter \u2014 do not prevent Parliament from acting in this manner. Parliament, like the legislatures, can enact legislation that affirms its position on the meaning of the Constitution. As mentioned above, it is for the courts to interpret the Constitution where a case so requires (see, e.g., Phillips v. Nova Scotia (Commission of Inquiry into the Westray Mine Tragedy), [1995] 2 S.C.R. 97, at paras. 9\u201111; Greenhouse Gas References, at para. 220).\n[111] The task that falls to the Court in the context of a reference invites caution: \u201c. . . care must be taken that the interpretation of a question does not amount to a new question\u201d (Reference re Canada Assistance Plan (B.C.), [1991] 2 S.C.R. 525, at p. 555). Such restraint is called for particularly in constitutional cases: \u201cIt is based on the realization that unnecessary constitutional pronouncements may prejudice future cases, the implications of which have not been foreseen\u201d (Phillips, at para. 9). In our view, caution is especially warranted here: the correctness of the position stated by Parliament with respect to the scope of s. 35 does not have to be determined to answer the question asked by the Attorney General of Quebec.\n[112] It should be noted that the Attorney General of Canada, as well as a number of the interveners before this Court, argued that s. 35(1) protects Indigenous peoples\u2019 inherent right of self\u2011government \u201cin relation to child and family services\u201d, as the very wording of the Act affirms. This Court has not yet addressed the question, and it is unnecessary for it to do so in this case to provide the requested opinion on the constitutionality of the Act . The Court has noted that rights of self\u2011government, insofar as they exist, \u201ccannot be framed in excessively general terms\u201d and cannot extend to a matter \u2014 for example, the regulation of gambling \u2014 that is not an integral part of the distinctive culture of the First Nations in question (see Delgamuukw, at para. 170; see also R. v. Pamajewon, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 821, at paras. 27\u201128). But the Court has never had to consider a matter as fundamental to the culture and identity of Indigenous peoples as the field of child and family services. While it has not discussed the question from the standpoint of an Aboriginal right of self\u2011government, the Court has nonetheless referred to the collective dimension of the exercise of certain rights held by Indigenous communities, including: their right to enter into treaties (R. v. Sioui, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1025, at p. 1056); their rights incidental to Aboriginal title (Delgamuukw, at paras. 115 and 166; Tsilhqot\u2019in Nation v. British Columbia, 2014 SCC 44, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 257, at para. 75); and their Aboriginal rights, such as the right to fish (R. v. Marshall, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 533, at para. 17; R. v. Nikal, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 1013, at para. 104) or the right to harvest wood (R. v. Sappier, 2006 SCC 54, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 686, at para. 46). For its part, Parliament has declared \u2014 through a legislative affirmation \u2014 that it considers such a right to be recognized in relation to child and family services. This affirmation is part of the ongoing dialogue on the question among Parliament, the legislatures, Indigenous peoples and the courts (see P. W. Hogg and A. A. Bushell, \u201cThe Charter Dialogue Between Courts and Legislatures\u201d (1997), 35 Osgoode Hall L.J. 75, at pp. 79\u201180).\n[113] This Court\u2019s jurisprudence recognizes the close link that exists between \u201ccultural continuity\u201d for Indigenous peoples, a principle to which the Act expressly refers in s. 9(2), and keeping Indigenous children in their community. As the Court stated in Canadian Western Bank with respect to s. 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867 , \u201crelationships within Indian families and reserve communities [can] be considered absolutely indispensable and essential to their cultural survival\u201d (para. 61). These relationships are \u201cat the centre of what they do and what they are\u201d (Delgamuukw, at para. 181, quoting Dick v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 309, at p. 320). Indeed, the Crown has always clearly understood the role played by family in the survival of Indigenous culture. It is no coincidence that the Crown targeted Indigenous children when, at the height of its imperialism, it was seeking to destroy Indigenous cultures (see C.A. reasons, at para. 85).\n[114] Ultimately, it will be for the courts to determine, on the basis of the evidence adduced, whether s. 18(1) of the Act falls within the confines of s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 . In this regard, Indigenous culture will certainly be a major factor in the analysis, because s. 35(1) \u201cserves to recognize the prior occupation of Canada by Aboriginal societies and to reconcile their contemporary existence with Crown sovereignty\u201d (Desautel, at para. 31). As the Court has stated, s. 35 recognizes and affirms \u201ca constitutional framework for the protection of the distinctive cultures of aboriginal peoples\u201d (Sappier, at para. 22).\n[115] Moreover, the fact that this Court has not yet recognized the existence under s. 35(1) of a right of self\u2011government does not mean that Parliament lacks the means to deal with the question of Indigenous child and family services. It is important to note that, in exercising its jurisdiction under s. 91(24), Parliament chose to affirm that the right of self\u2011government with respect to this matter is directly tied to s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 . The Crown is also expressly bound by this affirmation along the path to reconciliation (Act, s. 7). In recent decades, as the Court of Appeal noted, Parliament has received numerous [translation] \u201cstudies, reports and surveys on various aspects of the situation of Aboriginal peoples\u201d (para. 108), including from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples. Indeed, the latter devoted 277 pages of its report to the issue of self\u2011government (Delgamuukw, at para. 171). Parliament is therefore particularly well positioned to act on the basis of its understanding of the content of s. 35(1) and, more broadly, of the imperatives of reconciliation.\n[116] In this regard, it should be noted that the process of enacting the Act was initiated after the Minister of Indigenous Services called an urgent meeting to address problems related to discrimination within the child and family services provided to Indigenous peoples (see C.A. reasons, at para. 173). This process led to nearly 65 meetings in which the federal government consulted with some 2,000 community, regional and national organizations, as well as individuals (see para. 176). Therefore, the Act does not merely speak to Indigenous peoples but also seeks to express their voice. The Act is thus intended to recognize the validity of Indigenous peoples\u2019 stated needs and to provide reassurance that reconciliation will not be imposed on them but will be achieved through cooperation. As stated by the National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations, Perry Bellegarde, whose words were quoted by the then Minister of Indigenous Services: \u201cThis legislation will recognize First Nations jurisdiction so they can build their own systems based on their own governance, laws and policies\u201d (House of Commons Debates, March 19, 2019, at p. 26137).\n[117] While it is unnecessary to determine the limits of s. 35(1) for the purposes of this reference, it is nevertheless worth noting that Parliament, after thoroughly inquiring into the matter, chose to advance reconciliation by affirming that the right of self\u2011government in relation to child and family services is \u201cinherent\u201d as well as \u201crecognized and affirmed by section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 \u201d. This affirmation, set out in s. 18(1), is therefore an important factor in deciding this reference. The importance of this affirmation will undoubtedly also be a factor to consider when the courts are called upon to formally rule on the scope of s. 35.\n[118] In any event, the classification of the affirmation under one of the heads of power in the Constitution Act, 1867 must, in the context of the reference question before this Court, be determined by the classification of the Act as a whole. Nevertheless, some discussion of the potential effect of the affirmation on the provincial governments is warranted. Although valid federal legislation may bind the provincial Crown (see, e.g., Her Majesty in right of the Province of Alberta v. Canadian Transport Commission, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 61, at p. 72; The Queen in the Right of the Province of Ontario v. Board of Transport Commissioners, [1968] S.C.R. 118, at p. 124; Wilkins, at p. 185), it is not clear on the face of ss. 7, 8(a) and 18(1) whether the affirmation is meant to bind the provincial governments. However, it is open to the courts to give a narrow meaning to legislation that would otherwise exceed the jurisdiction of the level of government that enacted it (see, e.g., Derrickson v. Derrickson, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 285, at p. 296). This interpretive approach can be justified by the presumption that legislation is consistent with the division of powers (Siemens v. Manitoba (Attorney General), 2003 SCC 3, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 6, at para. 33; see also Brun, Tremblay and Brouillet, at para. VI\u20112.56; Hogg and Wright, at \u00a7 15:13). To the extent that binding the provinces to the position that Parliament has affirmed exceeds federal jurisdiction (a point not directly argued before this Court), it would accordingly be necessary to read down ss. 8(a) and 18(1).\n(3) The Incorporation Provisions in Section 21 Do Not Alter the Architecture of the Constitution\n[119] The Attorney General of Quebec argues that ss. 21 and 22(3) of the Act alter the architecture of the Constitution (R.F., at para. 26). The Court of Appeal reached the same conclusion, holding that these provisions purport to extend the application of the doctrine of federal paramountcy to the laws of Indigenous groups, communities or peoples in relation to child and family services and are therefore ultra vires s. 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867 (paras. 537, 540\u201142 and 571). The Court of Appeal stated that the laws of Indigenous groups, communities or peoples are not federal laws enacted under s. 91(24) but rather Indigenous laws that serve Indigenous imperatives (para. 540).\n[120] In our view, given that this Court has not yet addressed the question of whether the right described in s. 18(1) has been proved, neither s. 21 nor s. 22(3) of the Act alters the architecture of the Constitution; both of these provisions were validly enacted under s. 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867 . Confining our remarks to the specific context of this reference, we discuss the validity of s. 21 in this section of our reasons and the validity of s. 22(3) in the next section.\n[121] The main aspect of s. 21 of the Act that the Court of Appeal found to be unconstitutional was subs. (1), which provides as follows: \u201cA law, as amended from time to time, of an Indigenous group, community or people . . . also has, during the period that the law is in force, the force of law as federal law.\u201d The Court of Appeal held that federal legislation enacted under s. 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867 cannot give a law of an Indigenous group, community or people the force of law as federal law (paras. 540\u201141). We disagree.\n[122] Section 21 of the Act is simply an incorporation by reference provision. It incorporates by reference the laws adopted by an Indigenous group, community or people and gives them the force of law as federal law. Moreover, because such laws may be amended, s. 21 incorporates the amendments that may be made to them in the future, on an anticipatory basis. Such an anticipatory incorporation by reference provision is constitutional.\n[123] Professors Hogg and Wright describe incorporation by reference as a \u201ctechnique which is occasionally used by legislative bodies, especially where it is desired to enact the same law as another jurisdiction\u201d (\u00a7 14:12; see also Brun, Tremblay and Brouillet, at para. VI\u20111.80; G.\u2011A. Beaudoin, in collaboration with P. Thibault, La Constitution du Canada: institutions, partage des pouvoirs, Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s (3rd ed. 2004), at pp. 317\u201118). They note that \u201c[i]nstead of repeating in full the desired rules, the drafter may simply incorporate by reference, or adopt, the rules of another jurisdiction\u201d (\u00a7 14:12). As a drafting technique, incorporation by reference avoids the need for the legislative body, in the exercise of its legislative jurisdiction, to replicate in a separate statute rules already adopted by another entity.\n[124] Legislative bodies have broad power to referentially incorporate provisions adopted by other entities, including other legislative bodies or non\u2011governmental bodies. For example, Parliament can incorporate by reference a law enacted by a province (Coughlin v. Ontario Highway Transport Board, [1968] S.C.R. 569, at p. 575; R. v. Smith, [1972] S.C.R. 359, at p. 366; Dick, at p. 328; Wewaykum Indian Band v. Canada, 2002 SCC 79, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 245, at paras. 114 and 136; F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des producteurs de volailles du Qu\u00e9bec v. Pelland, 2005 SCC 20, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 292, at paras. 53 and 61). This Court has also upheld the validity of a provincial legislature\u2019s incorporation by reference of laws made by the Parliament of the United Kingdom (Attorney General for Ontario v. Scott, [1956] S.C.R. 137, at p. 152). Parliament may also referentially incorporate standards set by a non\u2011governmental body (Reference re Manitoba Language Rights, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 212, at pp. 230 and 234). Once Parliament has incorporated by reference provisions adopted by another entity, the \u201crelevant provisions apply as federal law\u201d (Wewaykum Indian Band, at para. 114). There is no doubt about the constitutionality of the drafting technique of incorporation by reference.\n[125] Incorporation by reference may also be anticipatory: a legislative body can incorporate another entity\u2019s provisions as amended from time to time, on an anticipatory basis. In Scott, for example, an Ontario statute incorporated both current and future English rules related to the enforcement of spousal and child support orders. Professors Hogg and Wright note that in Scott, this Court \u201crecognized, but did not attach particular importance to, the fact that the Ontario statute adopted not only the English rules in existence at the time of the enactment of the Ontario statute, but the English rules in existence from time to time in the future\u201d (\u00a7 14:13; see also Beaudoin, at p. 318; N. Finkelstein, Laskin\u2019s Canadian Constitutional Law (5th ed. 1986), at p. 43). It is uncontroversial that legislation may be enacted \u201cby reference to the legislation as it may from time to time be\u201d of another legislative body (Scott, at p. 143 (emphasis added); see also Coughlin, at p. 575; Smith, at p. 366; Dick, at p. 328).\n[126] A legislative body\u2019s broad power to incorporate by reference is, however, subject to limits. For example, the legislative body cannot abdicate its legislative role: it cannot permit another entity \u201cto enact general, or generally, laws\u201d for it (Scott, at p. 143; see also Finkelstein, at p. 43). The legislative body must also have the legislative jurisdiction required to enact the law it seeks to referentially incorporate (see Scott, at p. 143; Hogg and Wright, at \u00a7 14:14; Finkelstein, at p. 43). Moreover, one level of government cannot delegate legislative powers to another level of government (see Attorney General of Nova Scotia v. Attorney General of Canada, [1951] S.C.R. 31, at p. 34; Hogg and Wright, at \u00a7 14:10; Brun, Tremblay and Brouillet, at para. VI\u20111.78; Beaudoin, at pp. 314\u201115; Finkelstein, at p. 42; P. J. Monahan, B. Shaw and P. Ryan, Constitutional Law (5th ed. 2017), at p. 402). Administrative inter\u2011delegation is permitted, however: one level of government may validly delegate powers to an administrative body created by another level of government (P.E.I. Potato Marketing Board v. H. B. Willis Inc., [1952] 2 S.C.R. 392; Reference re Agricultural Products Marketing Act, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1198, at pp. 1223\u201124; Hogg and Wright, at \u00a7 14:11; Brun, Tremblay and Brouillet, at para. VI\u20111.78; Beaudoin, at p. 315; Finkelstein, at pp. 45\u201146).\n[127] One commentator has expressed doubts about the possibility that the incorporation by reference of the laws of Indigenous groups, communities or peoples could be invalid, \u201csince Parliament could easily adopt them piecemeal as they arise without violating subsection 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867 \u201d (Leclair, at p. 98 (footnote omitted)). We agree. Here, s. 21(1) of the Act validly incorporates by reference the laws in relation to child and family services, as amended from time to time, of an Indigenous group, community or people referred to in s. 20(3). As concluded above, Parliament has independent legislative authority to enact such laws pursuant to its jurisdiction over \u201cIndians, and Lands reserved for the Indians\u201d under s. 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867 . To answer the reference question before the Court, it suffices to say that the laws of Indigenous groups, communities or peoples derive force of law from s. 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867 and from compliance with the requirements set out in ss. 20 and 21 of the Act . That being said, the Court is taking care not to exclude the possibility that the right of self\u2011government has a distinct constitutional source. In particular, our conclusion certainly does not negate the possibility that such a right of self\u2011government may be recognized under s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 . This remains an open question.\n[128] Parliament has also used appropriate language to incorporate by reference the laws of Indigenous groups, communities or peoples as they may be amended from time to time. Section 21(1) of the Act provides that such laws \u201cha[ve] . . . the force of law as federal law\u201d once they have come into force. They apply as federal law from the time they are incorporated (Wewaykum Indian Band, at para. 114). Section 21(1) operates in tandem with s. 20(3), which conditions the application of s. 21 on the Indigenous governing body in question having entered into a coordination agreement or made reasonable efforts to do so. These mechanisms effect a valid anticipatory incorporation by reference.\n[129] Questions relating to the implementation of laws incorporated by reference may be raised in the future and may need to be addressed. For example, there may be some uncertainty about the territorial scope of an Indigenous governing body\u2019s jurisdiction or about whether an entity is an Indigenous nation or an \u201cIndigenous governing body\u201d for the purposes of the Act . Potential future challenges arising from such issues are, however, beyond the scope of this reference, which raises a broad and general question about the constitutional validity of the Act as a whole. As the Court recently stated, \u201c[i]t is not this Court\u2019s role to express opinions about the substance, arguments or merits of future challenges\u201d (Greenhouse Gas References, at para. 220).\n[130] In summary, it is constitutionally open to Parliament to use anticipatory incorporation by reference as a legislative drafting technique. Through s. 21, Parliament has validly incorporated by reference the laws, as amended from time to time, of Indigenous groups, communities or peoples in relation to child and family services. As a result, s. 21 does not alter the architecture of the Constitution.\n(4) The Section 22(3) Paramountcy Provision Does Not Alter the Architecture of the Constitution\n[131] The Attorney General of Quebec argues that s. 22(3) of the Act , the paramountcy provision, alters the architecture of the Constitution. In our view, this is not the case. Section 22(3) provides as follows: \u201cFor greater certainty, if there is a conflict or inconsistency between a provision respecting child and family services that is in a law of an Indigenous group, community or people and a provision respecting child and family services that is in a provincial Act or regulation, the provision that is in the law of the Indigenous group, community or people prevails to the extent of the conflict or inconsistency.\u201d The laws of Indigenous groups, communities or peoples that are incorporated by reference will have the force of law as federal law: laws incorporated into federal law apply as federal law (Wewaykum Indian Band, at para. 114). Section 22(3) is simply a legislative restatement of the doctrine of federal paramountcy.\n[132] Under the doctrine of federal paramountcy, the provisions of a valid federal law prevail over conflicting or inconsistent provisions of a provincial law (see Canadian Western Bank, at paras. 32 and 69; Hogg and Wright, at \u00a7 16:1; Brun, Tremblay and Brouillet, at para. VI\u20112.69; Monahan, Shaw and Ryan, at p. 133; Beaudoin, at p. 354; G. R\u00e9gimbald and D. Newman, The Law of the Canadian Constitution (2nd ed. 2017), at \u00a75.73). Although paramountcy is a judicial doctrine whose scope and application are matters for the courts rather than Parliament or the legislatures (Reference re Remuneration of Judges of the Provincial Court of Prince Edward Island, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 3, at para. 98; Toronto (City) v. Ontario (Attorney General), 2021 SCC 34, at para. 56), this does not prevent Parliament or a legislature from declaring its understanding of federal paramountcy \u201c[f]or greater certainty\u201d, as Parliament has done in s. 22(3), where these words precede its explanation. But it is ultimately for the courts to adjudicate any alleged conflict between federal law and provincial law and to make any necessary declaration of paramountcy.\n[133] As a result, s. 22(3) of the Act does not alter the architecture of the Constitution.\nVIII. Conclusion\n[134] Developed in cooperation with Indigenous peoples, the Act represents a significant step forward on the path to reconciliation. It forms part of the implementation of the UNDRIP by Parliament. It also responds to call to action No. 4 made by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which calls upon the federal government to establish national standards and to affirm the role of Indigenous governments in the area of child and family services. The Act creates space for Indigenous groups, communities and peoples to exercise their jurisdiction to care for their children. The recognition of this jurisdiction invites Indigenous communities to work with the Crown to weave together Indigenous, national and international laws in order to protect the well\u2011being of Indigenous children, youth and families.\n[135] The pith and substance of the Act , taken in its entirety, is to protect the well\u2011being of Indigenous children, youth and families by promoting the delivery of culturally appropriate child and family services and, in so doing, to advance the process of reconciliation with Indigenous peoples. This important legislative initiative falls squarely within Parliament\u2019s legislative jurisdiction under s. 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867 .\n[136] For these reasons, the following reference question:\nIs the Act respecting First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis children, youth and families ultra vires the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada under the Constitution of Canada?\nis answered as follows:\nNo.\n[137] Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal of the Attorney General of Quebec and allow the appeal of the Attorney General of Canada.\nAppeal of the Attorney General of Quebec dismissed.

Police then obtained a production order compelling the Internet service provider (\u201cISP\u201d) to disclose the name and address of the customer for each IP address. Police used this subscriber information to seek and execute search warrants. B was arrested.\nB challenged the request by police to obtain the IP addresses from the processing company, alleging it violated his right against unreasonable search and seizure under s. 8 of the Charter . The trial judge held that the police\u2019s request to the processing company was not a search under s. 8 of the Charter because B did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in his IP address; therefore, B\u2019s s. 8 right was not engaged. B was convicted of 14 offences related to the fraudulent online purchases. The majority of the Court of Appeal agreed that B had no reasonable expectation of privacy in his IP addresses and dismissed B\u2019s conviction appeal. The dissenting judge would have allowed the appeal, on the basis that a reasonable expectation of privacy attached to the IP addresses.\nHeld (Wagner C.J. and C\u00f4t\u00e9, Rowe and O\u2019Bonsawin JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered.\nPer Karakatsanis, Martin, Kasirer, Jamal and Moreau JJ.: If s. 8 of the Charter is to meaningfully protect the online privacy of Canadians in today\u2019s overwhelmingly digital world, it must protect their IP addresses. An IP address is the crucial link between an Internet user and their online activity. Viewed normatively, it is the key to unlocking a user\u2019s Internet activity and, ultimately, their identity. Thus, an IP address attracts a reasonable expectation of privacy. Accordingly, a request by the state for an IP address is a search under s. 8 of the Charter .\nSection 8 of the Charter guarantees the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure. Its principal object is the protection of privacy, including informational privacy, that is, the claim of individuals, groups, or institutions to determine for themselves when, how and to what extent information about them is communicated to others. Personal privacy is vital to individual dignity, autonomy, and personal growth. Its protection is a basic prerequisite to the flourishing of a free and healthy democracy.\nTo establish a breach of s. 8, a claimant must first show that there was a search or seizure. A search occurs where the state invades a reasonable expectation of privacy. An expectation of privacy is reasonable where the public\u2019s interest in being left alone by the government outweighs the government\u2019s interest in intruding on the individual\u2019s privacy to advance its goals, notably those of law enforcement. Courts analyze an expectation of privacy by considering many interrelated but often competing factors, which can be grouped together under four categories: (1) the subject matter of the search; (2) the claimant\u2019s interest in the subject matter; (3) the claimant\u2019s subjective expectation of privacy; and (4) whether the subjective expectation of privacy was objectively reasonable. In the case at bar, the parties agreed that B had a direct interest in the IP addresses and a subjective expectation of privacy in their informational content.\nWith respect to the subject matter of the search, it is defined not only in terms of the information itself, but also the tendency of information sought to support inferences in relation to other personal information. A court must take a holistic view of the subject matter and must be especially careful in describing the subject matter of a search touching electronic data. The approach must not be mechanical, and it must reflect technological reality. The subject matter of the search in the instant case was the information that IP addresses could reveal about specific Internet users including, ultimately, their identity. Recognizing that police wanted the IP address \u2014 as the link between a specific subscriber and location and particular Internet activity \u2014 to obtain more information about the user lets the court assess the expectation of privacy in relation to all the information this IP address tends to reveal.\nWith respect to whether a subjective expectation of privacy is objectively reasonable, courts must look to the totality of the circumstances. While there is no definitive list of factors, courts have often focussed on control over the subject matter, the place of the search, and the private nature of the subject matter. In the informational privacy context, the claimant\u2019s control over the subject matter is not determinative. The Internet requires that users reveal subscriber information to their ISP to participate in this new public square, and Canadians are not required to become digital recluses in order to maintain some semblance of privacy in their lives. Nor is the place where the search occurred detrimental to a reasonable expectation of privacy in such a context. Online spaces are qualitatively different from physical spaces. The information the Internet harbours can reveal much more than information subject to the limits of physical space. Therefore, a lack of physical intrusion reveals little about the reasonableness of an expectation of privacy.\nAs to the private nature of the subject matter, s. 8 seeks to protect a biographical core of personal information which individuals in a free and democratic society would wish to maintain and control from dissemination to the state. The biographical core is not limited to identity, but includes information which tends to reveal intimate details of the lifestyle and personal choices of the individual. Section 8\u2019s emphasis on such information means that a reasonable expectation of privacy is assessed normatively rather than simply descriptively. It cannot be assessed according to only one particular use of the evidence; nor can its reach be determined according to the police\u2019s specific intention in seeking the information. Rather, the purpose of s. 8, appreciated normatively, requires asking what information the subject matter of the search tends to reveal. As the link that connects specific Internet activity to a specific location, an IP address may betray deeply personal information, even before police try to link the address to the user\u2019s identity. Moreover, activity associated with the IP address can be correlated with other online activity associated with that address available to the state. An IP address can also set the state on a trail of Internet activity that leads directly to a user\u2019s identity, even without a warrant compelling an ISP to disclose the name and address of the customer for the IP address. Access to IP addresses without judicial pre-authorization poses intense privacy risks.\nDefining a reasonable expectation of privacy is an exercise in balance. In this case, the balance weighs in favour of extending a reasonable expectation of privacy to IP addresses. The intensely private nature of the information an IP address may betray strongly suggests that the public\u2019s interest in being left alone should prevail over the government\u2019s interest in advancing its law enforcement goals. The Internet has exponentially increased both the quality and quantity of information stored about Internet users, spanning the most public and the most private human behaviour. The Internet has not only allowed private corporations to track their users, but also to build profiles of their users filled with information the users never knew they were revealing. By concentrating this mass of information with private third parties and granting them the tools to aggregate and dissect that data, the Internet has essentially altered the topography of privacy under the Charter . It has added a third party to the constitutional ecosystem, making the horizontal relationship between the individual and the state tripartite. Though third parties are not themselves subject to s. 8, they mediate a relationship which is directly governed by the Charter \u2014 that between defendant and police. This shift has enhanced the state\u2019s informational capacity.\nWeighed against these substantial privacy concerns is society\u2019s sometimes conflicting but legitimate interest in the need for safety and security. Police should have the investigative tools to deal with crime that is committed and facilitated online. However, requiring that police obtain prior judicial authorization before obtaining an IP address is not an onerous investigative step. Where the IP address, or the subscriber information, is sufficiently linked to the commission of a crime, judicial authorization is readily available. Recognizing that an IP address attracts s. 8 protection aims to make sure police investigations better reflect what each reasonable Canadian expects from a privacy perspective and from a crime control perspective. Judicial oversight narrows the state\u2019s online reach and removes the decision to disclose information \u2014 and how much to disclose \u2014 from private corporations and returns it to the purview of the Charter .\nPer Wagner C.J. and C\u00f4t\u00e9, Rowe and O\u2019Bonsawin JJ. (dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed. B did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the IP addresses on the credit card processor\u2019s servers and the ISP they revealed. The police did not need judicial authorization before asking the processor for the IP addresses in order to determine the ISP associated with them. However, this conclusion does not foreclose the possibility that someone may have a reasonable expectation of privacy on different facts.\nSection 8 of the Charter is meant to protect against state intrusion on an individual\u2019s privacy and comes into play only where a person\u2019s reasonable expectations of privacy are somehow diminished by an investigatory technique. The reasonable expectation of privacy test is fact-specific and contextual and depends on the totality of the circumstances of a particular case. The test is normative, not descriptive. Its objective is to determine what degree of privacy one ought to have, not what degree of privacy one actually has.\nIdentifying the subject matter of the search is a key question in the totality of the circumstances analysis. To identify the subject matter of the search, the court must examine the connection between the police investigative technique and the privacy interest at stake. It must consider not only the nature of the precise information sought, but also the nature of the information that it reveals. The court is concerned with the capacity of the precise information sought to give rise to inferences or to reveal further information. These inferences and this further information form part of the true subject matter of the search. Once the subject matter of the search is identified, the question then becomes whether a subjective expectation of privacy in the subject matter of the search is objectively reasonable. Whether an expectation of privacy is reasonable depends on several factors. These may include the place of the search, control over the subject matter of the search, the private nature of the subject matter, whether the subject matter was in public view, whether the subject matter was abandoned, whether the subject matter was already in the hands of third parties, whether the search method was intrusive in relation to the privacy interest at stake, whether the search method was itself unreasonable, and whether the search exposed core biographical information. Not all factors will be relevant to the analysis in a particular case and no single factor is determinative.\nIn the instant case, the factors relevant to the reasonableness inquiry are the private nature of the subject matter, control over the subject matter, and the place of the search. The private nature of the subject matter of a purported search can support a finding that an expectation of privacy is reasonable. The issue is not simply whether the subject matter itself is private, but also whether it can reveal other essential private information. This factor is of particular importance with respect to informational privacy interests. Where informational privacy alone is at stake, it may be all but essential that the information itself be private in order for a reasonable expectation of privacy to exist. Control over the subject matter of the search generally supports a finding that there was a reasonable expectation of privacy, while lack of control may weigh against such a finding. The place of the search informs the reasonableness of any expectation of privacy in it. The idea of place essentially relates to the concept of territorial privacy and necessarily assumes less significance in cases which engage informational privacy.\nThere is disagreement with the majority\u2019s assessment of the subject matter of the supposed search in the instant case. The majority includes in the subject matter every step leading up to the ultimate identification of the suspect, notwithstanding the fact that such information is not revealed by the IP addresses alone, according to the evidence in the record. The correct way to characterize the subject matter of the search is to describe it as the IP addresses and the ISP revealed by them.\nB\u2019s subjective expectation of privacy in the subject matter of the search was not objectively reasonable. The IP addresses at issue were not private and did not, on the facts of the case, reveal private information. Without more, all an IP address reveals to the police is a user\u2019s ISP \u2014 hardly a particularly private matter, let alone core biographical information. In addition, the factor of control points away from a finding that B\u2019s expectation of privacy was reasonable. B had little control over the IP addresses, which an ISP can change at will and without notice. An Internet user who leaves behind IP address data completely loses control over what happens to those numbers. Finally, the alleged search was not carried out at B\u2019s home. The place of the search was the credit card processor\u2019s database. Its location does not enhance the objective reasonableness of B\u2019s subjective expectation of privacy.\nCases Cited\nBy Karakatsanis J.\nReferred to: R. v.

Introduction\n[1] The Internet has shifted much of the human experience from physical spaces to cyberspace. It has grown to encompass public squares, libraries, markets, banks, theatres, and concert halls, becoming the most expansive cultural artifact our species has ever created. Along with our shopping mall and our town hall, for many of us, the Internet has become a constant companion, through which we confide our hopes, aspirations, and fears. Individuals use the Internet not only to find recipes, pay bills, or get directions, but also to explore their sexualities, to map out their futures, and to find love.\n[2] These new realities have forced courts to grapple with \u201ca host of new and challenging questions about privacy\u201d (R. v. Spencer, 2014 SCC 43, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 212, at para. 1). In Spencer, this Court determined that a reasonable expectation of privacy attaches to subscriber information \u2014 the name, address, and contact information \u2014 associated with an individual Internet Protocol (IP) address. A request for this information by the state is a \u201csearch\u201d under s. 8 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .\n[3] This appeal asks whether an IP address itself attracts a reasonable expectation of privacy. The answer must be yes.\n[4] An IP address is a unique identification number. IP addresses identify Internet-connected activity and enable the transfer of information from one source to another. They are necessary to access the Internet. An IP address identifies the source of every online activity and connects that activity (through a modem) to a specific location. And an Internet Service Provider (ISP) keeps track of the subscriber information that attaches to each IP address.\n[5] But because IP addresses consist of numbers that can usually be changed by an ISP without notice, the Crown submits \u2014 and the majority of the Court of Appeal agreed \u2014 that an IP address does not attract a reasonable expectation of privacy. Here, the Crown contends that police were after no more than the collection of numbers that would ultimately allow them to obtain the production order contemplated by Spencer. Thus, the Crown reasons, the state did not infringe on the appellant\u2019s right to privacy because Spencer sufficiently protected his personal information.\n[6] I respectfully disagree. This analysis runs counter to this Court\u2019s jurisprudence under s. 8 of the Charter . We have never approached privacy piecemeal, based on police\u2019s stated intention to use the information they gather in only one way. The right against unreasonable search and seizure, like all Charter rights, must receive a broad and purposive interpretation, reflective of its constitutional source. Since Hunter v. Southam Inc., [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145, we have held that s. 8 seeks to prevent breaches of privacy, rather than to condemn or condone breaches based on the state\u2019s ultimate use of that information. Privacy, once breached, cannot be restored.\n[7] To that end, our Court has applied a normative standard to reasonable expectations of privacy. We have defined s. 8 in terms of what privacy should be \u2014 in a free, democratic, and open society \u2014 balancing the individual\u2019s right to be left alone against the community\u2019s insistence on protection. This normative standard demands we take a broad, functional approach to the subject matter of the search and that we focus on its potential to reveal personal or biographical core information (R. v. Marakah, 2017 SCC 59, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 608, at para. 32).\n[8] Informational privacy is particularly critical \u2014 and particularly challenging. Our jurisprudence recognizes that computers are unique and present privacy risks that differ from s. 8\u2019s traditional objects. Thus, this Court has determined that s. 8 generally prevents police from seizing a computer without a warrant \u2014 even though the device itself provides no information without judicial permission to search its contents \u2014 because seizing the computer gives the state the means through which to access its content (R. v. Reeves, 2018 SCC 56, [2018] 3 S.C.R. 531, at para. 34).\n[9] Casting the subject matter of this search as an abstract string of numbers used solely to obtain a Spencer warrant goes against these precedents. IP addresses are not just meaningless numbers. Rather, as the link that connects Internet activity to a specific location, IP addresses may betray deeply personal information \u2014 including the identity of the device\u2019s user \u2014 without ever triggering a warrant requirement. The specific online activity associated with the state\u2019s search can itself tend to reveal highly private information. Correlated with other online information associated with that IP address, such as that volunteered by private companies or otherwise collected by the state, an IP address can reveal a range of highly personal online activity. And when associated with the profiles created and maintained by private third parties, the privacy risks associated with IP addresses rise exponentially. The information collected, aggregated and analyzed by these third parties lets them catalogue our most intimate biographical information. Viewed normatively and in context, an IP address is the first digital breadcrumb that can lead the state on the trail of an individual\u2019s Internet activity. It may betray personal information long before a Spencer warrant is sought.\n[10] And the Internet has concentrated this mass of information with private third parties operating beyond the Charter \u2019s reach. In this way, the Internet has fundamentally altered the topography of informational privacy under the Charter by introducing third-party mediators between the individual and the state \u2014 mediators that are not themselves subject to the Charter . Private corporations respond to frequent requests by law enforcement and can volunteer all activity associated with the requested IP address. Private corporate citizens can volunteer granular profiles of an individual user\u2019s Internet activity over days, weeks, or months without ever coming under the aegis of the Charter . This information can strike at the heart of a user\u2019s biographical core and can ultimately be linked back to a user\u2019s identity, with or without a Spencer warrant. It is a deeply intrusive invasion of privacy.\n[11] Weighed against society\u2019s legitimate interest in privacy is society\u2019s legitimate interest in \u201c[s]afety, security and the suppression of crime\u201d (R. v. Tessling, 2004 SCC 67, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 432, at para. 17). While the right to be left alone must keep pace with technological developments, the way in which crime is committed and investigated also evolves. Easy access to the Internet and user anonymity combine to facilitate the commission of crime and challenge effective law enforcement. Clearly, the particularly insidious nature of much online crime, including child pornography and luring, presents serious and pressing social harm. Police must have the tools to investigate these crimes. And when an IP address (or subscriber information) is clearly linked to a crime \u2014 as it obviously can be for child pornography or luring \u2014 prior judicial authorization is readily available. A production order for an IP address would require little additional information to what police must already provide for a Spencer warrant. Both society\u2019s interest in effective law enforcement and its interest in protecting the informational privacy rights of all Canadians must be respected and balanced.\n[12] On balance, the burden imposed on the state by recognizing a reasonable expectation of privacy in IP addresses is not onerous. This recognition adds another step to criminal investigations by requiring that the state show grounds to intrude on privacy online. But in the age of telewarrants, this hurdle is easily overcome where the police seek the IP address in the investigation of a criminal offence. Section 8 protection would let police pursue the Internet activity related to their law enforcement goals while barring them from freely seeking the IP address associated with online activity not related to the investigation. Judicial oversight would also remove the decision of whether to reveal information \u2014 and how much to reveal \u2014 from private corporations and return it to the purview of the Charter .\n[13] As a crucial component inherent in the structure of the Internet, an IP address is the key that can lead the state through the maze of a user\u2019s Internet activity and is the link through which intermediaries can volunteer that user\u2019s information to the state. Thus, s. 8 ought to protect IP addresses. Doing so would safeguard the first \u201cdigital breadcrumb\u201d and shroud the trail of an Internet user\u2019s journey through cyberspace; it would further s. 8\u2019s purpose of preventing potential infringements of privacy rather than circumscribe its scope according to the state\u2019s stated intentions about how it will use this key.\n[14] I would allow the appeal. There is a reasonable expectation of privacy in an IP address. A request by the state for an IP address constitutes a search.\nII. Background\n[15] The appellant, Andrei Bykovets, was convicted of 14 offences for using unauthorized credit card data to buy gift cards online, using those gift cards to make purchases in store, and possessing material related to credit card fraud.\n[16] During the Calgary Police Service\u2019s investigation into fraudulent online purchases from a liquor store, police learned that the store\u2019s online sales were managed by Moneris, a third-party payment processing company. Police contacted Moneris to obtain the IP addresses used for the transactions, and Moneris voluntarily identified two. Police then obtained a production order compelling the addresses\u2019 ISP to disclose the subscriber information \u2014 the name and address of the customer \u2014 for each IP address, as required by Spencer. One was registered to the appellant, the other to his father.\n[17] Police then used this subscriber information to seek and execute search warrants for the residential addresses of the appellant and his father. The appellant was arrested, convicted after a trial, and his convictions were confirmed on appeal.\n[18] Before trial, the appellant alleged that the police\u2019s request to Moneris violated his right against unreasonable search and seizure under s. 8 of the Charter . The key issue on the voir dire was whether the appellant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his IP address.\n[19] Defence counsel submitted a forensic investigator\u2019s expert report providing a technical summary of IP addresses and their functions. The report showed that there are internal and external IP addresses. External IP addresses are used to transfer information across the Internet from one source to another through a modem rented from the ISP. An external IP address is much like the street address of an individual\u2019s house. Without one, a user can neither send nor receive data. A modem or router also assigns an internal IP address to each device on a local network, roughly equivalent to the individual rooms in a house.\n[20] IP addresses can also be static or dynamic. Most are dynamic, meaning that the ISP can change a user\u2019s external IP address without notice and for any number of reasons. ISPs keep a record of which subscriber each external IP address was assigned to and for what time period.\n[21] A user\u2019s ISP can be determined by entering their IP address into an IP lookup website. The police can then request subscriber information for the assigned IP address from the ISP, as contemplated by Spencer. That said, the expert explained that one may still take steps to determine a user\u2019s identity, without resorting to an ISP, through the information logged on the website of a third-party company. Third-party companies, such as Google or Facebook, can track the external IP addresses of each user who visits their site and log this information to varying degrees. These companies can determine the identity of those individual users based on their Internet activity on their sites (expert report, reproduced in A.R., at p. 311). The effect is compounded when information from multiple sites is collected (p. 312).\n[22] Thus, in the expert\u2019s view, if those seeking to identify a particular Internet user have access to information logged by third-party companies, \u201cit is not necessary to obtain ISP-held subscriber information in order to accurately identify a particular internet user\u201d (p. 312).\nIII. Decisions Below\nA. Court of Queen\u2019s Bench of Alberta, 2020 ABQB 70, 10 Alta. L.R. (7th) 103 (Ho J.)\n[23] The trial judge held that the police\u2019s request to Moneris was not a search under s. 8 of the Charter because the appellant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in his IP address. Considering the factors laid down by this Court in Tessling, she defined the subject matter of the alleged search as IP addresses sought for the purpose of furthering the investigation. She considered the expert report and reasoned that, on their own, IP addresses do not provide a link to, or any other information about, an Internet user (para. 44).\n[24] As a result, the appellant\u2019s subjective expectation of privacy in his IP address was not reasonable because the IP address did not disclose a \u201cbiographical core of personal information\u201d without access to a third-party website (para. 56). The trial judge saw \u201clittle to be gained from a normative perspective\u201d by \u201crequiring the police to seek judicial authorization\u201d when accessing the IP address itself rather than when accessing the subscriber information connected to that IP address (para. 64, citing Spencer).\nB. Court of Appeal of Alberta, 2022 ABCA 208, [2023] 5 W.W.R. 51 (Schutz and Crighton JJ.A., Veldhuis J.A. Dissenting)\n[25] The majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, largely for the reasons of the trial judge. Schutz and Crighton JJ.A. agreed that the appellant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in his IP address because, standing alone, it reveals nothing of a person\u2019s lifestyle or core biographical information. What little information the IP address communicated was overwhelmed by \u201clegitimate countervailing concerns\u201d: \u201c. . . safety, security, and the suppression of crime . . .\u201d (para. 22).\n[26] In dissent, Veldhuis J.A. would have allowed the appeal because the trial judge did not \u201cundertake her analysis with the normative approach in mind\u201d (para. 62). Properly characterized, the subject matter of the search was not the IP address itself, but \u201cthe identity of an internet user which corresponds to a particular IP address that is linked to a particular, monitored internet activity\u201d (para. 77).\n[27] Veldhuis J.A. concluded that the appellant\u2019s expectation of privacy in that subject matter was reasonable. A person communicating financial information to make an online purchase would expect the IP address used to remain private, and that information was of a private nature because it could identify an Internet user \u201cwithout any requirement for reasonable suspicion or grounds to support judicial authorization\u201d (para. 88). Thus, a reasonable expectation of privacy attached to these IP addresses because \u201cthey were linked to a particular, monitored internet activity that could disclose biographical core information\u201d (para. 94).\nIV. Analysis\n[28] This appeal raises a single issue: Does a reasonable expectation of privacy attach to an IP address? In my view, the answer is yes. As I will explain, an IP address is the crucial link between an Internet user and their online activity. Thus, the subject matter of this search was the information these IP addresses could reveal about specific Internet users including, ultimately, their identity. To find that s. 8 does not extend to an IP address because police collected it only to obtain a Spencer warrant ignores the information it can reveal without a warrant. Such an analysis reflects piecemeal reasoning based on how the state intends to use the information in a specific case, contrary to the broad, purposive approach required by s. 8\u2019s constitutional status. Nor can the analysis be limited to the privacy interests affected by what the IP address can reveal on its own, without consideration of what it can reveal in combination with other available information, particularly from third-party websites. Viewed normatively, an IP address is the key to unlocking a user\u2019s Internet activity and, ultimately, their identity, such that it attracts a reasonable expectation of privacy. If s. 8 is to meaningfully protect the online privacy of Canadians in today\u2019s overwhelmingly digital world, it must protect their IP addresses.\nA. Legal Framework\n[29] Section 8 of the Charter guarantees \u201cthe right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure\u201d. Its principal object is the protection of privacy, or the individual\u2019s \u201cright to be left alone\u201d (R. v. Edwards, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 128, at para. 67). Personal privacy is vital to individual dignity, autonomy, and personal growth (R. v. Jones, 2017 SCC 60, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 696, at para. 38). Its protection is a basic prerequisite to the flourishing of a free and healthy democracy.\n[30] To establish a breach of s. 8, a claimant must show there was a search or seizure, and that the search or seizure was unreasonable. Only the first requirement \u2014 whether the request for the IP addresses was a search \u2014 is at issue here.\n[31] A search occurs where the state invades a reasonable expectation of privacy. An expectation of privacy is reasonable where the public\u2019s interest in being left alone by the government outweighs the government\u2019s interest in intruding on the individual\u2019s privacy to advance its goals, notably those of law enforcement (Hunter, at pp. 159-60). Courts analyze an expectation of privacy by considering many interrelated but often competing factors, which can be grouped together under four categories: (1) the subject matter of the search; (2) the claimant\u2019s interest in the subject matter; (3) the claimant\u2019s subjective expectation of privacy; and (4) whether the subjective expectation of privacy was objectively reasonable (Spencer, at para. 18, citing Tessling, at para. 32).\n[32] This case is about informational privacy, or \u201cthe claim of individuals, groups, or institutions to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others\u201d (Tessling, at para. 23, quoting A. F. Westin, Privacy and Freedom (1970), at p. 7). In other words, this aspect of privacy is concerned with \u201cinformational self-determination\u201d (Jones, at para. 39).\n[33] The parties agree that the appellant had a direct interest in the IP addresses and a subjective expectation of privacy in their informational content. In the next sections, I address the subject matter of the search and whether the appellant\u2019s expectation of privacy in that subject matter was reasonable.\nB. The Subject Matter of the Search\n[34] Considering the subject matter of the alleged search allows the court to identify the privacy interests at issue (Spencer, at para. 22). A guiding question in defining the subject matter of the alleged search is \u201cwhat were the police really after?\u201d (Marakah, at para. 15, citing R. v. Ward, 2012 ONCA 660, 112 O.R. (3d) 321, at para. 67). A court must take a holistic view of the subject matter of the search. The approach must not be mechanical, and it must reflect technological reality (Spencer, at paras. 26 and 31; Marakah, at para. 17).\n[35] Here, the appellant asks us to adopt the dissenting judge\u2019s characterization of the subject matter. What the police were really after, he says, was \u201cto connect an internet activity to a specific person. Obtaining an IP address was an essential step in identifying the internet user responsible for specific internet activity\u201d (A.F., at para. 37).\n[36] The respondent Crown argues for the characterization of the trial judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal. Police \u201cwanted the IP addresses to further [their] investigation\u201d (R.F., at para. 53).\n[37] In my view the trial judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal adopted an artificially narrow description of the subject matter of this alleged search. It is at odds with our precedents\u2019 normative approach and fails to capture the privacy interests at stake in this case.\n[38] This Court has never described the constitutional right to privacy according to the state\u2019s declared intention, or according to one particular use of the information. Rather, we have consistently taken a broad and functional approach to the subject matter of the search, \u201cexamining the connection between the police investigative technique and the privacy interest at stake\u201d (Spencer, at para. 26). The subject matter is defined not only in terms of the information itself, but also \u201cthe tendency of information sought to support inferences in relation to other personal information\u201d (para. 31). In Marakah, for example, the issue was whether the sender of a text message has a reasonable expectation of privacy in that text message on the recipient\u2019s device. Writing for the majority, McLachlin C.J. determined that the subject matter of the search was not the recipient\u2019s telephone, or even the text message itself, but an \u201celectronic conversation\u201d including \u201cany inferences about associations and activities that can be drawn from that information\u201d (para. 20).\n[39] Courts must be especially careful in describing the subject matter of a search touching electronic data (Marakah, at para. 14). In R. v. Cole, 2012 SCC 53, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 34, where police had examined the contents of a computer, this Court described the subject matter of the alleged search as \u201cthe data, or informational content of the laptop . . . not the devic[e] [itself]\u201d (para. 41 (emphasis in original)).\n[40] Similarly, in Reeves, where police had seized the appellant\u2019s shared home computer, the search was not merely for the computer itself, but \u201cultimately the data it contained about Reeves\u2019 usage, including the files he accessed, saved and deleted\u201d (para. 30). The state engaged s. 8 by seizing the computer even though police needed a warrant to search its contents because, through the seizure, police \u201cobtained the means through which to access [highly private] information\u201d (para. 34).\n[41] The same is true here. Police were not \u201creally after\u201d IP addresses in the abstract. As \u201ca collection of numbers\u201d, an IP address is of no interest to police. Rather, police were after the information an IP address tends to reveal about a specific Internet user including their online activity and, ultimately, their identity \u201cas the source, possessor or user of that information\u201d (Spencer, at para. 47). As the identifier of Internet-connected activity originating at a specific location, an IP address is a powerful tool that allows the state \u2014 with or without another warrant \u2014 to collect a user\u2019s Internet activity over the time period a particular IP address is linked to that source. Thus, as in Reeves, an IP address provided the state with the means through which to draw immediate and direct inferences about the user behind specific Internet activity. The information inferred from a device\u2019s Internet activity can be deeply personal, including linking that activity to a particular user\u2019s identity (see Spencer, at para. 47).\n[42] This description takes a broad and functional view of the subject matter. By \u201cproperly avoid[ing] a mechanical approach that defines the subject matter in terms of physical acts, spaces, or modalities of [informational] transmission\u201d, it \u201creflects the technological reality\u201d (Marakah, at para. 17). This description does not extend the shield of Charter protection to every investigatory step. Instead, it affirms that investigative techniques that reveal seemingly innocuous information must still be examined in connection with the privacy interest at stake (Spencer, at para. 26). Recognizing that police wanted the IP address \u2014 as the link between a specific subscriber and location and particular Internet activity \u2014 to obtain more information about the user lets the court assess the expectation of privacy in relation to all the information this IP address \u201ctends to reveal\u201d (Spencer, at para. 27 (emphasis in original), quoting R. v. Plant, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 281, at p. 293), and, therefore \u201cby reference to the nature of the privacy interests potentially compromised by the state action\u201d (Marakah, at para. 15, citing Ward, at para. 65 (emphasis added)).\n[43] Thus, the subject matter of this alleged search is an IP address as the key to obtaining more information about a particular Internet user including their online activity and, ultimately, their identity as the source of that information. Here, police sought to obtain that information through a production order as contemplated by Spencer. But, as the expert report states, a Spencer warrant is not the only way an IP address can reveal intimate details of an Internet user\u2019s lifestyle and personal choices. Online activity associated to the IP address may itself betray highly personal information without the safeguards of judicial pre-authorization. I turn to that issue next.\nC. Was the Expectation of Privacy Reasonable?\n[44] Section 8 is engaged only where a subjective expectation of privacy is objectively reasonable. The question, in all cases, is \u201cwhether in a particular situation the public\u2019s interest in being left alone by government must give way to the government\u2019s interest in intruding on the individual\u2019s privacy in order to advance its goals, notably those of law enforcement\u201d (Hunter, at pp. 159-60).\n[45] Courts must make this determination in the totality of the circumstances. While there is no definitive list of factors (Cole, at para. 45), courts have often focussed on the claimant\u2019s control over the subject matter, the place of the search, and the private nature of the subject matter (see, e.g., Marakah, at para. 24).\n(1) Control Over the Subject Matter\n[46] In the informational privacy context, the claimant\u2019s control over the subject matter is not determinative (Reeves, at para. 38). The self-determination at the heart of informational privacy means that individuals \u201cmay choose to divulge certain information for a limited purpose, or to a limited class of persons, and nonetheless retain a reasonable expectation of privacy\u201d (Jones, at para. 39). Anonymity is a particularly important conception of privacy when it comes to the Internet (Spencer, at para. 45, citing Westin, at p. 32).\n[47] Our approach is distinct from that of the United States, where the so\u2011called \u201cthird-party doctrine\u201d negates a reasonable expectation of privacy \u201cif information is possessed or known by third parties\u201d (T. Panneck, \u201cIncognito Mode Is in the Constitution\u201d (2019), 104 Minn. L. Rev. 511, at p. 520, quoting D. J. Solove, \u201cA Taxonomy of Privacy\u201d (2006), 154 U. Pa. L. Rev. 477, at p. 528). This Court rejected the American approach at an early stage of our s. 8 jurisprudence (R. v. Dyment, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 417, at pp. 429-30, per La Forest J.).\n[48] The non-determinative nature of control in our analysis is particularly relevant for the Internet, which requires that users reveal subscriber information to their ISP to participate in this new public square. As we said in Jones, \u201cthe only way to retain control over the subject matter of the search vis-\u00e0-vis the service provider was to make no use of its services at all. That choice is not a meaningful one. . . . Canadians are not required to become digital recluses in order to maintain some semblance of privacy in their lives\u201d (para. 45).\n(2) The Place of the Search\n[49] Nor is the place where the search occurred detrimental to a reasonable expectation of privacy here. This factor was largely developed in the context of territorial privacy, and digital subject matter \u201cdoes not fit easily within the strictures set out by the jurisprudence\u201d (Marakah, at para. 27). As this Court recently remarked, \u201conline spaces are qualitatively different\u201d from physical spaces (R. v. Ramelson, 2022 SCC 44, at para. 49 (emphasis in original)).\n[50] The architecture of the Internet has led to a broad, accurate, and continuously expanding permanent record \u201cwithout precedent in our society\u201d (R. v. Vu, 2013 SCC 60, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 657, at para. 40 (emphasis in original), quoting A. D. Gold, \u201cApplying Section 8 in the Digital World: Seizures and Searches\u201d, prepared for the 7th Annual Six-Minute Criminal Defence Lawyer (June 9, 2007), at para. 3). The information the Internet harbours can reveal much more than information subject to the limits of physical space (see Vu, at paras. 44 and 47). Therefore, the lack of physical intrusion highlighted by the trial judge tells us little about the reasonableness of an expectation of privacy.\n(3) The Private Nature of the Subject Matter\n[51] Section 8 seeks \u201cto protect a biographical core of personal information which individuals in a free and democratic society would wish to maintain and control from dissemination to the state\u201d (Plant, at p. 293). The \u201cbiographical core\u201d is not limited to identity, but \u201cinclude[s] information which tends to reveal intimate details of the lifestyle and personal choices of the individual\u201d (p. 293).\n[52] Section 8\u2019s emphasis on information which individuals \u201cwould wish to maintain and control from dissemination to the state\u201d means that a reasonable expectation of privacy is assessed normatively rather than simply descriptively (Spencer, at para. 27, quoting Plant, at p. 293). The normative approach has an aspirational quality. \u201cThe question is whether the privacy claim must \u2018be recognized as beyond state intrusion absent constitutional justification if Canadian society is to remain a free, democratic and open society\u2019\u201d (Reeves, at para. 28, quoting Ward, at para. 87). Thus, s. 8 will extend as far as privacy ought to extend to protect individual dignity, autonomy, and personal growth, and no further. Or, as Doherty J.A. put it, recognizing a reasonable expectation of privacy means \u201cthe impugned state conduct has reached the point at which the values underlying contemporary Canadian society dictate that the state must respect the personal privacy of individuals unless it is able to constitutionally justify any interference with that personal privacy\u201d (Ward, at para. 82). This analysis is inevitably \u201claden with value judgments which are made from the independent perspective of the reasonable and informed person who is concerned about the long-term consequences of government action for the protection of privacy\u201d (R. v. Patrick, 2009 SCC 17, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 579, at para. 14).\n[53] Thus, a reasonable expectation of privacy, as s. 8\u2019s operative component, cannot be assessed according to only one particular use of the evidence. Nor can its reach be determined according to the police\u2019s specific intention in seeking the information. Rather, the purpose of s. 8, appreciated normatively, requires that we ask what information the subject matter of the search tends to reveal. Because this analysis seeks to determine \u201cwhether people generally have a privacy interest\u201d in the subject matter of the state\u2019s search, we consider not only the information that police seek to uncover in a particular case, but all the information that the subject matter may tend to uncover (Patrick, at para. 32).\n[54] This principle is especially clear where there is a search of digital information. Computers are different. These devices store immense amounts of information \u2014 some of which is automatically generated and retained unbeknownst to the user \u2014 which can touch the biographical core of personal information (Vu, at para. 41). These privacy interests can be even more palpable if the device is used to connect to the Internet (Cole, at para. 47). Indeed, \u201cit is difficult to imagine a more intrusive invasion of privacy\u201d than searches concerning an individual\u2019s use of the Internet (R. v. Morelli, 2010 SCC 8, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 253, at para. 105).\n[55] The unique and heightened privacy interests in personal computer data flows from its potential to expose deeply revealing information. In Vu, this Court found that the search of a computer requires specific pre-authorization because computers are a repository for an almost limitless universe of information (at para. 41); and information relating to the user\u2019s Internet activity \u201ccan also enable investigators to access intimate details about a user\u2019s interests, habits, and identity\u201d (para. 42). Even though police in that case were merely trying to determine who lived in the home, the Court still concluded there were serious privacy interests engaged by the search.\n[56] Similarly, in Reeves, the severity of the privacy concerns arising from the seizure of a computer was unaffected by the police\u2019s specific intention to search the computer for child pornography. Rather, these concerns stemmed from \u201cthe personal or confidential nature of the data that is preserved and potentially available to police through the seizure of the computer\u201d (para. 33 (emphasis added), citing Marakah, at para. 32). The Constitution should protect against the seizure of a computer because, in doing so, police \u201cobtained the means through which to access [highly private] information\u201d (Reeves, at para. 34).\n[57] The police\u2019s specific intention to restrict the use of information in a particular case \u2014 no matter how well-intentioned \u2014 is thus irrelevant to s. 8. The \u201creasonable expectation of privacy\u201d analysis revolves around the potential of a particular subject matter to reveal an individual\u2019s biographical core to the state, not whether the IP addresses revealed information about the appellant on these facts. McLachlin C.J. made this point explicit in Marakah where she wrote that \u201cthe potential for revealing private information is a factor to consider in determining whether an electronic conversation attracts a reasonable expectation of privacy\u201d (para. 31; see also para. 32). Thus, text messages attracted a reasonable expectation of privacy regardless of whether the text messages sought revealed any information on the facts of that case.\n[58] Moreover, in applying a normative standard, it is not helpful to focus on the narrowest interpretation of the expert evidence. Rather, we must assess the evidence in its broader context, including the prevailing social realities and the impact of our decision in other circumstances. This Court has frequently taken judicial notice of these broader \u201csocial facts\u201d to \u201cconstruct a frame of reference or background context for deciding factual issues crucial to the resolution of a particular case . . . [;] they help to explain aspects of the evidence\u201d (R. v. Spence, 2005 SCC 71, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 458, at para. 57; see also P. W. Hogg and W. K. Wright, Constitutional Law of Canada (5th ed. Supp.), at \u00a7 60:8). In my view, the ever-increasing intrusion of the Internet into our private lives must be kept in mind in deciding this case. It is widely accepted that the Internet is ubiquitous and that vast numbers of Internet users leave behind them a trail of information that others gather up to different ends, information that may be pieced together to disclose deeply private details. And, as the expert evidence describes, an IP address is attached to all online activity; it is a fundamental building block to all Internet use. This social context of the digital world is necessary to a functional approach in defining the privacy interest afforded under the Charter to the information that could be revealed by an IP address.\n[59] Similarly, interveners play a critical role in this Court\u2019s adjudication \u2014 not only by identifying the consequences of particular legal decisions but also by reflecting the diversity of views that inform our normative approach. \u201cThe acceptance of intervenors is a reflection of the fact that the decision of the court on a constitutional matter will have broad public ramifications and a recognition of the fact that those who have particular interests that are affected and who can assist the court should be heard\u201d (R. J. Sharpe and K. Roach, The Charter of Rights and Freedoms (7th ed. 2021), at p. 128).\n[60] The Crown suggests that an IP address is useless without a Spencer warrant. Respectfully, I cannot agree. First, as the link that connects specific Internet activity to a specific location, an IP address may betray deeply personal information, even before police try to link the address to the user\u2019s identity. Second, activity associated with the IP address can be correlated with other online activity associated with that address available to the state \u2014 with particularly concerning consequences when coupled with access to third\u2011party\u2011held information. Finally, an IP address can set the state on a trail of Internet activity that leads directly to a user\u2019s identity, even without a Spencer warrant. The instances when an IP address may betray biographical core information are not all captured by Spencer. In light of these three points, which I elaborate below, access to IP addresses without judicial pre-authorization poses intense privacy risks, and IP addresses attract a reasonable expectation of privacy.\n[61] First, the activity associated with the IP address can itself be deeply revealing, even before any attempt to determine identity. Here, the activity was a series of financial transactions through an online intermediary, Moneris. Linked to financial intermediaries like Moneris or PayPal, an IP address can reveal all of a user\u2019s transactions on that intermediary over the period the IP address was assigned to them. For example, Moneris associated five different online transactions with these IP addresses (voir dire reasons, at paras. 7-8).\n[62] These purchases may \u201cbroadcas[t] a wealth of personal information capable of revealing personal and core biographical information about the [purchaser]\u201d (Marakah, at para. 33), from the restaurants they frequent, the destinations they visit, the hobbies they enjoy, to the health supplements they use. Internet users may even have \u201can acute privacy interest in the fact of their electronic [purchases]\u201d, especially as our marketplaces rapidly migrate online (para. 33 (emphasis in original)).\n[63] Other online activities can reveal information that goes directly to a user\u2019s biographical core. Websites offering dating services or adult pornography can give the state a depiction of the user\u2019s sexual preferences. An Internet user\u2019s history on medical, political, or other similar online chatrooms can reveal their health concerns or political views. If an IP address is not protected, this information is freely available to the state without the protection of the Charter whether or not it relates to the investigation of a particular crime.\n[64] Second, the specific activity associated to the IP address by the search can be correlated with other online activity associated to that IP address.\n[65] Without the protection of s. 8, nothing prevents the state from pre\u2011emptively collecting IP addresses and comparing that user\u2019s IP address against their database. Further, and significantly, the scope of information that an IP address can reveal is enormous if correlated against information held by a third party. Cases suggest that third parties provide this information without being asked. For example, in State v. Simmons, 190 Vt. 141 (2011), the police, after identifying a suspect, contacted MySpace, a social media site, and requested that they share the IP addresses that had accessed his MySpace profile (para. 3). MySpace provided records showing not just the IP addresses themselves, but also every time each IP address had logged into Simmons\u2019 MySpace account \u2014 including that one IP address had logged into the account \u201cmore than 100 times over the course of a week\u201d (para. 3).\n[66] As the expert explained, third-party websites can track the external IP address of each user who visits their site. Some websites, like Google, also collect massive amounts of other information such as YouTube history, Google searches, and location history. This information can be of an extremely personal nature.\n[67] A great deal of online activity is performed anonymously (Spencer, at para. 48; Ward, at para. 75). People behave differently online than they do in person (Ramelson, at para. 5). \u201cSome online locations, like search engines, allow people to explore notions that they would be loath to air in public; others, like some forms of social media, allow users to dissimulate behind veneers of their choosing\u201d (para. 46). We would not want the social media profiles we linger on to become the knowledge of the state. Nor would we want the intimately private version of ourselves revealed by the collection of key terms we have recently entered into a search engine to spill over into the offline world. Those who use the Internet should be entitled to expect that the state does not access this information without a proper constitutional basis.\n[68] Finally, link by link, an IP address can set the state on a trail of anonymous Internet activity that leads directly to a user\u2019s identity. The expert uses the example of an IP address that logs onto a particular social media profile or email account containing information from which the user\u2019s identity can be inferred, such as their name. From there, the user\u2019s identity is but a short inference away. It is not an answer to say \u2014 as Crown counsel does \u2014 that a Spencer warrant is required if the IP address is sought in relation to information that can unveil the identity of the Internet user. It cannot be left to police or private companies to determine whether the information provided on the website will (perhaps in combination with other information) assist in identifying the source of the activity, the identity of the user or otherwise compromise privacy interests.\n[69] Thus, to say that a Spencer warrant protects against the privacy concerns raised by IP addresses is simply not supported by modern technological realities. IP addresses play a crucial role in the inherent structure of the Internet. They are the means by which Internet-connected devices both send and receive data. As such, they are the key to unlocking an Internet user\u2019s online activity \u2014 the first \u201cdigital breadcrumbs\u201d on the user\u2019s cybernetic trail (Jones, at para. 42, citing S. Magotiaux, \u201cOut of Sync: Section 8 and Technological Advancement in Supreme Court Jurisprudence\u201d (2015), 71 S.C.L.R. (2d) 501, at p. 502). Those breadcrumbs may establish an Internet user\u2019s entire daily, weekly, or even monthly online activity, leading to an electronic roadmap of the user\u2019s cybernetic peregrinations (Morelli, at para. 3). Like the computer in Reeves, an IP address provides the state with the means that can lead them to a trove of personal information.\n[70] Consequently, an IP address may betray an intensely private array of information, touching directly on the intimate details of the lifestyle and personal choices of an individual user (Marakah, at para. 32; Spencer, at para. 27).\n(4) Does the Balance Weigh in Favour of a Reasonable Expectation of Privacy?\n[71] Defining a reasonable expectation of privacy is an exercise in balance. Individuals are entitled to insist on their right to be left alone by the state. \u201cAt the same time, social and economic life creates competing demands. The community wants privacy but it also insists on protection\u201d (Tessling, at para. 17).\n[72] Here, the intensely private nature of the information an IP address may betray strongly suggests that the public\u2019s interest in being left alone should prevail over the government\u2019s interest in advancing its law enforcement goals. I will elaborate.\n[73] The Internet has exponentially increased both the quality and quantity of information stored about Internet users, spanning the most public and the most private human behaviour (Ramelson, at para. 45). It is highly centralized, easily accessible, and \u201cnot filtered through human memory and motivation but can be produced as a copy of its original form\u201d (L. M. Austin, \u201cTechnological Tattletales and Constitutional Black Holes: Communications Intermediaries and Constitutional Constraints\u201d (2016), 17 Theoretical Inquiries L. 451, at p. 457). Information once revealed to the state in pieces can now be \u201ccompiled, dissected and analyzed to lend new insights into who we are as individuals or populations\u201d (Ramelson, at para. 48). An IP address attaches to each of these pieces. It is the key that links them to one another.\n[74] Even \u201cinformation that may at first blush appear mundane and outside of the biographical core may be profoundly revealing when situated in context with other data points\u201d (N. Hasan et al., Search and Seizure (2021), at p. 59). Aggregation \u201ccreates synergies. When analyzed, aggregated information can reveal new facts about a person that she did not expect would be known about her when the original, isolated data was collected\u201d (O. Tene, \u201cWhat Google Knows: Privacy and Internet Search Engines\u201d, [2008] Utah L. Rev. 1433, at p. 1458, quoting Solove, at p. 507). The ubiquity of the Internet means we must increasingly consider \u201cthe ways in which different data sets in combination with other data sets affect privacy rights\u201d (Hasan, at p. 60 (emphasis in original)).\n[75] Not only does the Internet keep an accurate permanent record, it has concentrated this mass of data in the hands of third parties, investing these third parties with immense informational power. It has given large private corporations the ability to collect vast stores of user information and to aggregate that data into sharp images of their users\u2019 online activity to determine what their users want and when they want it. In exchange, these corporations are \u201cbuilding possibly the most lasting, ponderous, and significant cultural artifact in the history of humankind\u201d (Tene, at p. 1435, quoting J. Battelle, The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture (2005), at p. 6).\n[76] The Internet has not only allowed private corporations to track their users, but also to build profiles of their users filled with information the users never knew they were revealing. \u201cBrowsing logs, for example, may provide detailed information about users\u2019 interests. Search engines may gather records of users\u2019 search terms. Advertisers may track their users across networks of websites, gathering an overview of their interests and concerns\u201d (Spencer, at para. 46). Commentators have even suggested that companies can use the data they collect to infer \u201cwhat you are going to purchase, the kind of person you are going to get into a relationship with, whether you will be good at a new job, how long you will stay at that job, and whether you\u2019ll get sick\u201d (H. Matsumi, \u201cPredictions and Privacy: Should There Be Rules About Using Personal Data to Forecast the Future?\u201d (2017), 48 Cumb. L. Rev. 149, at p. 149).\n[77] This is far from speculation. Indeed, it is common knowledge that the largest social media companies in the world use IP addresses to, for example, personalize the advertisements their users see, identify their users\u2019 preferences, and infer even more information about their users, such as their age, their gender, and their interests. When it comes to tracking users on the Internet, to paraphrase science fiction novelist William Gibson, \u201c[t]he future is already here\u201d (P. Kennedy, \u201cWilliam Gibson\u2019s Future Is Now\u201d, The New York Times, January 13, 2012 (online)).\n[78] By concentrating this mass of information with private third parties and granting them the tools to aggregate and dissect that data, the Internet has essentially altered the topography of privacy under the Charter . It has added a third party to the constitutional ecosystem, making the horizontal relationship between the individual and the state tripartite. Though third parties are not themselves subject to s. 8, they \u201cmediat[e] a relationship which is directly governed by the Charter \u2014 that between the defendant and police\u201d (A. Slane, \u201cPrivacy and Civic Duty in R v Ward: The Right to Online Anonymity and the Charter -Compliant Scope of Voluntary Cooperation with Police Requests\u201d (2013), 39 Queen\u2019s L.J. 301, at p. 311).\n[79] That shift has enhanced, rather than constrained, the state\u2019s informational capacity. \u201c[T]echnological developments are permitting government actors to expand their surveillance powers significantly, in part by tapping into detailed information collected by the private sector\u201d (A. J. Cockfield, \u201cWho Watches the Watchers? A Law and Technology Perspective on Government and Private Sector Surveillance\u201d (2003), 29 Queen\u2019s L.J. 364, at p. 406). Professor Austin describes this state of affairs as the \u201cnew public\/private nexus of surveillance\u201d, where intermediaries can \u201callo[w] the state to access the content of our communications as well as a treasure trove of other associated data\u201d (p. 453). As a result, \u201cin the context of intermediary cooperation state power is augmented\u201d (p. 458).\n[80] Even if the IP address does not itself reveal the user\u2019s identity, the prospect and ease of a Spencer warrant means that the user\u2019s identity can later be revealed, not only in relation to the potentially criminal Internet activity in question, but in relation to all the information that can be inferred from the user\u2019s Internet activity. As the appellant argues, comparing the IP address of an identified user with other online activities \u201cshatters [online] anonymity completely\u201d (A.F., at para. 45).\n[81] Some foreign jurisdictions have responded by recognizing that IP addresses amount to private information deserving of protection, even if recourse to third-party information is necessary. In Breyer v. Bundesrepublik Deutschland, C-582\/14, EU:C:2016:779, the European Court of Justice concluded that an IP address was personal data relating to an \u201cidentifiable person\u201d according to art. 2 of Directive 95\/46\/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, [1995] O.J. L. 281\/31. It did not matter if a third party was needed to make this person \u201cidentifiable\u201d: a user\u2019s IP address is itself \u201cpersonal data\u201d because the IP address can reasonably tend to reveal the user\u2019s identity \u2014 in that case, through information held by a private intermediary (para. 44).\n[82] Likewise, the Court of Appeal for England and Wales concluded that whether \u201cbrowser-generated information\u201d \u2014 such as an IP address \u2014 was personal data under the Data Protection Act 1998 (U.K.), 1998, c. 29, was a serious issue to be tried on the merits (Vidal-Hall v. Google Inc., [2015] EWCA Civ 311, [2016] Q.B. 1003, at para. 107). The court reasoned that it was clearly arguable that such information is personal data because it \u201c\u2018individuates\u2019 the individual, in the sense that they are singled out and distinguished from all others\u201d (para. 115). It was \u201cimmaterial\u201d to their finding that the information does not name the user because \u201cin most cases \u2014 including cases with dynamic IP address allocation \u2014 the necessary data will be available to identify the user(s) of the IP address\u201d (para. 117).\n[83] I agree with the intervener the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association that these authorities offer a persuasive account of the interaction between IP addresses and the normative approach our Court has consistently applied to s. 8 of the Charter . They recognize IP addresses as private information because IP addresses could reasonably reveal \u2014 that is, they tend to reveal \u2014 the identity of the user whether or not recourse to a third party is required. These authorities provide \u201csupport or confirmation\u201d for this Court\u2019s methodology towards privacy (Quebec (Attorney General) v. 9147-0732 Qu\u00e9bec inc., 2020 SCC 32, [2020] 3 S.C.R. 426, at para. 22 (emphasis in original)). Our Court has looked to comparative authorities for their persuasive force throughout its history (see N. Olivetti Rason and S. Pennicino, \u201cComparative Law in the Jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of Canada\u201d, in G. F. Ferrari, ed., Judicial Cosmopolitanism: The Use of Foreign Law in Contemporary Constitutional Systems (2019), 140, at p. 146).\n[84] Weighed against these substantial privacy concerns is society\u2019s sometimes conflicting but legitimate interest in the need for safety and security. As technology evolves, how crime is committed and investigated also evolves (R. v. Mills, 2019 SCC 22, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 320, at paras. 38-39). Easy access to the Internet and user anonymity combine to allow for the commission of a wide range of crime, including sexual offences and crimes against children. The amplified impact and permanence of harm done to victims of online crime, especially children, must be considered in defining and calibrating the law enforcement interest implicated by this appeal (see R. v. Friesen, 2020 SCC 9, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 424, at paras. 1, 5 and 50-73; Magotiaux, at p. 502). Police should have the investigative tools to deal with crime that is committed and facilitated online.\n[85] In my view, however, requiring that police obtain prior judicial authorization before obtaining an IP address is not an onerous investigative step, and it would not unduly interfere with law enforcement\u2019s ability to deal with this crime. Where the IP address, or the subscriber information, is sufficiently linked to the commission of a crime, judicial authorization is readily available and adds little to the information police must already provide for a Spencer production order. For example, under s. 487.015(1) of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , a production order for information relating to a specified transmission of a communication is available if there are reasonable grounds to suspect that an offence has been or will be committed. Police often apply for and obtain multiple authorizations to protect different territorial privacy interests. The same is true to protect informational privacy.\n[86] On balance, the burden imposed on the state by recognizing a reasonable expectation of privacy in IP addresses pales compared to the substantial privacy concerns implicated in this case. Law enforcement will need to demonstrate enough grounds to intrude on an individual\u2019s privacy but, in the age of telewarrants and around-the-clock access to justices of the peace, this burden is not onerous. Police engaging in legitimate investigatory activities can readily establish the requisite constitutional grounds. Recognizing that an IP address attracts s. 8 protection will not thwart police investigations involving IP addresses; rather, it aims to make sure police investigations better reflect what each reasonable Canadian expects from a privacy perspective and from a crime control perspective.\n[87] A reasonable expectation of privacy limits the state to searches motivated by legitimate law enforcement concerns. The benefits to privacy are significant. Judicial pre-authorization considerably narrows the state\u2019s online reach and prevents it from acquiring the details of a user\u2019s online life revealed by their IP address that are not relevant to the investigation. This significantly reduces the potential of any \u201carbitrary and even discriminatory\u201d exercises of discretion that would empower the state to identify information about any Internet user it pleases for any reason it sees fit (L. M. Austin, \u201cGetting Past Privacy? Surveillance, the Charter , and the Rule of Law\u201d (2012), 27 C.J.L.S. 381, at p. 392). In a democratic society, it is \u201cinconceivable that the state should have unrestricted discretion to target whomever it wishes for surreptitious [digital] surveillance\u201d (R. v. Wong, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 36, at p. 47).\n[88] Judicial oversight in respect of an IP address is the way to accomplish s. 8\u2019s goal of preventing infringements on privacy. Since Hunter, we have held that s. 8 seeks to prevent breaches of privacy, not to condemn or condone breaches after the fact based on the state\u2019s use of that information. Privacy, once breached, cannot be restored.\n[89] Finally, judicial oversight removes the decision to disclose information \u2014 and how much to disclose \u2014 from private corporations and returns it to the purview of the Charter . The increase in state power occasioned by the Internet is thus offset by a broad, purposive approach to s. 8 that meets our \u201cnew social, political and historical realities\u201d (Hunter, at p. 155). To leave it to the private sector to decide whether to provide police with information that may betray our most intimate selves strikes an unacceptable blow to s. 8. To leave the protection of the Charter to the next intended step in the investigation is insufficient. As I have explained, the next step might be too late.\n[90] Thus, viewed normatively, s. 8 of the Charter ought to extend a reasonable expectation of privacy to IP addresses. They provide the state with the means through which to obtain information of a deeply personal nature about a specific Internet user and, ultimately, their identity whether or not another warrant is required. An IP address plays an integral role in maintaining privacy on the Internet. It is the key to unlocking an Internet user\u2019s online activity and the key to identifying the user behind online activity. Given these serious privacy concerns, the public\u2019s interest in being left alone should prevail over the relatively straightforward burden imposed on law enforcement. Recognizing a reasonable expectation of privacy in IP addresses would ensure that the veil of privacy all Canadians expect when they access the Internet is only lifted when an independent judicial officer is satisfied that providing this information to the state will serve a legitimate law enforcement purpose.\n[91] In my view, the reasonable and informed person concerned about the long\u2011term consequences of government action for the protection of privacy would conclude that IP addresses should attract a reasonable expectation of privacy. Extending s. 8\u2019s reach to IP addresses protects the first \u201cdigital breadcrumb\u201d and therefore obscures the trail of an Internet user\u2019s journey through the cyberspace.\nV. Disposition\n[92] I would find the request by the state for an IP address is a search under s. 8 of the Charter . I would allow the appeal, set aside the conviction, and order a new trial.\nThe reasons of Wagner C.J. and C\u00f4t\u00e9, Rowe and O\u2019Bonsawin JJ. were delivered by\nC\u00f4t\u00e9 J. \u2014\nI. Introduction\n[93] In this digital age, concerns about online privacy are prevalent. So are concerns about online crime.\n[94] In this case, the Calgary police investigated a series of fraudulent purchases made online. As a result of that investigation, the appellant, Andrei Bykovets, was arrested, tried, and convicted of a number of offences relating to fraud through the use of the Internet. The police were able to identify him by taking several steps, including obtaining a production order as required by R. v. Spencer, 2014 SCC 43, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 212. The first step in the investigation was retrieving the appellant\u2019s Internet Protocol (\u201cIP\u201d) addresses from an intermediary, which the police did without a warrant. The appellant alleges that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his IP addresses, such that his rights under s. 8 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms were violated when the police obtained the IP addresses from the intermediary. According to the appellant, the police needed prior judicial authorization to obtain the addresses.\n[95] Our Court is called upon to determine whether the appellant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the IP addresses alone \u2014 without any other information linking those addresses to him as an Internet user \u2014 in the circumstances of this case. I conclude that the appellant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy. Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal.\nII. Facts\n[96] The facts are not disputed by the parties.\n[97] In September 2017, the Calgary police commenced an investigation related to the purchase of virtual gift cards using fraudulent credit card information. The purchases were made online through businesses, including a liquor store called Co\u2011op Wine Spirits Beer. The payments were processed by a subsidiary of the credit card processor, Moneris.\n[98] In the course of their investigation into the fraud, the police contacted Moneris and asked for the IP addresses associated with the purchases. Moneris provided the IP addresses shown in its logs for the transactions. The police then used a publicly\u2011accessible lookup website and learned that the IP addresses had been issued by TELUS. They obtained a production order requiring TELUS to provide the subscriber information associated with the IP addresses. One address was registered to the appellant and one was registered to his father. I note that there is no distinction between those two addresses for the purposes of this appeal.\n[99] The police then applied for and obtained warrants to search the two residences associated with the IP addresses. During the search, the police found a magnetic stripe card reader and writer, government identification bearing the names of third\u2011party individuals, computers, USB sticks, fake immigration documents, and firearms. The appellant was arrested and charged with 33 offences related to the possession and use of third parties\u2019 credit cards and personal identification documents as well as the possession and storage of firearms.\n[100] Prior to trial, the appellant applied to exclude the evidence discovered as a result of the police\u2019s use of his IP addresses, alleging that the police had infringed his rights under s. 8 of the Charter . He tendered the report of Matthew Musters, whom the trial judge qualified as an expert in electronic forensic analysis and in the nature and operation of IP addresses. The Crown consented to the admission of Mr. Musters\u2019 expert report and did not seek to cross\u2011examine him. The Crown also expressed agreement with the contents of the report.\n[101] The relevant parts of the report may be briefly summarized.\n[102] First, the report explains that there are two types of IP addresses: external and internal. This appeal concerns external IP addresses only. An external IP address is assigned to a subscriber by an Internet service provider (\u201cISP\u201d) and is used in the transfer of information across the Internet from one source to another. Without an external IP address, a user cannot send or receive data. Each external IP address is distinctly associated with one subscriber during its lease period. Most commonly, residential subscribers are assigned dynamic external IP addresses which an ISP can change at will and without notice. Each ISP keeps a record of which subscriber each external IP address was assigned to and for what period of time.\n[103] Next, the report explains that in a typical Internet browsing session, a user\u2019s external IP address is known only by the destination server (excluding any hops it went through on its way). The report describes two methods by which a user\u2019s identity can be discovered from his or her external IP address. The first involves entering the IP address into an ISP lookup website to determine which ISP owns the IP address, and then obtaining the subscriber information from the ISP. The other is based on the assumption that one is able to access the information logged by third\u2011party companies\u2019 websites. Websites are able to track the IP address of each user who visits the site. Based on that information, one could attempt to determine the identity of an individual using a company\u2019s online service by examining the user\u2019s activity on the website in question.\nIII. Judicial History\nA. Court of Queen\u2019s Bench of Alberta, 2020 ABQB 70, 10 Alta. L.R. (7th) 103 (Ho J.)\n[104] In her voir dire ruling, the trial judge stated that the primary issue to be determined in respect of s. 8 of the Charter was whether an individual has a reasonable expectation of privacy in an IP address. The Crown conceded that if the appellant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the IP addresses, then his s. 8 rights were violated. To determine whether a reasonable expectation of privacy exists, the trial judge applied the \u201ctotality of the circumstances test\u201d as set out by this Court in Spencer.\n[105] The trial judge found that the subject matter of the alleged search was the IP addresses. Both on their face and in light of what could be inferred from them, the IP addresses could only provide limited information about an Internet user. Only with other information could an IP address lead to the identification of a particular individual. In this case, the police were \u201creally after\u201d the IP addresses themselves to discover the suspected fraudster\u2019s ISP and then obtain a production order to identify him or her.\n[106] The trial judge accepted that the appellant had a direct interest and a subjective expectation of privacy in the IP addresses. However, she found that this subjective expectation of privacy was not objectively reasonable. Contrary to the appellant\u2019s submission, the search took place not in his home but in the credit card processor\u2019s database. As collections of numbers, the IP addresses did not disclose personal information or reveal intimate details of the appellant\u2019s lifestyle. The ISP was able to control the subject matter of the search through its ability to change the appellant\u2019s IP addresses, though this factor was not determinative.\n[107] Considering all the factors, the trial judge held that the appellant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the IP addresses. Therefore, his s. 8 rights were not engaged by the search. The appellant was ultimately convicted of 14 of the 33 offences with which he had been charged.\nB. Court of Appeal of Alberta, 2022 ABCA 208, [2023] 5 W.W.R. 51\n(1) Majority (Schutz and Crighton JJ.A.)\n[108] The appellant appealed and challenged the trial judge\u2019s finding that there was no breach of his s. 8 rights. The majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal and held that the trial judge had correctly interpreted the scope of s. 8 and applied the correct principles, and that her factual findings revealed no palpable and overriding error. The trial judge interpreted the subject matter of the search functionally, as she was required to do. She understood what the police were \u201creally after\u201d: IP addresses to further the investigation, in the hope that the authorized further investigation would uncover names and addresses associated with the IP addresses. The trial judge found that the IP addresses revealed no private information; the appellant therefore had no reasonable expectation of privacy in them. The majority thus agreed with the trial judge\u2019s analysis and conclusions.\n[109] The majority also agreed with the trial judge that Spencer was distinguishable because the police in this case did not obtain subscriber data in addition to the IP addresses themselves. Without that data, the police simply believed that \u201can unknown person using a known IP address was committing fraud from an unknown address\u201d, which was not enough to give rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy (para. 17). In the majority\u2019s view, an \u201cIP address is an abstract number that reveals none of the core biographical information the issuer of that IP address attaches to it. Standing alone, it reveals nothing\u201d (para. 21). Only with subscriber information could an IP address reveal personal information, and the police could only obtain that subscriber information by complying with Spencer.\n(2) Dissent (Veldhuis J.A.)\n[110] Veldhuis J.A., in dissent, would have found that the appellant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the IP addresses because they were linked to a particular, monitored Internet activity that could disclose biographical core information. Accordingly, she would have found a breach of the appellant\u2019s s. 8 rights and ordered a new trial.\n[111] Veldhuis J.A. was of the opinion that the trial judge had failed to apply the normative approach to reasonable expectations of privacy. In her view, the case was indistinguishable from Spencer. Both Spencer and this case involved an attempt by the police to identify a particular user of the Internet so that they could \u201cgather further information to draw inferences about the intimate details of the lifestyle and personal choices of the internet user\u201d (para. 62).\n[112] In Veldhuis J.A.\u2019s view, this failure to apply the normative approach led the trial judge to characterize the subject matter of the search too narrowly. She noted that the expert evidence showed how an IP address could be used to identify an Internet user from third\u2011party websites, and if there were no reasonable expectation of privacy, then there would be nothing requiring the police to obtain a warrant before doing so. For Veldhuis J.A., the true subject matter of the search, and what the police were really after, was \u201cthe identity of an internet user which corresponds to a particular IP address that is linked to a particular, monitored internet activity\u201d (para. 77). This subject matter engaged the idea of privacy as anonymity, which is very important in the context of the Internet.\n[113] According to Veldhuis J.A., the trial judge\u2019s error in characterizing the subject matter of the search led to a further error in her finding that the appellant\u2019s subjective expectation of privacy was not objectively reasonable. With respect to the place of the search as a factor in assessing such reasonableness, Veldhuis J.A. noted that s. 8 \u201cprotects people, not places\u201d, and held that a person would expect credit card information and the IP address from which it is sent to remain private. With respect to the private nature of the subject matter, Veldhuis J.A. reiterated her earlier comments about the possibility of identifying an Internet user by using an IP address, which raises privacy interests going beyond the user\u2019s name and address. With respect to control over the subject matter, Veldhuis J.A. found that control is not lost simply because an IP address can be accessed by others. She held that there is no meaningful choice between not using the Internet at all and giving up control of one\u2019s IP address.\n[114] Veldhuis J.A. concluded that the appellant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the IP addresses \u201cbecause they were linked to a particular, monitored internet activity that could disclose biographical core information\u201d (para. 94).\n[115] The appellant now appeals to this Court on the strength of Veldhuis J.A.\u2019s dissent.\nIV. Issue\n[116] The single issue in this case is whether a reasonable expectation of privacy attached to the IP addresses. If it did, then the Crown concedes that the appellant\u2019s s. 8 Charter rights were violated.\nV. Analysis\n[117] The law with respect to reasonable expectations of privacy is well\u2011established. This case calls for a straightforward application of the law to a situation where an IP address is given to the police by an online credit card processor.\n[118] Section 8 of the Charter , which provides that \u201c[e]veryone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure\u201d, is meant to protect against state intrusion on an individual\u2019s privacy. But as this Court has observed, \u201cnot every form of examination conducted by the government will constitute a \u2018search\u2019 for constitutional purposes\u201d (R. v. Evans, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 8, at para. 11). Section 8 comes into play only \u201cwhere a person\u2019s reasonable expectations of privacy are somehow diminished by an investigatory technique\u201d (ibid.).\n[119] The reasonable expectation of privacy test is fact\u2011specific and contextual. Whether someone has a reasonable expectation of privacy depends on \u201cthe totality of the circumstances of a particular case\u201d (R. v. Edwards, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 128, at para. 31). This Court has identified a non\u2011exhaustive list of factors to be considered in this regard. The relevant factors are often conveniently grouped under four main headings:\n(1) What was the subject matter of the alleged search?\n(2) Did the claimant have a direct interest in the subject matter?\n(3) Did the claimant have a subjective expectation of privacy in the subject matter?\n(4) If so, was the claimant\u2019s subjective expectation objectively reasonable?\n[120] As has often been noted, the inquiry is normative, not descriptive (R. v. Tessling, 2004 SCC 67, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 432, at para. 42; R. v. Reeves, 2018 SCC 56, [2018] 3 S.C.R. 531, at para. 28). The objective is to determine what degree of privacy one ought to have, not what degree of privacy one actually has. As Binnie J. put it in Tessling:\nIn an age of expanding means for snooping readily available on the retail market, ordinary people may come to fear (with or without justification) that their telephones are wiretapped or their private correspondence is being read. . . . Suggestions that a diminished subjective expectation of privacy should automatically result in a lowering of constitutional protection should therefore be opposed. It is one thing to say that a person who puts out the garbage has no reasonable expectation of privacy in it. It is quite another to say that someone who fears their telephone is bugged no longer has a subjective expectation of privacy and thereby forfeits the protection of s. 8. [Emphasis in original; para. 42.]\n[121] Bearing this normative approach in mind, I now turn to its application to the facts of this case. Like the trial judge, I accept that the appellant had a direct interest in the IP addresses and a subjective expectation of privacy in their informational content. The principal points of disagreement before this Court are in connection with the first and fourth parts of the analysis: the subject matter of the search, and the objective reasonableness of the expectation of privacy, specifically in relation to the private nature of the subject matter. I will address them in turn.\nA. Subject Matter of the Search\n[122] Identifying the subject matter of the search is a key question in the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d analysis. Our Court has taken a \u201cbroad and functional approach\u201d to this inquiry. The subject matter of the search must not be defined \u201cnarrowly in terms of the physical acts involved or the physical space invaded, but rather by reference to the nature of the privacy interests potentially compromised by the state action\u201d (R. v. Marakah, 2017 SCC 59, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 608, at para. 15, quoting R. v. Ward, 2012 ONCA 660, 112 O.R. (3d) 321, at para. 65). Accordingly, to identify the subject matter of the search, the court must examine the connection between the police investigative technique and the privacy interest at stake (Marakah, at para. 15). It must consider \u201cnot only the nature of the precise information sought, but also . . . the nature of the information that it reveals\u201d (Spencer, at para. 26).\n[123] When assessing the subject matter of an alleged search, the court\u2019s task is to determine \u201cwhat the police were really after\u201d (Marakah, at para. 15, quoting Ward, at para. 67). This guiding question highlights the fact that the subject matter of the search may go beyond the precise object or information obtained by the police. When the court inquires into \u201cwhat the police were really after\u201d, it is not concerned with the police\u2019s objective in the criminal investigation (i.e., why the police sought the information). Nor is it concerned with their subjective intentions. Rather, the court is concerned with the capacity of the precise information sought to give rise to inferences or to reveal further information. These inferences and this further information form part of the true subject matter of the search.\n[124] Spencer illustrates these principles. In that case, in the course of an investigation into child pornography, the police had requested subscriber information (a name and a physical address) from the ISP that owned a particular IP address. The Court disagreed with the contention that such subscriber information by itself was the true subject matter of the search. That \u201ccharacterizatio[n] gloss[es] over the significance of an IP address and what such an address, once identified with a particular individual, is capable of revealing about that individual, including the individual\u2019s online activity in the home\u201d (para. 32 (emphasis added), quoting R. v. Trapp, 2011 SKCA 143, 377 Sask. R. 246, at para. 35). Instead, this Court concluded that the subject matter of the search was \u201cthe identity of a subscriber whose Internet connection is linked to particular, monitored Internet activity\u201d (para. 33). The precise information sought \u2014 subscriber information \u2014 provided a link between a specific individual and the particular online activity associated with an anonymous IP address. All of this constituted the subject matter of the search.\n[125] Similarly, in Marakah, McLachlin C.J. held that the subject matter of the search was not merely the cell phone that had been seized by the police. Rather, it included text message conversations contained in the cell phone as well as any inferences about associations and activities \u201cthat can be drawn from th[e] information\u201d shared in those conversations (para. 20 (emphasis added)).\n[126] Finally, and importantly, while the subject matter of the search cannot be defined too narrowly, it must still be anchored to what can be drawn from the evidence itself. Specifically, the capacity of the precise information sought to give rise to inferences or to reveal further information must be supported by the evidence; it cannot be based on mere conjectures or hypotheses. This principle can be traced back through this Court\u2019s jurisprudence. In R. v. Kang\u2011Brown, 2008 SCC 18, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 456, for example, Deschamps J., dissenting, but not on this point, explained that what was significant about the dog sniff of the accused\u2019s bag was that sniffer dogs are relied on by the police with a success rate of over 92 percent and that the dogs do not simply identify the odours emanating from a bag but, by doing so, actually identify the contents of the bag (i.e., a controlled substance) (para. 174). In that case, the dog sniff therefore allowed a \u201cstrong, immediate and direct inference\u201d to be drawn about the contents of the accused\u2019s bag, which was what the police were really interested in searching (para. 175). The capacity of the precise information sought \u2014 the odours detected by the dog \u2014 to reveal other information was supported by the evidence on the record in that case.\n[127] By contrast, in R. v. Gomboc, 2010 SCC 55, [2010] 3 S.C.R. 211, the police suspected that the accused was involved in producing marijuana. They asked a utility company to install a device to measure electrical power flowing into the accused\u2019s residence. This Court relied on the evidentiary record to assess what the precise information sought (from the device) discloses and what inferences it supports. The Court of Appeal had concluded that some information about what is taking place in a house may be inferred from the device. Several members of this Court disagreed, as this finding was not supported by the evidence on the record. Instead, the record showed that the device reveals only the consumption of electricity; it reveals nothing about the intimate or core personal activities taking place inside a home (para. 14). The evidentiary record thus constrained the subject matter of the search.\n[128] In the circumstances of this case, the subject matter of the search comprises the IP addresses and the identity of their associated ISP. While the police had the ultimate goal of identifying the person alleged to have committed fraud, their investigative objective is not the focus of the \u201cbroad and functional approach\u201d for ascertaining the subject matter of the search (Spencer, at para. 26). Rather, the subject matter must reflect the information revealed by the precise information sought (Spencer, at para. 26). I disagree with Veldhuis J.A.\u2019s assertion that the subject matter was \u201cthe identity of an internet user which corresponds to a particular IP address that is linked to a particular, monitored internet activity\u201d (para. 77). While that may have been the ultimate goal of the investigation, it was not information revealed by the raw IP addresses alone, and it is therefore not the subject matter of the search.\n[129] I fully appreciate that the numbers constituting an IP address are not sought for their own sake. They are sought for the information they reveal. However, the evidentiary record in this case establishes that an IP address, on its own, reveals only limited information. It does not reveal a \u201cbiographical core of personal information which individuals in a free and democratic society would wish to maintain and control from dissemination to the state\u201d (R. v. Plant, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 281, at p. 293). On its own, an IP address does not even reveal browsing habits. What it reveals is a user\u2019s ISP \u2014 hardly a more private piece of information than electricity usage (Plant) or heat emissions (Tessling).\n[130] Only when an IP address is combined with other information can it give rise to inferences about a user\u2019s identity, which fundamentally distinguishes this case from Spencer. In Spencer, subscriber information was the key that unlocked the identity of the person behind an IP address and revealed his activities online. A reasonable expectation of privacy attached to the subscriber information because it provided the link between anonymous Internet activity and a specific person. But in the present case, there was no such link. The question, then, is this: What information do IP addresses, on their own, disclose, and what inferences do they support?\n[131] As discussed, the uncontested expert evidence in this case established that there are two methods by which a user\u2019s identity can be discovered from his or her external IP address. The first method is to identify the ISP that owns an IP address using an \u201cIP lookup website\u201d (A.R., at p. 311). The expert explained that \u201c[o]nce the ISP of a particular IP address has been identified, it is possible to determine the subscriber of the account by requesting that information from the ISP in control of that IP address\u201d (A.R., at p. 311). This is what happened in Spencer. In response, our Court held that individuals have a reasonable expectation of privacy in such subscriber information. Following Spencer, the police must now obtain a production order to acquire that information. It is noteworthy that obtaining such an order is exactly what the police did in this case.\n[132] According to the expert report, the second method by which an IP address may be used to determine the identity of an individual using the Internet is to access \u201cthe information logged by the third\u2011party company\u2019s website\u201d, which is \u201cable to track the external IP address of each user who visits\u201d (A.R., at p. 311). According to the expert, an IP address could be provided to a company like Google, and Google could use that IP address to identify a user\u2019s activity which the company tracks. This seems to have been Veldhuis J.A.\u2019s main concern, and it seems that my colleague Karakatsanis J. has the same concern.\n[133] There are two answers to this concern about third\u2011party websites.\n[134] First, on the facts of this case, the police simply did not use a third\u2011party website\u2019s tracking of the appellant in order to identify him. As the trial judge found, the police sought the IP addresses in order to investigate further, specifically to discover their associated ISP. The primary investigator\u2019s testimony was to this effect. The investigation that followed was carried out with a production order, which is consistent with this Court\u2019s judgment in Spencer. Thus, the concern does not arise here.\n[135] Second, as conceded by the Crown, such a scenario (using a third\u2011party website) seems indistinguishable from Spencer. Spencer established that a reasonable expectation of privacy may exist in the link between a user\u2019s identity and specific Internet activity. Whether the identity of an anonymous Internet user is revealed by combining his or her IP address with subscriber information held by an ISP or by combining his or her IP address with other information held by third\u2011party websites, the result is the same. The user\u2019s privacy interest in anonymity is undermined. Accordingly, as the Crown accepts, Spencer requires the police to obtain judicial authorization before requesting data of this nature \u2014 in other words, data that unveils the identity of an individual whose Internet connection is linked to particular, monitored online activity. I mention in passing that if a third\u2011party website were to spontaneously provide information without being asked, the reasonable expectation of privacy analysis \u2014 which is always guided by \u201cthe totality of the circumstances\u201d \u2014 could well be different (cf. Reeves, at para. 46). That, however, is an issue for another day in a case where the situation actually arises on the facts.\n[136] Finally, the appellant relies upon Reeves to argue that the mere fact that the police had to take further steps to identify him and link him to particular Internet activity does not mean that he lacked a reasonable expectation of privacy in the IP addresses. In my respectful view, this reliance is misplaced. In Reeves, the police had seized a computer shared by the accused and his spouse, with the latter\u2019s permission. The seizure of the computer necessarily entailed a seizure of its data. This Court held that the accused had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the computer and its data. While a warrant was indeed necessary to search the computer notwithstanding the seizure (see R. v. Vu, 2013 SCC 60, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 657, at para. 49), the seizure itself deprived the accused of control over the private data in the computer (Reeves, at para. 34). Moreover, it provided the police with possession of the data in which the accused had an interest. In this case, however, the IP addresses alone did not give the police possession of any private information about the appellant, whether immediately accessible or not. Only by obtaining a production order to require the ISP to provide the subscriber information did the police uncover constitutionally\u2011protected information, namely the link between the appellant\u2019s identity and his Internet activity.\n[137] Thus, the correct way to characterize the subject matter of the search is to describe it as the IP addresses and the ISP revealed by them. A characterization of the subject matter that goes far beyond the scope of the information actually revealed by the precise information sought by the police effectively treats an important goal of many police investigations, i.e., ultimately leading to the identification of the suspect, as conclusive of the subject matter of the search. Of course, the police were seeking to identify the person who used the IP addresses in the commission of the offences, but they were doing so through a series of steps, and the step in question here revealed only the user\u2019s ISP.\n[138] My colleague correctly recognizes that the information revealed by the IP addresses is part of the subject matter of the supposed search. However, she includes in the subject matter every step leading up to the ultimate identification of the suspect, notwithstanding the fact that such information is not revealed by the IP addresses alone, according to the evidence in the record. With respect, I believe this to be the most significant difference between her position and mine.\n[139] I add in passing that it would be inconsistent with a functional approach to defining the subject matter of the search to effectively hold that any step taken in an investigation engages a reasonable expectation of privacy. Such a holding would upset the careful balance that this Court has struck between the interest of Canadians in actual privacy and the interest of Canadians in not hindering law enforcement (see, e.g., Tessling, at para. 17; Kang\u2011Brown, at para. 10; Vu, at para. 21; R. v. Stairs, 2022 SCC 11). In rejecting a claim that there was a reasonable expectation of privacy in an online conversation with a police officer posing as a child, my colleague put the point well in her concurring reasons in R. v. Mills, 2019 SCC 22, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 320: \u201cThe alternative conclusion would significantly and negatively impact police undercover operations, including those conducted electronically, [and it] simply does not strike an appropriate balance between individual privacy and the safety and security of our children\u201d (para. 52). I view the consequences of my colleague\u2019s broad holding in this case similarly.\n[140] Thus, I conclude that the subject matter of this search was the IP addresses, i.e., the collections of numbers, and the identity of the ISP that is revealed by them. The trial judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal were correct in their determinations on this issue.\nB. Objective Reasonableness of the Expectation of Privacy\n[141] The question then becomes whether the appellant\u2019s subjective expectation of privacy in the subject matter of the search was objectively reasonable. I conclude that it was not.\n[142] Whether an expectation of privacy is reasonable depends on several factors. These may include the place of the search, control over the subject matter of the search, the private nature of the subject matter, whether the subject matter was in public view, whether the subject matter was abandoned, whether the subject matter was already in the hands of third parties, whether the search method was intrusive in relation to the privacy interest at stake, whether the search method was itself unreasonable, and whether the search exposed core biographical information (see, e.g., Tessling, at para. 32). This list is not exhaustive. No single factor is determinative.\n[143] Not all factors will be relevant to the analysis in a particular case. Considering the type of privacy interest at stake can sometimes be helpful in determining which factors are relevant.\n[144] The three types of privacy interests that emerge from the jurisprudence are personal, territorial, and informational. The last of these is what is clearly at stake in this case. Informational privacy may be defined as \u201cthe claim of individuals, groups, or institutions to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others\u201d (Tessling, at para. 23, quoting A. F. Westin, Privacy and Freedom (1970), at p. 7).\n[145] On the facts of this case and particularly in light of the informational privacy interest involved, the factors relevant to the reasonableness inquiry are the private nature of the subject matter, control over the subject matter, and the place of the search (see Marakah, at para. 24). These are the factors focused on by the parties and the courts below, and I will consider them in turn.\n[146] But before doing so, I want to address my colleague\u2019s reliance on foreign authorities as offering a \u201cpersuasive account of the interaction between IP addresses and the normative approach our Court has consistently applied to s. 8\u201d (para. 83). With respect, I am of the view that these authorities are irrelevant. To begin with, they dealt with different statutory frameworks in different countries. Breyer v. Bundesrepublik Deutschland, C\u2011582\/14, EU:C:2016:779, considered whether a person was identifiable through an IP address by the website accessed, not by the state per se. Vidal-Hall v. Google Inc., [2015] EWCA Civ 311, [2016] Q.B. 1003, simply answered the question of whether service ex juris should have been allowed in that case, and the Court of Appeal\u2019s affirmative answer was akin to refusing to strike out a pleading as disclosing no reasonable cause of action (Altimo Holdings v. Kyrgyz Mobil Tel Ltd, [2011] UKPC 7, [2012] 1 W.L.R. 1804, at paras. 84\u201186). Most fundamentally, however, these authorities dealt with different facts and different records.\n(1) Private Nature of the Subject Matter\n[147] The private nature of the subject matter of a purported search can support a finding that an expectation of privacy is reasonable. This follows from the purpose of s. 8, namely protecting people \u201cfrom unjustified state intrusions upon their privacy\u201d (Hunter v. Southam Inc., [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145, at p. 160). As with the identification of the subject matter, the issue is not simply whether the subject matter itself is private, but also whether it can reveal other essential private information, such as core biographical information (Gomboc, at para. 14). This factor is of particular importance with respect to informational privacy interests, like the one at issue in this case. Where informational privacy alone is at stake, it may be all but essential that the information itself be private in order for a reasonable expectation of privacy to exist.\n[148] In this case, the IP addresses were not private and did not, on these facts, reveal private information of any sort, let alone core biographical information. According to the expert evidence, it is only when an IP address is combined with other information that an IP address may tend to reveal intimate information about an individual. As I have shown above, nothing in the evidence suggests that the police can obtain any private information about an individual with an IP address alone. Without more, all an IP address reveals to the police is a user\u2019s ISP \u2014 hardly a particularly private matter, let alone \u201ccore biographical information\u201d.\n[149] My colleague concludes that IP addresses, without more, reveal highly sensitive and personal information, including the identity of their user. While I appreciate that the normative approach to s. 8 analyses requires some degree of flexibility, I am of the view that this case must be decided based on the actual evidentiary record and nothing else. The evidence available on the record must not be ignored; that evidence was before the trial judge and was tested by the rigorous adversarial process.\n[150] Additionally, nobody in this case contended that a mere purchase is private information, whether made online or otherwise (paras. 61\u201162). Nobody made such a submission, probably because without identifying the purchaser, the fact of the purchase is meaningless.\n[151] All of this strongly points away from a finding that any expectation of privacy was reasonable.\n(2) Control Over the Subject Matter\n[152] Control over the subject matter of the search generally supports a finding that there was a reasonable expectation of privacy, while lack of control may weigh against such a finding (Marakah, at para. 38). The idea is simple: when we control something, we can expect \u2014 and to some degree require \u2014 others to respect our interest in it. This reasoning does not make control necessary to establish a reasonable expectation of privacy, but the existence of control is a factor which may support a finding of one.\n[153] In light of the expert evidence, the appellant seemed to have little control over the IP addresses. An ISP can change a user\u2019s IP address at will and without notice. This significantly distinguishes IP addresses from text messages, as in Marakah, where the majority of this Court held that people \u201cexercise meaningful control over the information they send by text message by making choices about how, when, and to whom they disclose the information\u201d (para. 39).\n[154] On the evidence, it seems that the IP addresses would have been visible only to websites that the appellant chose to visit, which is a limited measure of control. That said, a useful comparison may be drawn between leaving fingerprints at the scene of a crime and leaving an IP address visible to a website. An Internet user who leaves behind IP address data completely loses control over what happens to those numbers, just as someone loses control over what happens to his or her fingerprints after touching something. It cannot be seriously suggested that a police investigation that involves dusting for fingerprints and keeping them \u2014 without more \u2014 could engage a reasonable expectation of privacy. The same \u2014 again, without more \u2014 is true of obtaining an IP address.\n[155] The factor of control therefore tends to point away from a finding that the appellant\u2019s expectation of privacy was reasonable.\n(3) Place of the Search\n[156] The place of the search informs the reasonableness of any expectation of privacy in it. The idea of place essentially relates to the concept of territorial privacy (Tessling, at para. 22). It is therefore somewhat remote from the facts of this case, which, as noted, engage informational privacy, and it necessarily assumes less significance. In the courts below, as here, the issue was whether the place of the search could be characterized as the appellant\u2019s home, as he contends. It has long been recognized that one has an increased expectation of privacy in one\u2019s home (see, e.g., R. v. Feeney, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 13, at para. 78). Thus, characterizing the place of the search as the appellant\u2019s home would in some sense support his assertion of a reasonable expectation of privacy.\n[157] In my view, however, the correct characterization of the place is the credit card processor\u2019s database. That is where the IP addresses were stored and where the processor retrieved them from in order to respond to the police inquiry. As the trial judge rightly recognized, the alleged search was not carried out at the appellant\u2019s home, and its location does not enhance the objective reasonableness of his subjective expectation of privacy.\n(4) Conclusion on Reasonable Expectation of Privacy\n[158] Considering the factors together, I find that the appellant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the IP addresses on the credit card processor\u2019s servers and the ISP they revealed. The police did not need judicial authorization before asking the processor for the IP addresses in order to determine the ISP associated with them. The police followed the teachings of Spencer to the letter.\n[159] To be clear, in holding that the appellant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the IP addresses in the circumstances of this case, I am not at all foreclosing the possibility that someone may have such an expectation on different facts. This is because, as noted, \u201c[t]he existence of a reasonable expectation of privacy . . . is always a contextual, fact\u2011based inquiry\u201d (R. v. McNeil, 2009 SCC 3, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 66, at para. 12). Indeed, the analysis must be conducted in light of \u201cthe totality of the circumstances of a particular case\u201d (Edwards, at para. 31 (emphasis added)). Nevertheless, while the instant case deals with the offence of fraud, it is noteworthy that police investigations involving IP addresses also take place in the context of other criminal offences. Indeed, the case law is replete with examples of police investigating offences against children, including child pornography and child luring, using IP addresses (see, e.g., R. v. O\u2019Brien, 2023 ONCA 197, 166 O.R. (3d) 114; R. v. Ilia, 2023 ONCA 75, 523 C.R.R. (2d) 128; R. v. Allen, 2020 ONCA 664, 396 C.C.C. (3d) 1; R. v. West, 2020 ONCA 473, 392 C.C.C. (3d) 271; R. v. Caza, 2015 BCCA 374, 376 B.C.A.C. 258; Ward; Trapp; R. v. Smith, 2005 BCCA 334, 199 C.C.C. (3d) 404).\n[160] The result reached by my colleague that not only some, but all, IP addresses attract a reasonable expectation of privacy (see paras. 12 and 87\u201188) would seriously thwart the police\u2019s ability to investigate such serious offences against children. As \u201csome of the most vulnerable members of our society\u201d (R. v. Friesen, 2020 SCC 9, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 424, at para. 1), children must receive \u201cenhance[ed] protection . . . from becoming victims of sexual offences\u201d (Mills, at para. 23, per Brown J.). As my colleague wrote in her concurring reasons in Mills, a child luring case, \u201cas technology evolves, the ways in which crimes are committed \u2014 and investigated \u2014 also evolve\u201d (para. 39). Given this evolution of online crime, requiring that police seek authorization to obtain an IP address in every case would also exacerbate the existing challenges faced by the criminal justice system. In this regard, I would highlight the words of Moldaver J. (dissenting, albeit on a different s. 8 issue) in Marakah, at para. 185, in reference to the functioning of the justice system:\nThe increased need for these judicial authorizations could strain police and judicial resources in an already overburdened criminal justice system. Investigations would be slowed, more judicial officers would be required, and the administration of criminal justice as a whole will suffer.\n[161] I stress that to reach the same result as my colleague in this case, I would need to consider different factual scenarios in order to draw new conclusions about what information an IP address may reveal and to discuss what third parties might voluntarily do with data that they collect. I cannot, because doing so would mean ignoring the limits on our Court\u2019s jurisdiction, the standard of review for factual findings, the specific evidence in the record, and also procedural fairness. A court must consider the facts as they are, not as they might be, whether because of technological change (Tessling, at paras. 28\u201129 and 55) or a different evidentiary record. If the facts are changed, then, in the ancient words of Plowden, \u201cthe case is altered\u201d. But that would not be this case.\n[162] Stated summarily, our Court\u2019s jurisdiction in criminal appeals is limited to questions of law (Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C\u201146, ss. 691 to 693 ; Supreme Court Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. S\u201126, s. 40(3) ), which means that setting aside the factual findings of the courts below is not an available option. Even if it were, nobody suggested that the standard of review for setting aside factual findings is met in this case. Nobody made that suggestion because at first instance the parties agreed with the defence\u2019s expert evidence upon which the factual findings underlying the s. 8 analysis were based.\n[163] Setting aside the factual findings of the courts below would also essentially amount to taking judicial notice of various contestable facts involving IP addresses and the information that may be gleaned from them, which in my view would be incompatible with this Court\u2019s jurisprudence on judicial notice (R. v. Find, 2001 SCC 32, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 863, at para. 48). On this note, I would also like to address the reliance by one of the interveners on governmental and other documents in its factum (e.g., Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, What an IP Address Can Reveal About You: A report prepared by the Technology Analysis Branch of the Office Privacy Commissioner of Canada (2013)). While I agree with my colleague that interveners play an important role, that role is circumscribed. Recent judgments of this Court have made it clear that interveners may not supplement the evidentiary record on appeal and have explained why this rule exists (R. v. McGregor, 2023 SCC 4, at para. 24, citing R. v. Sharma, 2022 SCC 39, at para. 75). The general point that evidence tested by the adversarial process, rather than judicial notice, should be used to establish facts in the constitutional context is also well\u2011established (R. v. Spence, 2005 SCC 71, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 458, at para. 68; In re The Board of Commerce Act, 1919, and The Combines and Fair Prices Act, 1919, [1922] 1 A.C. 191 (P.C.), at p. 201).\n[164] With the utmost respect, I believe that the effect of my colleague\u2019s reasoning is to answer a question that is not asked, on the basis of factual scenarios different from the one in this case, in order to address a social problem that is not in issue here. I would say nothing more on this, so as not to prejudge the matter should it ever arise.\nVI. Conclusion\n[165] I find that the majority at the Court of Appeal was correct in upholding the trial judge\u2019s determination that the appellant lacked a reasonable expectation of privacy in the IP addresses in the circumstances of this case. Therefore, I would dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal allowed, Wagner C.J. and C\u00f4t\u00e9, Rowe and O\u2019Bonsawin JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: McKay Ferg, Calgary.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Alberta Crown Prosecution Service, Calgary.\nSolicitor for the intervener the Director of Public Prosecutions: Public Prosecution Service of Canada, Halifax.\nSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Ontario: Ministry of the Attorney General of Ontario, Crown Law Office \u2014 Criminal, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of British Columbia: Attorney General of British Columbia \u2014 Criminal Appeals and Special Prosecutions, Victoria.\nSolicitors for the intervener the Canadian Civil Liberties Association: Kapoor Barristers, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the intervener the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association: Pringle Chivers Sparks Teskey, Vancouver; British Columbia Civil Liberties Association, Vancouver.\n",

In both cases, the Court of Appeal overturned the convictions on the basis of alleged errors of law in the trial judges\u2019 credibility and reliability assessments. Using the rule against ungrounded common\u2011sense assumptions, which originated in a series of appellate cases, the Court of Appeal found that the trial judges erred in law by making assumptions about human behaviour not grounded in the evidence. In K\u2019s appeal, the court held that the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that it was unlikely that a woman would be mistaken about the feeling of penile\u2011vaginal penetration relied on speculative reasoning and was not the proper subject of judicial notice. In T\u2019s appeal, the court held that the trial judge had made three assumptions about human behaviour that had impacted her assessment of the evidence: (1) a person would not ask to be spanked while engaging in sexual foreplay out of the blue; (2) a controlling person would not refrain from engaging in vaginal intercourse because they could not find a condom; and (3) a person would not abruptly and unceremoniously drive away from the person with whom they had engaged in consensual sex. The court found that these generalizations were not based in the evidence and engaged in speculative reasoning, and that these errors were material. New trials were ordered for K and T.\nHeld: The appeals should be allowed and the convictions restored.\nPer Wagner C.J. and C\u00f4t\u00e9, Martin, Kasirer, Jamal and O\u2019Bonsawin JJ.: The rule against ungrounded common\u2011sense assumptions should not be recognized as giving rise to an error of law. Such an error of law would represent a radical departure from how appellate courts have typically approached credibility and reliability assessments, especially in the context of sexual assault. The proposed rule is in no way analogous to the body of law protecting sexual assault complainants from myths and stereotypes, nor can it be justified as necessary to ensure fairness to the accused. It also treats any and all factual assumptions drawn in the course of testimonial assessments as errors of law and thereby represents an unjustified departure from well\u2011established principles governing testimonial assessment and appellate standards of review. The faulty use of common\u2011sense assumptions in criminal trials should continue to be controlled by existing standards of review and rules of evidence. In some cases, a trial judge\u2019s use of common sense will be vulnerable to appellate review because it discloses recognized errors of law. Otherwise, like with other factual findings, credibility and reliability assessments \u2014 and any reliance on the common\u2011sense assumptions inherent within them \u2014 will be reviewable only for palpable and overriding error. In the instant cases, assessing the trial judges\u2019 credibility and reliability findings using the proper standard of palpable and overriding error, no such errors were made.\nFirst, the proposed rule against ungrounded common\u2011sense assumptions is not a logical extension of the prohibition against myths and stereotypes about sexual assault complainants. It reflects a misunderstanding of the distinct body of law associated with myths and stereotypes in sexual assault cases, which has a unique history and a specific remedial purpose: to remove discriminatory legal rules that contributed to the view that women, as a group, were less worthy of belief and did not deserve legal protection against sexual violence. Several myths and stereotypes have been jurisprudentially condemned as errors of law and significant legislative changes were made with a view to protecting the rights of women and children given their particular vulnerability to sexual violence. This history puts into perspective the distinct reasons why relying on myths and stereotypes to discredit sexual assault complainants amounts to an error of law, as opposed to being an ordinary factual finding reviewable for palpable and overriding error. Conversely, the proposed rule does not relate to specific, identified, erroneous generalizations about a specific category of witness, nor does it protect elements of an offence from taking on a distorted meaning. It instead lumps together the sorts of pernicious, discriminatory stereotypes that both the courts and Parliament have worked to condemn and correct with more benign generalizations that, while they may be factually wrong, have nothing to do with inequality of treatment.\nThe rule would also drastically expand the scope of permissible questioning into a complainant\u2019s sexual history, effectively requiring both parties to apply to adduce other sexual activity evidence that may not otherwise be relevant or permitted, opening a back door to prohibited twin\u2011myth reasoning. Although framed in terms of ensuring equal treatment for the accused, this approach in fact risks resurrecting the very prejudice against sexual assault complainants that the law on myths and stereotypes was designed to eliminate. Recognizing an identical rule mirroring the treatment of myths and stereotypes between complainants and accused is not necessary and would be misguided. The accused\u2019s rights remain safeguarded by crucial legal protections explicitly designed to ensure fairness to the accused that find their source in their own robust body of law flowing from principles such as the presumption of innocence, the right to silence, and reasonable doubt. Such protections ensure fairness to the accused and must guide trial judges in assessing testimony.\nFurthermore, the proposed rule is counterproductive to proper testimonial assessment and incompatible with the often inextricable role common\u2011sense assumptions play in credibility and reliability assessments. By prohibiting ungrounded common\u2011sense assumptions, the rule interferes with the necessary recourse to common sense as a part of testimonial analysis. It is effectively impossible to draw a clear boundary between using human experience to interpret evidence or draw inferences (which is permissible under the rule) and introducing new considerations into the evidence (which is not). The rule invites appellate courts to substitute their opinions about what generalizations are appropriate or instructive for those of trial judges, improperly transforming their strong opposition to a trial judge\u2019s factual inferences into supposed legal errors, thus creating uncertainty and unfairness on appeal.\nThe rule also runs contrary to established standards of review and would unduly increase the scope of appellate intervention into the credibility and reliability assessments of trial judges. These assessments can be the most important and difficult judicial determinations in a criminal trial, especially in sexual assault cases, which often involve acts that allegedly occurred in private and hinge on the contradictory testimony of two witnesses. Although credibility and reliability findings may be overturned on correctness if errors of law are disclosed, in most cases it is preferable to review them using the nuanced and holistic standard of palpable and overriding error \u2014 which defers to the conclusions of trial judges who have had direct exposure to the witnesses themselves and have expertise in assessing and weighing the facts. The reasons for the deference accorded to a trial judge\u2019s factual and credibility findings include: (1) limiting the cost, number, and length of appeals; (2) promoting the autonomy and integrity of trial proceedings; and (3) recognizing the expertise and advantageous position of the trial judge. Appellate courts are comparatively ill\u2011suited to credibility and reliability assessment, being restricted to reviewing written transcripts of testimony and often focusing narrowly on particular issues as opposed to seeing the case and the evidence as a whole. Invoking the proposed rule, appellate courts have been invited to parse trial reasons, attack generic statements made in the course of credibility assessments, and frame any credibility findings based on human behaviour as impermissible stereotype or common\u2011sense assumptions untethered to evidence. The jurisprudence in this area is variable, even volatile, and evinces the need for a more consistent approach to appellate review.\nIn view of the rejection of the proposed rule, appellate courts should continue to rely on the existing and well\u2011established law on assessing a trial judge\u2019s credibility or reliability assessments. First, where an appellant alleges that a trial judge erroneously relied on a common\u2011sense assumption in their testimonial assessment, the reviewing court should consider whether what is being impugned is, in fact, an assumption. What might appear to be an assumption may actually be a judge\u2019s particular finding about the witness based on the evidence. Second, if the trial judge did rely on an assumption that is beyond the bounds of what common sense and the judicial function support, the reviewing court should identify the appropriate standard of review applicable to the impugned portion of the trial judge\u2019s credibility or reliability assessment. The standard of review will be correctness if the error alleged is a recognized error of law, such as reliance on myths and stereotypes about sexual assault complainants, or improper and incorrect assumptions about accused persons contrary to fundamental principles such as the right to silence and the presumption of innocence. Stereotypes based in other forms of inequality of treatment that are analogous to myths and stereotypes about sexual assault complainants may also be recognized as errors of law in future cases. Testimonial assessments may also become vulnerable to correctness review for reasonable apprehension of bias, making a finding of fact for which there is no evidence, and improperly taking judicial notice.\nAbsent an error of law, the standard of review will be palpable and overriding error. The reviewing court must first determine whether the erroneous reliance on the assumption is palpable, such as where the assumption in question is obviously untrue on its face, or where it is untrue or inapplicable in light of the other accepted evidence or findings of fact. Once a palpable error has been identified, the reviewing court must also find that the erroneous reliance on the assumption was overriding, where it has affected the result or goes to the very core of the outcome of the case. If it cannot be shown that the error was palpable and overriding, a trial judge\u2019s assessment of credibility or reliability will be entitled to deference and there will be no basis for appellate intervention.\nIn K and T\u2019s cases, the Court of Appeal erred in using the rule against ungrounded common\u2011sense assumptions and reviewing the alleged improper generalizations on a correctness standard. The trial decisions in both cases should have been reviewed for palpable and overriding error. In K\u2019s case, the Court of Appeal erred in concluding that the trial judge relied on speculative reasoning in accepting the complainant\u2019s evidence based on his observation that it is extremely unlikely that a woman would be mistaken about the feeling of penile\u2011vaginal penetration. Viewing the reasons as a whole and in context, the trial judge did not reject the defence theory because of an assumption that no woman would be mistaken, but rather because he accepted the complainant\u2019s testimony that she, herself, was not mistaken. The trial judge\u2019s conclusion was grounded in his assessment of the complainant\u2019s testimony and no palpable and overriding errors were made. In T\u2019s case, the Court of Appeal erred in concluding that the trial judge\u2019s assessment of the accused and the complainant\u2019s credibility was fatally affected by three material unfounded assumptions about normal behaviour. The first two assumptions were not assumptions but statements that reflected the trial judge\u2019s reasoning process and findings of fact. The third assumption was truly an assumption and one that was palpably incorrect. However, it was not overriding, as it did not affect the core of the trial judge\u2019s finding of guilt.\nPer Rowe J.: Generalized expectations based on common sense and human experience play a necessary role in the judicial fact\u2011finding process; however, reliance on generalized expectations in a criminal proceeding is not without limits, as some expectations may not be accurate or reliable predictors of general human behaviour. The proliferation of appellate jurisprudence identifying concerns about the limits of this exercise points to the need for guidance in the form of a clear and consistent framework for appellate review. This framework is composed of three questions that an appellate court should ask when reviewing for potential legal error in a trial judge\u2019s reliance on generalized expectations in the fact\u2011finding process: (1) Did the trial judge rely on a generalized expectation in their reasoning process? (2) If the trial judge relied on a generalized expectation, was the expectation reasonable? (3) Did the trial judge rely on a generalized expectation as itself a conclusive and indisputable fact?\nThe first question asks whether the trial judge relied on a generalized expectation in their reasoning process. If the appellate court determines that the judge relied on a generalized expectation, the analysis will proceed to the second question. Where a judge has not relied on any generalized expectation, for example where the judge assessed the evidence with reference to other accepted evidence or facts from the trial, the review for potential error under the framework ends. At this stage of the analysis, the appellate court is not identifying any error. It is not an error of law per se for a judge to rely on a generalized expectation as a logical benchmark to assess the evidence; rather, it is a well\u2011recognized and necessary part of the judicial fact\u2011finding process. In answering this first question, the appellate court is simply determining what the trial judge really decided, why the judge decided that way, and whether there is a basis for further scrutiny. This is a highly case\u2011dependent inquiry \u2014 an appellate court must assess whether the reasons, read as a whole and in context of the live issues at trial, explain what the trial judge decided and why they decided that way in a manner that permits effective appellate review. Appellate courts must not finely parse the trial judge\u2019s reasons in search for error.\nIf the trial judge relied on a generalized expectation, the second question then asks whether the expectation was reasonable. It is an error of law for a judge to rely on an unreasonable generalized expectation to assess the evidence. Unreasonable generalized expectations masquerading as common sense or collective human experience are not a legitimate basis on which to assess and understand the evidence in a criminal trial. A standard of reasonableness imparts a measure of objectivity and community consensus in shaping the boundaries of a judge\u2019s reliance on common sense and human experience to make decisions, ensuring that triers of fact do not rely on generalized expectations that are inaccurate or unreliable. It also recognizes that as society evolves, its understanding of what is reasonable may change. Public confidence in the administration of justice and the judicial fact\u2011finding process require that appellate courts be able to intervene where trial judges employ generalized expectations that are not a reasonably accurate reflection of what is true in most circumstances and are not a reliable benchmark to assess the evidence. However, where a trial judge relies on a reasonable generalized expectation, an appellate court may not interfere with the judge\u2019s assessment of the evidence based on that expectation just because it would have come to a different conclusion.\nAppellate review for legal error should extend to the reasonableness of any generalized expectation relied on by the trial judge. The categories of generalized expectations that may not, as a matter of law, be relied on should not be limited to what might be considered myths or stereotypes or to the context of sexual assault trials. Such a narrow approach creates artificial distinctions in the law, unduly limits the important role of appellate courts in the criminal justice system, and risks undermining public confidence in the administration of justice. On a conceptual level, the underlying rationale for reliance on a generalized expectation is the same, regardless of whether the generalized expectation can be considered a myth, a stereotype, or something else. There is no principled basis to separate particular categories of generalized expectations for distinct treatment. Such an exercise invites artificial distinctions in the law with no clear boundaries and fails to account for generalized expectations that cannot accurately be classified as myths or stereotypes about complainants in sexual assault cases yet would nonetheless be unacceptable to rely on in a criminal trial.\nAll reliance on unreasonable generalized expectations should be recognized as an error or law. Support for this is found in the relevant policy reasons for why appellate courts defer to trial judges\u2019 factual findings on one hand, and the wide discretion for appellate intervention on questions of law on the other hand. Appellate courts defer to trial judges on factual matters for at least three overarching policy reasons: (1) to limit the number, length, and cost of appeals; (2) to promote the autonomy and integrity of trial proceedings; and (3) to recognize the expertise of the trial judge and the judge\u2019s advantageous position to assess the evidence. Reviewing unreasonable expectations on a standard of correctness would have a limited impact on those policy considerations. Concerns about preserving public resources or promoting the autonomy and integrity of trials are secondary to the rights of the accused in a criminal proceeding, in light of the interests at stake and Parliament\u2019s decision to provide broad access to a first level of appeal. It is the recognition of the trial judge\u2019s expertise and advantageous position that forms the central basis for appellate deference on factual matters in the context of criminal proceedings; however, trial judges are not more experienced or in a more advantageous position than appellate judges in identifying a reasonable generalized expectation based on common sense or human experience, as the basis for the general reliability of such expectations is that they are common or the shared experience of the entire community.\nThe primary role of appellate courts is to delineate and refine legal rules and ensure their universal application. They therefore maintain a broad scope of review on questions of law, which require clear and consistent answers in order to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice. Any approach to appellate review that dilutes the important role of appellate courts would do significant damage to the criminal justice system. The characterization of an issue as a question of law is also significant to the grounds for appellate jurisdiction in criminal matters, especially the limited grounds for Crown appeals from acquittals. If the reasonableness of a generalized expectation were treated as a question of fact, then the Crown would not be able to appeal from acquittals that rest on generalized expectations that do not amount to myths or stereotypes, no matter how unreasonable or contrary to society\u2019s collective expectations. The need to preserve public confidence in the administration of justice mandates that verdicts in criminal cases not be founded on assumptions that are not reasonably accurate reflections of what is true in most circumstances. The correctness standard requires setting out expressly an alternative line of reasoning and demonstrating why it should be followed. Properly applied, correctness demands greater conceptual clarity and analytical rigour. By contrast, the palpable and overriding standard of review can be misused to generate a decision\u2011making black box that facilitates ad hoc decision\u2011making, whereby if the Court of Appeal agrees with what the trial judge has done, it shows deference, but if it prefers another outcome, it labels the trial judge\u2019s decision as a palpable and overriding error and substitutes its preferred outcome.\nFinally, the third question asks whether the judge relied on a generalized expectation as itself a conclusive and indisputable fact. Trial judges have considerable latitude to rely on reasonable general expectations as a logical benchmark in assessing the evidence, and an appellate court may not interfere with the judge\u2019s assessment of the evidence just because it would have come to a different conclusion. However, there is an important limit on the use of even a reasonable generalized expectation: the trial judge cannot treat the generalized expectation as itself a conclusive and indisputable fact, such that the judge ignores or forecloses their mind to the evidence. This is because people may always act contrary to a generalized expectation of what common sense or human experience would ordinarily anticipate, and therefore it is the trial judge\u2019s duty to determine on the evidence what really happened. Generalized expectations based on human experience and common sense are only one consideration, which assist with interpreting the evidence, but the focus must remain on the evidence. It is an error of law for a judge to fail to consider all of the evidence on the ultimate issue of guilt or innocence, or to make a factual conclusion in the absence of evidence. Where a judge relies on a generalized expectation as itself a factual conclusion, what the judge is really doing is taking judicial notice, which is subject to a stringent test \u2014 a standard that will rarely, if ever, be met by a generalized expectation about people due to the variability of human experience and behaviour. And where a factual conclusion is based neither on the evidence, nor on judicial notice, then it is speculation, which is an error of law.\nApplying these principles to the cases at hand, the appeals should be allowed and the convictions restored. In K\u2019s case, under the framework\u2019s first question, the trial judge relied on a generalized expectation about the likelihood of a woman being mistaken about the feeling of vaginal penetration. Under the framework\u2019s second question, it is a reasonable generalized expectation about general human perception that a woman is unlikely to be mistaken about the feeling of vaginal penetration, as a sexual act of this nature would have a profound and traumatic impact on the bodily integrity of an individual, and ordinary people would not generally require special knowledge to assess this sort of evidence. Under the framework\u2019s third question, the trial judge did not treat this as an indisputable fact but instead used it as a benchmark to assess the complainant\u2019s evidence in light of the totality of the evidence. There was therefore no basis for the Court of Appeal to intervene.\nIn T\u2019s case, the Court of Appeal wrongly identified the trial judge as having relied on a generalized expectation regarding the first two assumptions, where the latter was actually assessing the whole of the evidence; this led the Court of Appeal to move beyond its role and reweigh the evidence. In respect of the third assumption, the trial judge did err by relying on an unreasonable expectation about how people ordinarily behave after a consensual sexual encounter. Under the framework\u2019s second question, it is unreasonable to expect any logical connection between an individual waiting for their sexual partner to enter a home and the consensual or non\u2011consensual nature of the preceding encounter. Nevertheless, this error of law was so harmless or minor that it could not have had any impact on the verdict, because the judge\u2019s verdict clearly turned on her favourable assessment of the complainant\u2019s credibility, as well as her complete rejection of T\u2019s testimony as inconsistent with the events and contrived to explain away the complainant\u2019s injuries.\nCases Cited\nBy Martin J.\nOverruled: R. v.

Introduction\n[1] These appeals in two sexual assault matters concern the standard for appellate intervention with respect to a trial judge\u2019s credibility and reliability findings in a criminal trial and the appropriate role of common sense when assessing the evidence of witnesses. The respondents ask this Court to recognize a novel rule referred to as the \u201crule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions\u201d. A breach of this proposed rule would provide a new, stand-alone basis for correctness review of credibility and reliability assessments whenever an appellate court determines that a trial judge has relied on a common-sense assumption that was not grounded in the evidence. This significant departure from established standards of review in respect of credibility and reliability assessments in criminal cases has been applied by some appellate courts \u2014 often in sexual assault cases that turn on the competing accounts of the accused and the complainant.\n[2] For the reasons provided below, no such change to the law is warranted, and I decline to recognize the rule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions as giving rise to an error of law. The current standards under which appellate courts review trial judgments are well-designed, long-established, and promote the fair assessment of testimony. There is no need to fashion a new rule of law against any assumption not supported by particular evidence in the record to strive for what existing rules already accomplish. Furthermore, the proposed rule is not a coherent extension of existing errors of law pertaining to myths and stereotypes against sexual assault complainants. Adopting it would undercut the functional and flexible approach to appellate intervention and create mischief across the entire criminal law.\n[3] The faulty use of common-sense assumptions in criminal trials will continue to be controlled by existing standards of review and rules of evidence. In some cases, a trial judge\u2019s use of common sense will be vulnerable to appellate review because it discloses recognized errors of law. Otherwise, like with other factual findings, credibility and reliability assessments \u2014 and any reliance on the common-sense assumptions inherent within them \u2014 will be reviewable only for palpable and overriding error. This standard is better equipped to the task than the new error of law the respondents propose.\n[4] In both cases before us, the Court of Appeal for British Columbia overturned the sexual assault convictions on the basis of alleged errors of law in the trial judges\u2019 credibility and reliability assessments. Using the rule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions, the Court of Appeal found that the trial judges erred in law by making assumptions about human behaviour not grounded in the evidence. Having rejected this new error of law, I would assess the trial judges\u2019 findings using the proper standard of palpable and overriding error. I conclude that they made no such errors in their credibility and reliability findings. In the result, I would allow both appeals and restore the convictions.\nII. Background\nA. Mr. Kruk\n[5] The respondent Christopher James Kruk was charged with sexual assault based on an allegation of non-consensual penile-vaginal penetration. The main issue at trial was whether the sexual activity occurred, which depended almost entirely upon the trial judge\u2019s assessment of the credibility of Mr. Kruk and the reliability of the complainant.\n[6] Mr. Kruk found the complainant intoxicated, lost, and distressed one night in downtown Vancouver. He decided to take her to his house, and connected with the complainant\u2019s parents by phone. The complainant did not remember much of what happened next, but she testified that she woke up with her pants off and Mr. Kruk on top of her with his penis inside her vagina. Mr. Kruk denied this, testifying that after the complainant spilled a glass of water on herself and went to his room to change, he found her passed out on his bed with her pants around her ankles. He said that when he tried to wake her, she was startled and must have assumed the worst, because she kicked off her pants and began running around the house in a panic.\n(1) Trial Decision, 2020 BCSC 1480\n[7] The trial judge found Mr. Kruk guilty of sexual assault. He did not believe Mr. Kruk and rejected his evidence on multiple points because of material inconsistencies in his testimony. Specifically, the trial judge rejected Mr. Kruk\u2019s explanation of the complainant\u2019s state of undress when she awoke, and \u201cflatly rejected\u201d his claim that he contacted the complainant\u2019s family to get her home safely. In turn, the trial judge considered the complainant\u2019s account to be largely unreliable due to her intoxication and \u201cmassive gaps in her memory\u201d (para. 48 (CanLII)). However, the trial judge accepted her evidence on the core of the sexual assault allegation \u2014 that she had felt Mr. Kruk\u2019s penis inside of her vagina:\n[The complainant\u2019s] evidence is devoid of detail, yet she claims to be certain that she was not mistaken. She said she felt [Mr. Kruk\u2019s] penis inside her and she knew what she was feeling. In short, her tactile sense was engaged. It is extremely unlikely that a woman would be mistaken about that feeling. [Emphasis added; para. 68.]\n[8] The trial judge also held there was important circumstantial evidence consistent with a sexual encounter, providing further reason to accept the complainant\u2019s account and reject Mr. Kruk\u2019s. At one point while the complainant was in Mr. Kruk\u2019s bedroom, he had taken off all his clothes and put on swim trunks. The complainant\u2019s pants had been completely removed, and the trial judge considered the notion that the complainant had done so herself to be \u201cfanciful\u201d given her state of intoxication. Finally, phone records admitted at trial revealed that after their initial conversation with Mr. Kruk, the complainant\u2019s parents had repeatedly called and texted and he failed to respond. In the overall circumstances, the trial judge considered that Mr. Kruk\u2019s failure to contact the complainant\u2019s parents was consistent with an intention to take advantage of her sexually while she was in an extremely vulnerable state.\n(2) British Columbia Court of Appeal Decision, 2022 BCCA 18\n[9] The Court of Appeal unanimously overturned Mr. Kruk\u2019s conviction and ordered a new trial. The court observed that although trial judges can rely on personal life experiences to assess the credibility of witnesses, they \u201cmust be careful . . . to \u2018avoid speculative reasoning that invokes \u00ab common sense \u00bb assumptions not grounded in the evidence\u2019\u201d (para. 41 (CanLII), quoting R. v. Roth, 2020 BCCA 240, 66 C.R. (7th) 107, at para. 65). The trial judge\u2019s conclusion regarding the unlikelihood of any complainant (\u201ca woman\u201d) being mistaken about the feeling of penile\u2011vaginal penetration relied on speculative reasoning and was not the proper subject of judicial notice, engaging \u201cquestions of neurology (the operation of the body\u2019s sensory system), physiology (the impact of alcohol on perception, memory and the body\u2019s sensory system) and psychiatry (the impact of alcohol and\/or trauma on perception and memory)\u201d (paras. 65 and 67). Since the trial judge\u2019s finding regarding penetration was considered to be the primary reason he had accepted the complainant\u2019s evidence, the court held that the trial judge\u2019s reasoning had been fatally affected by a legal error.\nB. Mr. Tsang\n[10] The respondent Edwin Tsang was charged with sexual assault based on alleged non-consensual fellatio, digital vaginal and anal penetration, and penile-vaginal penetration. Although the parties\u2019 accounts of what sexual activity had happened also diverged, the main issue was consent, which primarily hinged on the credibility of both the complainant and the accused.\n[11] The complainant and Mr. Tsang met at a music festival she attended with her friend, and the three subsequently went to an after-party at a club in downtown Vancouver, where they danced and drank. Mr. Tsang then offered to drive the complainant home, and on the way, they stopped in a parking lot. They got into the backseat and the complainant consented to kissing Mr. Tsang. The complainant\u2019s and Mr. Tsang\u2019s testimonies diverged significantly at this point. The complainant testified that Mr. Tsang, all without her consent, forced her to perform fellatio on him, digitally penetrated her vagina and anus, and forced her to have vaginal intercourse. Mr. Tsang testified that they engaged in consensual, rough oral sex and digital penetration, and that the complainant had initiated and was an active participant during the sexual encounter. He also denied having vaginal intercourse or engaging in anal penetration.\n[12] The morning after the alleged assault, the complainant was examined by a sexual assault physician examiner, who also testified as an expert at trial. The examiner documented extensive injuries to the complainant\u2019s genital area, including a tear in her genital opening only typically seen after childbirth.\n(1) Trial Decision, 2020 BCPC 306\n[13] The trial judge found Mr. Tsang guilty of sexual assault. She acknowledged that the complainant had consented to getting into the backseat of the car and to kissing, but rejected Mr. Tsang\u2019s evidence that the subsequent sexual acts had been consensual, which she found to be at odds with the evidence she had accepted. The trial judge found that Mr. Tsang\u2019s testimony sounded contrived, as if he were describing how he thought such an encounter might unfold rather than what had really happened. She also took issue with Mr. Tsang\u2019s evidence that the complainant had initiated each step of the sexual encounter, finding instead that the accused had dominated and controlled the complainant, and \u201corchestrated\u201d the events. By contrast, the judge found the complainant was credible and reliable and held that the Crown\u2019s case, which relied heavily on her testimony, did not raise a reasonable doubt. The judge concluded that Mr. Tsang knew the complainant was not consenting as soon as he began forcing her to give him fellatio, and accordingly found him guilty of sexual assault.\n[14] The trial judge made three factual findings that became crucial on appeal. First, it was not believable that the complainant had asked Mr. Tsang to spank her and was \u201cgearing up for rough sex\u201d (para. 126 (CanLII)). Second, Mr. Tsang\u2019s explanation that they did not have vaginal intercourse because he could not find a condom was contrived and inconsistent with the level of control he had conveyed over all of their interactions that evening and in court. Third, Mr. Tsang\u2019s rapid departure once he dropped the complainant off at her friend\u2019s house was consistent with a sexual assault having occurred.\n(2) British Columbia Court of Appeal Decision, 2022 BCCA 345, 419 C.C.C. (3d) 187\n[15] The Court of Appeal unanimously overturned Mr. Tsang\u2019s conviction and ordered a new trial. The court found that the trial judge had made three assumptions about human behaviour that had impacted her assessment of the evidence: (1) a person would not ask to be spanked while engaging in sexual foreplay \u201cout of the blue\u201d; (2) a controlling person would not refrain from engaging in vaginal intercourse because they could not find a condom; and (3) a person would not abruptly and unceremoniously drive away from the person with whom they had engaged in consensual sex. Relying on the rule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions, these generalizations were not based in the evidence and engaged in speculative reasoning, and thus constituted reversible legal errors. The court also found these errors were material, as the judge would not necessarily have rejected Mr. Tsang\u2019s evidence without erring in law.\nIII. Analysis\n[16] In both Mr. Kruk and Mr. Tsang\u2019s cases, the British Columbia Court of Appeal reviewed the trial judges\u2019 credibility and reliability findings on a standard of correctness. In line with this approach, the respondents now ask this Court to recognize the proposed rule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions as grounding an error of law.\n[17] These appeals are part of a broader pattern in which special rules have been proposed for the assessment of credibility and reliability in sexual assault cases.[1] The rule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions is before this Court for the first time, and the question of whether it should be adopted should be approached based on first principles relating to credibility and reliability assessments and existing standards of review. When the rule comes into play in sexual assault cases in particular, constitutional imperatives call for the consideration of the Charter rights of both accused persons and complainants as well as the interests of society at large (R. v. Mills, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 668; R. v. Darrach, 2000 SCC 46, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 443; R. v. J.J., 2022 SCC 28). This approach is part of the obligation to strive towards \u201cthe fair, ethical and non-discriminatory adjudication of sexual assault cases\u201d (D. M. Tanovich, \u201cRegulating Inductive Reasoning in Sexual Assault Cases\u201d, in B. L. Berger, E. Cunliffe and J. Stribopoulos, eds., To Ensure that Justice is Done: Essays in Memory of Marc Rosenberg (2017), 73, at p. 95).\n[18] These reasons proceed as follows. First, I explore the origins and treatment of the proposed rule. Next, I explain why it should not be recognized as giving rise to an error of law. Finally, applying the correct legal principles to both cases on appeal, I find that no palpable and overriding errors were made by the trial judge in Mr. Kruk\u2019s case, and that while the trial judge in Mr. Tsang\u2019s case relied on a palpably wrong generalization, the error was not overriding.\nA. The Proposed Rule Against Ungrounded Common-Sense Assumptions\n[19] The proposed rule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions originated in a trio of key cases \u2014 R. v. Perkins, 2007 ONCA 585, 223 C.C.C. (3d) 289; R. v. Cepic, 2019 ONCA 541, 376 C.C.C. (3d) 286; and Roth \u2014 and has been most clearly and recently articulated in R. v. J.C., 2021 ONCA 131, 401 C.C.C. (3d) 433. The Court of Appeal in Mr. Kruk\u2019s case cited to the trio of cases and specifically quoted the rule as stated by the British Columbia Court of Appeal in Roth, while the Court of Appeal in Mr. Tsang\u2019s case relied on the rule as stated in J.C.\n[20] In Perkins, the Ontario Court of Appeal held that the trial judge\u2019s finding that a \u201cvirile young man with a full erection bound on having a climax would not lose his erection\u201d was not the use of acceptable common sense, but was instead a conclusion reached outside the evidence and beyond the proper scope of judicial notice (paras. 35-36; see also para. 40). In Cepic, the Ontario Court of Appeal held that the trial judge\u2019s characterization of the accused\u2019s testimony as \u201cimplausible\u201d and \u201cnonsensical\u201d was untethered to the evidence and reflected erroneous assumptions about what a young woman would do and stereotypes about male aggression (paras. 19-27). Both Perkins and Cepic were subsequently invoked in Roth, at para. 65, in which the British Columbia Court of Appeal articulated the following rule: \u201c. . . although judges are entitled to rely on their human experience in assessing the plausibility of a witness\u2019s testimony, they must avoid speculative reasoning that invokes \u2018common sense\u2019 assumptions not grounded in the evidence . . . .\u201d The court went on to find that the trial judge had erred in relying on the speculative assumption that the accused, \u201ca fit and healthy young man who regularly worked out and trained as a power lifter\u201d (para. 56), would not fall asleep during a cab ride, erroneously leading the trial judge to reject the accused\u2019s narrative.\n[21] In J.C., the trial judge had found the accused guilty of sexual assault and extortion, accepting the complainant\u2019s testimony that the accused had threatened to post a sexual video recording of her online if she did not continue her sexual relationship with him. On appeal, the accused alleged that the trial judge made two errors in his credibility assessment. First, the accused alleged that the trial judge impermissibly used stereotype to reject his testimony about expressly seeking the complainant\u2019s consent before engaging in specific sexual acts \u2014 the trial judge had held that the accused\u2019s testimony on this point was \u201ctoo perfect, too mechanical, too rehearsed, and too politically correct to be believed\u201d (para. 4). Second, the accused alleged that the trial judge had erred in characterizing the defence\u2019s theory that the complainant had fabricated the allegations to conceal cheating from her boyfriend as relying on stereotype, when in fact it had been grounded in the evidence.\n[22] The Ontario Court of Appeal unanimously allowed the appeal, set aside the convictions, and ordered a new trial. The court theorized a new approach to credibility and reliability assessments in sexual assault cases that consisted of two separate but interrelated rules: the new \u201crule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions\u201d, and the modification of an existing \u201crule against stereotypical inferences\u201d, the latter of which prevents judges from relying on stereotypes about how sexual assault complainants or accused persons are expected to act in assessing their credibility (J.C., at para. 63, citing Roth, at para. 129; R. v. A. (A.B.), 2019 ONCA 124, 145 O.R. (3d) 634, at para. 5; Cepic, at paras. 14 and 24). The court considered that failing to abide by either rule was an error of law reviewable on a standard of correctness where the error played a material role in the impugned conclusion.\n[23] The appeals before this Court are therefore part of a body of recent jurisprudence that seeks to transform how credibility and reliability findings in sexual assault cases are reviewed on appeal. This jurisprudence undertakes three significant legal innovations. First, it introduces a novel general rule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions. Second, it classifies any breach of this rule as an error of law. Third, it takes the existing error of law barring the use of myths and stereotypes about sexual assault complainants and transposes it into a separate, parallel error of law relating to all factual assumptions about all witnesses, including the accused.\n[24] Mindful of the context in which many of these cases have been argued, at the core of this novel approach is an explicit analogy between the historic treatment of myths and stereotypes undermining the credibility of sexual assault complainants and the principles to be applied when assessing the testimony of accused persons in sexual assault cases. In J.C., the court considered that because reliance on myths and stereotypes against sexual assault complainants is an error of law, it would be \u201cequally wrong to draw inferences from stereotypes about the way accused persons are expected to act\u201d (paras. 63; see paras. 72-74, citing R. v. A.R.J.D., 2018 SCC 6, [2018] 1 S.C.R. 218; A. (A.B.)). Embracing the proposed rule, other courts have agreed that this established error of law pertaining to myths and stereotypes about sexual assault complainants must also extend to other types of stereotypes or factual assumptions that can work to undermine an accused\u2019s testimony. Collectively, these cases advance the notion that, although myths and stereotypes have traditionally operated to prejudice complainants, these same myths and stereotypes can simultaneously prejudice the accused (R. v. C.M.M., 2020 BCCA 56, at para. 139 (CanLII); R. v. Kodwat, 2017 YKCA 11, at para. 41 (CanLII); R. v. Thompson, 2019 BCCA 1, 370 C.C.C. (3d) 354, at paras. 56-57; R. v. T.L., 2020 NUCA 10, 393 C.C.C. (3d) 195, at para. 35).\n[25] The parallel treatment proffered in this line of cases is at the forefront of the cases on appeal. At para. 25, the Court of Appeal in Mr. Tsang\u2019s case relied upon a lengthy extract from J.C. that included the idea that it is \u201cequally wrong\u201d to invoke this historical set of myths and stereotypes about complainants in assessing the testimony of accused persons. Going further, in Mr. Kruk\u2019s case, the Court of Appeal expressly drew a parallel between the historic use of myths and stereotypes as applied against sexual assault complainants, and the use of improper assumptions more generally:\nHistorically, the issue of improper assumptions typically arose in the context of trial judges drawing adverse inferences about the credibility of sexual assault complainants based on discredited myths and stereotypes. The authorities are clear, however, that trial judges must not rely on assumptions and stereotypes in their assessment of testimony given by both sexual assault complainants and accused persons. [Emphasis added; para. 42.]\n[26] The proposed rule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions thus represents a radical departure from how appellate courts have typically approached credibility and reliability assessments, especially in the context of sexual assault. Crucially, the rule transformed all factual findings that could be said to constitute \u201cassumptions\u201d \u2014 which, in the ordinary course, were previously subject to review for palpable and overriding error \u2014 into errors of law reviewable on a standard of correctness. The rule also enlarged the well-established prohibition against myths and stereotypes about complainants \u2014 a relatively narrow error of law targeted at the fair assessment of a discrete category of witness testimony in a particular subset of criminal trials \u2014 well beyond its original scope, presenting it as the doctrinal basis for the creation of a far broader error that applies to credibility assessments of any witness in all criminal trials.\nB. The Proposed Rule Against Ungrounded Common-Sense Assumptions Should Not Be Adopted\n[27] For the following reasons, the proposed rule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions should not be recognized as giving rise to an error of law.\n[28] First, in the sexual assault context, the rule disregards the distinct nature of myths and stereotypes about complainants, transforming all factual generalizations regardless of their nature into errors of law and imposing a false symmetry to the circumstances of accused persons. Second, the rule runs contrary to long-settled law on credibility and reliability assessments and existing standards of review, leading to unprecedented and undesirable consequences.\n(1) The Proposed Rule Is Not a Logical Extension of the Prohibition Against Myths and Stereotypes About Sexual Assault Complainants\n[29] As noted, the proposed rule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions builds on the well-established prohibition against the use of myths and stereotypes when assessing the testimony of sexual assault complainants. In the ordinary course, credibility and reliability assessments are reviewable for palpable and overriding error and are otherwise entitled to deference. However, if a trial judge relies on myths or stereotypes about sexual assault complainants in their reasons, this amounts to an error of law. The proponents of the rule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions argue that if reliance on myths and stereotypes about complainants is an error of law, then all unfounded and speculative assumptions about all witnesses, including the accused, should be treated in the same manner.\n[30] With respect, this impulse towards symmetry and formally identical treatment is unwarranted. It reflects a misunderstanding of the distinct body of law associated with myths and stereotypes in sexual assault cases, which developed in a particular historical context to protect complainants alone.\n(a) The History of Myths and Stereotypes Against Complainants\n[31] The prohibition against myths and stereotypes that undermine the credibility of sexual assault complainants has a unique history and a specific remedial purpose: to remove discriminatory legal rules that contributed to the view that women, as a group, were less worthy of belief and did not deserve legal protection against sexual violence.\n[32] In the past, multiple legal barriers operated to ensure that the testimony of sexual assault complainants \u2014 who, at the time, were almost exclusively women \u2014 was treated as inherently unreliable. The term \u201cmyths and stereotypes\u201d was coined to describe how the exceptional procedural protections historically afforded to those accused of sexual assault discriminated against complainants and made sexual assault not only the most underreported crime, but one that was exceptionally difficult to prove in court. These myths and stereotypes, formerly embedded into the law, arose in relation to both credibility and consent, and made sexual assault inherently dissimilar to other crimes.\n[33] Before 1983, \u201crape\u201d was a main type of sexual offence: it criminalized non-consensual penetration of a penis into a vagina and was thus understood as a gendered crime committed by men against women. Under the express terms of the prohibition, a married woman could not be raped by her husband as she was deemed, by her status as a wife, to have forfeited her legal capacity to refuse unwanted sexual activity. The law thereby enforced the notion that certain relationships provided men with a right to women\u2019s sexual availability (see, e.g., J. Koshan, \u201cMarriage and Advance Consent to Sex: A Feminist Judgment in R v JA\u201d (2016), 6 O\u00f1ati Socio-legal Series 1377, at p. 1387).\n[34] Special evidentiary rules also governed the testimony of sexual assault complainants. The statutory corroboration requirement obliged judges to instruct juries that it was dangerous to convict the accused of a sexual offence based only on the testimony of a complainant (Criminal Code, S.C. 1953-54, c. 51, s. 131(1); corroboration requirements were abolished by An Act to amend the Criminal Code in relation to sexual offences and other offences against the person and to amend certain other Acts in relation thereto or in consequence thereof, S.C. 1980-81-82-83, c. 125, ss. 5 and 19; see also Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 (\u201cCode \u201d), s. 274; R. v. Seaboyer, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577, at p. 676). The doctrine of recent complaint required immediate disclosure of a sexual assault to avoid an adverse credibility inference, meaning a complainant\u2019s initial silence could be taken as \u201ca virtual self-contradiction of her story\u201d (R. v. D.D., 2000 SCC 43, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 275, at paras. 60-61, quoting Kribs v. The Queen, [1960] S.C.R. 400, at p. 405; see also Timm v. The Queen, [1981] 2 S.C.R. 315).\n[35] By virtue of these rules, not only were women as a group seen as lacking credibility, there was a construct about the specific subset of women who could be believed. Negative social attitudes about women were often used to differentiate \u201creal\u201d rape victims from women suspected to be concocting false allegations out of self-interest or even revenge. Prejudicial beliefs about women who were Indigenous, racialized, persons with disabilities, or part of the 2SLGBTQI+ community also operated to socially prescribe ideals and norms about sexual assault victims. To the extent a particular complainant deviated from the characteristics of the idealized real rape victim, her credibility and entitlement to the law\u2019s protection was diminished, sometimes to zero (see, e.g., J. Benedet, \u201cJudicial Misconduct in the Sexual Assault Trial\u201d (2019), 52 U.B.C. L. Rev. 1; S. Ehrlich, \u201cPerpetuating \u2014 and Resisting \u2014 Rape Myths in Trial Discourse\u201d, in E. A. Sheehy, ed., Sexual Assault in Canada: Law, Legal Practice and Women\u2019s Activism (2012), 389; M. Randall, \u201cSexual Assault Law, Credibility, and \u2018Ideal Victims\u2019: Consent, Resistance, and Victim Blaming\u201d (2010), 22 C.J.W.L. 397; J. Benedet and I. Grant, \u201cHearing the Sexual Assault Complaints of Women with Mental Disabilities: Evidentiary and Procedural Issues\u201d (2007), 52 McGill L.J. 515).\n[36] This Court has repeatedly recognized the prevalence of myths and stereotypes about sexual assault complainants, some of which include the following:\n\u2022 Genuine sexual assaults are perpetrated by strangers to the victim (Seaboyer, at p. 659, per L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9 J., dissenting in part; R. v. Friesen, 2020 SCC 9, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 424, at para. 130, per Wagner C.J. and Rowe J.).\n\u2022 False allegations of sexual assault based on ulterior motives are more common than false allegations of other offences (Seaboyer, at p. 669, per L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9 J., dissenting in part; R. v. Osolin, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 595, at p. 625, per L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9 J., dissenting; R. v. A.G., 2000 SCC 17, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 439, at para. 3, per L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9 J., concurring).\n\u2022 Real victims of sexual assault should have visible physical injuries (Seaboyer, at pp. 650 and 660, per L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9 J., dissenting in part; R. v. McCraw, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 72, at pp. 83-84, per Cory J. for the Court).\n\u2022 A complainant who said \u201cno\u201d did not necessarily mean \u201cno\u201d, and may have meant \u201cyes\u201d (Seaboyer, at p. 659, per L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9 J., dissenting in part; R. v. Esau, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 777, at para. 82, per McLachlin J. (as she then was), dissenting; R. v. Ewanchuk, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 330, at paras. 87 and 89, per L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9 J., concurring; R. v. Cinous, 2002 SCC 29, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 167, per Arbour J., dissenting; R. v. Kirkpatrick, 2022 SCC 33, at para. 54, per Martin J. for the majority; R. v. Goldfinch, 2019 SCC 38, [2019] 3 S.C.R. 3, at paras. 44 and 74, per Karakatsanis J. for the majority).\n\u2022 If a complainant remained passive or failed to resist the accused\u2019s advances, either physically or verbally by saying \u201cno\u201d, she must have consented \u2014 a myth that has historically distorted the definition of consent and rendered rape \u201cthe only crime that has required the victim to resist physically in order to establish nonconsent\u201d (Ewanchuk, at paras. 93, 97 and 99, per L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9 J., concurring, quoting S. Estrich, \u201cRape\u201d (1986), 95 Yale L.J. 1087, at p. 1090; see also para. 103, per McLachlin J., concurring, and para. 51, per Major J. for the majority; see further R. v. M.

Myths, in particular, convey traditional stories and worldviews about what, in the eyes of some, constitutes \u201creal\u201d sexual violence and what does not. Some myths involve the wholesale discrediting of women\u2019s truthfulness and reliability, while others conceptualize an idealized victim and her features and actions before, during, and after an assault. Historically, all such myths and stereotypes were reflected in evidentiary rules that only governed the testimony of sexual assault complainants and invariably worked to demean and diminish their status in court.\n[38] Overall, this legal backdrop reflected a time in which less was known about the prevalence of sexual violence and its lifelong harms. Eventually, Parliament, the courts, academics, and the public came to understand that the previous legal rules and the inaccurate, outdated, and inequitable social attitudes they represented impeded the equal treatment of sexual assault complainants and, hence, the overall fairness of trials.\n[39] New Criminal Code provisions were drafted replacing the former offence of rape with a new offence of sexual assault, and the marital rape exemption was repealed \u2014 reflecting the reality that while women continue to make up the vast majority of sexual assault complainants, the offence of sexual assault can be perpetrated by and against people of all genders. Consent was expressly defined in s. 273.1(1) of the Code as the voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in the sexual activity in question, and ss. 273.1(2) and 273.2 clearly circumscribed when no consent is obtained and the scope of mistaken belief in consent. The corroboration requirement was abolished and the doctrine of recent complaint was abrogated, pursuant to ss. 274 and 275 of the Code , respectively. Finally, ss. 276 and 278.1 to 278.91 now govern the admissibility of a complainant\u2019s prior sexual activity and the production and admission of records containing the complainant\u2019s highly sensitive personal information that is either held by a third party or comes into the hands of the accused.\n[40] The significant legislative changes in this area of law were made with a view to protecting the rights of women and children given their particular vulnerability to sexual violence. In the preamble to the Act that amended s. 276 of the Code post-Seaboyer and reformed the definition of consent to sexual activity, Parliament explicitly focused on combatting \u201cthe prevalence of sexual assault against women and children\u201d and expressed a particular intention to \u201censure the full protection of the rights guaranteed under sections 7 and 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms \u201d (An Act to amend the Criminal Code (sexual assault), S.C. 1992, c. 38). Parliament also expressed an intention to \u201cencourage the reporting of incidents of sexual violence\u201d and emphasized that the admission of the complainant\u2019s sexual history into evidence is \u201cinherently prejudicial\u201d and \u201cshould be subject to particular scrutiny\u201d (ibid.). In amending ss. 278.1 to 278.91 of the Code , Parliament sought to protect complainants\u2019 privacy interests in highly sensitive personal information and, in turn, preserve their dignity. Amendments such as these appropriately balance respect for complainants\u2019 dignity, privacy, and equality and the fundamental right of the accused to the presumption of innocence and a fair trial and they have been endorsed as constitutionally compliant by this Court (see Mills; Darrach; J.J.).\n[41] In turn, several of the myths and stereotypes outlined above have now been jurisprudentially condemned as errors of law. For example, it is prohibited for a trial judge to rely on notions such as: delay in a complainant\u2019s disclosure of a sexual assault, alone, undermines the credibility of the disclosure (D.D.; R. v. Lacombe, 2019 ONCA 938, 383 C.C.C. (3d) 114); a complainant\u2019s \u201cfailure\u201d to dress modestly indicates that she is more likely to have consented (Ewanchuk, at para. 103); a complainant\u2019s \u201cfailure\u201d to resist or cry out is suggestive of consent (para. 93); the mere fact of a complainant having psychiatric or therapeutic consultations is relevant to their credibility or reliability (s. 278.3(4) of the Code ); or a complainant associating with or not avoiding the accused after the alleged sexual assault suggests that there was consent and that no assault occurred (A. (A.B.), at paras. 6-12).\n[42] The legislative and jurisprudential treatment of these issues reflects a collective understanding that courts should strive to eradicate myths and stereotypes from their decisions because they threaten the rights of complainants and undermine the truth-seeking function of trials. Today, sexual offences remain underreported and continue to occur mostly against women and children. There remains a \u201cneed to affirm the principles of equality and human dignity in . . . criminal law by addressing the problem of myths and stereotypes about complainants in sexual assault cases\u201d (A.G., at para. 1, per L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9 J., concurring; see R. v. O\u2019Connor, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 411).\n[43] This Court has repeatedly held that \u201cmyths and stereotypes have no place in a rational and just system of law, as they jeopardize the courts\u2019 truth-finding function\u201d (A.G., at para. 2). A trial is a truth-seeking process, and reliance on myths and stereotypes distorts the truth. In Mills, this Court explained that myths and stereotypes about sexual assault victims hamper the search for truth and impose \u201charsh and irrelevant burdens on complainants in prosecutions of sexual offences\u201d (para. 119). While the accused\u2019s constitutional rights must remain at the forefront of any criminal trial, this Court has also acknowledged that measures can be taken to avoid reliance on myths and stereotypes without compromising those rights. Myths and stereotypes in fact undermine a fair trial \u2014 meaning a trial that is fair not only to the accused, but to the complainant and the public (see J.J., at paras. 1-2).\n[44] All of this history puts into perspective the distinct reasons why relying on myths and stereotypes to discredit sexual assault complainants amounts to an error of law \u2014 as opposed to being an ordinary factual finding reviewable for palpable and overriding error. The very reason this error of law emerged was to prevent the accused from discrediting complainants\u2019 testimony on unwarranted, discriminatory grounds, and accordingly to correct the particular advantage accused persons historically had in sexual assault cases as compared to accused persons in other cases: myths and stereotypes are no longer meant to play any role in mounting a defence. The judicial and legislative developments designed to eradicate the categorical discounting of women as witnesses do not create any special benefits in law for complainants in sexual assault cases. They simply remove discriminatory barriers, establish a level testimonial field between sexual assault complainants and complainants in other cases, and ensure the truth-seeking function of the trial is not distorted.\n(b) The Proposed Rule Should Not Be Adopted as a Corollary to the Prohibition Against Myths and Stereotypes\n[45] In sum, the prohibition against myths and stereotypes about sexual assault complainants carries with it a discrete history, purpose, and character. It was designed with the specific goal of protecting complainants against prejudicial or discriminatory reasoning in criminal trials. The proposed rule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions should be rejected because it enlarges that particular context beyond its proper scope.\n(i) The Proposed Rule Disregards the Distinct Character of Myths and Stereotypes\n[46] The types of assumptions captured by the proposed rule do not share the distinct discriminatory character of myths and stereotypes relating to sexual assault complainants, which form a unique category of legal error created to be explicitly remedial in nature. As noted in Find, this Court has been willing to accept the prevailing existence of myths and stereotypes about sexual assault complainants based on \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d from the social science literature (para. 101). There is no comparable legislative recognition of a pattern of improper reliance upon a specific, circumscribed set of generalizations to incorrectly assess the testimony of accused persons in sexual assault cases. Myths and stereotypes about sexual assault complainants are governed by a limited set of legal principles that emerged to redress pervasive systemic prejudice, which was embedded in law and directed against a distinct category of witness \u2014 they cannot be coherently analogized to support a rule prohibiting any generalizations about any witness, including the accused.\n[47] Unlike the proposed rule, the authorities that target sexual assault myths and stereotypes remove from the law specific erroneous assumptions and notions that formerly distorted judicial reasoning and fact-finding on a widespread basis. These myths and stereotypes unfairly undermine the perceived credibility of a specific category of witness before the evidence has even been heard, effectively imbuing complainants\u2019 evidence with a prima facie judgment of frailty. They also distort the legal significance of consent. The legal principles that prohibit judges from relying on specific stereotypes when assessing the testimony of complainants are therefore in a separate category and are fundamentally different from a blanket prohibition on generalizations when assessing testimony at large. Conversely, the proposed rule does not relate to specific, identified, erroneous generalizations about a specific category of witness, many of which were first imposed by law, nor does it protect elements of an offence from taking on a distorted meaning. The rule instead casts a vast net \u2014 effectively transforming all types of factual generalizations, regardless of their nature, into errors of law. In doing so, the rule impermissibly expands the bounds of existing errors of law to any and all factual findings that can be said to amount to assumptions about human behaviour.\n[48] As noted above, there is significant overlap between the rule against common-sense assumptions and the related rule against stereotypical reasoning articulated in J.C.: both rules bar trial judges from using \u201cstereotypes\u201d in their assessments of credibility. However, in J.C. and as adopted by the British Columbia Court of Appeal, the term \u201cstereotype\u201d not only demarcated an error of law, but was used in a manner that effectively encompassed all generalizations about human behaviour. With respect, this is not the correct approach: just because something is a generalization does not necessarily mean it amounts to a stereotype that can be understood as an error of law.\n[49] Generally speaking, all ungrounded assumptions about human behaviour, including stereotypes, share two characteristics. First, they take a general proposition and apply it to a specific individual, foregoing any assessment of that person\u2019s unique characteristics or circumstances. Second, that general proposition is inaccurate or untrue, either in all cases or as applied to that specific individual (see, e.g., R. v. G. (C.M.), 2016 ABQB 368, 41 Alta. L.R. (6th) 374, at para. 60). However, stereotyping goes one step further and connotes a particular legal meaning that merely generalizing does not: specifically, a meaning rooted in discrimination and inequality of treatment.\n[50] The discriminatory character of stereotypes is made plain from our jurisprudence\u2019s understanding of stereotypes about sexual assault complainants. Reliance on such stereotypes was recognized as an error of law for the very purpose of eliminating discrimination against women and promoting their dignity and equality within the justice system. For example, the requirement that a woman raise a \u201chue and cry\u201d was based on the now-discredited assumption that, because rape was the worst thing that could happen to a woman, any credible victim would immediately disclose what happened to the first person she encountered. Accordingly, it is now an error of law to draw an adverse inference from the mere fact that the complainant did not report the assault immediately (D.D., at para. 65). The historical requirement that a complainant\u2019s testimony be corroborated, now abolished, was based on the discriminatory assumption that the testimony of a woman was not, in law, equal to that of a man. The twin myths, now prohibited by s. 276 of the Code , were again based on the discriminatory notion that women who had sex were less trustworthy and did not deserve equal respect and treatment under the law (Seaboyer). The negative stereotypes about sexual assault complainants were recognized as errors of law because they often originated in law, took statutory form, and were founded on the misinterpretation of the now-clear definition of consent as the voluntary, communicated agreement to the sexual activity in question \u2014 a misinterpretation that undermined the core principle of equal justice for all.\n[51] The problem with the proposed rule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions is that it fails to appreciate this crucial dimension. It instead lumps together the sorts of pernicious, discriminatory stereotypes that both the courts and Parliament have worked to condemn and correct with more benign generalizations that, while they may be factually wrong, have nothing to do with inequality of treatment.\n[52] In J.C., for example, the Ontario Court of Appeal found that the trial judge\u2019s characterization of the accused\u2019s evidence as mechanical, rehearsed, and politically correct relied on \u201cstereotype\u201d and therefore amounted to an error of law. In Roth, although the British Columbia Court of Appeal rejected the submission that the trial judge had relied on stereotypes about male behaviour, it nevertheless found that the trial judge\u2019s improper generalization about the accused being a power lifter amounted to an error of law. Regardless of whether these factual assumptions were wrong or right, there is no question they are fundamentally of a different character than inequality-based stereotypes. A witness being discredited because they testified in what the trial judge considered to be an implausible manner, or because of their fitness habits, is simply not the same thing as a complainant being discredited because of her sexual history and therefore \u201cunchaste\u201d character, because she did not resist her assailant, or because she did not report the assault right away. This is in no way meant to condone reliance on improper generalizations in credibility assessments. Rather, it illustrates that ordinary factual generalizations \u2014 which are of a different character than those relating to myths and stereotypes about sexual assault complainants, and do not disclose other recognized errors of law \u2014 should be evaluated for palpable and overriding error.\n[53] The legislative shift towards a more gender-neutral understanding of sexual violence compels courts to also be sensitive to the fact that complainants in sexual assault cases come from all walks of life. By eliminating the inherently gendered crime of rape, Parliament signalled that sexual assault is no longer meant to be limited to the male accused, female complainant paradigm. Stereotypes about complainants that formerly targeted women alone now have the potential to compromise the testimonial assessment of all types of complainants \u2014 for example, although it remains the case that the majority of sexual assault complainants are women, it is an error of law to rely on the doctrine of immediate complaint or on stereotypes about a complainant\u2019s past sexual activity regardless of the complainant\u2019s gender. The wholesale discrediting of complainants as a particular category of witness, at its core, is also rooted in inequality of treatment, as this Court recognized in O\u2019Connor (at para. 123):\n. . . a legal system which devalues the evidence of complainants to sexual assault by de facto presuming their uncreditworthiness would raise similar concerns. It would not reflect, far less promote, \u201ca society in which all are secure in the knowledge that they are recognized at law as human beings equally deserving of concern, respect and consideration\u201d (Andrews v. Law Society of British Columbia, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 143, at p. 171). [Emphasis deleted.]\n(See also Seaboyer, at p. 654.)\n[54] In turn, all sexual assault cases have the potential to engage a broad range of stereotypes beyond those about female complainants. In Barton, for example, this Court recognized specific myths and stereotypes that apply to Indigenous women, which may in turn hinder proper assessments of their credibility and reliability. Courts have also moved away from treating the testimony of very young complainants with inherent suspicion, recognizing that past attitudes did not account for the inherent vulnerability of children and the particular problems they may face when giving evidence (see R. v. F. (W.J.), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 569). I would also stress at this juncture that reliance on stereotypes, being rooted in inequality of treatment, is certainly not just a problem for sexual assault complainants alone. Stereotypical reasoning based in the sort of inequality of treatment at the heart of myths and stereotypes against sexual assault complainants has the potential to affect the testimony of all witnesses in all trials. It remains open to all parties in future cases, including the accused, to argue that trial judges have employed stereotypes rooted in other, analogous forms of inequality of treatment, and therefore erred in law.\n[55] In addition to its unsound foundations, the proposed rule interacts particularly poorly with sexual offence cases given the carefully crafted rules that now govern the assessment of a complainant\u2019s testimony. The Court of Appeal in Mr. Tsang\u2019s case acknowledged the reality that for certain common-sense assumptions about sexual activity to be \u201cgrounded\u201d in the evidence, evidence of a \u201ccomplainant\u2019s own predilections\u201d may be required (para. 19). In that case, to \u201cground\u201d the trial judge\u2019s finding that it was unbelievable the complainant would ask for rough sex, the complainant would first have to be subjected to deeply intrusive questioning about her sexual preferences or past practices. In Mr. Kruk\u2019s case, to \u201cground\u201d the complainant\u2019s testimony that she was not mistaken about the physical sensation of penile-vaginal penetration in the evidence, the complainant would need to testify about previously feeling that sensation.\n[56] The proposed rule thereby drastically expands the scope of permissible questioning into a complainant\u2019s sexual history, effectively requiring both parties to apply, pursuant to Seaboyer (at p. 619) or s. 276 of the Code , to adduce \u201cother sexual activity\u201d evidence that may not otherwise be relevant to the main issues in the case or permitted to make its way into the trial at all. It opens a back door to prohibited twin-myth reasoning insofar as, in the process of \u201cgrounding\u201d the trial judge\u2019s findings about her testimony, evidence of the complainant\u2019s sexual history may be treated as logically probative of her credibility or consent. Although framed in terms of ensuring \u201cequal\u201d treatment for accused in these cases, this approach in fact risks resurrecting the very prejudice against sexual assault complainants that the law on myths and stereotypes was designed to eliminate.\n[57] In sum, the proposed rule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions cannot be understood as a logical extension of legal rules against stereotyping. To the extent it conflates stereotyping with all assumptions about human behaviour, it runs off course. The concept of a stereotype is not closed and no doubt will continue to evolve in future cases: the closer an error is to the types of myths and stereotypes pertaining to sexual assault complainants that have been recognized in the jurisprudence, the more likely it is that it will amount to an error of law. However, all other mere assumptions drawn in the course of credibility and reliability assessments, like other findings of fact, must remain reviewable for palpable and overriding error.\n(ii) The Accused\u2019s Rights Remain Protected\n[58] The respondents argue that the proposed rule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions should be adopted in sexual assault cases out of fairness to the accused. This argument, too, must be rejected. There are crucial legal protections explicitly designed to ensure fairness to the accused that find their source in their own robust body of law. It is essential that these legal protections be taken seriously and given their full effect to ensure the accused\u2019s constitutional rights remain safeguarded. However, the idea that an identical rule mirroring the treatment of myths and stereotypes between complainants and accused is necessary to achieve that goal is misguided.\n[59] The overarching principle of the presumption of innocence, enshrined in s. 11(d) of the Charter , and the correlative principle of the Crown\u2019s burden of proof, must always govern the fact-finding process. The presumption of innocence \u2014 a \u201challowed principle lying at the very heart of criminal law\u201d (R. v. Oakes, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103, at p. 119) \u2014 requires the Crown to bear the onus of proving all essential elements of the offence charged, beyond a reasonable doubt, before a conviction may be entered (Osolin). Closely related to the presumption of innocence is the accused\u2019s right to silence as enshrined in s. 11(c) of the Charter , which safeguards human dignity and privacy against processes or reasoning that would compel an accused person to incriminate themselves with their own words (R. v. Noble, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 874, at paras. 69-78).\n[60] Various protections relating to the assessment and weighing of evidence flow from the presumption of innocence and the right to silence. Notably, an accused\u2019s silence at trial may not be treated as evidence of guilt, as such reasoning would violate both principles (Noble, at para. 72). Likewise, it is improper to discount the credibility of accused persons on the basis that, because they face criminal penalties, they will say anything to protect themselves. Though considering the possibility that the accused may have a motive to lie will not necessarily offend this rule, courts should be wary of going further and drawing the \u201cimpermissible assumption\u201d that they will do so in all cases (R. v. Laboucan, 2010 SCC 12, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 397, at para. 14). Such reasoning is premised on a supposition of guilt and therefore offends the presumption of innocence (para. 12).\n[61] The presumption of innocence also restricts how credibility is assessed in cases of conflicting testimony between defence and Crown witnesses. The analysis of testimony must never be treated as a contest of credibility, and triers of fact need not accept the defence\u2019s evidence or version of events in order to acquit (R. v. Van, 2009 SCC 22, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 716, at para. 23; R. v. W. (D.), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742, at p. 757). The burden never shifts to the accused to establish their own innocence, and the onus always lies with the Crown to prove every essential element (R. v. J.H.S., 2008 SCC 30, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 152, at para. 13).\n[62] Reasonable doubt applies to credibility assessments such that if the evidence the Crown adduced does not rise to the level required of a criminal conviction, an accused cannot be found guilty simply because they are disbelieved (see W. (D.)). Some elements of the totality of the evidence may give rise to a reasonable doubt, even where much \u2014 or all \u2014 of the accused\u2019s evidence is disbelieved. Any aspect of the accepted evidence, or the absence of evidence, may ground a reasonable doubt. Moreover, where the trier of fact does not know whether to believe the accused\u2019s testimony, or does not know who to believe, the accused is entitled to an acquittal (J.H.S., at paras. 9-13; R. v. H. (C.W.) (1991), 68 C.C.C. (3d) 146 (B.C.C.A.); R. v. S. (W.D.), [1994] 3 S.C.R. 521, at p. 533; R. v. Avetysan, 2000 SCC 56, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 745, at para. 19). Finally, where the Crown relies on circumstantial evidence to establish guilt, the trier of fact may only convict if guilt is the only reasonable inference from the evidence (R. v. Villaroman, 2016 SCC 33, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 1000, at para. 30).\n[63] Protections like these ensure fairness to the accused and must guide trial judges in assessing testimony. They impose specific prohibitions regarding identifiable forms of improper reasoning. In so doing, they safeguard the accused\u2019s fundamental Charter rights. Where full effect is properly accorded to them, further restrictions on how trial judges may assess the credibility and reliability of the accused and the complainant that go beyond existing errors of law and the standard of palpable and overriding error are rendered unnecessary. Even where recognized errors of law pertaining to the accused\u2019s rights are not engaged, where the accused chooses to testify or otherwise lead evidence, appellate courts must ensure that trial judges have thoroughly and properly assessed the accused\u2019s account of events. Reliance on illogical, untrue, or otherwise improper assumptions in assessing the evidence of an accused is wrong and remains reversible on appeal if it amounts to palpable and overriding error. It is just that such ordinary factual assumptions cannot be recognized, wholesale, as stand-alone errors of law.\n[64] It must also be emphasized that the concept of myths and stereotypes concerning sexual assault complainants is not unbounded. It has produced a circumscribed set of legal rules that require careful application, close attention to context, and a nuanced understanding of the purpose for which any given piece of evidence is tendered. Some scholars have suggested that the law of myths and stereotypes is presently being overused in contexts where it is inapplicable, or applied without rigour (see, e.g., L. Dufraimont, \u201cCurrent Complications in the Law on Myths and Stereotypes\u201d (2021), 99 Can. Bar Rev. 536). If this problem exists, the appropriate solution is not to extend parallel errors of law that apply to accused persons as well as complainants. Rather, mindful that myths and stereotypes against sexual assault complainants give rise to an error of law, courts must ensure these myths and stereotypes are not extended beyond their permissible scope.\n[65] For example, just because the evidence happens to align with a myth or stereotype does not necessarily mean that any inferences that can be drawn from that evidence will be prejudicial. While it is a myth that women regularly fabricate allegations of sexual assault, it is not an error to consider whether the circumstances of a particular case support the existence of a motive to fabricate (see, e.g., R. v. Esquivel-Benitez, 2020 ONCA 160, 61 C.R. (7th) 326, at paras. 9-15) \u2014 indeed, where the defence adduces evidence on this point, a trial judge is obliged to consider it to give full effect to the presumption of innocence, and a failure to do so constitutes reversible error. Furthermore, while s. 276 of the Code prohibits the use of prior sexual history to support either twin myth, it clearly does not prohibit such evidence point-blank and for all purposes. So long as it is properly screened by s. 276, such evidence may be used, for instance, to resolve inconsistencies between the complainant and the accused\u2019s testimony as to their relationship.\n[66] Our existing legal framework is sufficient to ensure that the accused\u2019s rights remain protected in sexual assault cases. It is vital that the accused\u2019s Charter rights be carefully respected, that any evidence the accused gives be properly assessed, and that the concept of myths and stereotypes remain appropriately constrained to its proper scope. However, there is no need to adopt the proposed rule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions in order to correct any putative unfairness.\n(iii) The Difference Between Factual and Legal Speculation\n[67] The conceptual slippage between stereotyping and generalizing in the jurisprudence of the lower courts illustrates the importance of precisely defining errors of law and keeping them distinct from other factual findings, even erroneous ones. In this vein, brief comment is also warranted in response to the respondent Mr. Tsang\u2019s argument that the proposed rule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions is a logical offshoot of the error of law of \u201cspeculation\u201d. With respect, this submission confuses the colloquial meaning of speculation \u2014 drawing conclusions without basis in fact \u2014 with the more precise form of speculation as an error of law.\n[68] Speculation as an error of law arises where a trial judge has found that certain evidence \u201ccreates a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused, when, on a proper view of the law, that evidence is not capable of creating any doubt as to his guilt\u201d (Wild v. The Queen, [1971] S.C.R. 101, at p. 111). In other words, it is an error of law to fail to distinguish between a rational conclusion as to reasonable doubt based on evidence, and an unsupported conclusion based on conjecture (see Wild; Rousseau v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 38; R. v. B. (G.), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 57; R. v. Clark, 2015 BCCA 488, 407 D.L.R. (4th) 610, at para. 43, aff\u2019d 2017 SCC 3, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 86). The term \u201cspeculation\u201d as invoked in the courts below does not refer to this legal error, but rather is used, as it is in common parlance, to signify drawing any inferences that are allegedly unsupported by evidence.[2] To the extent that, in recognizing the proposed rule, the courts below rely on the error of law of speculation \u2014 which most often arises where trial judges err in acquitting the accused based on speculative alternative explanations \u2014 they are stretching the case law beyond what it logically bears.\n(2) The Proposed Rule Runs Contrary to Established Standards of Review and Is Counterproductive to Proper Testimonial Assessment\n[69] Although the proposed rule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions has often been invoked in the sexual assault context, its applications extend to all criminal cases. I approach these reasons primarily in the context of sexual assault given that this is the offence immediately before the Court, but nothing in them should be taken as an endorsement of the proposed rule in any other case. Part of the justification for the rule\u2019s rejection in the context of these appeals is rooted in the body of law relating to sexual assault myths and stereotypes. However, cognizant that the rule has also been invoked in other contexts,[3] its fundamental weaknesses extend to all criminal appeals.\n[70] With that in mind, another reason why this proposed rule should not be adopted is that it is profoundly incompatible with the established law associated with credibility and reliability findings. The rule is not a cautious or incremental extension of existing principles \u2014 it is instead an unwarranted departure from how appellate courts typically treat trial judges\u2019 credibility findings. By exposing trial judges\u2019 findings to overly invasive appellate review, it creates a serious barrier to meaningful testimonial assessment, creating mischief that will extend across the entire criminal law.\n(a) The Role of Common Sense in Evaluating a Witness\u2019s Testimony\n[71] First, the proposed rule is incompatible with the often inextricable role common-sense assumptions play in credibility and reliability assessments. Testimonial assessment is largely based on inductive reasoning and the particular circumstances of the case: it requires the trier of fact to make assessments based on probable interpretations of the evidence (R. v. Calnen, 2019 SCC 6, [2019] 1 S.C.R. 301, at para. 111; R. v. Munoz (2006), 86 O.R. (3d) 134 (S.C.J.), at para. 23). Testimonial assessment therefore necessarily depends on the life experience a trial judge brings to their task, which, in turn, informs the common-sense inferences they draw from what they see before them.\n[72] It is widely recognized that testimonial assessment requires triers of fact to rely on common-sense assumptions about the evidence. In R. v. Delmas, 2020 ABCA 152, 452 D.L.R. (4th) 375, at para. 31, aff\u2019d 2020 SCC 39, [2020] 3 S.C.R. 780, the Alberta Court of Appeal observed that triers of fact may rely on reason and common sense, life experience, and logic in assessing credibility. In R. v. R.R., 2018 ABCA 287, 366 C.C.C. (3d) 293, the same court held that triers of fact \u201cmust invariably fall back on their common sense, and their acquired knowledge about human behaviour in assessing the credibility and reliability of witnesses\u201d (para. 6). Finally, in R. v. S. (R.D.), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 484, this Court considered that the life experience of trial judges \u2014 though of course not a substitute for evidence, and subject to appropriately circumscribed limits \u2014 \u201cis an important ingredient in the ability to understand human behaviour, to weigh the evidence, and to determine credibility\u201d, and assists with a \u201cmyriad of decisions arising during the course of most trials\u201d (para. 13). Reasoning about how people generally tend to behave, and how things tend to happen, is not only permissible, it is often a necessary component of a complete testimonial assessment.\n[73] In turn, common-sense assumptions necessarily underlie all credibility and reliability assessments. Credibility can only be assessed against a general understanding of \u201cthe way things can and do happen\u201d; it is by applying common sense and generalizing based on their accumulated knowledge about human behaviour that trial judges assess whether a narrative is plausible or \u201cinherently improbable\u201d (R. v. Kiss, 2018 ONCA 184, at para. 31 (CanLII); R. v. Adebogun, 2021 SKCA 136, [2022] 1 W.W.R. 187, at para. 24; R. v. Kontzamanis, 2011 BCCA 184, at para. 38 (CanLII)). Common sense underpins well-established principles guiding credibility assessment \u2014 including the now-universal idea that witnesses who are inconsistent are less likely to be telling the truth \u2014 and assists in assessing the scope and impact of particular inconsistencies. Reliability also requires reference to common-sense assumptions about how witnesses perceive, remember, and relay information, invoking generalizations about how individuals tend to present information that they are remembering accurately and completely, as opposed to matters about which they are unsure or mistaken. A trial judge may, for example, infer that a witness was credible yet unreliable because they appeared sincere but displayed indicia that tend to suggest an unclear or uncertain memory (e.g., equivocation, phrases such as \u201chmm . . . let me see\u201d, long pauses, or failure to provide much detail).\n[74] Even the proponents of the rule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions accept that common sense is necessary and, to some extent, inevitable, to the task of testimonial assessment. The Court of Appeal in Mr. Kruk\u2019s case acknowledged that in \u201cworking through the minefield of legal and evidentiary issues, trial judges apply their common sense to the evidence to reach sound verdicts\u201d (para. 2), and indeed, \u201c[r]elying on their life experience to assess the credibility of witnesses is a daily and appropriate exercise for trial judges\u201d (para. 41). In J.C., the court held that there is no bar on relying on common sense or human experience to identify inferences arising from the evidence \u2014 otherwise, circumstantial evidence, which depends on bridging gaps between the evidence and the inference drawn using human experience, would not be admissible at all. The court also correctly observed that there is no bar on using human experience to draw inferences from evidence. Otherwise, many other well-established principles of evidence \u2014 such as the idea that fleeing the scene or destroying evidence after a criminal offence is generally proof of concealment of guilt \u2014 would also be put at risk.\n[75] By prohibiting ungrounded common-sense assumptions, the proposed rule interferes with the necessary recourse to common sense as a part of testimonial analysis. Trial judges are uniquely tasked with assessing the testimony they hear and interpreting the range of possible inferences arising from the evidence. They must be able to rely not only on their judicial experience as fact-finders, but also on their common sense and the generalized expectations it generates about human behaviour. Trial judges will naturally rely on \u201cungrounded\u201d assumptions about human behaviour in their testimonial assessments and thereby draw on factors that lie outside the immediate record. The judicial function entitles them to do so without requiring extrinsic evidence to support each and every one of their conclusions.\n[76] The proposed rule\u2019s rationale is belied by a contradiction inherent in its own logic. It prohibits relying on common sense to introduce new considerations not arising from evidence \u2014 while simultaneously acknowledging that common sense can be used as an interpretive aid, which necessarily involves importing considerations arising not from the evidence itself but from a judge\u2019s accumulated life experience. It is effectively impossible to draw a clear boundary between using human experience to interpret evidence or draw inferences (which is permissible under the rule) and introducing new considerations into the evidence (which is not).\n[77] According to the rule as described by the majority of the Court of Appeal below in Mr. Tsang\u2019s case, impermissible reasoning is: \u201caffected by implicit, unsupported assumptions about \u2018normal behaviour\u2019\u201d (para. 53); \u201cunsubstantiated, untethered to the evidence and a prejudicial stereotype\u201d (para. 65); \u201cassumptions with respect to human behaviour\u201d (para. 73); \u201cgeneralizations about normative behaviour [that] did not rest on the evidence\u201d (para. 74); \u201cunfounded\u201d assumptions or \u201cgeneralizations\u201d (paras. 84 and 112); and \u201cunsupported inferences\u201d (para. 115). On the other hand, permissible reasoning includes: \u201c. . . a conclusion about what this complainant is likely to have done in these circumstances\u201d (para. 39 (emphasis deleted)); and \u201cthe class of inferences relating to behaviour that may fairly be drawn\u201d and \u201cnot used to draw an inference that is \u2018unfair and inaccurate\u2019\u201d (para. 40). Curiously, the Court of Appeal in Mr. Tsang\u2019s case considered it permissible to infer that people who have recently met are unlikely to want to share drinking glasses, because such an inference is \u201cbased on common sense and [is] not prejudicial\u201d (para. 40). Yet this inference is undeniably a generalization about human behaviour that was not grounded in any evidence.\n[78] Given that a trial judge is inevitably bound to rely on a common-sense assumption at some point when assessing a witness\u2019s testimony, the ill-defined requirement that such assumptions must be \u201cgrounded in evidence\u201d would also compel counsel in criminal cases to lead direct evidence to establish a wide range of notions that are generally true. To return to the example from Mr. Tsang\u2019s case, to properly be able to find that people who have just met are unlikely to share drinking glasses at a bar \u2014 putting aside whether this is actually the case \u2014 the court would require direct evidence, presumably from the witnesses themselves. This evidence might include how closely each witness typically interacts with strangers in bars, their personal hygiene habits, and any inclinations or aversions they may have to sharing drinks with people they do not know, as well as presumably the underlying reasons for all of these propositions. Such matters are mundane, take up inordinate amounts of trial time, and are often of minimal, if any, relevance to the alleged offence. Particularly in sexual assault cases, which are already fraught with complexities, the incredible complications this type of evidentiary obligation would occasion cannot be understated.\n[79] In sum, the proposed rule is fundamentally unfaithful to the necessary and proper use of common sense when assessing the testimony of witnesses. Worse, the rule also fails to establish any discernable boundary between the permissible and impermissible uses of common-sense assumptions. There is no coherent method to determine what assumptions are sufficiently uncontroversial to be \u201cgrounded in the evidence\u201d, nor how much evidence is required to \u201cground\u201d them. Instead, as explained further below, the rule seems to reduce this question to what a particular reviewing court deems to be fair, accurate, or uncontentious. The rule thereby invites appellate courts to substitute their opinions about what generalizations are appropriate or instructive in any given circumstance for those of trial judges, improperly transforming their \u201cstrong opposition to [a] trial judge\u2019s factual inferences . . . into supposed legal errors\u201d (R. v. George, 2017 SCC 38, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 1021, at para. 17; A.F. (Tsang), at para. 74). This dynamic creates uncertainty and unfairness on appeal.\n(b) Established Standards of Review for Credibility and Reliability Assessments\n[80] The proposed rule runs contrary to well-established standards of review and would unduly increase the scope of appellate intervention into the credibility and reliability assessments of trial judges. Adopting the rule would compromise the delicate task trial judges undertake when evaluating the evidence of a witness by subjecting their reasons to unjustifiably invasive appellate scrutiny.\n[81] Assessments of credibility and reliability can be the most important judicial determinations in a criminal trial. They are certainly among the most difficult. This is especially so in sexual assault cases, which often involve acts that allegedly occurred in private and hinge on the contradictory testimony of two witnesses. The trial judge, while remaining grounded in the totality of the evidence, is obliged to evaluate the testimony of each witness and to make determinations that are entirely personal and particular to that individual. Credibility and reliability assessments are also context-specific and multifactorial: they do not operate along fixed lines and are \u201cmore of an \u2018art than a science\u2019\u201d (S. (R.D.), at para. 128; R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 621).[4] With respect to credibility in particular, while coherent reasons are crucial, it is often difficult for trial judges to precisely articulate the reasons why they believed or disbelieved a witness due to \u201cthe complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events\u201d (Gagnon, at para. 20; see also R. v. R.E.M., 2008 SCC 51, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 3, at para. 28; R. v. G.F., 2021 SCC 20, [2021] 1 S.C.R. 801, at para. 81). The task is further complicated by the trial judge\u2019s ability to accept some, all, or none of a witness\u2019s testimony.\n[82] The governing standard of review applicable to findings of credibility and reliability is well established: absent a recognized error of law, such findings are entitled to deference unless a palpable and overriding error can be shown (Gagnon, at para. 10, citing Schwartz v. Canada, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 254, at paras. 32-33; H.L. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2005 SCC 25, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 401, at para. 74). Credibility and reliability findings typically do not engage errors of law, as at their core they relate to the extent to which a judge has relied upon a particular factor and how closely that factor is tied to the evidence. Although such findings may be overturned on correctness if errors of law are disclosed, in most cases it is preferable to review them using the nuanced and holistic standard of palpable and overriding error \u2014 which defers to the conclusions of trial judges who have had direct exposure to the witnesses themselves.\n[83] Trial judges have expertise in assessing and weighing the facts, and their decisions reflect a familiarity that only comes with having sat through the entire case. The reasons for the deference accorded to a trial judge\u2019s factual and credibility findings include: (1) limiting the cost, number, and length of appeals; (2) promoting the autonomy and integrity of trial proceedings; and (3) recognizing the expertise and advantageous position of the trial judge (Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, at paras. 12-18). In light of the practical difficulty of explaining the constellation of impressions that inform them, it is well-established that \u201cparticular deference\u201d should be accorded to credibility findings (G.F., at para. 81). Appellate courts are comparatively ill-suited to credibility and reliability assessment, being restricted to reviewing written transcripts of testimony and often focussing narrowly, even telescopically, on particular issues as opposed to seeing the case and the evidence as a whole (Housen, at para. 14, citing R. D. Gibbens, \u201cAppellate Review of Findings of Fact\u201d (1991-92), 13 Advocates\u2019 Q. 445, at p. 446).\n[84] The unique nature of testimonial assessment also guides how reviewing courts approach their task on appeal. Appellate courts must be mindful of the acute practical difficulties trial judges face in articulating why a particular witness was believed or disbelieved, tasked as they are with interpreting the various impressions and inferences that arise from the evidence (Gagnon, at para. 20; see also R.E.M., at para. 28; G.F., at para. 81). An appellate court should examine a trial judge\u2019s reasons as a whole and refrain from parsing their \u201cindividual linguistic components\u201d, as such an invasive approach would \u201cundermine the trial judge\u2019s responsibility for weighing all of the evidence\u201d (Gagnon, at para. 19; see also Housen, at para. 72; G.F., at para. 69; R. v. Chung, 2020 SCC 8, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 405, at para. 33; R.E.M., at paras. 35 and 54). The need to review the entire record and for a full, flexible and functional approach when scrutinizing the findings of a trial judge is tied to the nature of the decision-making process at trial: reasons for judgment \u201care not intended to be, and should not be read, as a verbalization of the entire process engaged in by the trial judge in reaching a verdict\u201d (R. v. Morrissey (1995), 22 O.R. (3d) 514 (C.A.), at p. 525).\n[85] The palpable and overriding error standard strikes the appropriate balance between deference to the factual findings of the trial judge and the need for meaningful review of criminal cases on appeal. Although this standard is duly deferential to the trial judge\u2019s unique vantage point and expertise, even under this more deferential standard, appellate courts must determine whether the trial judge\u2019s findings on credibility and reliability are \u201cthe product of an evidence-based and context-specific assessment\u201d of the witness\u2019s testimony (R. v. Pastro, 2021 BCCA 149, 71 C.R. (7th) 296, at para. 67). Trial judges must \u201cclearly articulat[e]\u201d the basis for their assessments and point to \u201ca nexus to the facts of the case\u201d as opposed to relying on \u201cassumptions about expected responses or conduct\u201d (Tanovich, at p. 92). Yet, the proposed rule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions undercuts the rationale for the palpable and overriding error standard by inviting appeal courts to examine the specific language of particular common-sense reasoning and scrutinize it on a standard of correctness. The ensuing appellate review exercise quickly becomes highly interventionist, cumbersome, and almost entirely unpredictable.\n[86] Invoking the proposed rule, appellate courts have been invited to parse trial reasons, attack generic statements made in the course of credibility assessments, and frame any credibility findings based on human behaviour as impermissible stereotypes or common-sense assumptions untethered to evidence. In Perkins, Cepic, Roth, and J.C., the appeal courts quashed the convictions due to errors in the trial judges\u2019 credibility assessments, concluding that the trial judges went beyond allowable common-sense inferences and engaged in reasoning not grounded in the evidence. In other cases, a review of the findings as a whole demonstrated that the trial judges had employed no unfounded assumptions and rather the credibility assessments had been conducted in relation to the parties and circumstances before the court. The jurisprudence in this area is variable, even volatile, and evinces the need for a more consistent approach to appellate review (see Perkins; Roth; Cepic; J.C.; see, contra, Pastro, at paras. 68-69; R. v. Greif, 2021 BCCA 187, at paras. 68-69 (CanLII); Adebogun; R. v. Al-Rawi, 2021 NSCA 86, 410 C.C.C. (3d) 385; R. v. K.B.W., 2022 SKCA 8; R. v. L.L., 2022 ONCA 50; R. v. Lapierre, 2022 NSCA 12; Kritik-Langer v. R., 2022 QCCA 657; R. v. Kavanagh, 2022 BCCA 225; R. v. D.B., 2022 SKCA 76, 415 C.C.C. (3d) 455; R. v. S.A., 2022 ONCA 642; R. v. S.M., 2023 ONCA 417).\n[87] With respect, the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in Mr. Tsang\u2019s case illustrates the microscopic form of appellate review this very Court has cautioned against. The Court of Appeal targeted specific word choices, approving certain formulations of the trial judge\u2019s credibility findings while implying that even slightly different word choices would have been erroneous. For example, in holding that the trial judge did not rely on a prejudicial generalization in refusing to believe the complainant had physically expressed her interest in the accused on the dance floor, the court emphasized that the \u201ctrial judge did not conclude simply that [the idea] was \u2018not capable of belief\u2019\u201d but that \u201cit was not capable of belief in the circumstances\u201d (para. 33 (emphasis in original)). Similarly, approving of the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that it was unlikely the parties would have shared a drink because they were effectively strangers, the court held, \u201c[i]mportantly . . ., the trial judge did not say [Mr. Tsang\u2019s] evidence about sharing a drink was \u2018unbelievable\u2019, it was simply \u2018unlikely\u2019 to have occurred\u201d (para. 40).\n[88] The proposed rule also risks diverting the focus of the trial judge\u2019s reasons on plausibility to issues of form over substance, creating a chilling effect against thorough and frank reasons. Under the rule, it would be permissible for a trial judge to find it implausible that x, y, or z would have occurred in the circumstances of the case \u2014 but it would be impermissible to plainly state the common-sense premise that underpins the finding of implausibility, for fear that an appellate court would deem that premise \u201cungrounded\u201d in the evidence at trial. The unstated barometer underpinning plausibility is a generalized expectation about how events tend to unfold and how people tend to behave in particular situations, meaning that common-sense assumptions represent a necessary measuring stick against which to assess the plausibility of a narrative. Yet the proposed rule leads judges into a catch-22, as the judge\u2019s reasons (read functionally and contextually) must provide both the \u201cwhat\u201d and the \u201cwhy\u201d (G.F., at paras. 68-70).\n[89] This form of appellate review directly cuts against established principles and leads to arbitrariness in outcomes. It does not, in my respectful view, advance the interests of justice. To the extent trial judges are the ones who have heard the evidence, they are best placed to make the complex and multifaceted factual findings that culminate in fair and nuanced credibility assessments. Deference to trial judges\u2019 assessments of that evidence and the words they choose to describe it is warranted.\n[90] In general, the introduction of new errors of law has the potential to upset the established balance in relation to credibility and reliability findings. Review based on an error of law may invite a \u201cyes-no\u201d answer measured on a standard of correctness, which opens the door to undue scrutiny of matters properly before the trial judge. To some extent, the materiality inquiry associated with the rule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions \u2014 under which the appellant must show that such reasoning \u201cmattered in arriving at the impugned factual finding\u201d (J.C., at para. 100) \u2014 mitigates the categorical nature of an error of law. However, in my view, it remains preferable to assess whether an error has been made in the first place based on the palpable and overriding standard. An overriding error is necessarily material because it must be shown to have affected the trial judge\u2019s decision \u2014 but it is important to emphasize that an overriding error affects not just an isolated finding of fact, which may or may not have played a role in reaching the outcome, but the trial judge\u2019s decision as a whole. It is not enough for an appellant asserting palpable and overriding error to pull at leaves and branches and leave the tree standing; the entire tree must fall (South Yukon Forest Corp. v. Canada, 2012 FCA 165, 431 N.R. 286, at para. 46, cited in Benhaim v. St-Germain, 2016 SCC 48, [2016] 2 S.C.R. 352, at para. 38, and Salomon v. Matte-Thompson, 2019 SCC 14, [2019] 1 S.C.R. 729, at para. 116).\n[91] Overall, the palpable and overriding error standard fosters an appropriately holistic approach to appellate review. As compared to the invasive method associated with the proposed error of law, palpable and overriding error is far better attuned to the deference rightly afforded to trial judges\u2019 factual findings, including with respect to credibility and reliability findings. There is simply no need for this Court to endorse a departure from that established approach \u2014 let alone one so substantial \u2014 by recognizing a new error whose far-reaching repercussions would reverberate across the entire criminal law.\n(3) Summary\n[92] For the reasons outlined above, the proposed rule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions should not be recognized as giving rise to an error of law. The rule is in no way analogous to the body of law protecting sexual assault complainants from myths and stereotypes, nor can it be justified as necessary to ensure fairness to the accused. It also treats any and all factual assumptions drawn in the course of testimonial assessments as errors of law and thereby represents an unjustified departure from well-established principles governing testimonial assessment and appellate standards of review.\n[93] Without the rule in play, appellate courts are left to rely on the existing and well-established law on assessing a trial judge\u2019s credibility or reliability assessments. For the utmost clarity, the applicable framework can be summarized as follows.\n[94] First, where an appellant alleges that a trial judge erroneously relied on a \u201ccommon-sense\u201d assumption in their testimonial assessment, the reviewing court should first consider whether what is being impugned is, in fact, an assumption. Given the nature of how witnesses give evidence and the need to read the trial judge\u2019s reasons as a whole, what might appear to be an assumption on its face may actually be a judge\u2019s particular finding about the witness based on the evidence.\n[95] Second, once satisfied that the trial judge did, in fact, rely on an assumption that is beyond the bounds of what common sense and the judicial function support, the reviewing court should identify the appropriate standard of review applicable to the impugned portion of the trial judge\u2019s credibility or reliability assessment.\n[96] The standard of review will be correctness if the error alleged is a recognized error of law. Nothing in these reasons should be taken to limit the scope of existing errors of law relating to testimonial assessments that this Court has previously approved. Such errors may include reliance on myths and stereotypes about sexual assault complainants, as well as any improper and incorrect assumptions about accused persons that run contrary to fundamental principles such as the right to silence and the presumption of innocence. Testimonial assessments may also become vulnerable to correctness review for reasonable apprehension of bias (S. (R.D.), at paras. 91-141), making a finding of fact for which there is no evidence (R. v. J.M.H., 2011 SCC 45, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 197, at para. 25; Schuldt v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 592, at p. 604), and improperly taking judicial notice (see, e.g., R. v. Poperechny, 2020 MBCA 81, 396 C.C.C. (3d) 478). As discussed, reliance on stereotypes other than myths and stereotypes about sexual assault complainants, but which are similarly rooted in inequality of treatment, may also amount to errors of law, and it remains open to all parties to argue as much in future cases. The list of errors of law is not closed \u2014 but the rule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions is not on it.\n[97] Absent an error of law, the standard of review will be palpable and overriding error. The reviewing court must first determine whether the erroneous reliance on the assumption is palpable, in that it is \u201cplainly seen\u201d, \u201cplainly identified\u201d, or \u201cobvious\u201d (see Housen, at paras. 5-6; R. v. Clark, 2005 SCC 2, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 6, at para. 9; Benhaim, at para. 38, citing South Yukon Forest Corp., at para. 46). Palpable errors in this context will include, for example, where the assumption in question is obviously untrue on its face, or where it is untrue or inapplicable in light of the other accepted evidence or findings of fact. Although trial judges are clearly best placed to make factual findings and assess the accuracy of generalizations, appellate courts can balance the need for deference to those findings with employing their own common sense to determine whether the presumption was clearly illogical or unwarranted so as to make out a palpable error. Appellate courts are routinely tasked with, for example, considering whether based on \u201clogic and human experience\u201d a particular piece of evidence was relevant or whether an accused\u2019s after-the-fact conduct was consistent with that of a guilty person (R. v. Corbett, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670, at p. 715; see R. v. White, 2011 SCC 13, [2011] 1 S.C.R. 433, at para. 17). In the context of factual generalizations, so long as the assessment remains focused on whether there was any palpable error, such an exercise remains an integral part of the judicial function of a reviewing court.\n[98] Once a palpable error has been identified, the reviewing court must also find that the erroneous reliance on the assumption was overriding, in that it is \u201cshown to have affected the result\u201d or \u201cgoes to the very core of the outcome of the case\u201d (Clark (2005), at para. 9; Benhaim, at para. 38, citing South Yukon Forest Corp., at para. 46). If it cannot be shown that the error was palpable and overriding, a trial judge\u2019s assessment of credibility or reliability will be entitled to deference and there will be no basis for appellate intervention.\n[99] Given that I have found that a breach of the proposed rule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions should not be recognized as an error of law, many of the assumptions identified in the cases below, including those in the cases before this Court, in fact should have been reviewed for palpable and overriding error. Such an approach accords due deference to the trial judges\u2019 factual findings and the role common sense played in their testimonial assessments. At the same time, it should also be emphasized that common sense is far from a catch-all phrase that licenses any form of reasoning, no matter how faulty. Common sense is not always \u201ccommon\u201d, does not always make \u201csense\u201d, and worst of all, may be based on falsehoods or discriminatory beliefs. However, so long as the trial judge\u2019s use and invocation of common sense is appropriately constrained by the legal principles applicable to appellate review in general, there is nothing inherently objectionable about its use in testimonial assessment. If and when the permissible bounds of common sense have been exceeded, appellate courts may intervene. As Fitch J.A. succinctly summarized in Pastro (at para. 41):\nJudges are entitled, and expected, to rely on their life experience in making credibility findings. This necessarily includes drawing common-sense inferences from established facts. Juries are routinely instructed along the same lines \u2014 to come to common-sense conclusions based on the evidence they accept. Where it is apparent from a review of the reasons as a whole that a credibility assessment is rooted in the evidence, and is the product of a case-specific determination about what the complainant and accused did or did not do, there will be no basis for appellate intervention, absent palpable and overriding error in fact . . . . [Emphasis added; citations omitted.]\nIV. Application\n[100] Having rejected the proposed rule, I would allow both appeals and restore the convictions. In both cases, the Court of Appeal erred in using the rule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions and reviewing the alleged improper generalizations on a correctness standard. As a result, the court failed to adopt the required contextual and functional review, leading it to overturn the trial judges\u2019 decisions without a proper basis to do so.\n[101] With respect, the Court of Appeal\u2019s approach in both cases reflects the fundamental problems with the rule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions. The rule invited the court to parse the trial judges\u2019 reasons in search of any assumptions drawn in their credibility and reliability assessments. This had the unfortunate effect of misidentifying particular phrases the trial judges used as \u201cassumptions\u201d, divorcing those findings from their context and the reasons as a whole. In going even further and elevating the alleged assumptions into errors of law, the court applied the wrong standard of review. As a result, in both cases, many of the assumptions identified by the court were either not assumptions at all or were otherwise ordinary factual findings reviewable for palpable and overriding error.\nA. Mr. Kruk\n[102] In Mr. Kruk\u2019s case, the Court of Appeal erred in concluding that the trial judge relied on speculative reasoning in accepting the complainant\u2019s evidence based on his observation that it \u201cis extremely unlikely that a woman would be mistaken about that feeling [of having a penis inside her]\u201d (trial reasons, at para. 68 (emphasis added)). In context, it is clear that the impugned statement, while perhaps unfortunately worded, was in fact not a generalization at all, but a specific articulation of the judge\u2019s response to a theory advocated by the defence.\n[103] First, in its analysis of the impugned statement, the Court of Appeal erred in failing to consider the whole of the judge\u2019s findings. The court observed that the trial judge had \u201crejected important parts of Mr. Kruk\u2019s evidence\u201d \u2014 including his evidence that he had given the complainant\u2019s parents his address, that the complainant had kicked off her own pants, and that he had only failed to contact the complainant\u2019s mother after a certain point because his phone had died \u2014 and that the judge had found inconsistencies between Mr. Kruk\u2019s testimony and prior statement to police (paras. 28\u201129). The court also acknowledged that despite the trial judge\u2019s concerns about the complainant\u2019s reliability due to her intoxication, the trial judge had accepted her \u201ccore assertion\u201d that she woke up to Mr. Kruk\u2019s penis inside of her, as well as the circumstantial evidence in support thereof (paras. 30-32). However, these same findings appeared to play no role in the court\u2019s analysis. Despite noting at the outset that, in addition to the complainant\u2019s reliability, Mr. Kruk\u2019s credibility was a central issue in the case, the court\u2019s analysis focused solely on the issue of the complainant\u2019s reliability, the judge\u2019s acceptance of the complainant\u2019s assertion of sexual assault, and the single impugned statement at para. 68 of the trial reasons: \u201cIt is extremely unlikely that a woman would be mistaken about that feeling.\u201d The Court of Appeal characterized this single statement as the \u201cprimary reason\u201d for the trial judge\u2019s acceptance of the complainant\u2019s evidence \u2014 the \u201cwhy\u201d of the judgment (paras. 63 and 65 (emphasis deleted)) \u2014 when it was para. 68 of the trial reasons as a whole, in conjunction with the judge\u2019s adverse credibility findings concerning Mr. Kruk and his observations at paras. 69-70 of the trial reasons about circumstantial evidence consistent with a sexual encounter having occurred, that in fact conveyed \u201cwhy\u201d Mr. Kruk should be convicted.\n[104] In this vein, the Court of Appeal also failed to give due regard to the judge\u2019s specific credibility findings respecting Mr. Kruk. Though briefly acknowledged elsewhere, the court\u2019s analysis of the trial judge\u2019s errors makes no reference to the judge\u2019s characterization of Mr. Kruk\u2019s explanation that the complainant kicked off her own pants as \u201cimprobable in the extreme\u201d and the finding that Mr. Kruk lied to police about an extremely important fact: that he was wearing swim trunks, with no shirt, when the complainant\u2019s father arrived to find his daughter (trial reasons, at paras. 60 and 63). Nor is there any consideration of the fact that Mr. Kruk\u2019s failure to contact the complainant\u2019s mother was \u201cinconsistent with [his stated] desire to be rid of the complainant and potentially consistent with some other motivation on his part\u201d (trial reasons, at para. 67). These important findings are part and parcel of the judge\u2019s finding of guilt and worked to contextualize the impugned statement about the complainant \u2014 \u201ca woman\u201d \u2014 not being mistaken about the feeling of penetration. In my respectful view, this statement was merely a reflection of the trial judge\u2019s reasoning as opposed to reliance on an improper generalization.\n[105] Viewed as a whole and in context, the trial judge did not reject the defence theory because of an assumption that no woman would be mistaken, but rather because he accepted the complainant\u2019s testimony that she was not mistaken. Despite her intoxication, he found the complainant\u2019s evidence on the material issue of whether there was penile-vaginal penetration to be reliable and therefore sufficient to ground a conviction. The trial judge addressed this theory at para. 68 of his reasons, acknowledging that whether the offence had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt depended on the complainant\u2019s core assertion that she felt Mr. Kruk\u2019s penis inside her vagina. He went on to say (at para. 68):\n[The complainant\u2019s] evidence is devoid of detail, yet she claims to be certain that she was not mistaken. She said she felt his penis inside her and she knew what she was feeling. In short, her tactile sense was engaged. It is extremely unlikely that a woman would be mistaken about that feeling.\n[106] A functional and contextual reading of this passage of the trial reasons demonstrates that the impugned line was not an assumption or inappropriate \u201cspeculation\u201d, as the Court of Appeal characterized it, but rather a response to the defence theory advanced in closing submissions: that the complainant, though sincere, was mistaken about the physical sensation of penile\u2011vaginal penetration due to her intoxication and panic after she awoke, which caused her to assume the worst.\n[107] Even accepting the possibility that the trial judge relied on an assumption in making this finding, the Court of Appeal erred in reviewing that assumption for correctness based on the proposed rule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions. The appropriate standard of review was palpable and overriding error. In this regard, the trial judge bore in mind that, as a matter of common sense, it is extremely unlikely that someone would be mistaken about the feeling of penile\u2011vaginal penetration. This assumption is not wrong in the sense of being untrue or inaccurate. It was a permissible assumption against which to consider the complainant\u2019s testimony that she was certain as to what she had felt. It discloses no palpable or overriding error.\n[108] The Court of Appeal also considered that the trial judge\u2019s conclusion about the complainant\u2019s perception of penile\u2011vaginal penetration was not the proper subject of judicial notice, as it engaged questions of \u201cneurology (the operation of the body\u2019s sensory system), physiology (the impact of alcohol on perception, memory and the body\u2019s sensory system) and psychiatry (the impact of alcohol and\/or trauma on perception and memory)\u201d (para. 67). With respect, the court\u2019s analysis on this point illustrates the potentially absurd consequences of the rule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions. It belies belief that questions of neurology, physiology, or psychiatry would be engaged by testimony that an intoxicated witness was certain they were physically assaulted in some other way, such as a punch to the face or a kick to the shins, such that expert evidence would be required to support that testimony \u2014 yet this is exactly the type of evidence the court implied was necessary for the trial judge to reach the conclusion he did in the context of penile-vaginal penetration. Even putting aside the impracticalities associated with finding experts willing and able to testify on such issues, such testimony is simply not necessary to establish what the trial judge determined to be what happened, having heard the complainant\u2019s testimony and considering it in light of all the other evidence.\n[109] Where a person with a vagina testifies credibly and with certainty that they felt penile\u2011vaginal penetration, a trial judge must be entitled to conclude that they are unlikely to be mistaken. While the choice of the trial judge to use the words \u201ca woman\u201d may have been unfortunate and engendered confusion, in context, it is clear the judge was reasoning that it was extremely unlikely that the complainant would be mistaken about the feeling of penile\u2011vaginal penetration because people generally, even if intoxicated, are not mistaken about that sensation. In other words, the judge\u2019s conclusion was grounded in his assessment of the complainant\u2019s testimony. The Court of Appeal erred in finding otherwise.\nB. Mr. Tsang\n[110] In Mr. Tsang\u2019s case, the Court of Appeal erred in concluding that the judge\u2019s assessment of the accused and the complainant\u2019s credibility was fatally affected by three material unfounded assumptions about normal behaviour: a person would not ask to be spanked \u201cout of the blue\u201d; a controlling person would not refrain from engaging in vaginal intercourse because they could not find a condom; and a person would not abruptly drive away from someone with whom they had just had consensual sex. Again, these first two assumptions were, in fact, not assumptions but statements that reflected the trial judge\u2019s reasoning process and findings of fact. The third assumption, though truly an assumption and one that was palpably incorrect, was not overriding, as it did not affect the core of the trial judge\u2019s finding of guilt.\n[111] As a general observation, just as was the case in Mr. Kruk\u2019s appeal, the Court of Appeal erred by not considering the whole of the trial judge\u2019s reasons when it conducted its review. At the outset of its analysis, the court stated at para. 29 that the \u201cfocus of [their] attention\u201d was on the trial judge\u2019s assessment of the complainant\u2019s and Mr. Tsang\u2019s credibility set out at paras. 117-58 of her reasons. While the identified paragraphs comprise the whole of the trial judge\u2019s credibility analysis, the court\u2019s assessment of each alleged error was narrower in scope. In particular, the court artificially segmented what happened in the car from what happened earlier in the night and thus did not view the judge\u2019s analysis as a whole.\n[112] This is especially apparent from the court\u2019s finding that the trial judge had rejected Mr. Tsang\u2019s evidence about what happened in the car, where the alleged assault occurred, based on unfounded assumptions. The court explicitly held that the judge\u2019s prior finding that Mr. Tsang was untruthful about what had occurred at the after-party at the club was \u201cbound to have coloured her assessment of [Mr. Tsang\u2019s] evidence about what happened later\u201d, but the court was unwilling to find that the earlier rebuffing of Mr. Tsang \u201cweighed heavily in her rejection\u201d of his evidence on what happened in the car (para. 45). In other words, the court disregarded the trial judge\u2019s adverse credibility findings against Mr. Tsang (trial reasons, at paras. 118-23).\n[113] The court also segmented the complainant\u2019s evidence. It acknowledged the judge\u2019s finding that the complainant had no interest in Mr. Tsang while at the club, but then characterized the \u201csexual foreplay\u201d that occurred in the car as a \u201cmarked departure from her previous behaviour\u201d, noting that the \u201ccomplainant\u2019s resistance to [Mr. Tsang\u2019s] advances clearly diminished by the time they got to the parking lot\u201d (para. 52). As such, the court determined that \u201cthe complainant\u2019s conduct earlier in the evening cannot be said to provide a reliable basis for conclusions with respect to consensual behaviour in the parked car\u201d (para. 52). Though not the main issue on appeal, I note that in doing so, the court improperly reweighed the evidence to come to its own finding about what evidence could provide a \u201creliable basis\u201d for the judge\u2019s subsequent conclusions.\n[114] This description of the complainant\u2019s behaviour in the car as a \u201cmarked departure\u201d ignores the thrust of her evidence: that \u201cshe was engaging in risk management\u201d and chose to remain in the car because she was \u201cscantily attired\u201d and did not feel safe walking home through a bad neighbourhood where the sex trade occurs (trial reasons, at para. 53). She decided to get into the backseat of the car to kiss Mr. Tsang, even though the tip of his penis was exposed, because: \u201c. . . the two of them had mutual friends and she thought she had a general idea of who he was. She said a man could just grab her off the street or she could stay with a guy she thought she knew. She thought that maybe giving Mr. Tsang a bit of what he wanted by making out, meaning kissing, was a little safer\u201d (para. 54 (emphasis added)).\n[115] The trial judge\u2019s analysis was alive to this aspect of the complainant\u2019s evidence. In considering the evidence that the complainant sat on Mr. Tsang\u2019s lap at the club, the judge quoted the complainant\u2019s testimony that \u201cyou pick your fights\u201d (para. 141). Then, in considering that the complainant directed Mr. Tsang to pull into a parking lot, the judge observed that the complainant \u201cweighed her options in her drunken state and decided to stay with a man who she had not perceived to be a threat to her that evening rather than walk home dressed as she was in a neighbourhood she thought to be unsafe\u201d (para. 143). In finding that the complainant\u2019s behaviour was a \u201cmarked departure\u201d, the Court of Appeal did not accord appropriate deference to the trial judge\u2019s findings about what happened earlier in the night and the judge\u2019s uses of those findings to assess the testimony about what happened in the car, and improperly reweighed the evidence.\n[116] Just as in Mr. Kruk\u2019s case, the court\u2019s approach to reviewing the reasons led it astray. When the trial judge\u2019s reasons are viewed holistically and in context, in my respectful view, the first two \u201cassumptions\u201d the Court of Appeal identified were not assumptions at all, and the third assumption did not amount to an overriding error.\n[117] On the first alleged assumption, the Court of Appeal found two paragraphs in particular to be problematic:\nWhile I accept Mr. Tsang\u2019s evidence that [the complainant] got into the back seat with him and consented to engage in some sexual foreplay, it is not believable that [the complainant] would have asked him to spank her. Moreover, given the encounter thus far in the back seat, a belief that [the complainant] was gearing up for rough sex with Mr. Tsang would be a fanciful and unfounded one on his part. The comments he testified to sounded contrived as if he were describing how he thought such an encounter might unfold rather than what really happened in the parking lot that night.\n. . .\n. . . Mr. Tsang\u2019s evidence this was consensual rings hollow in the opinion of the Court. His testimony about the things he said to [the complainant] and what she said to him seemed lifted from a pornographic script completely at odds with their encounter up to that point.\n(trial reasons, at paras. 126 and 148)\n[118] The Court of Appeal characterized the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that it was unbelievable the complainant would ask to be spanked as \u201ca bald statement untethered to any evidence\u201d, considering that the trial judge\u2019s \u201cprimary rationale\u201d for rejecting the conclusion appeared to be \u201csimply that it is \u2018unbelievable\u2019\u201d (paras. 48-49). The court went on to emphasize that, absent extrinsic evidence to support it, the trial judge\u2019s conclusion about spanking could \u201conly have been founded upon an assumption about what activity [the complainant] might have willingly engaged in after she willingly engaged in some sexual foreplay\u201d, and that the trial judge\u2019s assessment of the evidence in this regard was thus affected by \u201cimplicit, unsupported assumptions about \u2018normal behaviour\u2019\u201d (para. 53).\n[119] While the Court of Appeal appeared to be preoccupied with finding some evidence in the record to support the trial judge\u2019s conclusion, it simultaneously disregarded the fact that that the trial judge\u2019s assessment of the complainant\u2019s evidence was based on a record that, when assessed as a whole, contained the very evidence needed to contextualize that conclusion. Although clearly there was no evidence about what activities the complainant would have willingly engaged in after sexual foreplay, the complainant specifically testified that she had not agreed to being spanked and had not asked the accused for rough sex. This evidence formed the backdrop for the credibility findings at paras. 117-58 of the trial judge\u2019s reasons and for her ultimate decision to reject the accused\u2019s account as contrived. As was the case in Mr. Kruk\u2019s appeal, the Court of Appeal\u2019s reasoning in this context reflects the fundamental problems with the proposed rule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions: in search of some extrinsic source of support for generalizations, appellate courts risk missing the evidence that is actually in the record.\n[120] The trial judge\u2019s conclusion that it was unbelievable the complainant would ask to be spanked or for rough sex must also be understood in the context of the broader body of evidence that the complainant was uninterested in Mr. Tsang, but engaged in a risk analysis and agreed to limited sexual activity in the car \u2014 kissing, but nothing more. The trial judge\u2019s finding in this respect was tethered to her assessment of Mr. Tsang\u2019s evidence as contrived: her remark that Mr. Tsang sounded \u201cas if he were describing how he thought such an encounter might unfold\u201d represents her explanation for why she found Mr. Tsang\u2019s testimony that the complainant asked to be spanked to be unbelievable (para. 126). Put simply, the judge accepted the complainant\u2019s evidence that she did not ask to be spanked or consent to have sex \u2014 rough or otherwise \u2014 and rejected Mr. Tsang\u2019s evidence. Her conclusion was not based on an assumption, but rather represents her assessment of the direct testimony of the two key witnesses.\n[121] With respect to the second alleged assumption, the Court of Appeal held the trial judge erred in finding that Mr. Tsang\u2019s description \u201cabout the prospect of intercourse being thwarted by the lack of a condom in his car when there was one available was contrived . . . and contrary to the level of control he conveyed about that evening and in court\u201d (trial reasons, at para. 129). The Court of Appeal considered this finding to be \u201cproblematic\u201d and characterized it as an assumption that a controlling person would not refrain from having unprotected sex (paras. 64-65).\n[122] Mr. Tsang\u2019s evidence was not assessed in relation to an assumption about whether controlling people would refrain from sex without a condom \u2014 rather, his evidence on this point was inconsistent with the judge\u2019s other findings, and so was disbelieved. Properly viewed, the judge\u2019s finding was that the accused himself was controlling and did not respect the complainant\u2019s wishes, a finding which the Court of Appeal agreed was open to her to make. In particular, the judge found that Mr. Tsang had, at various points, exercised control to ignore the wishes of the complainant and her friend, including by insisting that the women drink at the club and leave their bags in his car. In light of these findings, the judge found Mr. Tsang\u2019s evidence about not having sex, because the complainant asked if he had a condom and he could not find one, to be unbelievable. Because the Court of Appeal artificially isolated the findings about what happened in the car from what happened in the club, it did not properly consider these other findings and thus reached the erroneous conclusion that the judge had made an assumption.\n[123] The third assumption the Court of Appeal identified relates to the judge\u2019s assessment of Mr. Tsang driving away quickly after dropping the complainant off. The judge made the following remarks:\nHis lack of interest . . . at [the complainant\u2019s] invitation to meet again was at odds with his evidence that they had just had a great time, but is consistent with a non-consensual event where he got what he wanted without regard for her and drove away.\n. . .\nMr. Tsang\u2019s testimony aligned with that of [the complainant] and [the complainant\u2019s friend] that he drove off as soon as [the complainant] got out of his car and he did not watch her go inside the house. I find this fact more consistent with [the complainant\u2019s] claim of non-consensual sex than with Mr. Tsang\u2019s version of what had just happened. He took off right away because of what he had just done to her and because she meant nothing to him. It is inconsistent with his evidence that he wanted to pleasure [the complainant] that night. [paras. 131 and 153]\n[124] I agree that the judge erred here in relying on an assumption that people do not drive off quickly after consensual sexual encounters. However, without the rule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions in play, this assumption again falls to be assessed under the palpable and overriding error standard. This is the standard the Court of Appeal should have applied, and had it done so, it would have found no basis for reviewable error.\n[125] I accept that the inaccuracy of this assumption is palpable, as it is obviously untrue and plainly observable. Mr. Tsang\u2019s after-the-fact decision to drive off quickly is neither consistent nor inconsistent with a sexual assault having occurred. As a matter of logic, the speed at which someone leaves after sexual activity generally has no bearing whatsoever on whether the activity was consensual or non-consensual. One can think of plenty of reasons why a person such as Mr. Tsang would want or need to depart quickly after consensual sex \u2014 including reasons completely irrelevant to the sexual activity itself, such as needing to get home after a late night. There are also plenty of reasons why a person who commits sexual assault would insist on staying at the scene for longer once the assault was over \u2014 for example, to ensure that the complainant does not say anything to others about what happened. In the context of this case, the fact that Mr. Tsang drove off as soon as the complainant got out of his car and \u201cdid not watch her go inside the house\u201d (para. 153) has nothing to do with whether the complainant consented to the sexual activity earlier that night. I accept that the trial judge\u2019s reliance on this generalization was a palpable error.\n[126] Nevertheless, the assumption is not overriding. Although it formed part of the judge\u2019s assessment of Mr. Tsang\u2019s testimony and contributed to the trial judge\u2019s finding that Mr. Tsang was a non-credible witness who \u201cgave a very contrived and unbelievable story\u201d (para. 156), the assumption itself did not form an essential part of the trial judge\u2019s decision to convict Mr. Tsang. Given all the other adverse credibility findings against Mr. Tsang, I am left with no doubt whatsoever that the judge would still have disbelieved him even without the assumption in play. Moreover, given the judge found the complainant to be credible and reliable, I am left with no doubt that the judge would still have convicted Mr. Tsang of sexual assault.\nV.

Conclusion\n249\nAppendix\nI. Overview\n[128] These two appeals ask how appellate courts should review trial judges\u2019 reliance on generalized expectations based on common sense and human experience in the fact-finding process. In both cases, the accused was convicted at trial by judge alone of one count of sexual assault, but the Court of Appeal for British Columbia unanimously ordered a new trial on the basis that the trial judge erred in their reliance on generalized expectations about human perception or behaviour. The Crown appeals to this Court, seeking to restore the convictions.\n[129] Generalized expectations based on common sense and human experience play a necessary role in the judicial fact-finding process. They serve as a logical benchmark against which to compare the evidence for the purposes of drawing inferences from circumstantial evidence or assessing a witness\u2019s credibility. However, intermediate appellate courts have increasingly identified concerns about the limits of this exercise. In these reasons, I propose three questions that an appellate court should ask when reviewing for potential legal error in a judge\u2019s reliance on generalized expectations in the fact-finding process.\n[130] First, did the trial judge rely on a generalized expectation in their reasoning process? Often, a factual conclusion may appear to reflect a generalized expectation, but the judge may not have actually relied on such an expectation and instead assessed the evidence with reference to other accepted evidence or facts from the trial. If the appellate court determines that the judge relied on a generalized expectation, then no error of law has yet been identified, and the analysis will proceed to the second question. In contrast, where a judge has not relied on any generalized expectation, the review for potential error under this framework ends.\n[131] Second, if the trial judge relied on a generalized expectation, was the expectation reasonable? In my view, it is an error of law for a judge to rely on an unreasonable generalized expectation to assess the evidence. Unreasonable generalized expectations masquerading as common sense or collective human experience are not a legitimate basis on which to assess and understand the evidence in a criminal trial. They are not confined to what might be considered \u201cmyths\u201d or \u201cstereotypes\u201d or to the context of sexual assault trials, but may arise throughout the fact-finding process in any criminal trial. Public confidence in the administration of justice and the judicial fact-finding process require that appellate courts be able to intervene where trial judges employ generalized expectations that are not a reasonably accurate reflection of what is true in most circumstances and are not a reliable benchmark to assess the evidence.\n[132] Third, did the judge rely on a generalized expectation as itself a conclusive and indisputable fact? Although judges have considerable latitude to rely on reasonable generalized expectations as a benchmark for assessing the evidence, such expectations are not a replacement for the evidence. It is an error of law for a judge to fail to consider all of the evidence on the ultimate issue of guilt or innocence, or to make a factual conclusion in the absence of evidence. Where a judge relies on a generalized expectation as itself a factual conclusion, what the judge is really doing is taking judicial notice, which is subject to a stringent test.\n[133] Applying these principles to the appeals at hand, I would allow the appeals and restore the convictions. In Mr. Kruk\u2019s case, the trial judge relied on a generalized expectation about the likelihood of a woman being mistaken about an invasive physical experience (2020 BCSC 1480). This was a reasonable expectation about general human perception. The trial judge did not treat this as an indisputable fact but instead used it as a benchmark to assess the complainant\u2019s evidence in light of the totality of the evidence. There was therefore no basis for the Court of Appeal to intervene. In Mr. Tsang\u2019s case, the Court of Appeal wrongly identified the trial judge as having relied on a generalized expectation in two instances where the latter was actually assessing the whole of the evidence; this led the Court of Appeal to move beyond its role and reweigh the evidence. In one instance, the trial judge did err by relying on an unreasonable expectation about how people ordinarily behave after a consensual sexual encounter. However, this error could have had no impact on the verdict, and I would have maintained the conviction pursuant to the curative proviso under s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 .\nII. Jurisprudential Background\n[134] The two decisions on appeal are part of an influx of recent decisions by intermediate appellate courts on the use of \u201ccommon sense\u201d, \u201chuman experience\u201d, \u201clogic\u201d, \u201cgeneralizations\u201d, \u201cassumptions\u201d, \u201cmyths\u201d, \u201cstereotypes\u201d, and other similar concepts used by trial judges in the fact-finding process. Such issues have become especially prevalent in appeals from sexual assault verdicts, both from acquittals and convictions (see, e.g., R. v. Kodwat, 2017 YKCA 11; R. v.

Various attempts have been made to articulate the principles by which appellate courts should approach these issues. A coherent solution has been elusive.\n[135] The parties and interveners point to the efforts of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in R. v. J.C., 2021 ONCA 131, 401 C.C.C. (3d) 433, with varying degrees of approval. This decision was noted to be helpful by the Court of Appeal for British Columbia in Mr. Tsang\u2019s appeal (2022 BCCA 345, 419 C.C.C. (3d) 187). It was not cited directly in the decision on appeal in Mr. Kruk\u2019s case (2022 BCCA 18), but both of these decisions refer to similar authorities, such as Roth, Cepic, and R. v. Perkins, 2007 ONCA 585, 223 C.C.C. (3d) 289. It is therefore helpful to review J.C. at some length.\n[136] In J.C., Justice Paciocco, for the Court of Appeal, described \u201ctwo relevant legal rules that identify impermissible reasoning relating to the plausibility of human behaviour\u201d (para. 57). First, there is a \u201crule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions\u201d, which says that \u201cjudges must avoid speculative reasoning that invokes \u2018common-sense\u2019 assumptions that are not grounded in the evidence or appropriately supported by judicial notice\u201d (para. 58). The rule \u201cdoes not bar using human experience about human behaviour to interpret evidence\u201d; however, \u201c[i]t prohibits judges from using \u2018common-sense\u2019 or human experience to introduce new considerations, not arising from evidence, into the decision-making process, including considerations about human behaviour\u201d (para. 61).\n[137] Second, there is an overlapping \u201crule against stereotypical inferences\u201d, which says that \u201cfactual findings, including determinations of credibility, cannot be based on stereotypical inferences about human behaviour\u201d (para. 63). This means \u201cit is an error of law to rely on stereotypes or erroneous common-sense assumptions\u201d about how a complainant or accused person is expected to act, either to bolster or compromise their credibility (ibid.). This rule only prohibits inferences based on \u201cstereotypes\u201d or \u201cprejudicial generalizations\u201d from being drawn, not the admission or use of certain kinds of evidence. A factual conclusion may logically reflect a stereotype but will not be an error if it is based on the evidence.\n[138] In addition, Justice Paciocco considered that \u201cerrors\u201d arising from violating the rule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions or the rule against stereotypical inferences \u201care reversible only when they \u2018ground\u2019 the relevant inference by playing a material or important role in the impugned conclusion\u201d (para. 71).\n[139] J.C. has been relied on by intermediate appellate courts in numerous instances in the few years since it was decided. This reflects the prevalence of the issues now before this Court concerning trial judges\u2019 reliance on matters such as \u201ccommon sense\u201d and \u201chuman experience\u201d to decide cases. Professor Lisa Dufraimont describes the attempt to clarify the law in J.C. as a \u201creal advance\u201d, while expressing some hesitation with respect to the breadth and malleability of the described rules (\u201cCurrent Complications in the Law on Myths and Stereotypes\u201d (2021), 99 Can. Bar Rev. 536, at pp. 563-64).\n[140] A key issue raised by some of the parties and interveners in these appeals is whether the \u201crule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions\u201d described in J.C. should be recognized as a basis for appellate intervention. The Crown and certain interveners say that the rule is unworkable and should be rejected by this Court, while the respondents and other interveners support the proposed approach in J.C. In contrast, the \u201crule against stereotypical reasoning\u201d is (seemingly) less controversial; the parties all agree that stereotypical reasoning is a basis for appellate intervention. There is, however, a lack of clarity as to how some of the parties and interveners view the relationship between these two \u201crules\u201d. Further, the parties disagree as to whether an error must play a \u201cmaterial\u201d or \u201cimportant\u201d role in the impugned conclusion in order for the error to be \u201creversible\u201d, as described in J.C.\nIII. Principles of the Fact-Finding Process\n[141] The proliferation of appellate jurisprudence and the submissions before this Court point to the need for guidance in the form of a clear and consistent framework for appellate review. In my view, a significant reason for the lack of clarity and consistency is the imprecise use of terminology, such as \u201ccommon sense\u201d, \u201cstereotypes\u201d, \u201cmyths\u201d, \u201cinferences\u201d, \u201cjudicial notice\u201d, and \u201cspeculation\u201d. I therefore find it helpful to begin with what I consider to be fundamental principles of the fact-finding process. I set out these principles with a view to using precise terms deliberately.\nA. Foundational Concepts\n[142] The essential purpose and feature of the trial process is the search for truth by identifying the \u201cfact[s]\u201d to which the law will be applied (S. N. Lederman, M. K. Fuerst and H. C. Stewart, Sopinka, Lederman & Bryant: The Law of Evidence in Canada (6th ed. 2022), at \u00b61.40). In a criminal trial, the trier of fact is tasked with applying the law to the facts to determine whether the accused is guilty or not guilty of the offences charged. The law is set out by statute or by common law and must be correctly understood and applied. The facts, on the other hand, are the province of the trier of fact. The trier of fact\u2019s primary task is to make conclusions on the \u201cfacts in issue\u201d in the trial; in a criminal case, the required elements of the offence are the key facts in issue. In addition to the facts in issue, any other fact will be relevant where it \u201cproves or renders probable the past, present or future existence (or non-existence) of any fact in issue\u201d (\u00b62.57). In addition, \u201c[f]acts relating to the credibility of the witness giving direct or circumstantial evidence of a fact in issue are relevant\u201d (\u00b62.58).\n[143] A conclusion of fact can be arrived at in one of two general ways: (a) by taking of judicial notice or (b) by \u201cfindings of fact\u201d derived from the evidence or through \u201cinferences\u201d from other facts.\n[144] \u201cJudicial notice\u201d is the acceptance by a court of the truth of a particular fact without \u201cproof\u201d (Lederman, Fuerst and Stewart, at \u00b619.25). The threshold for taking judicial notice of fact is strict \u2014 \u201ca court may properly take judicial notice of facts that are either: (1) so notorious or generally accepted as not to be the subject of debate among reasonable persons; or (2) capable of immediate and accurate demonstration by resort to readily accessible sources of indisputable accuracy\u201d (R. v. Find, 2001 SCC 32, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 863, at para. 48). Once a fact is taken on judicial notice, consideration of evidence on the fact will generally be foreclosed, as satisfying the test for judicial notice means the fact is not reasonably debatable; however, this does not mandate that any \u201cinference\u201d from the judicially-noticed fact must be drawn (Lederman, Fuerst and Stewart, \u00b6\u00b619.74-19.75). Due to the consequences of drawing a fact on judicial notice, judges should give the parties notice and the opportunity to respond before relying on such facts (\u00b6\u00b619.78 et seq.).\n[145] \u201cEvidence\u201d is the primary means to facilitate the introduction of all logically relevant facts at trial (Lederman, Fuerst and Stewart, at \u00b61.1). There are various types of evidence; I focus in these reasons on viva voce testimony from witnesses at trial. Evidence must be admissible in order to be considered by the trier of fact; I do not discuss issues of admissibility in these reasons. Evidence is not itself fact. Witnesses testify as to their observations and experiences, and the trier of fact may accept all, some, or none of the witness\u2019s evidence as fact (see, e.g., R. v. Fran\u00e7ois, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 827, at p. 837; R. v. D.A.I., 2012 SCC 5, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 149, at para. 72).\n[146] Whether evidence is accepted as fact by the trier of fact will depend on an assessment of the witness\u2019s \u201ccredibility\u201d and \u201creliability\u201d. Credibility refers to a witness\u2019s honesty or sincerity. Reliability, meanwhile, is about the accuracy of the witness\u2019s testimony, referring to the witness\u2019s ability to observe, recall, and recount events (see R. v. H.C., 2009 ONCA 56, 244 O.A.C. 288, at para. 41). Assessing credibility and reliability is not a science (see R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 621, at para. 20). Credibility and reliability are assessed based on various factors including the character, demeanor, and conditions and capabilities of the witness, the plausibility and internal consistency of the testimony, and supporting information; it is also assessed in light of its consistency with other facts and evidence (D. M. Paciocco, P. Paciocco and L. Stuesser, The Law of Evidence (8th ed. 2020), at p. 593).\n[147] There are, broadly speaking, two types of evidence: \u201cdirect evidence\u201d and \u201ccircumstantial evidence\u201d. Direct evidence is \u201cevidence which, if believed, resolves a matter in issue\u201d (R. v. Cinous, 2002 SCC 29, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 88, quoting D. Watt, Watt\u2019s Manual of Criminal Evidence (2001), at \u00a7 8.0). For example, a witness who testifies that they saw it raining outside is providing direct evidence that it was raining. Circumstantial evidence, also known as \u201c[i]ndirect evidence\u201d, is evidence from which the trier of fact is asked to draw certain \u201cinferences\u201d (R. v. Villaroman, 2016 SCC 33, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 1000, at para. 23, quoting National Committee on Jury Instructions of the Canadian Judicial Council, Model Jury Instructions (online), s. 10.2). For example, a witness who testifies they saw someone enter the courthouse wearing a raincoat and carrying an umbrella, both dripping wet, is providing circumstantial evidence, from which an inference may be drawn that it was raining (see ibid.). Circumstantial evidence \u201cis all about inferences\u201d (S. C. Hill, D. M. Tanovich and L. P. Strezos, McWilliams\u2019 Canadian Criminal Evidence (5th ed. (loose-leaf)), at \u00a7 31:17, citing R. v. Gibson, 2021 ONCA 530, 157 O.R. (3d) 597, at para. 76).\n[148] An \u201cinference\u201d is a finding of fact that may logically and reasonably be drawn from another fact (or group of facts) found or otherwise established in the proceedings (e.g., through judicial notice) (Hill, Tanovich and Strezos, at \u00a7 31:17, citing R. v. Chanmany, 2016 ONCA 576, 338 C.C.C. (3d) 578, at para. 45; Lampard v. The Queen, [1969] S.C.R. 373; D. Watt, Watt\u2019s Manual of Criminal Evidence (2023), at \u00a712.01). Thus, triers of fact draw inferences from facts (known as \u201cprimary facts\u201d) in order to conclude the existence of further facts (which are inferences). Inferences may \u2014 not must \u2014 be drawn in the circumstances (Watt, at \u00a712.01).\n[149] An \u201copinion\u201d can be understood as a particular inference proffered by a witness (see White Burgess Langille Inman v. Abbott and Haliburton Co., 2015 SCC 23, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 182, at para. 14). The line between fact and opinion is not always clearly drawn (Graat v. The Queen, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 819, at p. 835). As a general rule, however, witnesses may not give opinions, but should testify only to \u201cfacts\u201d in their knowledge, observation, and experience; it is for the trier of fact to draw inferences from proven facts (Lederman, Fuerst and Stewart, at \u00b612.2). However, a qualified expert witness may provide the trier of fact with a \u201cready-made inference\u201d that the trier of fact would otherwise not be able to draw because of the technical nature of the subject matter (ibid.; R. v. Mohan, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 9). A lay witness may also be able to give an opinion on certain matters (see Graat); however, as the evidence approaches the central issues that the court must decide, resistance to admissibility increases (Lederman, Fuerst and Stewart, at \u00b612.15).\n[150] \u201cSpeculation\u201d is a concept that has been given several meanings in different contexts. Notably, inferences must be ones which can be reasonably and logically drawn from a primary fact established by the evidence (or on judicial notice); however, \u201c[a]n inference which does not flow logically and reasonably from established facts cannot be made and is condemned as conjecture and speculation\u201d (R. v. Morrissey (1995), 22 O.R. (3d) 514 (C.A.), at p. 530). It follows that reasoning that is not based on the facts established by evidence is generally speculative. However, \u201c[t]he boundary that separates permissible inference from impermissible speculation in connection with circumstantial evidence is often a very difficult one to determine\u201d (Watt, at \u00a712.01; see also Hill, Tanovich and Strezos, at \u00a7 31:17; Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Murray, [1932] S.C.R. 112, at p. 117).\nB. Generalized Expectations in the Fact-Finding Process\n[151] The foregoing sets out certain foundational concepts of the fact-finding process. Missing from this array is the role of the trial judge\u2019s reasoning, which bridges the gaps between evidence and fact, primary fact and inference, and so on.\n[152] Common sense has been described as \u201cboth self-evident and inscrutable\u201d (P. Cochran, Common Sense and Legal Judgment: Community Knowledge, Political Power, and Rhetorical Practice (2017), at p. 15). At various points in the fact-finding process, trial judges will necessarily rely on their \u201ccommon sense\u201d and \u201chuman experience\u201d (or \u201cexperience of human affairs\u201d (R. v. B\u00e9land, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 398, at p. 418)) when assessing the evidence and deciding the facts in a case (see R. v. S. (R.D.), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 484, at paras. 13, 29, 38 and 130; Villaroman, at para. 30). As Justice Major explained in S. (R.D.):\nIt is apparent, and a reasonable person would expect, that triers of fact will be properly influenced in their deliberations by their individual perspectives on the world in which the events in dispute in the courtroom took place. Indeed, judges must rely on their background knowledge in fulfilling their adjudicative function. As David M. Paciocco and Lee Stuesser write in their book The Law of Evidence (1996), at p. 277:\nIn general, the trier of fact is entitled simply to apply common sense and human experience in determining whether evidence is credible and in deciding what use, if any, to make of it in coming to its finding of fact. [Emphasis deleted; para. 39.]\n[153] Thus, common sense and human experience are the foundation for what can be described as \u201cgeneralized expectations\u201d \u2014 whether about typical human behaviour, human perception, or other shared experiences of humanity. In these reasons, I will rely on the language of \u201cgeneralized expectations\u201d to encompass considerations based on \u201ccommon sense\u201d or \u201chuman experience\u201d in the judicial reasoning process. This phrase highlights that such considerations are both generalized (meaning they relate not to any particular person or event, but about people or things in general) and are expectations (meaning they are ideas about what is usually or ordinarily true, not about what is definitively true in a particular case). Such generalized expectations are often referred to, inter alia, as \u201cassumptions\u201d (including \u201ccommon-sense assumptions\u201d), \u201cgeneralizations\u201d, or \u201ccommon-sense inferences\u201d. I do not favour those terms, insofar as they necessarily imply error through negative connotations or invite confusion with inferences as factual conclusions drawn from the evidence or other primary facts.\n[154] Common sense, upon which generalized expectations are based, is the \u201cpredominant source of assessment for trier of fact decision-making\u201d (Hill, Tanovich and Strezos, at \u00a7 31:16). Generalized expectations are an input into the reasoning process, acting as a logical benchmark against which to compare the evidence. For example, during the reasoning process used to arrive at an inference from a primary fact, trial judges may compare a proposed inference against the benchmark of a generalized expectation of events based on common sense and human experience. To parse out the wet raincoat and umbrella example raised earlier, the proposed inference might be that it was raining. A witness may offer the circumstantial evidence that they saw someone with a dripping raincoat and umbrella. In order to draw the inference that it was raining, the trier of fact might rely on the generalized expectation that raincoats and umbrellas are usually wet due to the rain. My point is that the generalized expectation is an input in the inference-drawing process, whether implicit or explicitly relied on. The inference, of course, is subject to the other evidence in the record.\n[155] Similarly, in assessing the credibility of a witness, trial judges are also expected to apply common sense and human experience as a benchmark against which to weigh the plausibility of the evidence (Paciocco, Paciocco and Stuesser, at p. 608; see also R. v. Marquard, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 223, at p. 248); thus, the trial judge applies their experiences and common sense when judging the witness\u2019s demeanour, character, or the internal or external plausibility of their evidence to decide whether an individual\u2019s evidence is believable (Paciocco, Paciocco and Stuesser, at p. 593).\n[156] Generalized expectations based on common sense are frequently recognized in the jurisprudence. For example, it is a common-sense expectation that a person foresees the natural and probable consequences of their actions (R. v. Walle, 2012 SCC 41, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 438, at para. 64), or is unlikely to flee a crime scene if they are not responsible for the act (R. v. Jacquard, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 314, at para. 50), or is unlikely to make false statements against their own interest (R. v. O\u2019Brien, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 591, at p. 594). There is no closed list of common-sense assumptions; these are merely examples of the basic premise that triers of fact need not check their common sense and life experiences at the courthouse door.\n[157] Some generalized expectations have been recognized in the jurisprudence as myths and stereotypes. \u201c[M]yths and stereotypes\u201d as a unified phrase is often understood in Canadian legal discourse as referring to \u201cfalse beliefs about sexual assault that distort the fact-finding process\u201d, often concerning complainants and particularly women and children (L. Dufraimont, \u201cMyth, Inference and Evidence in Sexual Assault Trials\u201d (2019), 44 Queen\u2019s L.J. 316, at pp. 330-32). This Court has recognized \u201cthe prevailing existence of such myths and stereotypes\u201d based on overwhelming evidence from relevant social science literature (Find, at para. 101). Regarding complainants in cases of sexual assault, this Court has noted that myths and stereotypes \u201care particularly invidious because they comprise part of the fabric of social \u2018common sense\u2019 in which we are daily immersed\u201d and they \u201ccreate the risk that victims of abuse will be blamed or unjustly discredited in the minds of both judges and jurors\u201d (para. 103).\n[158] In my view, concepts such as \u201cmyths\u201d and \u201cstereotypes\u201d should be given distinct meanings. I would adopt a conception of \u201cstereotypes\u201d as referring to biases arising from \u201ctraits that one associates with a particular group\u201d (R. v. Chouhan, 2021 SCC 26, [2021] 2 S.C.R. 136, at para. 53 (emphasis added), per Moldaver and Brown JJ., quoting A. Roberts, \u201c(Re)forming the Jury: Detection and Disinfection of Implicit Juror Bias\u201d (2012), 44 Conn. L. Rev. 827, at p. 833). In contrast, a \u201cmyth\u201d might be considered a \u201cwidely held misconception\u201d (Oxford English Dictionary (online)) about people in general, particularly with regard to sexual behaviour; for example, the \u201ctwin myths\u201d set out in s. 276(1) relate to all complainants where their past sexual activity is at issue, although these myths have historically and continue to be targeted disproportionately at women and children. While there may be overlap in the meaning of these terms, efforts should be made to clearly set out the relevant concerns at play in a given case.\n[159] I note that reliance on generalized expectations in judicial reasoning has been understood by some as a form of implicit \u201cjudicial notice\u201d (see, e.g., Hill, Tanovich and Strezos, at \u00a7 26:2). In my view, it is best to avoid the term \u201cjudicial notice\u201d in this context to distinguish (a) the reasoning process relating to evidence based on consistency with a generalized expectation from (b) the conclusion of indisputable or notorious facts through judicial notice (as an alternative to findings of fact from the evidence). As I will explain later, these concepts should be kept distinct.\nIV. Framework for Appellate Review of the Use of Generalized Expectations in the Fact-Finding Process\n[160] The principles described above disclose two overarching ideas, which can be in tension, though not necessarily in conflict.\n[161] On one hand, triers of fact necessarily rely on generalized expectations based on common sense or human experience as a logical benchmark when assessing the evidence. This occurs in at least two ways: (1) when drawing inferences from primary facts (by comparing the proposed inference to a generalized expectation of what is likely to happen from a given set of circumstances), and (2) when assessing credibility (by comparing the witness\u2019s evidence to a generalized expectation of what people do or feel).\n[162] On the other hand, reliance on generalized expectations in a criminal proceeding is not without limits. Some expectations may not be accurate or reliable predictors of general human behaviour. This includes (but, as I will explain, is not limited to) \u201cstereotypes\u201d or other prejudicial assumptions about a particular group of people, as well as certain widely-held misconceptions about human behaviour that the law has identified as \u201cmyths\u201d. Furthermore, even if an expectation may be acceptable as a general proposition, it is always possible that reality may run contrary to that expectation. The trial judge\u2019s duty is to decide what really happened, based on the evidence. Relatedly, a factual conclusion derived entirely from a generalized expectation in the absence \u2014 or to the exclusion \u2014 of the evidence is best conceptualized as a fact drawn on judicial notice, which is subject to a stringent test. This is distinguishable from the use of generalized expectations as an input into the reasoning process when assessing evidence.\n[163] In my view, these overarching ideas disclose three questions that an appellate court should ask when reviewing for potential legal error in a trial judge\u2019s reliance on generalized expectations in the fact-finding process:\nA. Did the trial judge rely on a generalized expectation in their reasoning process?\nB. If the trial judge relied on a generalized expectation, was the expectation reasonable?\nC. Did the trial judge rely on a generalized expectation as itself a conclusive and indisputable fact?\n[164] The first question is a means of distinguishing the judge\u2019s overall appreciation of the evidence from the use of generalized expectations in the reasoning process. The second and third questions can disclose errors of law by the trial judge, but only if, under the first question, the judge has indeed relied on a generalized expectation. I will discuss each question in turn. I include a diagram of this framework as an appendix to these reasons.\nA. Did the Trial Judge Rely on a Generalized Expectation in Their Reasoning Process?\n[165] Where a trial judge makes a conclusion about a witness\u2019s credibility or an inference or a finding of fact from the evidence, that conclusion may appear to reflect a generalized expectation about the behaviour of most people (or a particular type of person), but the judge may not have actually relied on a generalized expectation. Instead, the judge may have assessed the evidence by comparing it to other accepted evidence or facts from the trial. Generally speaking, an appellate court may not interfere with the trial judge\u2019s overall appreciation of the evidence, absent a palpable and overriding error of fact or unless the resulting verdict is unreasonable under s. 686(1)(a)(i).\n[166] Thus, where a judge is alleged to have improperly relied on a generalized expectation, appellate courts must first review the judge\u2019s reasons to determine whether the judge indeed relied on the alleged generalized expectation. Where no generalized expectation is employed, there is no basis for further appellate scrutiny, absent some other recognized basis for appellate intervention such as an unreasonable verdict. If, on the other hand, the appellate court concludes that the trial judge did rely on a generalized expectation, then the analysis proceeds to the next question.\n[167] At this stage of the analysis, the appellate court is not identifying any error. It is not an error of law per se for a judge to rely on a generalized expectation as a logical benchmark when assessing the evidence. To the contrary, as I have explained, this is a well-recognized and necessary part of the judicial fact-finding process. Rather, in answering this first question, the appellate court is simply determining what the trial judge really decided, why the judge decided that way, and whether there is a basis for further scrutiny.\n[168] Many errors often alleged before appellate courts would be resolved under this question. For example, in Quartey, the accused \u2014 a man \u2014 testified that he was not interested in sex with the complainant and that he had refused the complainant\u2019s attempt to perform fellatio on him because he did not enjoy fellatio. The trial judge rejected his evidence and found him guilty of sexual assault. On appeal, the accused argued that the judge found his testimony unbelievable because the judge assumed men are more interested in engaging in sex than women and that all men enjoy fellatio. This Court agreed with the Court of Appeal of Alberta that the trial judge did not \u201cerr by applying generalizations and stereotypes in rejecting the appellant\u2019s evidence\u201d, because \u201cthe trial judge\u2019s statements in this regard were directed to the appellant\u2019s own evidence and to the believability of the appellant\u2019s claims about how he responded to the specific circumstances of this case, and not to some stereotypical understanding of how men in those circumstances would conduct themselves\u201d (para. 3 (emphasis in original); see also, e.g., Pastro, at paras. 41 and 66; Percy, at para. 107).\n[169] As Professor Dufraimont observes, \u201c[t]he clear implication of Quartey . . . is that the accused\u2019s appeal would have succeeded if the trial judge had indeed relied on stereotypes about men and male sexuality\u201d ((2021), at p. 548). Thus, a negative answer to this first question may obviate appellate intervention, even where an alleged generalized expectation, had it been relied on, would have amounted to an error of law (as discussed below).\n[170] How can appellate courts determine whether a trial judge relied on a generalized expectation (meaning the analysis proceeds to the next two questions below) or made a determination based on the evidence and facts in the particular case (meaning there is no need for further scrutiny under this framework)? This is a highly case-dependent inquiry. However, this Court has provided repeated guidance in recent cases to which appellate courts should direct themselves. An appellate court must assess whether the reasons, read as a whole and in the context of the live issues at trial, explain what the trial judge decided and why they decided that way in a manner that permits effective appellate review. Appellate courts must not finely parse the trial judge\u2019s reasons in a search for error (see R. v. G.F., 2021 SCC 20, [2021] 1 S.C.R. 801, at para. 69, referring to R. v. Chung, 2020 SCC 8, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 405, at paras. 13 and 33). Thus, appellate courts must not view a single statement that might appear to reflect a generalized expectation in isolation. The reasons read as a whole and considered in light of the evidence and submissions at trial may indicate that the statement related to the circumstances of the particular case or a conclusion made by the judge elsewhere in the reasons.\n(1) Materiality and the Curative Proviso\n[171] Before turning to the second question of my proposed framework, I pause to distinguish the question of whether the trial judge relied on a generalized expectation, as described above, from the question of \u201cmateriality\u201d and the operation of the curative proviso under s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code . As I have explained, the Court of Appeal for Ontario in J.C. considered that, after identifying errors in the trial judge\u2019s reasons (with respect to a \u201crule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions\u201d or a \u201crule against stereotypical reasoning\u201d), an appellate court may reverse the trial judge\u2019s decision \u201conly when [the errors] \u2018ground\u2019 the relevant inference by playing a material or important role in the impugned conclusion\u201d (para. 71). Justice Paciocco stated that the burden to prove the materiality of an error falls on the accused who appeals, and that this consideration is distinct from the operation of the curative proviso, where the burden falls on the Crown (paras. 100-101). This aspect of J.C. led the Court of Appeal for British Columbia in Mr. Tsang\u2019s case to conduct an extensive review of the evidence and the trial judge\u2019s reasons to determine whether the judge committed a reversible error, after having found that the judge had erred.\n[172] The requirement for materiality or importance in J.C. appears to be founded on the idea that a judge may not have actually \u201crelied on\u201d a given \u201cstereotype or improper inference\u201d, as in cases such as Quartey (see J.C., at paras. 71-74). I would give effect to this question pursuant to the first question that I have described above. In my view, appellate courts must address the question of \u201creliance\u201d at the outset of the analysis, rather than as part of a secondary \u201cmateriality\u201d analysis after identifying an error. This encourages restraint and simplicity in terms of how appellate review is conducted by obviating the need for unnecessary scrutiny into the reasonableness of hypothetical generalized expectations or \u201cstereotypes\u201d that were not actually relied on by the trial judge.\n[173] However, unlike the framework proposed in J.C., this question does not turn on whether the judge\u2019s reliance on a generalized expectation was \u201cmaterial\u201d or \u201cimportant\u201d to the analysis. Whenever an appellate court identifies the trial judge as having relied on a generalized expectation, the analysis proceeds to the second question that I describe below, regardless of whether that reliance was material or important. Again, an affirmative answer to this first question does not yet amount to an error.\n[174] I come to this conclusion because, as I will explain, the question of whether an error was \u201cmaterial\u201d to the conviction plays no role in identifying an error of law. Rather, it is only after an error of law has been identified on an appeal that the burden falls on the Crown to demonstrate whether the error was \u201cmaterial\u201d to the conviction. The particulars of the Crown\u2019s burden in this respect differ depending on the identity of the appealing party and the nature of the alleged error.\n[175] In an appeal by the accused from a conviction, the question of materiality is addressed under the curative proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code . Whenever an appellate court identifies an error of law by the trial judge in a conviction appeal, it may nonetheless decline to intervene under the curative proviso on the basis that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred. The curative proviso may be invoked in two circumstances: (1) where the error can be considered \u201charmless\u201d, or (2) where the Crown\u2019s case is \u201coverwhelming\u201d (R. v. Sarrazin, 2011 SCC 54, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 505, at para. 25 (emphasis deleted)). The burden falls on the Crown to demonstrate one of these requirements (R. v. Van, 2009 SCC 22, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 716, at para. 34). In either instance, \u201cthe underlying question is always whether the verdict would have been the same if the error had not been committed\u201d (Van, at para. 36).\n[176] The principles of appellate review for legal error and the application of the curative proviso must be kept distinct. The Criminal Code and this Court\u2019s jurisprudence mandate a structured analysis. The appellant must first demonstrate an error of law. Only then does the Crown, should it choose to rely on the curative proviso, bear the burden to satisfy one of the bases for its application. This division of responsibility \u201cacknowledges that, when an error of law . . . is established, a presumption is created in favor of allowing the appeal, unless it is shown that the error or irregularity is curable\u201d (R. v. Khan, 2001 SCC 86, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 823, at para. 88; see also Morrissey). The burden on the Crown is heavy, \u201creflecting the limited role of an appellate court and the need to safeguard the criminal justice process from the risk of wrongful convictions\u201d (R. v. Samaniego, 2022 SCC 9, at para. 162, per C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Rowe JJ., dissenting). It would effectively reverse this burden to require the appellant in a conviction appeal to demonstrate materiality when identifying an error of law, as this simply mirrors the considerations under the curative proviso. For example, the Court of Appeal for Ontario in J.C. considered that a reversible error will arise only where \u201cit cannot safely be said that the trial judge would have reached the same conclusion without the error\u201d (para. 73). It is difficult to see how one could ever conclude that \u201cthe verdict would have been the same if the error had not been committed\u201d under the curative proviso if it had already been decided that the judge may not have reached the same conclusion without the error.\n[177] The Court of Appeal in J.C. may have mistakenly imported the requirement for materiality from two contexts in which materiality is required. However, there is a distinct rationale for the materiality requirement in those contexts, which cannot be translated to appeals from convictions on an error of law.\n[178] First, the requirement for an error of law to be material arises in appeals by the Crown from acquittals (R. v. Graveline, 2006 SCC 16, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 609, at para. 14). In such appeals, the burden remains with the Crown to prove both the existence of legal error as well as the materiality of that error. The burden on the Crown is a \u201cheavy one\u201d, recognizing that acquittals ought not to be overturned lightly (R. v. Morin, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 345, at p. 374; Graveline, at para. 15; S. Coughlan, Criminal Procedure (4th ed. 2020), at p. 587). Thus, \u201cdifferent policy considerations apply in providing the Crown with a right of appeal against acquittals\u201d (R. v. Biniaris, 2000 SCC 15, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 381, at para. 33). The same concerns about limiting Crown appeals cannot be imputed onto accused persons in appeals from convictions where, again, errors of law are presumed to have prejudiced the accused unless the Crown can prove otherwise under the curative proviso.\n[179] Second, the issue of materiality arises in the context of misapprehensions of evidence amounting to a miscarriage of justice (see Morrissey; R. v. Lohrer, 2004 SCC 80, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 732; R. v. Sinclair, 2011 SCC 40, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 3). Here, the appellant in a conviction appeal must prove materiality because misapprehensions of evidence are, generally speaking, factual issues, not questions of law. There is no presumption that factual issues are material and thus constitute a miscarriage of justice, such that the grounds for appellate intervention under s. 686(1) (a) of the Criminal Code are engaged. As explained by Justice Doherty in Morrissey, \u201c[w]here the error is one of law the Crown bears the burden of demonstrating that the error did not result in a miscarriage of justice. Where the error is not one of law alone the appellant bears that burden\u201d (p. 540).\n[180] With this precision in hand, I turn to discuss the second question that an appellate court should ask, if it has determined that the trial judge relied on a generalized expectation.\nB. If the Trial Judge Relied on a Generalized Expectation, Was the Expectation Reasonable?\n[181] Again, it is not an error of law per se for a trial judge to rely on a generalized expectation as a logical benchmark when assessing the evidence. Generalized expectations are necessarily relied on as inputs in the inference-drawing process, as well as when determining credibility. However, as I have explained, generalized expectations are based not on the evidence, but on common sense and human experience. Some generalized expectations may be widely held by the community but may be revealed over time to be inaccurate or unreliable, including through developments in psychological or social science research. Other expectations may not be widely held and may instead be the product of the trial judge\u2019s own intuition, which may sometimes fail to accurately or reliably predict the behaviours or experiences of ordinary people. It is not controversial that inferences themselves cannot be based on \u201c[i]ntuitive notions of probability at odds with objectively relevant probability theory\u201d or \u201cunsupportable stereotypical or prejudicial reasoning\u201d (Hill, Tanovich and Strezos, at \u00a7 31:25). Similarly, where an inference is drawn pursuant to a generalized expectation, that expectation must reflect some measure of objective common sense rather than an individual\u2019s assumption that may be intuitive but, ultimately, inaccurate. Thus, \u201cif the trial process is a search for the truth, then misplaced assumptions about human behaviour which drive the trier of fact to draw incorrect inferences from the evidence must be unmasked if this process is not to be subverted rather than furthered\u201d (Marquard, at pp. 265-66 (emphasis added), per L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9 J., dissenting).\n[182] I would therefore propose the following question for appellate review. If, under the first question, the appellate court concludes that the trial judge did rely on a generalized expectation in assessing the evidence, then the appellate court should determine whether the generalized expectation was reasonable. A standard of reasonableness imparts a measure of objectivity and community consensus in shaping the boundaries of a judge\u2019s reliance on common sense and human experience to make decisions, thus ensuring that triers of fact do not rely on generalized expectations that are inaccurate or unreliable. It also recognizes that as society evolves, its understanding of what is reasonable may change.\n[183] I note that the standard could have been couched in terms of \u201caccurate\u201d, \u201ctrue\u201d, \u201cplausible\u201d, etc. In my opinion, \u201creasonableness\u201d is preferable. It strikes a balance between: (a) ensuring that triers of fact do not rely on unacceptably prejudicial or inaccurate generalizations on one hand, and (b) respect for the trier of fact\u2019s role and the necessity of common sense and human experience in fact-finding on the other hand.\n[184] Where a trial judge relies on an unreasonable generalized expectation in assessing the evidence, then the judge has committed an error of law. This will invite appellate intervention, subject to the Crown successfully invoking the curative proviso or, in an appeal by the Crown, subject to the Crown\u2019s ability to demonstrate the materiality of the error (as explained above, these inquiries are distinct from the identification of legal error). I add that the fact that this is a \u201creasonableness\u201d standard does not foreclose appellate review on a correctness standard for errors of law; other standards with an element of \u201creasonableness\u201d (e.g., the existence of reasonable and probable grounds (R. v. Shepherd, 2009 SCC 35, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 527, at para. 20)) can entail a question of law.\n[185] Similar to how drawing the line between a reasonable inference and speculation is \u201cnot always easy\u201d (Villaroman, at paras. 38 and 43), it is difficult to set out, in the abstract, what amounts to a reasonable generalized expectation with perfect precision. It will be up to appellate courts to consider the reasonableness of a proposition derived from common sense or human experience. The crucial point, however, is that a generalized expectation must be a reasonably accurate reflection of what is true in most circumstances, such that it can be used as a reliable benchmark to assess the evidence.\n[186] Examples of reasonable generalized expectations abound in the jurisprudence. Often, these generalized expectations relate to human experience or behaviour. This includes the \u201ccommon-sense assumptions\u201d I have referred to that a person foresees the natural consequences of their actions or is unlikely to make false statements against their own interest. Such expectations are frequently relied on in the fact-finding process because they are understood as reasonably accurate reflections of ordinary human behaviour or experience, until proven otherwise. This does not mean that these expectations are invariably true, only that they are usually true. The reasoning process depends on these \u201cassumptions about the ordinary conduct of people in assessing credibility, and in assessing circumstantial evidence\u201d (R. v. R.R., 2018 ABCA 287, 366 C.C.C. (3d) 293, at para. 5; see, e.g., A.R.D., at para. 100; see R. v. White, 2011 SCC 13, [2011] 1 S.C.R. 433, at para. 67). Thus, what is available as a generalized expectation in one case will be available in any other case (this relates to the principle of universality, which I discuss below).\n[187] Where the boundaries of common sense or human experience end and the trial judge relies on an inaccurate proposition masquerading as \u201ccommon sense\u201d or \u201chuman experience\u201d, the expectation cannot be said to be a reasonable reflection of what is true in most circumstances and should not be used as a benchmark to assess the evidence. Myths and stereotypes are recognized examples of inaccurate generalized expectations that \u201cjeopardize the courts\u2019 truth-finding function\u201d (R. v. A.G., 2000 SCC 17, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 439, at para. 2). For example, the common law historically reflected the generalized expectation that victims of sexual assault are likely to report the acts, and that the failure to do so suggested that the acts did not occur. While at one time this was considered a fair expectation reflected in the \u201cdoctrine of recent complaint\u201d, improved understanding over time has shown it to be an inaccurate and therefore unreasonable generalized expectation (see R. v. D.D., 2000 SCC 43, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 275, at paras. 60-63 and 65). However, myths and stereotypes are not exhaustive examples of unreasonable generalized expectations. As I will explain, my view is that an inaccurate generalized expectation about ordinary human behaviour should not be relied on to assess evidence, whether or not it can be characterized as a myth or stereotype.\n[188] I stress that this inquiry targets a specific and limited part of the fact-finding process. Again, generalized expectations based on common sense and human experience are an input into the fact-finding process. They serve as a logical benchmark against which to assess the evidence to make conclusions of credibility or inferences of fact. Appellate review under this question is concerned solely with that benchmark, and not with the evidence being interpreted or any conclusions drawn from that evidence. Where a trial judge relies on a reasonable generalized expectation, an appellate court may not interfere with the judge\u2019s assessment of the evidence based on that expectation just because it would have come to a different conclusion.\n[189] The foregoing sets out my view of how appellate courts should assess the reasonableness of generalized expectations. In the following sections, I will discuss two further points arising from the Crown\u2019s submissions: (1) whether the reasonableness of a generalized expectation is a question of law, and (2) whether the framework set out by the Court of Appeal for Ontario in J.C. should be endorsed, including the \u201crule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions\u201d and the \u201crule against stereotypical inferences\u201d.\n(1) Question of Law or Fact?\n[190] Central to the parties\u2019 disagreement on the legal principles engaged in these appeals is the issue of whether a trial judge\u2019s reliance on a generalized expectation engages a question of law or a question of fact. This characterization is important to both appellate jurisdiction and the standard of appellate review.\n[191] It is not disputed that there are limitations to reliance on generalized expectations that amount to questions of law. Notably, various expectations founded on myths or stereotypes about complainants, particularly women and children, in the context of sexual assault trials have been identified as errors of law, either by statute or by the courts. For example, s. 276(1) of the Criminal Code proscribes the drawing of inferences from the complainant\u2019s past sexual activity to conclude on the question of consent or the credibility of the complainant \u2014 these are often referred to as the \u201ctwin myths\u201d. Courts have identified other expectations that, as a matter of law, may not be relied on, such as the expectation that a person who has been sexually assaulted would necessarily exhibit avoidant behaviour towards the aggressor (see A.R.J.D.; see also, e.g., R. v. Mills, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 668, at para. 90; R. v. Osolin, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 595, at p. 670).\n[192] To be clear, nothing in my reasons should be understood as altering or diluting the jurisprudence on recognized myths and stereotypes in the context of sexual assault trials. Such myths and stereotypes \u2014 including the \u201ctwin myths\u201d set out in the Criminal Code and other discredited expectations of how individuals, disproportionately women and children, behave during sexual encounters \u2014 have no place in the law and are appropriately denounced as errors of law (A.R.J.D., at para. 2). Nor should my reasons be understood as suggesting that all persons endure the same experiences of prejudice and marginalization, or to the same degree, irrespective of characteristics such as gender, age, and race.\n[193] However, the Crown suggests that the categories of generalized expectations that may not, as a matter of law, be relied on are limited to what may be considered a discredited \u201cmyth\u201d or a \u201cstereotype\u201d. I disagree. In my view, such a narrow approach creates artificial distinctions in the law, unduly limits the important role of appellate courts in the criminal justice system, and risks undermining public confidence in the administration of justice. Rather, for the reasons below, appellate review for legal error should extend to the reasonableness of any generalized expectation relied on by the trial judge.\n[194] On a conceptual level, the underlying rationale for reliance on a generalized expectation is the same, regardless of whether the generalized expectation can be considered a \u201cmyth\u201d, a \u201cstereotype\u201d, or something else. While the prevalence and experience of people subject to such generalized expectations will differ, all generalized expectations purport to derive from the same source: \u201ccommon sense\u201d and \u201chuman experience\u201d. I am not persuaded that there is a principled basis to separate particular categories of generalized expectations for distinct treatment. Such an exercise invites artificial distinctions in the law with no clear boundaries.\n[195] On a practical level, intermediate appellate courts have increasingly identified concerns about trial judges relying on unreasonable generalized expectations beyond the paradigmatic categories of myths and stereotypes about complainants in sexual assault cases. Professor Dufraimont observes that other categories have emerged in the jurisprudence, such as stereotypes about men and persons accused of sexual assault, or on grounds other than sex and gender such as against Indigenous and racialized people (see (2021), at pp. 546-50 and 557-59). In my view, these concerns cannot be disregarded out of hand as mere interventionism.\n[196] I also agree with the intervener Association qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise des avocats et avocates de la d\u00e9fense that the Crown\u2019s narrower view would fail to account for generalized expectations that could not accurately be classified as \u201cmyths\u201d or \u201cstereotypes\u201d about complainants in sexual assault cases yet would nonetheless be unacceptable to rely on in a criminal trial. For example, the trial judge in J.C., in rejecting the accused\u2019s evidence, relied on the expectation that people (namely, people accused of sexual assault) generally do not achieve the \u201cpolitically correct\u201d ideal of obtaining consent for each escalating sexual act. In Roth, the trial judge appeared to assume that the accused, being a power lifter, was \u201csomehow less susceptible to the effects of fatigue resulting from a long day, physical activity and the consumption of alcohol\u201d (para. 70). These sorts of expectations are difficult to properly characterize as a \u201cmyth\u201d or a \u201cstereotype\u201d as those terms are commonly understood in the jurisprudence (e.g., in Roth, the Court of Appeal for British Columbia considered that the trial judge did not rely on a \u201cstereotyp[e]\u201d about \u201cmale behaviour\u201d (para. 66)), but I agree with the appellate courts in those cases that such expectations cannot reasonably be considered an accurate reflection of general human behaviour by which matters as significant as a criminal trial can be decided.\n[197] The Crown asserts that appellate review of generalized expectations should be narrow because such expectations are deployed as part of the factual assessment of the evidence. Of course, deference is owed to trial judges on factual matters. However, not all issues that involve matters of evidence are necessarily questions of fact to which deference is owed. This Court has acknowledged at least four types of cases where the mishandling of evidence can constitute an error of law: (1) it is an error of law to make a finding of fact for which there is no evidence; (2) the legal effect of findings of fact or undisputed facts raises a question of law; (3) the assessment of the evidence based on a wrong legal principle is an error of law; and (4) the failure to consider all of the evidence in relation to the ultimate issue of guilt or innocence is an error of law (R. v. J.M.H., 2011 SCC 45, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 197). Thus, reliance on \u201cmyths\u201d or \u201cstereotypes\u201d is recognized as an error of law despite relating to the assessment of evidence, as it amounts to an assessment of evidence based on a wrong legal principle \u2014 the third category set out in J.M.H. (see A.R.D., at para. 28; Coughlan, at p. 589, fn. 135). Again, in my view, the same logic extends to all reliance on unreasonable generalized expectations.\n[198] I find support for my conclusion in the relevant policy reasons for why appellate courts defer to trial judges\u2019 factual findings on one hand, and the wide discretion for appellate intervention on questions of law on the other hand.\n[199] Appellate courts defer to trial judges on factual matters for at least three overarching policy reasons, as described in Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235 (a civil case): (1) to limit the number, length, and cost of appeals; (2) to promote the autonomy and integrity of trial proceedings; and (3) to recognize the expertise of the trial judge and the judge\u2019s advantageous position to assess the evidence (paras. 16-18).\n[200] In my view, reviewing unreasonable expectations on a standard of correctness would have a limited impact on these policy considerations. Concerns about preserving public resources or promoting the autonomy and integrity of trials, while important, are secondary to the rights of the accused in a criminal proceeding, in light of the interests at stake and Parliament\u2019s decision to provide broad access to a first level of appeal (see, e.g., Sarrazin, at para. 27, affirming the high standard for the curative proviso). Rather, it is the recognition of the trial judge\u2019s expertise and advantageous position that forms the central basis for appellate deference on factual matters in the context of criminal proceedings (see, e.g., R. v. Spencer, 2007 SCC 11, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 500, at para. 17; R. v. Beaudry, 2007 SCC 5, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 190, at para. 62). However, trial judges are not more experienced or in a more advantageous position than appellate judges in identifying a reasonable generalized expectation based on common sense or human experience. To the contrary, the basis for the general reliability of such expectations is that they are \u201ccommon\u201d or the shared experience of the entire community.\n[201] In contrast, \u201cthe primary role of appellate courts is to delineate and refine legal rules and ensure their universal application\u201d (Housen, at para. 9). Appellate courts therefore maintain a broad scope of review on questions of law. The principle of universality dictates that legal questions require clear and consistent answers in order to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice. Further, the public expects courts to fulfill a law-making function by bringing a measure of expertise on the art of just and practical rule-making. Appellate courts make law not only for the case under review, but also for future cases (ibid.).\n[202] In the context of appeals from criminal matters, appellate courts play an especially important role in reviewing trial proceedings to prevent wrongful convictions and ensure that all convictions arise through a fair process that maintains public confidence in the administration of justice. As explained in Biniaris, \u201c[c]riminal appeals on questions of law are based in part on the desire to ensure that criminal convictions are the product of error-free trials. Error-free trials are desirable as such, but even more so as a safeguard against wrongful convictions\u201d (para. 26). It has been explained that \u201c[a] person charged with the commission of a crime is entitled to a fair trial according to law. Any error which occurs at trial that deprives the accused of that entitlement is a miscarriage of justice\u201d (Fanjoy v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 233, at p. 240; Morrissey, at p. 541). Any approach to appellate review that dilutes the important role of appellate courts would do significant damage to the criminal justice system as a whole.\n[203] The characterization of an issue as a question of law is also significant to the grounds for appellate jurisdiction in criminal matters, especially the limited grounds for Crown appeals from acquittals. The Crown maintains a limited right to appeal on questions of law, which provides an avenue to balance the legitimate needs of a criminal justice system operating under the rule of law against the accused\u2019s entitlement to finality when acquitted of criminal charges. Parliament and the courts have recognized the importance of protecting the dignity, privacy, equality, and other interests of all participants in the criminal justice system \u2014 including complainants \u2014 in order to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice (see, e.g., R. v. Ewanchuk, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 330). If the reasonableness of a generalized expectation were treated as a question of fact, then the Crown would not be able to appeal from acquittals that rest on generalized expectations that do not amount to \u201cmyths\u201d or \u201cstereotypes\u201d, no matter how unreasonable or contrary to society\u2019s collective expectations they are.\n[204] In my view, these considerations support the application of a correctness standard when determining the reasonableness of a generalized expectation. This inquiry is not dependent on the evidence and instead rests on what is reasonably true in most instances. The need to preserve public confidence in the administration of justice mandates that verdicts in criminal cases \u2014 whether convictions or acquittals \u2014 not be founded on assumptions that are not reasonably accurate reflections of what is true in most circumstances. Appellate courts play an important role in ensuring the consistency and legitimacy of judicial reliance on generalized expectations, for the benefit of not only the case under review, but all future cases.\n[205] Appellate courts should take caution that nothing in these reasons should be construed as meaning that the Crown can appeal an acquittal merely on a reassessment of the facts.\n[206] We should not undermine the important institutional role of courts of appeal. Trial judges and courts of appeal have complementary roles, the latter being a safety net for errors by the former. In criminal law, effective appellate review is critical to avoiding improper verdicts. In earlier times, courts of appeal too readily intervened to substitute their own assessment of the evidence for that of the trial judge. More recently, under the banner of \u201cdeference\u201d, there is increasing risk that the \u201csafety net\u201d role of courts of appeal is being unduly weakened.\n[207] The palpable and overriding standard of review can be misused to generate a decision-making \u201cblack box\u201d that facilitates ad hoc decision-making. By this, I mean an approach whereby if the Court of Appeal agrees with what the trial judge has done, it \u201cshows deference\u201d, while where the appellate court prefers another outcome, it labels the trial judge\u2019s decision as a palpable and overriding error and substitutes its preferred outcome.\n[208] Of course, this can also occur in applying the correctness standard, as was so in the \u201cbad old days\u201d where appellate courts too readily substituted their own assessment of the evidence. But, application of the palpable and overriding standard can be an opaque process. By contrast, the correctness standard, by its nature, requires setting out expressly an alternative line of reasoning and demonstrating why it should be followed. Properly applied, correctness demands greater conceptual clarity and analytical rigour. In part, this perspective underlies my analysis.\n(2) The \u201cRules\u201d in J.C.\n[209] Having set out my view of the scope and standard of appellate review, I turn to consider whether the Court of Appeal for Ontario\u2019s approach in J.C. should be endorsed. As I have explained, J.C. represents a notable effort to address the concerns identified by intermediate appellate courts in many recent decisions. The Crown directs its attention to the \u201crule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions\u201d described in J.C. and says that the rule should be rejected because it encourages appellate courts to interfere too readily with trial judges\u2019 reliance on generalized expectations, as exemplified by the Court of Appeal for British Columbia in Mr. Tsang\u2019s case.\n[210] I would not adopt the articulation of the \u201crule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions\u201d as described in J.C. It implies that a generalized expectation can be rejected merely because it is not \u201cgrounded\u201d in the evidence. However, generalized expectations are not themselves grounded in the evidence, but are instead grounded in common sense and human experience. They nonetheless play a necessary role in the reasoning process when assessing the evidence.\n[211] In my view, the difficulty with the standard set out in J.C. is exemplified by the Court of Appeal\u2019s application of the proposed rule to the circumstances of that case. The accused testified about his practice of securing consent from the complainant on each progressive stage of sexual activity. The trial judge concluded that the accused\u2019s testimony was \u201cnot in accord with common sense and experience about how sexual encounters unfold\u201d (R. v. J.C., 2018 ONSC 5547, at para. 88 (CanLII)). The Court of Appeal considered that the trial judge came to this conclusion based on the assumption that \u201cpeople engaged in sexual activity simply do not achieve the \u2018politically correct\u2019 ideal of expressly discussing consent to progressive sexual acts\u201d (para. 97); in the Court of Appeal\u2019s view, this ran afoul of the rule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions because the judge\u2019s assumption was \u201ca bald generalization about how people behave\u201d and was \u201cnot derived from anything particular to the case, or any evidence before the trial judge on how all sexual encounters unfold\u201d (para. 96). With respect, this is not a workable standard for appellate scrutiny. The lack of evidence supporting a generalized expectation cannot itself be a basis to reject reliance on that expectation. The Crown cannot be expected to elicit evidence on how sexual encounters ordinarily unfold in every sexual assault trial before a trial judge can rely on their common sense or human experience with respect to human sexual behaviour (see R.R., at para. 8).\n[212] While I would not adopt J.C.\u2019s articulation of a \u201crule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions\u201d, this does not mean that the Court of Appeal in J.C. did not identify a legitimate concern with the trial judge\u2019s reasoning in that case. The Court of Appeal concluded that the impugned expectation also contravened the \u201crule against stereotypical inferences\u201d, as \u201cit presupposes that no-one would be this careful about consent\u201d (para. 97), and \u201cthe behaviour the trial judge rejected as \u2018too perfect\u2019, \u2018too mechanical\u2019, and \u2018too politically correct\u2019 to be believed is encouraged by the law, and certainly prudent\u201d (para. 98). Respectfully, it is difficult to characterize the judge\u2019s expectation in that case as a \u201cstereotype\u201d (To what group of persons is this stereotype directed?). However, I observe that the Court of Appeal in J.C. considered it an error of law under this rule to rely not only on stereotypes, but also on \u201cerroneous common-sense assumptions\u201d (para. 63). As I have explained, I would characterize all such assumptions within the broader category of unreasonable generalized expectations.\n[213] Thus, the trial judge\u2019s generalized expectation in J.C. was problematic not because it was ungrounded in the evidence, or because it was a \u201cstereotype\u201d, but because it is unreasonable to expect that people generally do not achieve the \u201cpolitically correct\u201d ideal of obtaining consent. The result and underlying rationale in J.C. are therefore compatible with my proposed framework, even though I would not adopt the same formulations of the principles as the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nC. Did the Trial Judge Rely on a Generalized Expectation as Itself a Conclusive and Indisputable Fact?\n[214] As I have explained, trial judges have considerable latitude to rely on reasonable generalized expectations as a logical benchmark in assessing the evidence. An appellate court may not interfere with the judge\u2019s assessment of the evidence just because it would have come to a different conclusion from the evidence and any reasonable generalized expectations relating to that evidence.\n[215] However, there is an important limit on the use of even a reasonable generalized expectation: The trial judge cannot treat the generalized expectation as itself a conclusive and indisputable fact, such that the judge ignores or forecloses their mind to the evidence. This is because people may always act contrary to a generalized expectation of what common sense or human experience would ordinarily anticipate. The trial judge\u2019s duty is to determine on the evidence what really happened. For example, when drawing inferences from circumstantial evidence, a judge must consider the evidence \u201cin light of all of the evidence and the absence of evidence, assessed logically, and in light of human experience and common sense\u201d (Villaroman, at para. 30 (emphasis added)). Thus, generalized expectations based on human experience and common sense are only one consideration, which assist with interpreting the evidence. In the end, the focus must remain on the evidence.\n[216] There is nothing novel about this aspect of my proposed framework. There are at least two reasons why the foregoing amounts to an error of law. First, it is an error of law for a trial judge to fail to consider all of the evidence on the ultimate issue of guilt or innocence \u2014 this is the fourth category of error described in J.M.H. (paras. 31-32; see also Walle, at para. 46). Second, where the judge treats a generalized expectation as itself an indisputable fact, what the judge is really doing is taking judicial notice of a fact. This is subject to the strict test for judicial notice \u2014 a standard that will rarely, if ever, be met by a generalized expectation about people due to the variability of human experience and behaviour. Where a factual conclusion is based neither on the evidence, nor on judicial notice, then it is speculation. This is an error of law, falling under the first category of errors described in J.M.H. \u2014 a finding of fact for which there is no evidence (para. 25; see Schuldt v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 592).\n[217] For example, in L. (J.), the trial judge did not engage with the complainant\u2019s and accused\u2019s testimony and instead \u201crelied on two facts to explain why he accepted that the complainant communicated a lack of consent to further sexual contact and that the [accused] pressed on in an attempt at intercourse\u201d, one of which was \u201chis finding that it \u2018defies reason and common sense\u2019 that \u2018a young woman would go outside wearing a dress in mid-December, lie down in dirt, gravel and wet grass and engage in consensual sexual activity\u2019\u201d (para. 43). The Court of Appeal for Ontario considered that, although trial judges are permitted to exercise common sense when deciding a case, the judge erred \u201cby relying on an assumption regarding what young women will and will not do, as if it were a fact\u201d (para. 47 (emphasis added)). Coupled with the judge\u2019s failure to consider the accused\u2019s evidence or to explain why it failed to raise a reasonable doubt, this amounted to an error of law.\n[218] Of course, a trial judge is not required to refer to every item of evidence or to explain how each piece of evidence was assessed (J.M.H., at paras. 31-32). \u201cA trial judge must consider all of the evidence in relation to the ultimate issue but unless the reasons demonstrate that this was not done, the failure to record the fact of it having been done is not a proper basis for concluding that there was error in law in this respect\u201d (R. v. Morin, [1992] 3 S.C.R. 286, at p. 296).\n[219] In addition, this aspect of my proposed framework is of considerably less utility to the Crown on an appeal from an acquittal than an accused on an appeal from a conviction. This is for several reasons. First, an error of law due to the absence of evidence for a finding of fact \u201cwill happen as regards an acquittal only if there has been a transfer to the accused by law of the burden of proof of a given fact\u201d (Schuldt, at p. 604). This is because \u201cabsent a shifting of the burden of proof upon the accused there is always some evidence upon which to make a finding of fact favourable to the accused\u201d (p. 610). Relatedly, a trial judge\u2019s decision to acquit based on a reasonable doubt \u201cis not a finding of fact but instead a conclusion that the standard of persuasion beyond a reasonable doubt has not been met\u201d (J.M.H., at para. 25). A reasonable doubt leading to an acquittal therefore does not need to arise from the evidence and can instead arise from the absence of evidence (paras. 26-27; Villaroman, at para. 36). Thus, when reviewing trial judges\u2019 reasons for legal error, appellate courts must take particular care in Crown appeals from acquittals: \u201cCaution must be taken to avoid seizing on perceived deficiencies in a trial judge\u2019s reasons for acquittal to create a ground of \u2018unreasonable acquittal\u2019 which is not open to the court under the provisions of the Criminal Code . . .\u201d (R. v. Walker, 2008 SCC 34, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 245, at para. 2).\nV. Application to These Appeals\n[220] Having set out what I consider to be the three questions to ask on appellate review of a trial judge\u2019s use of generalized expectations, I turn to the purported errors in each of the two appeals before this Court.\nA. Mr. Kruk\n[221] Mr. Kruk was charged with one count of sexual assault from an incident at his home in the early hours of May 27, 2017. Earlier that evening, he came upon the heavily intoxicated complainant on the street. The complainant testified that she woke up in Mr. Kruk\u2019s bed with her pants off, Mr. Kruk on top of her, and his penis inside her vagina. Mr. Kruk testified that he took care of the complainant throughout the evening and intended to drive her to her home in the morning. He denied any sexual touching of the complainant and said the complainant removed her own pants while intoxicated. He proposed that the complainant woke up, still intoxicated, found her pants were off, and assumed the worst.\n[222] The trial judge found Mr. Kruk\u2019s testimony did not raise a reasonable doubt. In accepting the complainant\u2019s testimony despite the reliability concerns from her intoxication, the judge stated: \u201cShe said she felt [the accused\u2019s] penis inside her and she knew what she was feeling. In short, her tactile sense was engaged. It is extremely unlikely that a woman would be mistaken about that feeling\u201d (para. 68 (CanLII)). The Court of Appeal concluded the judge erred in law by engaging in \u201cspeculative reasoning\u201d and making an assumption on a matter that was not a matter of common sense or the proper subject of judicial notice.\n[223] I disagree with the Court of Appeal. Answering the three questions I have described above leads me to the conclusion that the trial judge committed no error.\n[224] Under the first question, the trial judge did rely on a generalized expectation about people \u2014 here, about physical perception. There was no evidence about whether this complainant was unlikely to be mistaken about the feeling of vaginal penetration. Thus, the judge assessed the plausibility of the complainant\u2019s evidence with reference to an expectation of what the judge believed people \u2014 or, more specifically, women \u2014 in general would or would not experience.\n[225] As I have explained, the fact that the judge relied on a generalized expectation is not itself problematic. To the contrary, it is a necessary part of judicial reasoning to assess evidence in relation to a benchmark of what might be ordinarily expected. However, the fact that the trial judge relied on a generalized expectation raises the possibility of an error of law under the second and third questions that I have described. My analysis therefore proceeds to those questions.\n[226] Under the second question, I conclude that it is a reasonable generalized expectation that a woman is unlikely to be mistaken about the feeling of vaginal penetration. This is not to say that this is an incontrovertible fact about all women in all instances, or that a woman can never be mistaken. However, as a general proposition, it is perfectly reasonable. As the Crown observes, a sexual act of this nature would have a profound and traumatic impact on the bodily integrity of an individual, and ordinary people would not generally require special knowledge of such an aspect of human perception to assess this sort of evidence. To suggest otherwise would resurrect the long-rejected view that a complainant\u2019s evidence about sexual assault cannot, without corroborating evidence, support a conviction. Further, it would impose an unnecessary, unrealistic, and invasive burden on the Crown to adduce expert medical evidence about the complainant\u2019s basic physiology in every sexual assault case.\n[227] The Court of Appeal implied that further detail from the complainant\u2019s testimony about her experience may have assisted, noting that the complainant \u201cwas not asked, for example, to put into words what [the feeling of penetration] felt like, whether she experienced any pain, whether she had been injured or even why she felt so confident about her testimony\u201d (para. 55 (CanLII)). I disagree that a more detailed description of the complainant\u2019s physical experience would have assisted in this case. Nothing would have turned on such gratuitous evidence; the complainant\u2019s testimony, if accepted, readily made out the actus reus of sexual assault.\n[228] Mr. Kruk suggests that it was problematic for the trial judge, a man, to rely on a generalized expectation about what women would likely feel, as the judge would have \u201cno personal experience regarding the matter\u201d (R.F., at para. 56; see also para. 64). I disagree. While the trial judge would not have direct life experience of this precise experience, it is perfectly reasonable for any person to expect another person to not be mistaken about the sensation of having their bodily integrity violated in such a manner.\n[229] Mr. Kruk also says that the reasonableness of an expectation depends on the particular circumstances of the case, and that \u201c[t]he further the circumstance comes from the norm to the outlying extreme, the less likely that it is a matter of common sense\u201d (transcript, at p. 70). Thus, in his submission, the fact that the complainant \u201cwas extremely intoxicated and disoriented\u201d meant that the judge\u2019s generalized expectation was no longer reasonable (ibid.). This misunderstands the nature of a generalized expectation and its role in the reasoning process of fact-finding. It is sufficient for an expectation to be reasonable in a generalized manner, meaning it would be true in most circumstances. The complainant\u2019s state of intoxication and the resulting concerns about her reliability were certainly important aspects of the evidence that the judge was required to consider when assessing the complainant\u2019s evidence, but the particulars of the evidence do not alter the reasonableness of the generalized expectation at issue. Rather, the complainant\u2019s evidence needed to be assessed both with reference to a reasonable benchmark, and in light of the evidence as a whole, including the evidence of intoxication. This is also the case, for example, with consideration of the \u201ccommon sense inference\u201d that a person intends the reasonable and probable consequences of their actions, even where there is evidence that the accused was impaired (Walle, at paras. 58-67). This relates to the third question of my proposed framework, to which I now turn.\n[230] In my view, the Court of Appeal\u2019s conclusion most closely reflects a concern arising under the third question. The Court of Appeal considered the trial judge erred by making a \u201cfinding\u201d that was not the \u201cproper subject of judicial notice\u201d (para. 67), which caused the trial judge to \u201cengag[e] in speculative reasoning that was not grounded in the evidence\u201d (para. 68). If this were true, I agree that this would amount to an error of law. However, I disagree that the trial judge committed this error. The trial judge did not treat the generalized expectation that a woman is unlikely to be mistaken about the feeling of vaginal penetration as a conclusive and indisputable fact in this case (i.e., as a fact drawn on judicial notice). Rather, he properly relied on that generalized expectation as a benchmark for assessing the plausibility of the complainant\u2019s evidence.\n[231] Crucially, the judge did not foreclose his mind to the rest of the evidence on the basis that a woman could never be mistaken about the feeling of vaginal penetration. The judge relied on circumstantial evidence that he considered was \u201cconsistent with a sexual encounter having occurred between the accused and the complainant\u201d, including their respective states of undress and the removal of the complainant\u2019s pants (para. 69). The judge also considered \u201cthe failure of the accused to contact the complainant\u2019s parents in the overall circumstances . . . to be consistent with an intention to take sexual advantage of a young woman he knew to be in an extremely compromised and vulnerable state\u201d (para. 70). The judge was also clearly alive to the reliability concerns about the complainant\u2019s evidence (para. 48). The judge was entitled to find the complainant\u2019s evidence reliable on this point by assessing that evidence with reference to a reasonable generalized expectation about human perception as a benchmark, and in light of the other circumstantial evidence.\n[232] For the reasons above, I conclude that the trial judge did not commit the error alleged by Mr. Kruk or identified by the Court of Appeal.\nB. Mr. Tsang\n[233] Mr. Tsang was charged with one count of sexual assault from an incident in his car in the early hours of December 29, 2018. He and the complainant met at a music concert and attended a subsequent event at the Commodore Ballroom in Vancouver. The two then departed in Mr. Tsang\u2019s car. The complainant testified that on the way to drop her off, Mr. Tsang stopped the car at a parking lot, where he asked to make out in the back seat. She consented, expecting no more. However, without her consent, Mr. Tsang forced her to perform oral sex and penetrated her vaginally and anally. He then dropped her off at her friend\u2019s home and abruptly drove away as soon as she exited the vehicle. Evidence from a sexual assault medical examiner noted trauma to the genital area, including a tear to the vagina. Mr. Tsang testified that the complainant suggested and led all instances of sexual activity, including the oral sex and digital vaginal penetration; that she asked to be \u201cspanked\u201d and for other instances of \u201crough sex\u201d; that he never penetrated her anally; and that they did not engage in penile-vaginal intercourse because he could not find a condom. The trial judge rejected Mr. Tsang\u2019s evidence and concluded that Mr. Tsang controlled the complainant throughout the night and \u201corchestrated\u201d the events. She found the complainant to be credible, accepted her evidence, and convicted Mr. Tsang (2020 BCPC 306).\n[234] The Court of Appeal concluded that the judge erred in rejecting Mr. Tsang\u2019s testimony by making three \u201cassumptions\u201d or \u201cgeneralizations\u201d about human behaviour that amounted to \u201cspeculative reasoning\u201d: that (1) a person would not ask to be spanked while engaging in sexual foreplay \u201cout of the blue\u201d; (2) a controlling person would not refrain from engaging in vaginal intercourse because of the absence of a condom; and (3) a person would not abruptly and unceremoniously leave another with whom he had engaged in consensual sex (paras. 73-74).\n[235] I will address each of these three purported errors in turn.\n(1) A Person Would Not Ask To Be Spanked While Engaging in Sexual Foreplay \u201cOut of the Blue\u201d\n[236] Under the first question that I have described, I conclude that the trial judge did not rely on a generalized expectation of human behaviour when she found that the complainant did not ask to be spanked or otherwise encourage \u201crough sex\u201d. I note that while the Court of Appeal at times focused on the judge\u2019s rejection of Mr. Tsang\u2019s evidence that the complainant \u201casked him to spank her\u201d (para. 28), it expressed a broader concern that the judge \u201crejected [Mr. Tsang\u2019s] evidence that the complainant encouraged rough sex\u201d (para. 43).\n[237] The trial judge\u2019s rejection of Mr. Tsang\u2019s \u201crough sex\u201d evidence was not based on a generalized expectation about whether any person would ask to be spanked or otherwise encourage rough sex. Instead, it was based on the judge\u2019s assessment of the evidence about the particular individuals in question and her conclusions about Mr. Tsang\u2019s credibility in particular. The judge\u2019s reasons clearly indicate that she did not believe Mr. Tsang\u2019s story that the complainant had instigated all flirtatious or sexual advances that evening. The judge had, at this point in her reasons, noted that the complainant \u201chad expressed no interest\u201d in Mr. Tsang throughout the night until the incident in his vehicle, and that she \u201chad been with another man earlier in the evening\u201d (para. 121 (CanLII)). The judge had also rejected Mr. Tsang\u2019s testimony about the complainant initiating a kiss on the Commodore Ballroom dance floor \u2014 a conclusion that the Court of Appeal acknowledged was open to the judge based on the evidence (para. 39). Further, and importantly, the trial judge considered Mr. Tsang\u2019s evidence about rough sex was contrived to explain the presence of injuries (para. 158). Taken at its highest, Mr. Tsang\u2019s evidence suggested the complainant wanted to be \u201cspanked\u201d or to have \u201charder\u201d digital penetration. The judge considered, in light of the complainant\u2019s injuries, that this sort of purportedly consensual \u201crough sex\u201d failed to explain the severity of the injuries actually exhibited by the complainant. It was in light of these conclusions that the judge found it was \u201cnot believable\u201d that this complainant would have asked to be spanked or was \u201cgearing up for rough sex\u201d with Mr. Tsang (para. 126).\n[238] With respect, the Court of Appeal reweighed the evidence. It downplayed aspects of the judge\u2019s reasoning by concluding, for example, that \u201clittle turns upon the events that preceded those that took place in the parking lot\u201d (para. 42) and that it could not be said that other aspects of the evidence \u201cweighed heavily\u201d in the judge\u2019s assessment of the evidence (para. 45). The trial judge\u2019s assessment of the evidence was clearly informed by the entire transaction of events during the evening and her overall assessment of the evidence. The Court of Appeal was not entitled to substitute its own view of how much \u201cturned\u201d on different parts of the narrative.\n[239] Accordingly, the trial judge did not rely on a generalized expectation of what people are likely to do during sexual activity. There is therefore no need to consider the second and third questions that I have described in relation to this alleged error.\n(2) A Controlling Person Would Not Refrain From Engaging in Vaginal Intercourse Because of the Absence of a Condom\n[240] As with the first purported error, I conclude under the first question that the trial judge did not rely on a generalized expectation about human behaviour when she rejected Mr. Tsang\u2019s evidence that he refrained from vaginal intercourse because of the absence of a condom. There is therefore no need to consider the second and third questions that I have described.\n[241] The impugned statement in the trial judge\u2019s reasons is as follows:\nThe accused\u2019s description about the prospect of intercourse being thwarted by the lack of a condom in his car when there was one available was contrived in my view and contrary to the level of control he conveyed about that evening and in court. He said [the complainant] told him she wanted to give him oral sex to finish him and she did so again. He said he used his hand to grab her hair lightly and guide her. He recalled that she choked on it a bit and then used her mouth and hands again. Mr. Tsang said he asked [the complainant] if she spat or swallowed. When [the complainant] answered \u201cswallow; spit is for losers\u201d, he ejaculated inside her mouth. I find Mr. Tsang\u2019s behaviour to have been focussed on himself at this time but for which it would have been apparent that [the complainant] was only participating so that he would finish and not because she wanted to or was enjoying it. [Emphasis added; para. 129.]\n[242] The Court of Appeal considered that the trial judge relied on a \u201cprejudicial stereotype\u201d about \u201ccontrolling\u201d people to assume that such people would not abstain from sex because of the lack of a condom (para. 65). In my view, there is no generalized expectation about \u201ccontrolling\u201d people at play in the trial judge\u2019s reasons. The judge concluded that Mr. Tsang himself was \u201ccontrolling\u201d and had \u201corchestrated\u201d events throughout the night, based on circumstances such as Mr. Tsang\u2019s insistence that the complainant and her friend leave their fanny packs and belongings in his car and his encouragement of further drinking. The trial judge thus found it contrived that the inability to find a condom would have \u201cthwarted\u201d his motivation to have sexual intercourse with the complainant, in light of all of the other evidence of his behaviour throughout the evening. Her overall conclusion was, of course, informed by the complainant\u2019s direct evidence that he did instigate sexual intercourse, which the judge accepted. This conclusion was also informed by the judge\u2019s finding that Mr. Tsang had exhibited few inhibitions through the night and was focussed on his own pleasure while in the car, as indicated by his indifference to hearing the complainant crying and gagging during oral sex.\n[243] The Court of Appeal again reweighed the evidence in order to identify an error. It did not question the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that Mr. Tsang was \u201ccontrolling\u201d and had \u201corchestrated\u201d the events throughout the night. It acknowledged the various aspects of the evidence that the judge considered. Despite acknowledging these points, the Court of Appeal downplayed the significance of the trial judge\u2019s impressions of Mr. Tsang, again by stating that \u201clittle turns upon the events that preceded those that took place in the parking lot\u201d (para. 42). There was no basis for the Court of Appeal to intervene with the trial judge\u2019s appreciation of the evidence as a whole.\n[244] As I would dismiss this argument under the first question, there is no need to consider the reasonableness of any generalized expectation under the second question, as none was relied on. However, I would add that, in my view, the Court of Appeal\u2019s characterization of the trial judge\u2019s analysis as relying on a \u201cprejudicial stereotype\u201d about \u201ccontrolling people\u201d distorts a proper understanding of stereotypes. \u201cControlling people\u201d are not members of a particular group who are subject to biases that could fairly be described as \u201cstereotypes\u201d. The Court of Appeal\u2019s approach would imply that any characterization about a person\u2019s personality, such as being \u201caggressive\u201d or \u201ccareless\u201d, could be labelled a \u201cstereotype\u201d, even where such characterizations arise from the evidence of the person\u2019s behaviour.\n(3) A Person Would Not Abruptly and Unceremoniously Leave Another With Whom He Had Engaged in Consensual Sex\n[245] I turn to the final error identified by the Court of Appeal. The impugned passages of the trial judge\u2019s reasons are as follows:\n[Mr. Tsang\u2019s] lack of interest . . . at [the complainant\u2019s] invitation to meet again was at odds with his evidence that they . . . just had a great time, but is consistent with a non-consensual event where he got what he wanted without regard for her and drove away.\n. . .\nMr. Tsang\u2019s testimony aligned with that of [the complainant] and [her friend] that he drove off as soon as [the complainant] got out of his car and he did not watch her go inside the house. I find this fact more consistent with [the complainant\u2019s] claim of non-consensual sex than with Mr. Tsang\u2019s version of what had just happened. He took off right away because of what he had just done to her and because she meant nothing to him. It is inconsistent with his evidence that he wanted to pleasure [the complainant] that night. [Emphasis added; paras. 131 and 153.]\n[246] Under the first question that I have described \u2014 and unlike the first two purported errors \u2014 I consider that the trial judge did rely on a generalized expectation about how people ordinarily behave after a consensual sexual encounter. I disagree with the Crown that the judge was solely considering the consistency between Mr. Tsang\u2019s evidence that he and the complainant had just had a great time with the evidence of Mr. Tsang\u2019s abrupt driving away. The judge did not simply say that Mr. Tsang\u2019s evidence was inconsistent, but she affirmatively considered that Mr. Tsang driving away was \u201cconsistent with a non-consensual event where he got what he wanted without regard for her\u201d and \u201cmore consistent with [the complainant\u2019s] claim of non-consensual sex\u201d. There was nothing in the evidence to suggest that Mr. Tsang was the type of person who would or would not abruptly drive away from a person with whom he had engaged in consensual sex. Rather, the judge considered that most people do not do this.\n[247] Furthermore, under the second question, I consider that it is unreasonable to expect any logical connection between an individual waiting for their sexual partner to enter a home and the consensual or non-consensual nature of the preceding encounter. Driving away could certainly indicate impoliteness or a lack of social tact. Yet this is a far cry from suggesting that the person has just participated in a non-consensual sexual encounter. This cannot be understood to be a reasonably accurate reflection of what is true in most circumstances, such that it can be used as a reliable benchmark to assess the evidence.\n[248] Despite this error of law, I would uphold the conviction under the curative proviso on the basis that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred. In my view, this error of law was \u201cso harmless or minor that it could not have had any impact on the verdict\u201d (Van, at para. 34). As the Crown observes, this generalized expectation played a very minor role in the trial judge\u2019s analysis. The judge\u2019s verdict clearly turned on her favourable assessment of the complainant\u2019s credibility, as well as her complete rejection of Mr. Tsang\u2019s testimony as inconsistent with the events throughout the evening and contrived to explain away the complainant\u2019s injuries. While the judge did consider Mr. Tsang\u2019s abrupt driving away as further evidence of a non-consensual encounter, she only entertained this evidence in response to Mr. Tsang\u2019s suggestion that he and the complainant had just had a great evening. In these circumstances, it is inconceivable that the trial judge would have had a reasonable doubt about consent had she not relied on the evidence about his abrupt driving away.\nVI. Conclusion\n[249] For the reasons above, I would allow both appeals and restore the convictions.\nAPPENDIX\nAppeals allowed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Ministry of Attorney General \u2014 Criminal Appeals, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the respondent Christopher James Kruk: Johnson Doyle Nelson & Anderson, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the respondent Edwin Tsang: Fowler & Blok, Vancouver.\nSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Alberta: Alberta Crown Prosecution Service \u2014 Appeals and Specialized Prosecutions Office, Calgary.\nSolicitors for the intervener the Independent Criminal Defence Advocacy Society: Thorsteinssons, Vancouver; Pringle Law, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the intervener the Criminal Lawyers\u2019 Association (Ontario): Gorham Vandebeek, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the intervener the Trial Lawyers Association of British Columbia: Peck and Company, Vancouver; Olthuis van Ert, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the intervener Association qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise des avocats et avocates de la d\u00e9fense: Hugo Caissy (ad hoc), Amqui, Que.; Beaudry Roussin, Qu\u00e9bec.\nSolicitors for the interveners the West Coast Legal Education and Action Fund Association and the Women\u2019s Legal Education and Action Fund Inc.: Megan Stephens Law, Toronto; West Coast LEAF, Vancouver; Women\u2019s Legal Education and Action Fund (LEAF), Toronto.\n[1] For example, this Court has rejected the notion that the questions in the W. (D.) analysis need to be posed in a specific order (R. v. W. (D.), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742; R. v. Vuradin, 2013 SCC 38, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 639); furthermore, trial judges can, in the right circumstances, reject the testimony of the accused because they believe the testimony of the complainant (R. v. D. (J.J.R.) (2006), 215 C.C.C. (3d) 252 (Ont. C.A.)). This Court has also expressed reservations about whether uneven scrutiny of Crown and defence evidence is a proper, independent ground of appeal (R. v. G.F., 2021 SCC 20, [2021] 1 S.C.R. 801).\n[2] For example, in Roth, the British Columbia Court of Appeal held that the trial judge erred in discounting the accused\u2019s evidence \u201con the basis of an unfounded (and therefore speculative) assumption about his physical stamina arising from his training as a powerlifter\u201d (para. 71 (emphasis added)). The fact that the court used the terms \u201cunfounded\u201d and \u201cspeculative\u201d interchangeably in this context does not mean that the court meant to indicate that any form of speculation, as it is colloquially understood, amounts to an error of law.\n[3] See e.g. R. v. Drydgen, 2021 BCCA 125 (aggravated assault); R. v. Petrolo, 2021 ONCA 498, 156 O.R. (3d) 321 (breach of trust and obstruction of justice); J.P. v. R., 2022 QCCA 104 (assault, indecent assault and threats to cause death or bodily harm).\n[4] Credibility assessments engage factors such as: the internal consistency and coherence of the witness\u2019s testimony and the incidence of inconsistencies with prior statements, especially those made under oath (Maxwell v. The Queen, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 1072); consistency with other accepted facts and probable circumstances (R. v. Norman (1993), 16 O.R. (3d) 295 (C.A.), at p. 314, citing Faryna v. Chorny, [1952] 2 D.L.R. 354 (B.C.C.A.)); the plausibility of the narrative presented by the testimony (Kiss, at para. 31); evidence of a motive to fabricate (R. v. B. (K.G.), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 740, at p. 803); and demeanour, though courts should not rely exclusively on this consideration and should be conservative in according it weight (R. v. N.S., 2012 SCC 72, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 726, at paras. 25-26; R. v. J.A.A., 2011 SCC 17, [2011] 1 S.C.R. 628, at para. 14; R. v. Rhayel, 2015 ONCA 377, 324 C.C.C. (3d) 362, at paras. 84-94; R. v. Pelletier (1995), 165 A.R. 138 (C.A.), at para. 18). Reliability assessments engage factors such as: the conditions under which the witness made the material observations; the level of detail in their testimony; the amount of time that elapsed between the observations and the testimony; and whether any intervening factors may have tainted the witness\u2019s memory (see, e.g., R. v. Virk, 2015 BCSC 981, at para. 117 (CanLII), discussing reliability in relation to eyewitness identifications).\n",

Her insurer initially paid her accident benefits. However, in January 2011, the insurer informed Y by letter that payment of all benefits had been stopped in the absence of a completed disability certificate. A dispute resolution form was attached to the letter. Then, in February 2011, the insurer informed Y that following a medical assessment her income replacement benefits were reinstated but her claim to the other two benefits \u2014 housekeeping and home maintenance \u2014 was denied. Finally, in September 2011, the insurer informed Y that her income replacement benefits were denied and payments would be stopped. No dispute resolutions forms were attached to either of the last two letters.\nY applied for mediation, which was mandatory at the time, to dispute the denial of her benefits. The mediation process came to an end in January 2014 and the mediator released his report. At the time of Y\u2019s accident, Ontario\u2019s Insurance Act provided for a two\u2011year limitation period after the insurer\u2019s refusal to pay the benefits to commence a proceeding to contest the denial. It also provided that the limitation period was extended by a period of 90 days after the mediator provided their report. Y commenced a proceeding before the Licence Appeal Tribunal (\u201cLAT\u201d) in March 2018. Her application was dismissed as being time\u2011barred and her request for reconsideration was dismissed.\nPursuant to Ontario\u2019s Licence Appeal Tribunal Act, 1999, Y\u2019s right of appeal from the LAT adjudicator\u2019s reconsideration decision was restricted to questions of law. Y pursued an appeal on questions of law, and also sought judicial review regarding questions of fact or mixed fact and law. The Divisional Court dismissed the appeal, holding that Y showed no errors of law made by the LAT adjudicator. It also dismissed Y\u2019s application for judicial review, on the basis that there were no exceptional circumstances that would justify judicial review. The Court of Appeal dismissed Y\u2019s appeal, holding that it would only be in rare cases that the remedy of judicial review would be exercised given the legislated scheme for the resolution of such disputes, and that Y had an appropriate alternative remedy. It also concluded that even if the judicial review application ought to have been considered, it would have been denied as the LAT adjudicator\u2019s decision was reasonable.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the matter remitted to the LAT adjudicator.\nIt was an error for the courts below to hold that, where there is a limited right of appeal, judicial review should only be exercised in exceptional or rare cases. The limited right of appeal from LAT decisions to pure questions of law does not reflect an intention by the legislature to restrict recourse to the courts on other questions arising from the LAT\u2019s administrative decision. The legislative decision to provide for a right of appeal on questions of law only denotes an intention to subject LAT decisions on questions of law to correctness review, and proceeding with judicial review on questions of fact or mixed fact and law is fully respectful of the legislature\u2019s institutional design choices. Furthermore, the LAT adjudicator\u2019s reconsideration decision was unreasonable, as he failed to take into account relevant legal constraints. The matter should be referred back to the LAT adjudicator for reconsideration.\nAs held by the Court in Vavilov, a right of appeal does not preclude an individual from seeking judicial review for questions not dealt with in the appeal. Where there is a statutory right of appeal limited to questions of law, judicial review is available for questions of fact or mixed fact and law. However, while there is a right to seek judicial review, it is open to the judge before whom judicial review is sought to decide whether to exercise his or her discretion to grant relief \u2014 although this discretion does not extend to decline to consider the application for judicial review. The discretion whether to undertake judicial review should be exercised by the judge having regard to the framework set out in Strickland v. Canada (Attorney General), 2015 SCC 37. At a minimum, the judge must determine whether judicial review is appropriate. If, in considering the application, the judge determines that one of the discretionary bases for refusing a remedy is present, they may decline to consider the merits of the judicial review application. The judge also has the discretion to refuse to grant a remedy even if they find that the decision under review is unreasonable.\nIn exercising its discretion, in addition to the suitability and appropriateness of judicial review in the circumstances, the court should consider the available alternatives. This balancing exercise should take account of the purposes and policy considerations underpinning the legislative scheme in issue. Alternative remedies exist where internal review processes have not been exhausted or where there is a statutory right of appeal that is not restricted, such that questions of law, fact and mixed fact and law could be considered on appeal. It would be ignoring Strickland to conclude that only in exceptional circumstances would judicial review be available where there is a limited right of appeal. It would also be an error to hold that judicial review should only be exercised in rare cases.\nIn the instant case, the Divisional Court should have exercised its discretion to undertake judicial review for issues not dealt with under the statutory right of appeal. The statutory right to appeal and the LAT adjudicator\u2019s reconsideration decision do not constitute adequate alternative remedies. Y raises errors of fact or mixed fact and law which are not reviewable under the statutory right of appeal, and access to internal reconsiderations cannot be an adequate alternative remedy, as the reconsideration decision itself is the subject of the review.\nFurthermore, the LAT adjudicator\u2019s reconsideration decision is unreasonable, as he failed to have regard to the effect of the reinstatement of the income replacement benefits between February and September 2011 on the validity of the initial denial. In addition, he did not consider earlier tribunal decisions, some of which had held that when an applicant\u2019s benefits are reinstated, the limitation period can only be triggered when they are validly terminated again. It is arguable that there needed to be a valid denial of the income replacement benefits to start the clock running on the limitation period, and this question is one to be properly decided by the LAT.\nCases Cited\nApplied: Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v.

Overview\n[1] This case deals with a court\u2019s exercise of discretion as to whether to undertake judicial review on the merits in light of a limited statutory right of appeal.\n[2] Ummugulsum Yatar is contesting the denial of her insurance benefits, following an accident in 2010. After having her application dismissed by the Licence Appeal Tribunal (\u201cLAT\u201d) in 2019, due to the matter being time-barred, Ms. Yatar requested reconsideration of this decision, which was dismissed. Then, she simultaneously appealed the decision before the Divisional Court of Ontario, and applied for judicial review. Section 11(6) of the Licence Appeal Tribunal Act, 1999, S.O. 1999, c. 12, Sch. G (\u201cLAT Act\u201d), provides that an appeal from a decision of the LAT relating to a matter under the Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8, may be made on a question of law only.\n[3] As per Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653, a right of appeal does not preclude an individual from seeking judicial review for questions not dealt with in the appeal. In this case, despite the statutory right of appeal limited to questions of law, judicial review is available for questions of fact or mixed fact and law. It is then a matter of discretion whether to undertake judicial review, having regard to the framework for analysis set out in Strickland v. Canada (Attorney General), 2015 SCC 37, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 713.\n[4] The Divisional Court erred when it concluded that only in \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d would judicial review be available where there is a limited right of appeal (2021 ONSC 2507, 157 O.R. (3d) 337, at para. 4); this ignored Strickland. The Court of Appeal for Ontario also erred when it held that only in \u201crare cases\u201d judicial review would be exercised (2022 ONCA 446, 25 C.C.L.I. (6th) 1, at para. 42), and that in this case, Ms. Yatar had an appropriate alternative remedy. Both courts sought to apply Strickland, but erred in principle in doing so. They did so by relying on a statutory right of appeal for questions of law as indicative of legislative intent to restrict access to judicial review for questions of fact and mixed fact and law. No such inference is warranted. Properly applying Strickland, the Divisional Court should have exercised its discretion to undertake judicial review for issues not dealt with under the statutory right of appeal.\n[5] As to the LAT adjudicator\u2019s reconsideration decision (2020 CanLII 34442 (\u201creconsideration decision\u201d)), it is unreasonable, as he failed to consider the effects of the reinstatement of benefits on the limitation period, and he did not have regard to jurisprudence relevant to the matter. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the matter is referred back to the LAT adjudicator for reconsideration.\nII. Factual Context\nA. The Underlying Insurance Claim\n[6] Ms. Yatar \u201cwas injured in an automobile accident in February 2010 and sought benefits under the Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule \u2014 Accidents on or After November 1, 1996, O. Reg. 403\/96 (\u2018SABS\u2019)\u201d (Divisional Court decision, at para. 5). One of the two respondents, TD Insurance Meloche Monnex, was her insurer at the time, and received Ms. Yatar\u2019s application for accident benefits on February 22, 2010, as well as her employer\u2019s confirmation form on March 13, 2010. Ms. Yatar\u2019s claim also included income replacement benefits (\u201cIRBs\u201d) as well as housekeeping and home maintenance benefits.\nB. Denial of Requested Benefits and Subsequent Proceedings\n[7] Ms. Yatar\u2019s request for benefits was initially considered valid by TD Insurance, which paid benefits to Ms. Yatar. In the months that followed, however, TD Insurance denied the benefits in three letters:\n(a) The January Letter: On January 7, 2011, TD Insurance informed Ms. Yatar that payment of IRBs, as well as housekeeping and home maintenance benefits, had been stopped in the absence of a completed disability certificate. The letter contained directions for a medical examination, which Ms. Yatar attended on January 17 and January 27. A dispute resolution form was attached to that letter.\n(b) The February Letter: On February 16, 2011, Ms. Yatar was informed by TD Insurance that following the medical assessment, her claim to housekeeping and home maintenance benefits was denied. However, her IRBs were reinstated. No dispute resolution form was attached to that letter.\n(c) The September Letter: On September 19, 2011, Ms. Yatar was advised that her IRBs were denied by TD Insurance, and that the payments would be stopped on September 28, 2011. No dispute resolution form was attached to that letter.\n[8] There have been significant legislative amendments since Ms. Yatar commenced her procedures. At the time of the accident, in 2010, the Insurance Act provided for a two-year limitation period after the insurer\u2019s refusal to pay the benefits to commence a proceeding (s. 281.1(1)), as well as mediation as a mandatory first step to resolve a dispute (s. 281(2)), which extended the limitation period to 90 days after the mediator provided their report (s. 281.1(2)(b)). Ms. Yatar applied for mediation on September 13, 2012, to dispute the denial of her benefits. The mediation process came to an end on January 14, 2014.\n[9] However, what is most relevant in this case is that when Ms. Yatar commenced her proceeding before the LAT in March 2018, both the Insurance Act and the SABS had been redesigned. Under the amended Insurance Act, the LAT was given exclusive jurisdiction at first instance over the resolution of SABS disputes. As well, mandatory mediation was eliminated. The LAT Act was also amended to provide for an appeal from a decision of the LAT on a question of law only (s. 11(6)).\n[10] On March 31, 2016, Ms. Yatar commenced an action in the Superior Court of Justice. The action was dismissed through a consent order on March 27, 2017, and the application underlying this appeal was brought to the LAT in March 2018.\nIII. Judicial History\nA. Licence Appeal Tribunal\n[11] In the LAT adjudicator\u2019s first decision in April 2019 (2019 CanLII 43918 (\u201cpreliminary decision\u201d)), the LAT adjudicator considered Ms. Yatar\u2019s claim for IRBs, housekeeping benefits and home maintenance benefits and dismissed it, concluding that the claim was time-barred since April 2014. When Ms. Yatar proceeded with mediation in early 2011, both s. 281.1(2)(b) of the Insurance Act and s. 51(2) of the SABS provided for a limitation period that expired 90 days after the mediator\u2019s report was released.\n[12] The LAT adjudicator found that TD Insurance denied the IRBs, home maintenance and housekeeping benefits in a letter dated January 7, 2011. Given that \u201c[Ms. Yatar] filed this Application before the [LAT] on March 16, 2018, more than seven years after these benefits were denied on January 7, 2011\u201d (para. 19), and even taking into account the extensions of the limitation period due to the evaluation and mediation, the LAT adjudicator found that the claims were time-barred since April 2014.\n[13] The LAT adjudicator noted that \u201c[f]rom counsel\u2019s evidence, it is clear that lawyers at her firm should have been aware of the applicable two-year limitation period. It is also clear that [Ms. Yatar] relied on the expertise of her counsel, to her detriment, in the face of the statutory limitation period\u201d (preliminary decision, at para. 25).\n[14] In the reconsideration decision, the LAT adjudicator reviewed his earlier reasons as well as the evidence. A factual error was corrected at para. 12 of the decision, but the LAT adjudicator re-affirmed the original decision.\n[15] The LAT adjudicator relied on Smith v. Co-operators General Insurance Co., 2002 SCC 30, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 129. He concluded that the dispute resolution form, attached to the January 2011 letter, \u201cclearly sets out three steps in the dispute process and warns in clear straightforward language of the two-year limitation period\u201d (para. 13). The LAT adjudicator stated that, in Smith v. Co-operators, the Supreme Court of Canada sought to ensure that the applicant is aware of the dispute resolution process. He noted that there was an \u201cimplicit acceptance of the denials effective January 4, 2011\u201d and affirmed his previous finding that the January 7, 2011 letter constituted a valid denial of benefits (reconsideration decision, at para. 15; see also para. 16).\n[16] The limitation period was extended into April 2014 following the mediation. However, Ms. Yatar made the application to the LAT for benefits on March 16, 2018. Thus, the request was time-barred. The application was dismissed.\nB. Ontario Superior Court of Justice (Divisional Court), 2021 ONSC 2507, 157 O.R. (3d) 337 (Swinton, Penny and Kristjanson JJ.)\n[17] Ms. Yatar\u2019s right of appeal from the LAT adjudicator\u2019s reconsideration decision was restricted to questions of law, per s. 11(6) of the LAT Act. In light of this, Ms. Yatar pursued an appeal on questions of law, and also sought judicial review regarding questions of fact or mixed fact and law.\n[18] The Divisional Court held that its authority to hear the judicial review application stemmed from s. 280(3) of the Insurance Act and s. 2(1) of the Judicial Review Procedure Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. J.1; this authority was not precluded by the limited right of appeal on questions of law provided by s. 11(6) of the LAT Act.\n[19] The appeal was dismissed, as Ms. Yatar showed no errors of law made by the LAT adjudicator and, instead, recited \u201cfindings of fact made by the [LAT] adjudicator and then baldly assert[ed] that the [LAT] adjudicator erred in law, without identifying the legal error or any extricable legal principle\u201d (Divisional Court decision, at para. 27).\n[20] On judicial review with respect to the questions of fact and mixed fact and law, the Divisional Court concluded that, per Vavilov, the limited right of appeal in the LAT Act did not \u201cdeprive this court of jurisdiction to consider other aspects of a decision in judicial review proceedings\u201d (para. 36). The court added that judicial review is a discretionary remedy, and should thus be declined when alternative remedies are adequate (see Strickland, at paras. 37 and 40).\n[21] As to whether to exercise its discretion to undertake judicial review in this case, the Divisional Court considered four factors: (i) the legislative intent to limit judicial review of LAT decisions on statutory accident benefits to questions of law only, (ii) the breadth of the LAT\u2019s reconsideration power, (iii) the nature of the alleged errors, and (iv) the systemic difficulties associated with dealing with judicial review and an appeal (paras. 41-45).\n[22] The Divisional Court concluded that there were \u201cno exceptional circumstances\u201d in this case that would justify judicial review (para. 46). On this basis, the Divisional Court declined to grant the application for judicial review.\nC. Court of Appeal for Ontario, 2022 ONCA 446, 25 C.C.L.I. (6th) 1 (Lauwers, Nordheimer and Zarnett JJ.A.)\n[23] Two issues were appealed to the Court of Appeal: (i) whether \u201cthe Divisional Court err[ed] in limiting judicial review, in cases where there has been a statutory appeal . . . to \u2018exceptional circumstances\u2019\u201d and (ii) whether \u201cthe [LAT]\u2019s reconsideration decision [was] reasonable\u201d (para. 27).\n[24] The Court of Appeal observed that when the Divisional Court referred to the availability of judicial review, \u201cthe use of the language \u2018exceptional circumstances\u2019 was an unfortunate one\u201d and led to potential confusion (para. 35). The Court of Appeal held that what the Divisional Court \u201cwas attempting to communicate is that it would only be in rare cases that the remedy of judicial review would be exercised, given the legislated scheme for the resolution of disputes over SABS\u201d (para. 42).\n[25] The Court of Appeal held that a limited statutory right of appeal does not preclude judicial review. The right to seek judicial review is always available, but this does not \u201cchange the fact that judicial review is a discretionary remedy\u201d (para. 41). The Court of Appeal also stated that \u201c[t]he court\u2019s discretion with respect to judicial review applies both to its decision to undertake review and to grant relief\u201d, relying on Strickland (para. 44).\n[26] The Court of Appeal held that the Divisional Court correctly considered the factors in Strickland as to whether there are alternative remedies to judicial review. There is \u201clegislative intent to limit access to the courts regarding these disputes\u201d (para. 43).\n[27] The Court of Appeal concluded that even if \u201cthe judicial review application ought to have been considered\u201d, Ms. Yatar had failed to show that the LAT adjudicator\u2019s reconsideration decision was unreasonable: \u201c. . . that application would have failed on the presumptive standard of review of reasonableness . . .\u201d (para. 52).\n[28] The Court of Appeal held that the LAT adjudicator\u2019s underlying finding, that the valid denial of benefits triggered the beginning of the limitation period, was also reasonable:\n. . . the limitation period would have expired in 2013, but for the . . . mediation process that extended that limitation period to April 2014. In either event, the fact that [Ms. Yatar] had not launched her application to the [LAT] until March 16, 2018 meant that it was outside of the limitation period. [para. 51]\n[29] Thus, while the Court of Appeal concluded that judicial review of the LAT adjudicator\u2019s decision ought not to have been considered, the application for judicial review would have been denied as the LAT adjudicator\u2019s decision on the reconsideration was reasonable.\nIV. Issues on Appeal\n[30] Ms. Yatar raises two questions on appeal: first, whether the Court of Appeal erred when it concluded that the legislature\u2019s decision to limit the right of appeal from LAT decisions to \u201cpure\u201d questions of law restricted the availability of judicial review of LAT decisions for errors of fact or mixed fact and law to \u201crare\u201d or \u201cunusual\u201d cases; and second, whether the Court of Appeal erred in concluding that the LAT adjudicator\u2019s reconsideration decision was reasonable (A.F., at para. 28).\nV. Submissions of the Parties\nA. Ms. Yatar\n[31] Ms. Yatar submits that the Court of Appeal erred in finding that the existence of a limited statutory right of appeal can be a basis to decline to undertake judicial review regarding issues outside the scope of the statutory appeal. Vavilov confirms that \u201ca right to appeal on a question of law is not an adequate remedy if a litigant seeks judicial review of a question of fact, or a question of mixed fact and law, . . . the two remedies are compl[e]mentary\u201d (A.F., at para. 52).\n[32] Regarding judicial review in this case, Ms. Yatar argues that since no dispute resolution form accompanied the letters in February and September 2011, the latter cannot be considered valid denials of benefits. The LAT adjudicator erred in considering that the letter from January 2011 was a valid denial, as it was a temporary suspension of benefits and \u201cdid not constitute notice in \u2018straightforward and clear language, directed towards an unsophisticated person\u2019 that benefits would not be provided\u201d (A.F., at para. 79). Thus, the letter from January 2011 cannot be the starting point for the limitation period.\n[33] The fact that the LAT adjudicator did not address the issue of \u201cambiguities\u201d in the January 2011 letter, Ms. Yatar submits, is a central flaw in the analysis and, therefore, the decision is unreasonable.\nB. TD Insurance and Licence Appeal Tribunal\n[34] TD Insurance submits that the Divisional Court did not err in exercising its discretion to decline to undertake judicial review of the LAT adjudicator\u2019s reconsideration decision. The Ontario legislature chose to limit the courts\u2019 involvement in appeals on questions of law.\n[35] Judicial review is discretionary and the Divisional Court\u2019s exercise of this discretion is entitled to deference. As this Court recognized in Canadian Pacific Ltd. v. Matsqui Indian Band, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 3, prerogative writs are an \u201cextraordinary remedy\u201d. The right to seek judicial review does not entail \u201ca right to require the court to undertake judicial review\u201d regardless of the nature of the question (para. 30; Canada (Auditor General) v. Canada (Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources), [1989] 2 S.C.R. 49, at p. 93).\n[36] TD Insurance submits that the Strickland factors provide a sufficient basis on which to dismiss this appeal. If the alternatives to judicial review are adequate, as they are here, then it is \u201cappropriate\u201d to give effect to the legislature\u2019s intent and to decline to undertake judicial review. Other factors from the jurisprudence confirm that judicial review was not appropriate here, including: the nature of the statutory scheme, the nature of the decision and the process followed in making it, the importance of the decision to the individual or individuals affected, and whether the case is of public interest.\n[37] In the alternative, TD Insurance submits, if the LAT adjudicator\u2019s reconsideration decision is to be judicially reviewed, the LAT adjudicator reasonably determined that the application was statute-barred.\n[38] The LAT submits that the Court of Appeal correctly held that the discretion to entertain judicial review on questions of fact and mixed fact and law should be exercised \u201conly . . . in rare cases\u201d (C.A. reasons, at para. 42). Otherwise, the legislative intent in enacting the restrictive appeal clause would be undermined.\n[39] The LAT submits this is consistent with Strickland\u2019s holding on the exercise of discretion on judicial review. Vavilov did not change the law on the discretion to decline to undertake judicial review where there is an alternative remedy; Vavilov did not overrule Strickland.\n[40] In the LAT\u2019s view, reading Vavilov and Strickland together leads to the conclusion that the exercise of discretion on judicial review must consider the adequacy of the restrictive appeal as an alternative remedy while also being respectful of the legislature\u2019s choice to create a right of appeal limited to questions of law only. The LAT takes no position on the reasonableness of its decision.\nVI. Analysis\nA. Standard of Review\n[41] The main issue in this appeal relates to the decision by the Divisional Court and the Court of Appeal not to undertake judicial review. As this is a discretionary decision, deference is to be shown (see Strickland, at para. 39). However, the exercise of discretion can be set aside when a judge \u201cconsidered irrelevant factors, failed to consider relevant factors, or reached an unreasonable conclusion\u201d (Matsqui Indian Band, at para. 39). As I will explain, the Divisional Court and the Court of Appeal erred in their application of Strickland in that they acted on the basis of a \u201cwrong principle\u201d (Matsqui Indian Band, at para. 112, per Sopinka J.).\n[42] Once it is determined that it is appropriate to undertake judicial review in this case, the issue arises whether the LAT adjudicator\u2019s reconsideration decision was reasonable. Per Vavilov, there is \u201ca presumption that reasonableness is the applicable standard whenever a court reviews administrative decisions\u201d (para. 16). That presumption is not rebutted here.\nB. The Existence of a Circumscribed Right of Appeal Does Not, on Its Own, Preclude Applications for Judicial Review\n[43] When the dispute arose in early 2011, mediation was a mandatory first step to challenge an insurer\u2019s denial of benefits. Both s. 281.1(2)(b) of the Insurance Act and s. 51(2) of the SABS provided for a 90-day extension of the limitation period after the mediator\u2019s report is released. Ms. Yatar undertook mediation in September 2012. When Ms. Yatar commenced her proceeding before the LAT in March 2018, the statutory scheme had been amended and provision was made for an appeal from a decision of the LAT on a matter under the Insurance Act on questions of law only.\n[44] In the case at bar, the Divisional Court and the Court of Appeal held that a party can both exercise a statutory right of appeal and seek judicial review for questions outside the scope of the statutory right of appeal. Other courts have also determined that a statutory right of appeal does not alter the availability of judicial review (see Smith v. The Appeal Commission, 2023 MBCA 23, 479 D.L.R. (4th) 121; Wongkingsri v. Alberta (Appeals Commission for Alberta Workers\u2019 Compensation), 2022 ABQB 545, 61 Alta. L.R. (7th) 170; Zarooben v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Board, 2021 ABQB 232, 84 Admin. L.R. (6th) 96, aff\u2019d 2022 ABCA 50, 95 Admin. L.R. (6th) 163).\n[45] The question remains: what role does the right of appeal play in the exercise of discretion to undertake judicial review? In settling this question, it is important to have regard to first principles. In Immeubles Port Louis Lt\u00e9e v. Lafontaine (Village), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 326, this Court held that \u201c[t]he principle that public authorities are subordinate to the supervisory power of the superior courts is the cornerstone of the Canadian and Quebec system of administrative law. Such judicial review is a necessary consequence of the rule of law\u201d (p. 360).\n[46] The importance of judicial review was affirmed by this Court in Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick, 2008 SCC 9, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 190, at para. 27:\nAs a matter of constitutional law, judicial review is intimately connected with the preservation of the rule of law. It is essentially that constitutional foundation which explains the purpose of judicial review and guides its function and operation. Judicial review seeks to address an underlying tension between the rule of law and the foundational democratic principle, which finds an expression in the initiatives of Parliament and legislatures to create various administrative bodies and endow them with broad powers.\n[47] This Court held in Vavilov, at para. 52, that the legislative intent to restrict statutory rights of appeal does not, on its own, affect the availability of judicial review:\n. . . the existence of a circumscribed right of appeal in a statutory scheme does not on its own preclude applications for judicial review of decisions, or of aspects of decisions, to which the appeal mechanism does not apply, or by individuals who have no right of appeal.\n[48] This Court\u2019s precedent contemplates a person pursuing both a statutory appeal on questions of law and judicial review on questions of fact and mixed fact and law. In such an instance, as set out in Vavilov, at para. 37, the questions of law being appealed would be subject to review on a standard of correctness (see also Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235), and questions of fact and mixed fact and law would be subject to review on a standard of reasonableness on judicial review (see Vavilov).\n[49] A person has a right to seek judicial review, and \u201c[t]o give courts a discretion not to hear judicial review applications because of their perception of the quality and quantity of internal reconsiderations would allow judicial discretion to trump [a] constitutional principle\u201d (P. Daly, A Culture of Justification: Vavilov and the Future of Administrative Law (2023), at p. 226, note 94). While there is discretion to hear the application on the merits and deny relief, this discretion does not extend to decline to consider the application for judicial review, as will be explained below.\n[50] I would note recent jurisprudence from the Federal Court of Appeal as to the availability of judicial review where there is a privative clause, i.e. a clause that seeks to bar or restrict judicial review (see, e.g., Canada (Attorney General) v. Pier 1 Imports (U.S.), Inc., 2023 FCA 209; Canada (Attorney General) v. Best Buy Canada Ltd., 2021 FCA 161; Democracy Watch v. Canada (Attorney General), 2023 FCA 39, 14 Admin. L.R. (7th) 42; Democracy Watch v. Canada (Attorney General), 2022 FCA 208). But that is not the question at issue in this case. Accordingly, I leave that question for another day.\nC. The Exercise of Discretion To Grant Relief on Judicial Review\n[51] While there is a right to seek judicial review, it is open to the judge before whom judicial review is sought to decide whether to exercise his or her discretion to grant relief. This Court stated in Strickland, at para. 37, quoting Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources, at p. 90:\nJudicial review by way of the old prerogative writs has always been understood to be discretionary. This means that even if the applicant makes out a case for review on the merits, the reviewing court has an overriding discretion to refuse relief . . . . Declarations of right, whether sought in judicial review proceedings or in actions, are similarly a discretionary remedy: \u201c. . . the broadest judicial discretion may be exercised in determining whether a case is one in which declaratory relief ought to be awarded\u201d . . . . [Emphasis added.]\n[52] In Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Khosa, 2009 SCC 12, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 339, at para. 135, Rothstein J. stated:\nThe traditional common law discretion to refuse relief on judicial review concerns the parties\u2019 conduct, any undue delay and the existence of alternative remedies: Immeubles Port Louis Lt\u00e9e v. Lafontaine (Village), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 326, at p. 364. As Harelkin [v. University of Regina, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 561,] affirmed, at p. 575, courts may exercise their discretion to refuse relief to applicants \u201cif they have been guilty of unreasonable delay or misconduct or if an adequate alternative remedy exists, notwithstanding that they have proved a usurpation of jurisdiction by the inferior tribunal or an omission to perform a public duty\u201d. As in the case of interlocutory injunctions, courts exercising discretion to grant relief on judicial review will take into account the public interest, any disproportionate impact on the parties and the interests of third parties. [Emphasis added.]\n[53] In the case at bar, the Court of Appeal stated that \u201c[t]he court\u2019s discretion with respect to judicial review applies both to its decision to undertake review and to grant relief\u201d (para. 44). This wording is unclear; thus, there is need for clarification.\n[54] When an applicant brings an application for judicial review, a judge must consider the application: that is, at a minimum, the judge must determine whether judicial review is appropriate. If, in considering the application, the judge determines that one of the discretionary bases for refusing a remedy is present, they may decline to consider the merits of the judicial review application (Strickland, at paras. 1, 38 and 40; Matsqui, at para. 31). The judge also has the discretion to refuse to grant a remedy, even if they find that the decision under review is unreasonable (Khosa, at para. 135; Strickland, at para. 37, quoting Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources, at p. 90).\n[55] The Court of Appeal initially found no reversible error in the Divisional Court\u2019s decision to refuse to hear the judicial review application and agreed with the Divisional Court that: (i) there were alternative remedies, and (ii) the legislative scheme demonstrates \u201cthe legislative intent to limit access to the courts regarding these disputes\u201d (para. 43). The Court of Appeal then went on to conduct a judicial review, as had the Divisional Court.\n[56] Per Strickland, the exercise of discretion requires the court to determine the appropriateness of judicial review: \u201cThe court should consider not only the available alternative, but also the suitability and appropriateness of judicial review in the circumstances. In short, the question is not simply whether some other remedy is adequate, but also whether judicial review is appropriate. . . . This balancing exercise should take account of the purposes and policy considerations underpinning the legislative scheme in issue . . .\u201d (paras. 43-44).\n[57] Respectfully, the Court of Appeal erred in its application of the Strickland factors. As I will explain, there is no proper basis to infer legislative intent to eliminate judicial review for issues (of fact and mixed fact and law) outside the scope of a statutory appeal. Furthermore, there was no adequate alternative remedy for Ms. Yatar on questions of fact and mixed fact and law.\n[58] The Court of Appeal erred by holding that the limited right of appeal reflected an intention to restrict recourse to the courts on other questions arising from the administrative decision, and that judicial review should thus be rare. The legislative decision to provide for a right of appeal on questions of law only denotes an intention to subject LAT decisions on questions of law to correctness review. The idea that the LAT should not be subject to judicial review as to questions of facts and mixed facts and law cannot be inferred from this.\n[59] The respondent TD Insurance argues that the legislative scheme and its amendments in 2016 reflects a policy choice by the legislature to severely limit the courts\u2019 involvement in accident benefits disputes: \u201cSection 11(6) of the LAT Act restricts appeals to questions of law. . . . For LAT decisions made under nearly twenty other statutes, the legislature has made appeals available on all questions\u201d (R.F., at paras. 62\u201163). TD Insurance further submits that \u201capplying a deferential standard of review (reasonableness) to factual and mixed questions arising out of LAT decisions concerning SABS would not be appropriately respectful of the legislature\u2019s institutional design choices\u201d (para. 84).\n[60] With respect, I do not agree. The legislature could have decided to encompass all types of errors in the right to appeal, but it did not. Moreover, s. 2(1) of the Judicial Review Procedure Act preserves the right of litigants to seek a judicial review \u201cdespite any right of appeal\u201d. Errors of fact or mixed fact and law, thus, are not subject to a correctness standard of review. With that in mind, proceeding with judicial review of questions of fact or mixed fact and law is fully respectful of the legislature\u2019s institutional design choices.\n[61] In Vavilov, this Court held that \u201cbecause judicial review is protected by s. 96 of the Constitution Act, 1867 , legislatures cannot shield administrative decision making from curial scrutiny entirely\u201d (para. 24). Professor Paul Daly argues that \u201c[w]here the judicial review jurisdiction of the courts has been successfully ousted by statute . . . the legislature has provided a particular channel for oversight of the legality, rationality and procedural fairness of administrative action\u201d (Understanding Administrative Law in the Common Law World (2021), at p. 188 (emphasis in original)). In other words, there was an appropriate alternative forum or remedy.\n[62] The statutory right to appeal and the LAT adjudicator\u2019s reconsideration decision do not constitute adequate alternative remedies. The right to appeal under s. 11(6) of the LAT Act is restricted to errors of law only. Ms. Yatar raises errors of fact or mixed fact and law. Review of these questions is not available under the statutory right of appeal.\n[63] The access to internal reconsideration cannot be an adequate alternative remedy, as the reconsideration decision itself is the subject of the review. Alternatives do exist where internal review processes have not been exhausted or where there is a statutory right to appeal that is not restricted, such that questions of law, fact, and mixed fact and law could be considered on appeal. But, that is not so here.\n[64] This Court in Strickland, at para. 43, also emphasizes the appropriateness of judicial review in the circumstances, referring to a \u201cbalancing exercise\u201d:\nThe categories of relevant factors are not closed, as it is for courts to identify and balance the relevant factors in the context of a particular case: Matsqui, at paras. 36-37, citing [Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources], at p. 96. Assessing whether there is an adequate alternative remedy, therefore, is not a matter of following a checklist focused on the similarities and differences between the potentially available remedies. The inquiry is broader than that. The court should consider not only the available alternative, but also the suitability and appropriateness of judicial review in the circumstances. In short, the question is not simply whether some other remedy is adequate, but also whether judicial review is appropriate. Ultimately, this calls for a type of balance of convenience analysis: Khosa, at para. 36; TeleZone, at para. 56. As Dickson C.J. put it on behalf of the Court: \u201cInquiring into the adequacy of the alternative remedy is at one and the same time an inquiry into whether discretion to grant the judicial review remedy should be exercised. It is for the courts to isolate and balance the factors which are relevant . . .\u201d [Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources], at p. 96). [Emphasis added.]\n[65] It has been argued by both respondents that judicial review was not appropriate in the circumstances, as the legislative intent was to \u201cstreamline dispute resolution and reduce costs\u201d (R.F., TD Insurance, at para. 61). Respectfully, I do not agree. Judicial economy is a legitimate concern. However, the countervailing consideration is to ensure that those whose interests are being decided by a statutory delegate have a meaningful and adequate means to challenge decisions that they consider to be unreasonable having regard to their substance and justification, or were taken in a way that was procedurally unfair.\n[66] Thus, in this case, the elements of the reconsideration decision that are not covered by the limited right of appeal should be judicially reviewed.\n[67] I turn now to whether the LAT adjudicator\u2019s decision was reasonable.\nD. The LAT Adjudicator\u2019s Decision Was Unreasonable\n[68] Ms. Yatar received a letter from the insurer in January 2011 advising her that she would not receive further IRBs, housekeeping and home maintenance benefits, as she had not submitted a disability certificate. Attached to the letter was a dispute resolution form.\n[69] Ms. Yatar provided the disability certificate and per the letter she received from the insurer in February 2011, her IRBs were reinstated, but her housekeeping and home maintenance benefits were denied. Following another medical examination, the insurer denied further IRBs as set out in the letter of September 2011.\n[70] Ms. Yatar argues that the letters of February and September 2011 are not valid denials as no dispute resolution form was attached. While the LAT adjudicator also arrived at that conclusion, Ms. Yatar submits that the LAT adjudicator erred in finding that the letter from January was a valid denial.\n[71] Per Vavilov, two types of flaws can render a decision unreasonable: first, a \u201cfailure of rationality internal to the reasoning process\u201d, and second, \u201cwhen a decision is in some respect untenable in light of the relevant factual and legal constraints that bear on it\u201d (para. 101). The LAT adjudicator\u2019s reconsideration decision should be \u201capproached as an organic whole, without a line-by-line treasure hunt for error\u201d (Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada, Local 30 v. Irving Pulp & Paper, Ltd., 2013 SCC 34, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 458, at para. 54).\n[72] The LAT adjudicator relied on Smith v. Co-operators and concluded from the affidavit adduced by Ms. Yatar that there was an \u201cimplicit acceptance of the denials effective January 4, 2011\u201d (reconsideration decision, at para. 15) and that her counsel should have been aware of the two-year limitation period, but that nothing was done to protect her rights.\n[73] At the time, both s. 281.1(2)(b) of the Insurance Act and s. 51(2) of the SABS provided for a 90-day extension of the limitation period after the mediator\u2019s report was released. The LAT adjudicator took into account the fact that Ms. Yatar commenced the mediation process after receiving the September letter. The LAT adjudicator had regard to the letters as well as the mediation process, and concluded that \u201c[t]he limitation period lapsed April 14, 2014, [at the end of] the statutory ninety-day extension following the report of the mediator\u201d (preliminary decision, at para. 26, aff\u2019d in reconsideration decision, at para. 17).\n[74] However, the LAT adjudicator failed to have regard to the effect of the reinstatement of the IRBs between February and September. The LAT adjudicator did not consider earlier tribunal decisions, some of which had held that when an applicant\u2019s benefits are reinstated, the limitation period can only be triggered when they are validly terminated again (see Veldhuizen v. Coseco Insurance Co., 1995 ONICDRG 144 (CanLII); Rudnicki v. Certas Direct Insurance Co., 2001 ONFSCDRS 60 (CanLII)).\n[75] It is not in question that Ms. Yatar initiated mediation in September 2012. The mediation took place between June 18, 2013 and January 14, 2014. On January 14, 2014, the mediator released his report. However, s. 281.1(2)(b) of the Insurance Act and s. 51(2) of the SABS (as they existed at the time) do not trigger a 90-day limitation period from the release of the mediator\u2019s report. Rather, they provide for an extension of the two-year limitation period from the mediator\u2019s report. In other words, it is arguable that there still needed to be a valid denial of the IRBs to start the clock running. I do not purport to decide this question; it is one properly to be decided by the LAT.\n[76] The LAT adjudicator failed to take into account relevant legal constraints. In light of this, his decision is unreasonable.\nVII. Conclusion\n[77] The appeal is allowed. Having concluded that the reconsideration decision is unreasonable, I send the matter back to the LAT adjudicator to consider the issue of the effects of the reinstatement of benefits on the validity of the initial denial and, thus, on the limitation period.\n[78] As Ms. Yatar succeeded on the jurisprudential question relating to the exercise of discretion to undertake judicial review when there is a limited statutory right of appeal, and in the judicial review, she is awarded her costs in this Court and the courts below payable by TD Insurance.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Dewart Gleason, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the respondent TD Insurance Meloche Monnex: McCarthy T\u00e9trault, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the respondent the Licence Appeal Tribunal: Tribunals Ontario \u2014 Legal Services Branch, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the intervener the Attorney General of Canada: Department of Justice Canada \u2014 Ontario Regional Office, National Litigation Sector, Toronto; Department of Justice Canada \u2014 Quebec Regional Office, National Litigation Sector, Montr\u00e9al.\nSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Ontario: Ministry of the Attorney General \u2014 Crown Law Office \u2014 Civil, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Quebec: Minist\u00e8re de la Justice du Qu\u00e9bec, Qu\u00e9bec.\nSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of British Columbia: Ministry of the Attorney General, Legal Services Branch, Vancouver.\nSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Alberta: Alberta Justice, Legal Services Division \u2014 Constitutional and Aboriginal Law Team, Edmonton.\nSolicitors for the intervener the Income Security Advocacy Centre: Income Security Advocacy Centre, Toronto; Clinic Resource Office \u2014 Legal Aid Ontario, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the intervener the Advocacy Centre for Tenants Ontario: Advocacy Centre for Tenants Ontario, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the intervener the Canadian Telecommunications Association: Paul Daly Law, Ottawa.\nSolicitors for the intervener the Insurance Bureau of Canada: Lenczner Slaght, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the intervener the Forest Appeals Commission: Arvay Finlay, Victoria.\nSolicitor for the interveners Aboriginal Council of Winnipeg, Inc. and the Social Planning Council of Winnipeg: Public Interest Law Centre, Winnipeg.\n",

The Crown appealed, arguing that the military judge failed to consider all of the evidence cumulatively and assessed the evidence on the wrong legal principles. A majority of the Court Martial Appeal Court dismissed the Crown\u2019s appeal. Justice McVeigh, in dissent, would have allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial.\nThe Crown appeals to this Court as of right.\nA majority of the Court is of the view that the appeal should be dismissed, substantially for the reasons of the majority of the Court Martial Appeal Court. The military judge\u2019s assessment of the evidence was thorough and cumulative. Reading the judgment as a whole, the military judge did not adopt a piecemeal or narrow approach to the evidence. In addition, we are not persuaded that the military judge applied the wrong legal principles. While we agree with all of the justices of the Court Martial Appeal Court that the military judge engaged in some improper speculation, we share the majority\u2019s view that these comments did not undermine the military judge\u2019s fundamental findings.\nFor her part, Justice O\u2019Bonsawin would allow the appeal for the reasons of Justice McVeigh, at paras. 39-90 and 119-26 (CanLII). Therefore, the appeal is dismissed.\nJUGEMENT\nL\u2019appel interjet\u00e9 contre l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour d\u2019appel de la cour martiale du Canada, num\u00e9ro CMAC-621, 2023 CACM 2, dat\u00e9 du 27 f\u00e9vrier 2023, a \u00e9t\u00e9 entendu le 16 janvier 2024 et la Cour a prononc\u00e9 oralement le m\u00eame jour le jugement suivant :\n[traduction] Le juge en chef \u2014 L\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 acquitt\u00e9 d\u2019agression sexuelle devant la Cour martiale. La Couronne a fait appel, plaidant que le juge militaire avait omis d\u2019effectuer une \u00e9valuation cumulative de l\u2019ensemble de la preuve et avait appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 celle-ci au regard des mauvais principes juridiques. La Cour d\u2019appel de la cour martiale a rejet\u00e9 \u00e0 la majorit\u00e9 l\u2019appel de la Couronne. La juge McVeigh, dissidente, aurait accueilli l\u2019appel et ordonn\u00e9 un nouveau proc\u00e8s.\nLa Couronne se pourvoit de plein droit devant notre Cour.\nLa Cour est majoritairement d\u2019avis que l\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9, essentiellement pour les motifs expos\u00e9s par les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel de la cour martiale. Le juge militaire a \u00e9valu\u00e9 la preuve de mani\u00e8re approfondie et cumulative. Il ressort du jugement dans son ensemble que ce dernier n\u2019a pas adopt\u00e9 une approche fragmentaire ou \u00e9troite \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la preuve. De plus, nous ne sommes pas convaincus qu\u2019il a appliqu\u00e9 les mauvais principes juridiques. Bien que nous soyons d\u2019accord avec tous les juges de la Cour d\u2019appel de la cour martiale pour dire que le juge militaire s\u2019est livr\u00e9 \u00e0 des conjectures inappropri\u00e9es, nous partageons l\u2019opinion des juges majoritaires portant que les commentaires en question n\u2019ont pas min\u00e9 les conclusions fondamentales de ce dernier.\nPour sa part, la juge O\u2019Bonsawin accueillerait l\u2019appel pour les motifs expos\u00e9s par la juge McVeigh, aux par. 39\u201190 et 119\u2011126 (CanLII). En cons\u00e9quence, l\u2019appel est rejet\u00e9.\nC.J.C.\nJ.C.C.",

Comme l\u2019envisageait l\u2019entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale, la VGFN a adopt\u00e9 sa propre constitution, qui reconna\u00eet \u00e0 ses citoyens certains droits et libert\u00e9s et \u00e9nonce des r\u00e8gles concernant l\u2019organisation de son gouvernement, ainsi que des r\u00e8gles et des normes \u00e9lectorales. La Constitution de la VGFN pr\u00e9voit notamment une obligation de r\u00e9sidence aux termes de laquelle le chef et les conseillers doivent tous r\u00e9sider sur les terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es de la VGFN, dans le village d\u2019Old Crow \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur du territoire traditionnel des Vuntut Gwitchin, ou y d\u00e9m\u00e9nager dans les 14 jours suivant leur \u00e9lection.\nD, citoyenne canadienne et citoyenne de la VGFN, vit actuellement \u00e0 Whitehorse, la capitale du Yukon, \u00e0 environ 800 kilom\u00e8tres au sud d\u2019Old Crow. D souhaite se porter candidate au poste de conseill\u00e8re de la VGFN, mais affirme qu\u2019elle ne peut pas d\u00e9m\u00e9nager \u00e0 Old Crow si elle est \u00e9lue, principalement parce que son fils a besoin de soins m\u00e9dicaux qui n\u2019y sont pas offerts. D a contest\u00e9 l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence, plaidant qu\u2019elle viole de mani\u00e8re injustifiable le droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 qui lui est garanti par le par. 15(1) de la Charte. La VGFN a r\u00e9torqu\u00e9 que l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence refl\u00e8te sa pratique de longue date voulant que son chef et ses conseillers vivent sur le territoire traditionnel des Vuntut Gwitchin. La VGFN a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019en tant que premi\u00e8re nation autonome, elle est soustraite \u00e0 l\u2019application de la Charte. \u00c0 titre subsidiaire, elle a fait valoir que, si la Charte s\u2019applique, l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence ne viole pas le droit de D \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9, et que, m\u00eame si c\u2019\u00e9tait le cas, l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence est n\u00e9anmoins valide car elle est prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par l\u2019art. 25 de la Charte, qui, au dire de la VGFN, maintient certains droits et libert\u00e9s collectifs des peuples autochtones lorsque ces droits collectifs entrent en conflit avec des droits garantis \u00e0 un particulier par la Charte. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance et la Cour d\u2019appel ont tous deux jug\u00e9 que la Charte s\u2019applique \u00e0 la VGFN et \u00e0 sa Constitution selon le par. 32(1) de la Charte, et ont conclu que, s\u2019il y a violation du droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 garanti \u00e0 D par le par. 15(1), l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence est prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par l\u2019art. 25 de la Charte. D interjette appel sur la question de la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence, et la VGFN forme un appel incident sur la question de l\u2019application de la Charte.\nArr\u00eat (le juge Rowe est dissident quant au pourvoi incident, les juges Martin et O\u2019Bonsawin sont dissidentes quant au pourvoi) : Le pourvoi et le pourvoi incident sont rejet\u00e9s.\nLe juge en chef Wagner et les juges C\u00f4t\u00e9, Kasirer et Jamal : La Charte s\u2019applique \u00e0 la VGFN et \u00e0 ses citoyens comme D, principalement parce que la VGFN est un gouvernement par nature selon le par. 32(1) de la Charte. En outre, D a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence constitue une violation \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue du droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 qui lui est garanti par le par. 15(1) de la Charte. Cependant, l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence est l\u2019exercice d\u2019un \u00ab autre \u00bb \u00ab droit ou libert\u00e9 \u00bb des peuples autochtones du Canada vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25 de la Charte. L\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence prot\u00e8ge la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone \u2014 \u00e0 savoir les int\u00e9r\u00eats li\u00e9s \u00e0 la diff\u00e9rence culturelle autochtone, \u00e0 l\u2019occupation ant\u00e9rieure des Autochtones, \u00e0 la souverainet\u00e9 autochtone ant\u00e9rieure ou encore \u00e0 la participation des Autochtones au processus de n\u00e9gociation de trait\u00e9s. La demande de D fond\u00e9e sur le par. 15(1) porte atteinte \u00e0 ce droit, avec lequel elle est en conflit irr\u00e9conciliable; en cons\u00e9quence, suivant l\u2019art. 25, il ne peut \u00eatre donn\u00e9 effet \u00e0 la demande de D fond\u00e9e sur le par. 15(1).\nL\u2019application de la Charte est trait\u00e9e au par. 32(1), qui \u00e9num\u00e8re certaines entit\u00e9s auxquelles la Charte s\u2019applique, dont la l\u00e9gislature et le gouvernement de chaque province pour les domaines de comp\u00e9tence provinciale, de m\u00eame que le Parlement et le gouvernement du Canada pour les domaines de comp\u00e9tence f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, y compris ceux qui concernent les gouvernements territoriaux et les domaines relevant de leur comp\u00e9tence. Le paragraphe 32(1) envisage en outre explicitement la possibilit\u00e9 que la Charte s\u2019applique \u00e0 d\u2019autres entit\u00e9s, y compris celles faisant l\u2019objet d\u2019un contr\u00f4le gouvernemental ou ex\u00e9cutant des fonctions v\u00e9ritablement gouvernementales. Ces entit\u00e9s peuvent \u00eatre assujetties \u00e0 la Charte de l\u2019une de deux mani\u00e8res, comme l\u2019explique l\u2019arr\u00eat Eldridge c. Colombie\u2011Britannique (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), [1997] 3 R.C.S. 624. Premi\u00e8rement, une entit\u00e9 peut \u00eatre jug\u00e9e faire partie du \u00ab gouvernement \u00bb pour l\u2019application du par. 32(1) si elle peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme un gouvernement de par sa nature m\u00eame ou en raison du degr\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le gouvernemental exerc\u00e9 sur elle. En pareil cas, toutes les activit\u00e9s de l\u2019entit\u00e9 sont assujetties \u00e0 la Charte. Deuxi\u00e8mement, m\u00eame si l\u2019entit\u00e9 elle\u2011m\u00eame ne fait pas partie du \u00ab gouvernement \u00bb pour l\u2019application du par. 32(1), elle sera assujettie \u00e0 la Charte pour ce qui est de ses activit\u00e9s qui peuvent \u00eatre attribu\u00e9es \u00e0 un gouvernement parce qu\u2019elles sont de nature gouvernementale. Le Parlement et les provinces ne peuvent se soustraire aux obligations qui d\u00e9coulent de la Charte en conf\u00e9rant une partie de leurs responsabilit\u00e9s ou de leurs pouvoirs l\u00e9gislatifs \u00e0 d\u2019autres entit\u00e9s qui ne sont pas normalement assujetties \u00e0 la Charte.\nPour ce qui est du crit\u00e8re \u00ab par nature \u00bb du premier volet du cadre d\u2019analyse de l\u2019arr\u00eat Eldridge, des entit\u00e9s peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme des gouvernements par nature lorsqu\u2019elles pr\u00e9sentent habituellement les caract\u00e9ristiques suivantes, qui ne sont ni essentielles ni d\u00e9terminantes, mais qui constituent des indices utiles \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard : (1) elles sont \u00e9lues d\u00e9mocratiquement par les citoyens et doivent leur rendre compte; (2) elles jouissent d\u2019un pouvoir g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de taxation qui ne se distingue pas des pouvoirs de taxation qu\u2019exercent le Parlement ou les provinces; (3) elles ont le pouvoir d\u2019\u00e9tablir des r\u00e8gles de droit, de les appliquer et de les faire respecter dans les limites d\u2019un territoire donn\u00e9; et (4) elles sont des cr\u00e9atures du Parlement ou des provinces, et exercent des pouvoirs que le Parlement ou les provinces devraient autrement exercer. Quant au crit\u00e8re relatif au \u00ab contr\u00f4le \u00bb du premier volet, la Charte s\u2019applique \u00e0 une entit\u00e9 que le Parlement ou les provinces investissent de pouvoirs gouvernementaux relevant de leur comp\u00e9tence, si le Parlement ou la province en question exerce un contr\u00f4le substantiel sur les activit\u00e9s de l\u2019entit\u00e9. Dans de telles circonstances, l\u2019entit\u00e9 ne peut pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une entit\u00e9 ind\u00e9pendante du gouvernement au sens du par. 32(1) de la Charte.\nSuivant le second volet du cadre d\u2019analyse \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Eldridge, la Cour a d\u00e9j\u00e0 reconnu que les activit\u00e9s d\u2019une entit\u00e9 sont assujetties \u00e0 la Charte dans les cas o\u00f9 l\u2019entit\u00e9 : exer\u00e7ait le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire que lui conf\u00e9rait une loi du gouvernement de d\u00e9finir la fa\u00e7on de fournir les services; avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e par une loi et accomplissait tous les actes en cause en vertu du pouvoir que lui conf\u00e9rait la loi; ou mettait en \u0153uvre un programme gouvernemental particulier et exer\u00e7ait des pouvoirs de contrainte \u00e9manant de la loi. Dans de telles circonstances, une entit\u00e9 ne peut pas \u00e9chapper \u00e0 un examen fond\u00e9 sur la Charte du seul fait qu\u2019elle ne fait pas partie du gouvernement ou qu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas sous son contr\u00f4le. M\u00eame si une entit\u00e9 est par ailleurs ind\u00e9pendante du gouvernement, l\u2019existence d\u2019un pouvoir de contrainte d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 par la loi signifie que cette entit\u00e9 d\u00e9tient un pouvoir coercitif de gouvernance que les personnes physiques, les personnes morales ou les organisations ne poss\u00e8dent pas. C\u2019est ce pouvoir qui fait en sorte que les organismes exer\u00e7ant un pouvoir conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par une loi sont assujettis \u00e0 la Charte.\nEn l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la Charte s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence inscrite dans la Constitution de la VGFN parce que cette derni\u00e8re est un gouvernement par nature selon le premier volet du cadre d\u2019analyse de l\u2019arr\u00eat Eldridge. Bien que la VGFN ne constitue pas un gouvernement selon le crit\u00e8re relatif au \u00ab contr\u00f4le \u00bb du premier volet puisque ni le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ni celui du Yukon n\u2019exercent un contr\u00f4le substantiel sur elle, en tant que gouvernement autochtone, la VGFN pr\u00e9sente les indices repr\u00e9sentatifs d\u2019un gouvernement par nature : le Conseil de la VGFN est form\u00e9 de membres qui sont \u00e9lus par les \u00e9lecteurs admissibles de la VGFN et qui sont d\u00e9mocratiquement responsables devant l\u2019\u00e9lectorat, \u00e0 l\u2019instar des d\u00e9put\u00e9s f\u00e9d\u00e9raux et provinciaux; la VGFN dispose de pouvoirs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de taxation qui sont pratiquement identiques \u00e0 ceux du Parlement ou des provinces; \u00e0 l\u2019instar du Parlement et des l\u00e9gislatures provinciales, la VGFN a le pouvoir d\u2019\u00e9tablir, d\u2019appliquer et de faire respecter des r\u00e8gles de droit contraignantes pour ses citoyens et le public en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral dans les limites de ses terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es; et le pouvoir de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer de la VGFN \u00e9mane au moins en partie du Parlement, en ce sens que la VGFN exerce des pouvoirs que le Parlement aurait autrement exerc\u00e9s en vertu de sa comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative.\nDe plus, la Charte s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence parce que son \u00e9diction et son application par la VGFN constituent une activit\u00e9 gouvernementale pr\u00e9cise. L\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence inscrite dans la Constitution de la VGFN a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e au moins en partie en vertu d\u2019une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (m\u00eame en supposant qu\u2019elle refl\u00e8te aussi l\u2019exercice d\u2019un droit inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale). Elle implique l\u2019exercice d\u2019un pouvoir de contrainte pr\u00e9vu par la loi, car elle impose des restrictions juridiques aux personnes susceptibles de servir comme chef ou conseiller de la VGFN. L\u2019obligation a force de loi parce qu\u2019elle fait partie de la Constitution de la VGFN, adopt\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale de la VGFN, qui a elle\u2011m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9e et s\u2019est vu donner effet par les lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et territoriale de mise en \u0153uvre.\n\u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que la Charte s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence impos\u00e9e par la VGFN, il est n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9terminer si cette obligation viole de mani\u00e8re injustifiable le par. 15(1) de la Charte en interdisant \u00e0 D de si\u00e9ger au Conseil de la VGFN \u00e0 moins qu\u2019elle ne d\u00e9m\u00e9nage de Whitehorse \u00e0 Old Crow dans les 14 jours suivant son \u00e9lection. Cette question requiert l\u2019examen du cadre d\u2019analyse permettant de d\u00e9terminer si, interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 ad\u00e9quatement, le droit garanti \u00e0 D par le par. 15(1) de la Charte porte atteinte \u00e0 des \u00ab droits ou libert\u00e9s \u2014 ancestraux, issus de trait\u00e9s ou autres \u2014 des peuples autochtones du Canada \u00bb vis\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25 de la Charte. Pour les communaut\u00e9s autochtones, le par. 32(1) et l\u2019art. 25 de la Charte sont \u00e9troitement li\u00e9s. Bien que l\u2019application de droits individuels garantis par la Charte \u00e0 une communaut\u00e9 autochtone autonome puisse \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme g\u00eanant l\u2019application de r\u00e8gles destin\u00e9es \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger les droits et les int\u00e9r\u00eats des minorit\u00e9s autochtones, l\u2019art. 25 agit comme contrepoids en assurant la protection des int\u00e9r\u00eats autochtones collectifs en tant que bienfait social et constitutionnel \u00e0 l\u2019avantage de l\u2019ensemble des Canadiens. Interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 correctement, l\u2019art. 25 permet l\u2019affirmation des droits individuels garantis par la Charte, sauf lorsqu\u2019ils entrent en conflit avec des droits ou libert\u00e9s \u2014 ancestraux, issus de trait\u00e9s ou autres \u2014 qui, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9, prot\u00e8gent la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone.\nL\u2019article 25 doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9 \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de son objet, en tenant d\u00fbment compte de son texte, de la nature et de l\u2019objectif plus large de la Charte, ainsi que de l\u2019historique de cette disposition. L\u2019objet de l\u2019art. 25 est de faire respecter certains droits et libert\u00e9s collectifs des peuples autochtones lorsque ces droits collectifs entrent en conflit avec des droits garantis \u00e0 un particulier par la Charte, c.\u2011\u00e0\u2011d. de veiller \u00e0 ce que les droits et libert\u00e9s d\u00e9sign\u00e9s des peuples autochtones soient prot\u00e9g\u00e9s lorsque le fait de donner effet \u00e0 des droits et libert\u00e9s individuels oppos\u00e9s et garantis par la Charte diminuerait la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone. Lorsqu\u2019un droit garanti \u00e0 un particulier par la Charte porterait atteinte \u00e0 un droit ancestral, issu de trait\u00e9s ou autre, l\u2019art. 25 exige que le droit autochtone collectif ait pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance, m\u00eame si le demandeur invoquant la Charte est un membre du groupe autochtone concern\u00e9. Cet objet s\u2019harmonise avec les objectifs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de l\u2019art. 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982, en plus d\u2019\u00eatre en phase avec le besoin de concilier la souverainet\u00e9 de la Couronne avec la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 selon laquelle les peuples autochtones vivaient en Am\u00e9rique du Nord, dans des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s distinctes dot\u00e9es de lois, traditions et coutumes, bien avant le contact avec les Europ\u00e9ens. L\u2019article 25 se fait l\u2019\u00e9cho de la volont\u00e9 de concilier les droits et libert\u00e9s individuels garantis par la Charte \u00e0 tous les Canadiens avec les droits collectifs distinctifs des peuples autochtones.\nLe texte de l\u2019art. 25 mentionne les \u00ab droits ou libert\u00e9s \u2014 ancestraux, issus de trait\u00e9s ou autres \u00bb. Les droits ancestraux et issus de trait\u00e9s sont prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par l\u2019art. 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982. En incluant les \u00ab autres \u00bb droits et libert\u00e9s parmi ceux m\u00e9ritant la protection constitutionnelle, l\u2019art. 25 \u00e9voque un \u00e9ventail plus large de droits que l\u2019art. 35. Il ressort clairement du texte et de l\u2019objet de l\u2019art. 25 que les protections pr\u00e9vues par cette disposition ne se limitent pas aux droits qui poss\u00e8dent un statut constitutionnel. Le texte et l\u2019objet de l\u2019art. 25 sugg\u00e8rent toutefois l\u2019existence d\u2019une autre restriction substantielle : conform\u00e9ment au principe de protection des peuples autochtones en tant que minorit\u00e9 distincte, et puisque l\u2019art. 25 visait \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger les droits associ\u00e9s \u00e0 la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone, les \u00ab autres \u00bb droits et libert\u00e9s vis\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25 se limitent aux droits et libert\u00e9s qui prot\u00e8gent la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone.\nLa protection des droits \u2014 ancestraux, issus de trait\u00e9s ou autres \u2014 vis\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25 n\u2019est toutefois pas absolue. Lorsqu\u2019il est d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019un droit rel\u00e8ve du champ d\u2019application de l\u2019art. 25, les protections pr\u00e9vues par celui\u2011ci ne s\u2019appliquent pas automatiquement. Ces protections s\u2019appliquent uniquement s\u2019il est jug\u00e9 qu\u2019il existe un conflit irr\u00e9conciliable entre le droit garanti par la Charte qui est revendiqu\u00e9 et le droit vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25, de telle sorte qu\u2019en donnant effet au droit garanti par la Charte, la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone prot\u00e9g\u00e9e ou reconnue par le droit collectif serait min\u00e9e. Il est possible, dans une affaire donn\u00e9e, que le droit individuel ainsi que les droits collectifs vis\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25 ne soient pas r\u00e9ellement en conflit. Certains droits individuels font partie du droit autochtone et coexistent avec les int\u00e9r\u00eats collectifs. En outre, l\u2019art. 25 ne s\u2019appliquerait pas si le droit individuel en question garanti par la Charte entrait en conflit avec un droit autochtone qui ne repose pas sur la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone. Et, tout comme les droits reconnus \u00e0 l\u2019art. 35, la primaut\u00e9 accord\u00e9e aux droits collectifs vis\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25 est assujettie \u00e0 la garantie d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 reconnue aux \u00ab personnes des deux sexes \u00bb par l\u2019art. 28 de la Charte et le par. 35(4) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982.\nIl existe un large consensus voulant que l\u2019art. 25 ne cr\u00e9e pas de nouveaux droits substantiels. Cependant, les d\u00e9tails de l\u2019application de l\u2019art. 25 demeurent dans une large mesure incertains. Deux approches oppos\u00e9es en ce qui concerne l\u2019effet de l\u2019art. 25 ressortent de la jurisprudence \u2014 suivant la premi\u00e8re, l\u2019effet de \u00ab bouclier \u00bb, le fait d\u2019invoquer avec succ\u00e8s l\u2019art. 25 fait obstacle \u00e0 une revendication fond\u00e9e sur la Charte dans les cas o\u00f9 l\u2019application d\u2019un droit garanti par la Charte porterait atteinte au droit vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25; suivant la seconde, l\u2019effet de \u00ab prisme interpr\u00e9tatif \u00bb ou de r\u00e8gle d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation, les tribunaux tentent d\u2019abord d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter le droit garanti par la Charte qui est revendiqu\u00e9 et de lui donner effet sans porter atteinte au droit identifi\u00e9 vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25. Selon la derni\u00e8re approche, en cas de conflit, le droit ancestral, issu de trait\u00e9 ou autre ne se verrait accorder aucune priorit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale, et la question de savoir si le droit autochtone collectif devrait \u00eatre maintenu serait laiss\u00e9e \u00e0 la discr\u00e9tion du tribunal, qui la trancherait au cas par cas.\nL\u2019approche qu\u2019il convient d\u2019adopter \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019art. 25 inclut des \u00e9l\u00e9ments tir\u00e9s des deux approches. Il est possible d\u2019affirmer que l\u2019art. 25 produit un effet de bouclier, en ce qu\u2019il donne la primaut\u00e9 aux droits ancestraux, issus de trait\u00e9s ou autres. Toutefois, un droit relevant du champ d\u2019application de l\u2019art. 25 se voit accorder la priorit\u00e9 uniquement si un exercice interpr\u00e9tatif d\u00e9montre qu\u2019il existe un conflit irr\u00e9conciliable entre le droit collectif et le droit individuel garanti par la Charte qui est revendiqu\u00e9. Bien que la disposition serve parfois de bouclier au profit des droits ancestraux, issus de trait\u00e9s et autres afin de prot\u00e9ger l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat collectif minoritaire des peuples autochtones, une conception absolutiste de l\u2019art. 25 est incompatible avec une interpr\u00e9tation t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique. Elle s\u2019oppose aussi \u00e0 l\u2019id\u00e9e que, dans les cultures juridiques autochtones, tout comme en droit constitutionnel canadien, les droits individuels et les droits collectifs sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme coexistant en harmonie.\nQuant au genre de conflit qui doit \u00eatre d\u00e9montr\u00e9 entre les droits collectifs et les droits individuels concern\u00e9s pour que le bouclier de l\u2019art. 25 op\u00e8re, le conflit entre les droits doit \u00eatre r\u00e9el et irr\u00e9conciliable, de sorte qu\u2019il est impossible de donner effet au droit individuel garanti par la Charte sans porter atteinte au droit relevant de l\u2019art. 25. Le conflit ne saurait \u00eatre hypoth\u00e9tique. L\u2019exigence requ\u00e9rant l\u2019existence d\u2019un conflit irr\u00e9conciliable entre les deux droits s\u2019accorde mieux avec l\u2019objet et le texte de l\u2019art. 25, parce que s\u2019il est possible pour les tribunaux, au moyen d\u2019une interpr\u00e9tation juste et minutieuse, de donner effet au droit garanti par la Charte et au droit vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25 identifi\u00e9, alors les deux droits sont respect\u00e9s, et le conflit \u00e9vit\u00e9. D\u00e9terminer s\u2019il existe un conflit irr\u00e9conciliable entre les droits en cause constitue un exercice interpr\u00e9tatif. Cet exercice requiert que les tribunaux interpr\u00e8tent tant la substance du droit garanti par la Charte que celle du droit ancestral, issu de trait\u00e9 ou autre en cause. Ils doivent prendre en compte et respecter les points de vue autochtones. En m\u00eame temps, les tribunaux doivent veiller \u00e0 ne pas s\u2019\u00e9carter de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation g\u00e9n\u00e9reuse des droits et libert\u00e9s individuels garantis par la Charte prescrite par la jurisprudence applicable.\nEn cons\u00e9quence, l\u2019art. 25 ne sert pas de bouclier chaque fois qu\u2019un droit relevant de son champ d\u2019application est en cause. Lorsqu\u2019un droit garanti par la Charte est en jeu par suite de l\u2019exercice d\u2019un droit ancestral, issu de trait\u00e9 ou autre, le tribunal doit plut\u00f4t se demander si ces deux droits peuvent \u00eatre concili\u00e9s. Si le fait de donner effet \u00e0 un droit garanti par la Charte influerait seulement de mani\u00e8re accessoire ou non essentielle sur le droit particulier vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25 \u2014 en ce que cela ne minerait pas la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone \u2014, ou si le droit garanti par la Charte peut \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019une mani\u00e8re compatible avec le droit ancestral, issu de trait\u00e9 ou autre, il serait alors inappropri\u00e9 de donner la priorit\u00e9 au droit relevant du champ d\u2019application de l\u2019art. 25. C\u2019est uniquement dans les cas o\u00f9 le droit vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25 est affect\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re non accessoire, cr\u00e9ant ainsi un conflit irr\u00e9conciliable entre les deux droits, que l\u2019art. 25 prot\u00e9gera le droit autochtone en rendant le droit individuel inop\u00e9rant dans la mesure du conflit. En ce sens, l\u2019art. 25 jouera parfois le r\u00f4le de bouclier et, d\u2019autres fois, il jouera simplement un r\u00f4le interpr\u00e9tatif.\nComme l\u2019art. 25 vise \u00e0 sauvegarder les droits ancestraux, issus de trait\u00e9s ou autres qui tendent \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone, l\u2019art. 25 s\u2019attache principalement aux droits collectifs, ind\u00e9pendamment de l\u2019identit\u00e9 de l\u2019individu ou de l\u2019entit\u00e9 qui pr\u00e9sente la contestation fond\u00e9e sur la Charte. Il s\u2019ensuit que le m\u00eame cadre d\u2019analyse s\u2019applique, et ce, que le demandeur invoquant la Charte soit autochtone, que l\u2019art. 25 soit invoqu\u00e9 par un groupe autochtone ou que les deux parties soient autochtones. Le bouclier de l\u2019art. 25 s\u2019applique imm\u00e9diatement si le droit garanti par la Charte qui est invoqu\u00e9 porte atteinte \u00e0 un droit collectif vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25, quelles que soient les parties en cause. Rien dans le texte de l\u2019art. 25 ne permet de conclure que le bouclier protecteur devrait s\u2019appliquer diff\u00e9remment selon l\u2019identit\u00e9 des parties. Une grande prudence s\u2019impose toutefois lorsque la revendication est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par une personne autochtone contre sa propre communaut\u00e9; le tribunal devrait proc\u00e9der avec prudence afin d\u2019\u00e9viter d\u2019imposer inutilement ou involontairement des notions ou des principes juridiques incompatibles au r\u00e9gime juridique autochtone distinct de la communaut\u00e9.\nEnfin, si l\u2019art. 25 est invoqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019une revendication fond\u00e9e sur la Charte, le tribunal devrait envisager de l\u2019appliquer le plus t\u00f4t possible, sans porter ind\u00fbment pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 la contestation fond\u00e9e sur le droit individuel garanti par la Charte. Vu les int\u00e9r\u00eats oppos\u00e9s qui doivent \u00eatre pris en compte dans le cadre d\u2019analyse de l\u2019art. 25, le point le plus h\u00e2tif o\u00f9 cette disposition pourrait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 bon droit est une fois que le demandeur qui invoque la Charte a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 une violation \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue de son droit. Lorsque des droits ou libert\u00e9s \u2014 ancestraux, issus de trait\u00e9s ou autres \u2014 pr\u00e9cis\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25 sont en jeu, les limites d\u2019un droit individuel concurrent garanti par la Charte n\u2019ont pas \u00e0 \u00eatre justifi\u00e9es en application de l\u2019article premier de la Charte. Contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019article premier, l\u2019art. 25 est l\u2019expression du choix constitutionnel de prot\u00e9ger les droits et libert\u00e9s collectifs des peuples autochtones au Canada en tant que minorit\u00e9 distincte. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 une longue tradition de respect des minorit\u00e9s, l\u2019art. 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 prot\u00e8ge les droits existants \u2014 ancestraux ou issus de trait\u00e9s \u2014, tandis que l\u2019art. 25 de la Charte \u00e9nonce de mani\u00e8re semblable une clause de non\u2011atteinte aux droits des peuples autochtones. La protection de l\u2019art. 25 est rattach\u00e9e \u00e0 la force de la promesse faite envers les peuples autochtones du Canada \u00e0 l\u2019art. 35, promesse qui reconnaissait non seulement l\u2019occupation pass\u00e9e de terres par les Autochtones, mais aussi leur contribution \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9dification du Canada et les engagements sp\u00e9ciaux pris envers eux par des gouvernements successifs. Toute justification au regard de l\u2019article premier ne devrait \u00eatre exig\u00e9e que si le tribunal juge l\u2019art. 25 inapplicable. C\u2019est le cas lorsqu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de droit ancestral, issu de trait\u00e9 ou \u00ab autre \u00bb en jeu, lorsque l\u2019\u00ab autre \u00bb droit ne fait pas intervenir la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone, ou lorsqu\u2019il n\u2019existe pas de conflit irr\u00e9conciliable entre les droits en cause. Dans de telles circonstances, la partie qui d\u00e9fend l\u2019acte contest\u00e9 peut toujours chercher \u00e0 justifier la restriction en vertu de l\u2019article premier de la Charte.\nLe cadre d\u2019analyse pour l\u2019application de l\u2019art. 25 comporte donc quatre \u00e9tapes. Premi\u00e8rement, le demandeur qui invoque la Charte doit d\u00e9montrer que la conduite contest\u00e9e viole \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue un droit individuel garanti par la Charte. Si aucune violation \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue n\u2019est \u00e9tablie, alors la revendication bas\u00e9e sur la Charte \u00e9choue, et il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de passer \u00e0 l\u2019examen fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019art. 25. Deuxi\u00e8mement, la partie qui invoque l\u2019art. 25 \u2014 habituellement la partie qui se fonde sur un int\u00e9r\u00eat collectif de la minorit\u00e9 \u2014 doit convaincre le tribunal que la conduite contest\u00e9e est un droit, ou l\u2019exercice d\u2019un droit, prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par l\u2019art. 25. Il lui incombe de d\u00e9montrer que le droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard duquel elle r\u00e9clame la protection de l\u2019art. 25 est un droit ancestral, issu de trait\u00e9 ou autre. Si le droit en cause fait partie des \u00ab autres \u00bb droits, alors la partie qui l\u2019invoque doit d\u00e9montrer l\u2019existence du droit revendiqu\u00e9 et le fait que ce droit prot\u00e8ge ou reconna\u00eet la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone. Troisi\u00e8mement, la partie qui invoque l\u2019art. 25 doit d\u00e9montrer l\u2019existence d\u2019un conflit irr\u00e9conciliable entre le droit garanti par la Charte et le droit ancestral, issu de trait\u00e9 ou autre, ou l\u2019exercice de ce droit. Si les droits sont irr\u00e9conciliablement en conflit, l\u2019art. 25 agira comme bouclier afin de prot\u00e9ger la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone. Quatri\u00e8mement, le tribunal doit se demander s\u2019il existe quelque limite applicable \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat collectif invoqu\u00e9. Si l\u2019art. 25 est jug\u00e9 inapplicable, la partie qui l\u2019invoque peut d\u00e9montrer que l\u2019acte contest\u00e9 est justifi\u00e9 au regard de l\u2019article premier de la Charte.\nSi l\u2019on applique cette analyse dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, premi\u00e8rement, le droit garanti \u00e0 D par le par. 15(1) de la Charte a \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9 \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue par l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence, laquelle a cr\u00e9\u00e9 une distinction fond\u00e9e sur le motif analogue que constitue le statut de non\u2011r\u00e9sident dans une communaut\u00e9 autochtone autonome, et cette distinction a renforc\u00e9 et accentu\u00e9 le d\u00e9savantage que subit D en tant que membre non r\u00e9sident de la VGFN. En ce qui concerne la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur le par. 15(1), le statut de non\u2011r\u00e9sident de D dans une communaut\u00e9 autochtone autonome constitue un motif analogue. Le d\u00e9savantage historique et continu que subissent les Autochtones vivant \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de leurs terres traditionnelles signifie que les distinctions fond\u00e9es sur ce statut constituent des indicateurs permanents de l\u2019existence d\u2019un processus d\u00e9cisionnel suspect ou de discrimination potentielle. Quant \u00e0 la seconde \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur le par. 15(1), l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence, qui \u00e9tablit une distinction sur la base du statut de non\u2011r\u00e9sident dans une communaut\u00e9 autochtone autonome, renforce, perp\u00e9tue ou accentue le d\u00e9savantage subi par D en tant que citoyenne de la VGFN non r\u00e9sidente.\nDeuxi\u00e8mement, la VGFN a \u00e9tabli que l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence pr\u00e9vue dans sa Constitution est l\u2019exercice d\u2019un droit ancestral, issu de trait\u00e9 ou autre vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25. Il s\u2019agit de l\u2019exercice d\u2019un \u00ab autre \u00bb droit, \u00e0 savoir celui d\u2019\u00e9noncer des crit\u00e8res de participation au corps dirigeant de la VGFN. \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de la preuve et des conclusions de fait en premi\u00e8re instance, l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence est clairement l\u2019exercice d\u2019un droit qui prot\u00e8ge des int\u00e9r\u00eats associ\u00e9s \u00e0 la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone. Le droit de d\u00e9finir la composition de ses corps dirigeants sur la base de restrictions fond\u00e9es sur le lieu de r\u00e9sidence permet \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Vuntut Gwitchin de pr\u00e9server l\u2019insistance particuli\u00e8re qu\u2019elle accorde au lien entre ses dirigeants et le territoire. Il s\u2019agit clairement d\u2019un fondement permettant d\u2019\u00e9tablir un lien entre la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone et l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence. Obliger les dirigeants de la VGFN \u00e0 r\u00e9sider sur les terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es aide \u00e0 pr\u00e9server le lien entre les dirigeants et le territoire, qui est profond\u00e9ment ancr\u00e9 dans la culture et les pratiques de gouvernance distinctives de la VGFN. Cela renforce aussi la capacit\u00e9 de la VGFN de r\u00e9sister aux forces ext\u00e9rieures qui attirent les citoyens loin de ses terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es, en plus de pr\u00e9venir l\u2019\u00e9rosion de leur important lien avec le territoire. De tels int\u00e9r\u00eats sont associ\u00e9s \u00e0 divers aspects de la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone.\nTroisi\u00e8mement, la VGFN a \u00e9tabli que, interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 ad\u00e9quatement, son droit vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25 et le droit garanti \u00e0 D par le par. 15(1) sont irr\u00e9conciliablement en conflit. L\u2019application du par. 15(1) porterait atteinte au droit des Vuntut Gwitchin de se gouverner eux\u2011m\u00eames conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 leurs propres valeurs et traditions particuli\u00e8res et conform\u00e9ment aux arrangements en mati\u00e8re d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale conclus avec le Canada et le Yukon. La sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence est inextricablement rattach\u00e9e au lien entre la VGFN et les terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es. Le fait de permettre \u00e0 un conseiller de r\u00e9sider \u00e0 Whitehorse diminuerait ce lien de mani\u00e8re inacceptable et minerait, de mani\u00e8re non accessoire, le droit de la VGFN de d\u00e9cider qui peut \u00eatre membre de ses corps dirigeants. Donner effet de cette mani\u00e8re au droit garanti par la Charte \u00e0 D repr\u00e9senterait un v\u00e9ritable risque pour la vitalit\u00e9 durable de la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone et porterait atteinte au droit de la VGFN, en contravention de l\u2019art. 25. Cela entra\u00eene l\u2019application de l\u2019art. 25 en tant que bouclier protecteur, mettant ainsi le droit collectif \u00e0 l\u2019abri de la revendication individuelle fond\u00e9e sur la Charte.\nQuatri\u00e8mement, bien que les protections de l\u2019art. 25 puissent \u00eatre assorties d\u2019autres limites, aucune restriction de la sorte n\u2019est pertinente pour le pr\u00e9sent litige. La Cour d\u2019appel a conclu que les protections de l\u2019art. 25 s\u2019\u00e9tendaient \u00e0 tous les aspects de l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence, y compris la r\u00e8gle du d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement dans les 14 jours, et D n\u2019a demand\u00e9 aucune r\u00e9paration \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cette r\u00e8gle, ni pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d\u2019arguments sur la question du retranchement. Enfin, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que l\u2019art. 25 s\u2019applique, la VGFN n\u2019est pas tenue de justifier l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence en vertu de l\u2019article premier de la Charte.\nLes juges Martin et O\u2019Bonsawin (dissidentes quant au pourvoi) : Il y a lieu d\u2019accueillir le pourvoi et de rejeter le pourvoi incident, et l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence devrait \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9e inop\u00e9rante. Il y a accord avec les juges majoritaires pour dire que la Charte s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence attaqu\u00e9e, que la VGFN est un gouvernement de par sa nature m\u00eame, et que l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence porte atteinte au droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 que garantit \u00e0 D le par. 15(1) de la Charte. Il y a toutefois d\u00e9saccord avec les juges majoritaires pour dire que l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence rel\u00e8ve du champ d\u2019application de l\u2019art. 25 de la Charte. Au contraire, comme elle ne vise pas \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre le statut sp\u00e9cial de groupes autochtones au sein de l\u2019\u00c9tat canadien au sens large, l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence \u00e9chappe \u00e0 la protection de l\u2019art. 25. De plus, la justification de l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence ne peut se d\u00e9montrer conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article premier de la Charte.\nLa Charte s\u2019applique aux mesures gouvernementales prises par des nations autochtones autonomes \u00e0 la fois parce qu\u2019elles sont de nature gouvernementale et que l\u2019objet du par. 32(1) \u00e9tait d\u2019\u00e9tendre les protections de la Charte pour rem\u00e9dier au d\u00e9s\u00e9quilibre des forces entre les gouvern\u00e9s et les gouvernants. L\u2019objet qui sous\u2011tend le champ d\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 de la Charte est donc de rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 ce d\u00e9s\u00e9quilibre des forces en soumettant l\u2019action gouvernementale au contr\u00f4le constitutionnel afin de prot\u00e9ger les droits et libert\u00e9s individuels. Le paragraphe 32(1) englobe l\u2019action gouvernementale \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des \u00ab domaines relevant \u00bb du Parlement et des l\u00e9gislatures provinciales : toute action gouvernementale de ce genre est assujettie \u00e0 un examen fond\u00e9 sur la Charte. Tous les ordres de gouvernement sont vis\u00e9s, quel que soit leur lien avec la structure gouvernementale f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ou provinciale officielle. Cette port\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du par. 32(1) trouve appui dans la jurisprudence de la Cour sur le par. 32(1), o\u00f9 cette derni\u00e8re a toujours confirm\u00e9 la vaste gamme d\u2019entit\u00e9s vis\u00e9es par la disposition et reconnu l\u2019importance du d\u00e9s\u00e9quilibre des forces entre les gouvern\u00e9s et les gouvernants lorsque vient le temps de d\u00e9cider si une entit\u00e9 est vis\u00e9e par le par. 32(1). La port\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du par. 32(1) trouve \u00e9galement appui dans d\u2019autres dispositions de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982, par exemple le par. 52(1) et l\u2019art. 25, qui fournissent des rep\u00e8res sur la mani\u00e8re dont toute interpr\u00e9tation particuli\u00e8re du par. 32(1) s\u2019harmoniserait avec l\u2019architecture interne de la Constitution du Canada.\nLa Charte s\u2019applique donc aux gouvernements autochtones parce qu\u2019ils disposent d\u2019un pouvoir de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer sur des mati\u00e8res l\u00e9gislatives vis\u00e9es par le par. 32(1). Cette reconnaissance de nations autochtones autonomes en tant que gouvernements \u00e0 part enti\u00e8re, et non en raison d\u2019un pouvoir d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9, rel\u00e8ve clairement de l\u2019objet et de la port\u00e9e du par. 32(1). La jurisprudence existante sur le par. 32(1) ne s\u2019applique pas directement aux gouvernements autochtones. Les crit\u00e8res juridiques con\u00e7us \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur du contexte distinct des gouvernements autochtones ne doivent pas \u00eatre per\u00e7us comme une r\u00e9ponse compl\u00e8te sur l\u2019\u00e9tendue de l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 de la Charte aux nations autochtones autonomes. Les approches du pouvoir d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 ou du contr\u00f4le substantiel employ\u00e9es dans la jurisprudence sur le par. 32(1) ne devraient pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s comme imposant la condition qu\u2019un pouvoir soit d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 par le Parlement ou les l\u00e9gislatures provinciales pour que la Charte s\u2019applique. Par cons\u00e9quent, la d\u00e9l\u00e9gation au titre du par. 91(24) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire au regard du premier volet du crit\u00e8re de l\u2019arr\u00eat Eldridge quand on l\u2019applique \u00e0 la situation unique des nations autochtones autonomes. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que la mesure attaqu\u00e9e d\u00e9coule d\u2019un pouvoir conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, provinciale ou territoriale pour qu\u2019elle fasse l\u2019objet d\u2019un examen fond\u00e9 sur la Charte. Interpr\u00e9ter le par. 32(1) et le cadre de l\u2019arr\u00eat Eldridge comme ne s\u2019appliquant que dans les cas de pouvoir d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 privil\u00e9gierait une conception trop textuelle du par. 32(1) et priverait les Autochtones des protections de la Charte lorsque leurs propres corps dirigeants portent atteinte \u00e0 leurs droits. En outre, cette reconnaissance de nations autochtones autonomes en tant que gouvernements \u00e0 part enti\u00e8re fait respecter les pratiques autochtones de longue date en mati\u00e8re d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale et favorise la r\u00e9conciliation au Canada.\nIl y a accord avec les juges majoritaires pour dire que la VGFN rel\u00e8ve du premier volet du cadre de l\u2019arr\u00eat Eldridge, car elle est gouvernementale par nature et, par cons\u00e9quent, elle est assujettie \u00e0 la Charte. Il est aussi convenu avec eux que l\u2019\u00e9diction par la VGFN de l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence doit faire l\u2019objet d\u2019un examen fond\u00e9 sur la Charte. De fait, la VGFN est un gouvernement de par sa nature m\u00eame parce qu\u2019elle exerce des pouvoirs l\u00e9gislatifs et ex\u00e9cutifs \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de domaines \u00ab relevant \u00bb du Parlement et des l\u00e9gislatures provinciales. Sa structure et ses fonctions refl\u00e8tent son caract\u00e8re intrins\u00e8quement gouvernemental : elle adopte des lois et prend des d\u00e9cisions qui favorisent, ordonnent et restreignent la vie de ses citoyens. Il y a d\u00e9saccord avec l\u2019id\u00e9e des juges majoritaires qu\u2019un facteur essentiel \u00e0 l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 de la Charte au regard du par. 32(1) est le fait que le pouvoir l\u00e9gislatif de la VGFN \u00e9mane du Parlement. La VGFN ne tire pas son origine de la loi, son pouvoir l\u00e9gislatif ne lui a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9, et elle n\u2019a pas \u00e0 fonder son statut gouvernemental en renvoyant \u00e0 ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9 par un autre ordre de gouvernement.\nL\u2019article 25 de la Charte sert d\u2019outil d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation pour aider \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger les droits collectifs distincts que poss\u00e8dent les peuples autochtones \u00e0 titre de peuples autochtones du Canada en prescrivant une op\u00e9ration d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation afin de r\u00e9soudre les difficult\u00e9s que posent les droits autochtones collectifs et les droits individuels garantis par la Charte qui s\u2019opposent. Il joue un r\u00f4le distinct de celui d\u2019autres dispositions de la Charte, ayant pour effet de pr\u00e9server une forme de droit collectif propre aux peuples autochtones tout en reconnaissant que, lorsque les gouvernements autochtones \u00e9tablissent des distinctions entre leurs citoyens, les particuliers et minorit\u00e9s au sein du groupe devraient n\u00e9anmoins b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de toutes les protections de la Charte ench\u00e2ss\u00e9es dans la Constitution. \u00c0 l\u2019instar des autres dispositions de la Charte, l\u2019art. 25 doit recevoir une interpr\u00e9tation t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique. Bien que, suivant une juste interpr\u00e9tation textuelle, il puisse \u00e9tayer l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des approches divergentes de par son effet, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire soit l\u2019approche du bouclier, soit celle du prisme d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation, compte tenu de sa nature, de son objet et de son historique, il \u00e9tait cens\u00e9 servir de prisme d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation.\nL\u2019article 25 favorise la r\u00e9alisation d\u2019un objectif particulier : \u00e9viter que l\u2019adoption d\u2019une d\u00e9claration des droits constitutionnalis\u00e9e au Canada ait pour effet de porter atteinte aux droits uniques d\u00e9tenus par les peuples autochtones qui d\u00e9coulent de leur identit\u00e9 en tant que tels. Les d\u00e9bats l\u00e9gislatifs sur la r\u00e9forme constitutionnelle \u00e9clairent son objet. Un examen de la r\u00e9daction et de la n\u00e9gociation de la Charte r\u00e9v\u00e8le une d\u00e9marche de pr\u00e9servation des droits dans le cas de l\u2019art. 25 \u2014 visant \u00e0 \u00e9viter que la Charte ne restreigne d\u2019autres droits existants, y compris les droits uniques d\u00e9tenus par les peuples autochtones. Les \u00e9bauches de disposition ant\u00e9rieures de ce qui est devenu l\u2019art. 25 tendent \u00e0 indiquer que le gouvernement souhaitait que la disposition emp\u00eache la revendication de droits individuels en vertu des articles applicables de la Charte de supprimer ou d\u2019\u00e9carter les droits autochtones collectifs. Trois conclusions importantes sur l\u2019objet de l\u2019art. 25 peuvent se d\u00e9gager des origines l\u00e9gislatives de la disposition. Premi\u00e8rement, l\u2019insertion de l\u2019art. 25 \u00e9tait motiv\u00e9e par des pr\u00e9occupations li\u00e9es \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re dont les droits et int\u00e9r\u00eats collectifs des peuples autochtones pourraient interagir avec l\u2019ench\u00e2ssement constitutionnel de droits individuels \u2014 surtout le droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 garanti au par. 15(1). Deuxi\u00e8mement, l\u2019art. 25 ne visait pas \u00e0 cr\u00e9er ou \u00e0 conf\u00e9rer des droits; on l\u2019envisageait plut\u00f4t comme un outil d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation. Troisi\u00e8mement, la disposition vise \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger le statut sp\u00e9cial de certains droits collectifs d\u00e9tenus par les peuples autochtones \u2014 droits qui se rapportent uniquement aux peuples autochtones parce qu\u2019ils sont des Autochtones.\nPlusieurs autres principes importants tir\u00e9s de la jurisprudence constitutionnelle, allant de la mobilisation constitutionnelle apr\u00e8s 1982 aux sources internationales, \u00e9tayent la conclusion suivant laquelle l\u2019art. 25 fait office de prisme d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation qui assure le respect des droits collectifs et des droits individuels. Ces sources \u00e9tayent l\u2019opinion selon laquelle l\u2019art. 25 ne devrait pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 interdire aux demandeurs autochtones d\u2019invoquer d\u2019autres dispositions de la Charte, y compris le par. 15(1), m\u00eame si la contestation vise les lois de leurs propres communaut\u00e9s. Dans sa jurisprudence, la Cour a toujours affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il faut lire en corr\u00e9lation toutes les parties de la Constitution, et qu\u2019il n\u2019existe aucune hi\u00e9rarchie entre ses diff\u00e9rentes dispositions. Le Rapport final publi\u00e9 en 1996 par la Commission royale sur les peuples autochtones r\u00e9clamait qu\u2019une certaine souplesse pr\u00e9side \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019art. 25 pour tenir compte des philosophies, des traditions et des pratiques culturelles propres aux peuples autochtones. La D\u00e9claration des Nations Unies sur les droits des peuples autochtones, qui lie le Canada, reconna\u00eet la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de prot\u00e9ger \u00e0 la fois les droits collectifs et les droits individuels des peuples autochtones et illustre bien qu\u2019un type de droit ne peut supplanter absolument un autre. De plus, \u00e0 titre de gouvernements \u00e0 part enti\u00e8re, les nations autochtones peuvent ench\u00e2sser les droits de leurs citoyens dans des documents constitutionnels. Ces ordres juridiques autochtones font partie int\u00e9grante du droit canadien, et les gouvernements autochtones ne sont pas soustraits \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 de respecter les droits et libert\u00e9s individuels formul\u00e9s dans la Charte, sous r\u00e9serve de la fonction d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation remplie par l\u2019art. 25 lorsque des droits autochtones collectifs sont en jeu.\nIl y a d\u00e9saccord avec les juges majoritaires quant \u00e0 la port\u00e9e de la protection offerte par l\u2019art. 25. Les droits vis\u00e9s par l\u2019art. 25 se limitent \u00e0 ceux qui sont v\u00e9ritablement propres aux peuples autochtones parce qu\u2019ils sont des Autochtones. Ils ne s\u2019\u00e9tendent pas \u00e0 tous les domaines o\u00f9 les gouvernements autochtones peuvent agir. La formulation des juges majoritaires suivant laquelle un \u00ab autre \u00bb droit rel\u00e8ve de l\u2019art. 25 lorsque la partie qui cherche \u00e0 l\u2019invoquer \u00e9tablit que le \u00ab droit prot\u00e8ge ou reconna\u00eet la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone \u00bb est trop large et ne remplit pas une v\u00e9ritable fonction de filtre \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la reconnaissance des droits. Il ne suffit pas qu\u2019un droit se rapporte aux peuples autochtones pour qu\u2019il rel\u00e8ve de l\u2019art. 25 ou, dans le contexte de l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale, qu\u2019une nation autochtone poss\u00e8de de vastes droits de gouverner sa communaut\u00e9. L\u2019accent doit \u00eatre mis sur le droit collectif lui\u2011m\u00eame, et sur la question de savoir s\u2019il est propre \u00e0 une communaut\u00e9 autochtone vu l\u2019autochtonit\u00e9. Dans ce contexte, les distinctions au sein du groupe bas\u00e9es sur une caract\u00e9ristique personnelle autre que l\u2019autochtonit\u00e9 d\u00e9bordent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement du cadre de l\u2019art. 25, mais l\u2019art. 25 peut viser des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives qui distinguent les Autochtones des non\u2011Autochtones dans le but de prot\u00e9ger les int\u00e9r\u00eats associ\u00e9s \u00e0 la diff\u00e9rence autochtone. Cette conception \u00e9vite que l\u2019art. 25 serve \u00e0 cr\u00e9er en fait de vastes zones soustraites \u00e0 l\u2019application de la Charte dans le contexte de l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale autochtone. Les membres de communaut\u00e9s autochtones doivent pouvoir contester les mesures de leurs propres gouvernements \u2014 il ne faut pas leur refuser d\u2019importantes protections de la Charte qui sont cens\u00e9es s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 tout un chacun.\nLorsque l\u2019art. 25 est invoqu\u00e9, le tribunal doit se poser plusieurs questions pour d\u00e9cider s\u2019il s\u2019applique. En premier lieu, le demandeur doit d\u00e9montrer la violation d\u2019un droit ou d\u2019une libert\u00e9 garanti par la Charte. En deuxi\u00e8me lieu, la partie qui se fonde sur l\u2019art. 25 doit d\u00e9montrer que le droit ou la libert\u00e9 collectif en question est un droit ancestral, issu de trait\u00e9 ou autre droit ou libert\u00e9 des peuples autochtones du Canada, de sorte qu\u2019il est propre \u00e0 une communaut\u00e9 autochtone en raison de l\u2019autochtonit\u00e9. En troisi\u00e8me lieu, le tribunal doit tenter de concilier le droit collectif et le droit individuel qui s\u2019opposent lorsque c\u2019est possible de le faire. En cas de v\u00e9ritable conflit entre les deux droits, c\u2019est \u00e0 ce stade qu\u2019une forme de mise en balance doit survenir pour concilier les int\u00e9r\u00eats oppos\u00e9s en jeu. Dans de tels cas, l\u2019art. 25 oblige le tribunal \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter le droit individuel garanti par la Charte de telle sorte qu\u2019il ne porte pas atteinte au droit prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par l\u2019art. 25. Le tribunal doit examiner si le fait de donner effet \u00e0 un droit individuel garanti par la Charte aurait une incidence plus que mineure ou accessoire sur le droit collectif, et si l\u2019exercice contest\u00e9 du droit collectif est n\u00e9cessaire au maintien de la culture distinctive de la communaut\u00e9 autochtone. Interpr\u00e9ter t\u00e9l\u00e9ologiquement l\u2019art. 25 veut dire accepter les limites quant \u00e0 ce qui constitue une atteinte \u00e0 un droit garanti par l\u2019art. 25 afin d\u2019\u00e9viter les situations dans lesquelles un empi\u00e8tement insignifiant sur un droit collectif vis\u00e9 par l\u2019art. 25 prime sur une violation potentiellement grave de la Charte. Cette approche comporte une mise en balance des droits autochtones collectifs et des droits individuels garantis par la Charte.\nEn l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, comme la VGFN s\u2019appuie sur l\u2019art. 25 relativement \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence, la premi\u00e8re question est de savoir si l\u2019\u00e9diction par la VGFN de l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence porte atteinte au droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 que le par. 15(1) de la Charte garantit \u00e0 D. Il y a accord avec les juges majoritaires que c\u2019est le cas. L\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence cr\u00e9e une distinction directement bas\u00e9e, suivant ses termes m\u00eames, sur le fait qu\u2019un citoyen de la VGFN r\u00e9side sur les terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es de la VGFN ou \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cart de celles\u2011ci, et cette distinction est fond\u00e9e sur le motif analogue de l\u2019autochtonit\u00e9-lieu de r\u00e9sidence. Bien que les circonstances factuelles de la pr\u00e9sente esp\u00e8ce soient notablement distinctes de celles de l\u2019affaire Corbiere c. Canada (Ministre des Affaires indiennes et du Nord canadien), [1999] 2 R.C.S. 203, en ce que la situation des membres de bandes vivant hors r\u00e9serve dans Corbiere ne soit pas identique \u00e0 celle des citoyens de la VGFN qui vivent \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de leur territoire traditionnel, le legs qu\u2019a laiss\u00e9 le colonialisme par le truchement de la Loi sur les Indiens est un d\u00e9nominateur commun aux deux groupes. La discrimination subie par les Autochtones qui vivent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cart de leur communaut\u00e9, telle qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crite dans l\u2019affaire Corbiere, est toujours v\u00e9cue par les citoyens de la VGFN, si bien que le motif analogue de l\u2019autochtonit\u00e9\u2011lieu de r\u00e9sidence demeure applicable en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Le lieu de r\u00e9sidence des citoyens de la VGFN touche \u00e0 l\u2019essence m\u00eame de leur identit\u00e9 et, par cons\u00e9quent, cette caract\u00e9ristique est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme immuable.\nEn outre, la distinction cr\u00e9\u00e9e par l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence est discriminatoire parce qu\u2019elle refuse \u00e0 D l\u2019avantage de servir au sein du gouvernement, ce qui est une forme d\u2019exclusion politique qui l\u2019\u00e9carte d\u2019un aspect essentiel de la participation d\u00e9mocratique et l\u2019emp\u00eache d\u2019influer sur les processus d\u00e9cisionnels qui la touchent. Cet avantage est refus\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re discriminatoire, car l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence renforce les st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes voulant que les citoyens non r\u00e9sidents de la VGFN aient moins de valeur et de dignit\u00e9 parce qu\u2019ils vivent \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de leur territoire traditionnel et que, pour \u00eatre un vrai Autochtone, une personne doit vivre dans la r\u00e9serve ou sur les terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es. Cela perp\u00e9tue \u00e0 tout le moins le d\u00e9savantage. Obliger un citoyen non r\u00e9sident \u00e0 d\u00e9m\u00e9nager sur les terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es pour participer \u00e0 la gouvernance de la communaut\u00e9 veut dire obliger quelqu\u2019un \u00e0 modifier une caract\u00e9ristique consid\u00e9r\u00e9e immuable. Un tel choix illusoire de retourner habiter sur les terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es n\u2019a pas de pertinence en droit.\nLa seconde question est de savoir si la pr\u00e9sente affaire fait intervenir un droit autochtone collectif qui rel\u00e8ve du champ d\u2019application de l\u2019art. 25. L\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence ne constitue pas l\u2019exercice d\u2019un droit relevant de l\u2019art. 25 parce qu\u2019on ne peut pas dire que le droit d\u2019une nation autochtone autonome de r\u00e9glementer la composition de ses corps dirigeants est un droit collectif unique qui appartient aux peuples autochtones parce qu\u2019ils sont des Autochtones. L\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence vise plut\u00f4t la r\u00e9gie interne de la VGFN et n\u2019a pas pour but de reconna\u00eetre le statut sp\u00e9cial de groupes autochtones \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur de l\u2019\u00c9tat canadien au sens large. Subsidiairement, m\u00eame si l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence constituait l\u2019exercice d\u2019un droit relevant de l\u2019art. 25, effectuer une mise en balance pour concilier les int\u00e9r\u00eats oppos\u00e9s en jeu m\u00e8nerait n\u00e9anmoins \u00e0 la conclusion que l\u2019art. 25 n\u2019aurait pas pour effet de donner la pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence sur les droits individuels garantis par la Charte, car l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence n\u2019en constituerait pas une qui est n\u00e9cessaire au maintien de la culture distinctive de la VGFN.\nLa conclusion selon laquelle l\u2019art. 25 ne s\u2019applique pas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ne signifie pas que la diff\u00e9rence autochtone est une consid\u00e9ration non pertinente dans l\u2019\u00e9valuation de la demande fond\u00e9e sur la Charte. Au contraire \u2014 elle a un r\u00f4le important \u00e0 jouer dans l\u2019analyse de la justification au regard de l\u2019article premier de la Charte. Les tribunaux doivent tenir respectueusement compte du point de vue de la communaut\u00e9 autochtone \u00e0 tous les stades de l\u2019analyse. Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence n\u2019est pas justifi\u00e9e au regard de l\u2019article premier. Bien qu\u2019elle serve \u00e0 atteindre l\u2019objectif urgent et r\u00e9el de la promotion et du maintien de l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale et du lien avec les territoires, et qu\u2019elle ait un lien rationnel avec cet objectif en ce qu\u2019il est crucial et logique que les dirigeants \u00e9lus entretiennent un lien avec le territoire traditionnel en \u00e9tant physiquement pr\u00e9sents sur celui\u2011ci, l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence ne porte pas une atteinte minimale au droit que le par. 15(1) de la Charte garantit \u00e0 D, et la VGFN n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les avantages de l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence l\u2019emportent sur les effets n\u00e9gatifs de la violation du par. 15(1) en cause. Une mesure portant une atteinte minimale doit permettre au moins quelques accommodements pour le droit des citoyens non r\u00e9sidents de participer \u00e0 la gouvernance de la communaut\u00e9. Aucune preuve n\u2019indique que la VGFN a cherch\u00e9 de v\u00e9ritables solutions de rechange \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence elle\u2011m\u00eame. Bien que l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence att\u00e9nue les effets de la dislocation coloniale du contr\u00f4le exerc\u00e9 par les Vuntut Gwitchin sur leur territoire traditionnel, elle repr\u00e9sente aussi un empi\u00e8tement important sur la participation d\u00e9mocratique. Elle ne constitue donc pas un juste \u00e9quilibre entre ses effets b\u00e9n\u00e9fiques et effets pr\u00e9judiciables.\nLe juge Rowe (dissident quant au pourvoi incident) : Le pourvoi de D devrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9, le pourvoi incident de la VGFN devrait \u00eatre accueilli et les ordonnances des juridictions inf\u00e9rieures devraient \u00eatre annul\u00e9es. Suivant une application ad\u00e9quate du par. 32(1) de la Charte, l\u2019adoption par la VGFN de l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence dans sa Constitution n\u2019est pas assujettie \u00e0 la Charte. \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de cette conclusion, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019examiner les arguments portant sur le par. 15(1) ou l\u2019art. 25 de la Charte.\nLa port\u00e9e de la Charte est d\u00e9limit\u00e9e par son par. 32(1). Cette disposition r\u00e9git la question de savoir sur qui p\u00e8se le fardeau des droits garantis par la Charte, ou, autrement dit, qui est li\u00e9 par la Charte. Invoquer d\u2019autres fondements d\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 de la Charte \u2014 comme le par. 52(1) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 \u2014 est incompatible avec la jurisprudence. Le texte du par. 32(1), son historique et sa place dans la structure de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982, ainsi que la jurisprudence relative \u00e0 son objet et \u00e0 sa port\u00e9e, confirment que la Charte ne s\u2019applique qu\u2019aux gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, provinciaux et territoriaux \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des domaines relevant de ceux\u2011ci. Il est fondamentalement erron\u00e9 de soutenir que la Charte s\u2019applique \u00e0 toute entit\u00e9 qui est un gouvernement ou \u00e0 toute activit\u00e9 qui semble \u00eatre gouvernementale, qu\u2019elle ait ou non un lien avec le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou un gouvernement provincial.\nPour ce qui est du texte du par. 32(1), le sens du mot \u00ab gouvernement \u00bb a \u00e9t\u00e9 interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 t\u00e9l\u00e9ologiquement de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 englober les nombreuses manifestations des gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux, mais les autres entit\u00e9s ou leurs activit\u00e9s doivent pr\u00e9senter un lien important avec l\u2019un de ces gouvernements pour \u00eatre vis\u00e9es par le par. 32(1). Le libell\u00e9 clair utilis\u00e9 pour \u00e9noncer \u00e0 qui et \u00e0 quoi s\u2019applique la Charte refl\u00e8te l\u2019objet du par. 32(1). On ne peut adopter une interpr\u00e9tation qui r\u00e9\u00e9crit en fait le par. 32(1) de la Charte, et aucune approche sur l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 de la Charte en vertu du par. 32(1) ne saurait faire abstraction des limites claires \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans la disposition elle\u2011m\u00eame.\nL\u2019historique du par. 32(1) et sa place dans la structure de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 confirment \u00e9galement que la Charte \u2014 y compris le par. 32(1) \u2014 a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9labor\u00e9e par les gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux, pour ces gouvernements, afin de consacrer des normes de comportement constitutionnel qui \u00e9taient adapt\u00e9es aux structures et aux fondements philosophiques de la gouvernance f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et provinciale. En revanche, la relation entre ces gouvernements et les peuples autochtones, et la place accord\u00e9e \u00e0 la gouvernance autochtone au sein du Canada contemporain, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9es s\u00e9par\u00e9ment dans la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982. Mais surtout, les droits collectifs des peuples autochtones se sont vu accorder la protection constitutionnelle par l\u2019art. 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982. Il convient de souligner que l\u2019art. 35 a \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9 en dehors de la Charte. M\u00eame si la Charte concernait principalement les acteurs f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux, l\u2019inclusion ultime de l\u2019art. 35 repr\u00e9sente l\u2019aboutissement d\u2019une bataille longue et difficile \u00e0 la fois dans l\u2019ar\u00e8ne politique et devant les tribunaux pour la reconnaissance de droits ancestraux et de droits issus de trait\u00e9s. Les gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux ont compris que la port\u00e9e et les limites de la gouvernance autochtone seraient examin\u00e9es sous le r\u00e9gime de l\u2019art. 35, plut\u00f4t qu\u2019au moyen de la Charte. La gouvernance interne autochtone ne rel\u00e8ve donc pas du champ d\u2019application de la Charte, sauf s\u2019il existe un lien important avec le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou un gouvernement provincial.\nDe plus, il ressort clairement de la jurisprudence sur l\u2019objet et la port\u00e9e du par. 32(1) que seuls les gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux devaient relever du champ d\u2019application de cette disposition. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 une m\u00e9thode d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique de la Charte, la port\u00e9e du par. 32(1) doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui refl\u00e8te la fa\u00e7on dont les gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux prennent forme dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne moderne. La jurisprudence a reconnu que les entit\u00e9s au sein de l\u2019\u00c9tat administratif moderne prennent diff\u00e9rentes formes et ont divers degr\u00e9s d\u2019autonomie \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux dans leurs activit\u00e9s. Par cons\u00e9quent, un lien important avec le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou un gouvernement provincial est n\u00e9cessaire pour faire en sorte que ces gouvernements ne puissent se soustraire \u00e0 un examen fond\u00e9 sur la Charte, notamment en agissant par l\u2019entremise d\u2019entit\u00e9s qui sont en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 leurs prolongements ou en d\u00e9l\u00e9guant la mise en \u0153uvre de politiques ou programmes particuliers \u00e0 des entit\u00e9s non gouvernementales. Si les gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux ne peuvent pas exercer une activit\u00e9 directement sans contrevenir \u00e0 la Charte, ils ne peuvent pas se soustraire \u00e0 un examen fond\u00e9 sur la Charte en d\u00e9l\u00e9guant l\u2019activit\u00e9 \u00e0 une entit\u00e9 non gouvernementale. M\u00eame si une autre entit\u00e9 est charg\u00e9e de l\u2019exercer, la nature de l\u2019activit\u00e9 n\u2019a pas chang\u00e9 : elle demeure celle du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou du gouvernement d\u2019une province. Les entit\u00e9s non gouvernementales sont simplement le m\u00e9canisme choisi par le gouvernement pour l\u2019accomplissement de ce qui constitue, essentiellement, des activit\u00e9s qui peuvent \u00eatre attribu\u00e9es \u00e0 ce gouvernement.\nLa Cour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Eldridge a \u00e9tabli un cadre d\u2019analyse \u00e0 deux volets afin de donner effet au par. 32(1). Dans le premier volet, un tribunal peut conclure qu\u2019une entit\u00e9 elle\u2011m\u00eame fait partie du \u00ab gouvernement \u00bb au sens du par. 32(1) soit de par sa nature m\u00eame, soit \u00e0 cause du degr\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le exerc\u00e9 par le gouvernement sur elle. Le degr\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le doit \u00eatre routinier ou r\u00e9gulier plut\u00f4t qu\u2019absolu ou extraordinaire; cette norme implique l\u2019existence d\u2019un lien important avec le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou un gouvernement provincial. Les entit\u00e9s consid\u00e9r\u00e9es relever du champ d\u2019application du par. 32(1) ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crites dans la jurisprudence comme faisant partie de l\u2019appareil ou de la structure du gouvernement, comme \u00e9tant des organismes subordonn\u00e9s, des organes ou une \u00e9manation du gouvernement, ou encore ont \u00e9t\u00e9 assimil\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tat. Dans chaque cas, l\u2019entit\u00e9 devait \u00e0 la fois son existence et ses pouvoirs au gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou \u00e0 un gouvernement provincial. Un lien important avec la Couronne est n\u00e9cessaire. S\u2019il est conclu que l\u2019entit\u00e9 elle\u2011m\u00eame rel\u00e8ve du par. 32(1), toutes ses activit\u00e9s sont assujetties \u00e0 la Charte. Dans le second volet du cadre d\u2019analyse, un tribunal peut statuer que, bien que l\u2019entit\u00e9 elle\u2011m\u00eame ne puisse \u00eatre assimil\u00e9e au gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou \u00e0 celui d\u2019une province, certaines de ses activit\u00e9s particuli\u00e8res peuvent \u00eatre attribu\u00e9es au gouvernement, nomm\u00e9ment lorsque l\u2019activit\u00e9 vise la mise en \u0153uvre d\u2019un r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gal ou d\u2019un programme gouvernemental donn\u00e9. Dans un tel cas, seules ces activit\u00e9s donnent lieu \u00e0 un examen fond\u00e9 sur la Charte parce qu\u2019elles sont effectivement les activit\u00e9s du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou du gouvernement d\u2019une province en application du par. 32(1). Un lien important avec le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou un gouvernement provincial est aussi n\u00e9cessaire en application de ce volet. Ce qu\u2019il faut, c\u2019est un lien direct et d\u00e9fini entre le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou celui d\u2019une province et l\u2019activit\u00e9.\nEn l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les divers arrangements entre la VGFN et les gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et\/ou du Yukon \u2014 y compris de multiples instruments, telle l\u2019Entente d\u00e9finitive de la VGFN, qui est un trait\u00e9 prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par le par. 35(1) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982, l\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale de la VGFN, et des lois adopt\u00e9es par le Parlement et la l\u00e9gislature du Yukon afin de donner effet \u00e0 ces ententes \u2014 ne satisfont pas au crit\u00e8re du lien important n\u00e9cessaire pour que la VGFN ou son adoption de l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence rel\u00e8ve du champ d\u2019application du par. 32(1). Supposer que, comme l\u2019entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce a \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9e par une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, la VGFN est en quelque sorte une \u00e9manation de la comp\u00e9tence f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, est fondamentalement incompatible avec la nature, le statut et l\u2019objet d\u2019un gouvernement autochtone autonome. L\u2019id\u00e9e relative \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale n\u2019est pas qu\u2019elle constitue un pouvoir qui \u00e9mane du Parlement, mais plut\u00f4t que les peuples autochtones exercent une comp\u00e9tence qui est l\u00e9gitimement la leur. Aucun des aspects des arrangements de la VGFN avec le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et celui du Yukon ne d\u00e9montre que l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des volets du cadre d\u2019analyse du par. 32(1) s\u2019applique. Au contraire, ils confirment que la VGFN est distincte de la Couronne, notamment lorsqu\u2019elle adopte l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence en conformit\u00e9 avec ses propres lois, coutumes et pratiques. Appliquer la Charte reviendrait \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer que la VGFN constitue un prolongement du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou de celui du Yukon, ou que l\u2019adoption par la VGFN de l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence peut \u00eatre attribu\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre de ces gouvernements. Une telle interpr\u00e9tation est incompatible non seulement avec les arrangements entre la VGFN et ces deux gouvernements, mais aussi avec la relation sp\u00e9ciale qui existe entre les gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et territorial et les Vuntut Gwitchin. Les structures de gouvernance et les d\u00e9cisions internes de la VGFN prennent leur source dans les traditions juridiques et les choix qui lui sont propres et ne donnent pas lieu \u00e0 un examen fond\u00e9 sur la Charte en application du par. 32(1).\nDe plus, le fait d\u2019imposer la Charte \u00e0 la VGFN n\u2019est pas compatible avec l\u2019objectif de r\u00e9conciliation et la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de respecter la capacit\u00e9 et le droit des Vuntut Gwitchin de prendre des d\u00e9cisions conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 leurs propres lois, coutumes et pratiques. Cela comprend les d\u00e9cisions concernant l\u2019adoption et la modification de mesures de protection des droits et libert\u00e9s des citoyens de la VGFN. Les fondements philosophiques de la Charte peuvent ne pas n\u00e9cessairement correspondre \u00e0 certaines visions autochtones du monde et \u00e0 la structure des corps dirigeants autochtones qui cherchent \u00e0 conserver et int\u00e9grer les structures traditionnelles aux formes de gouvernement contemporaines. Il peut y avoir des tensions entre l\u2019accent g\u00e9n\u00e9ral que met la Charte sur les droits et la pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence de certaines communaut\u00e9s autochtones \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une conception plus relationnelle et plus r\u00e9ciproque des rapports, devoirs et responsabilit\u00e9s. De plus, les communaut\u00e9s autochtones peuvent voir diff\u00e9remment l\u2019\u00e9quilibre entre les droits individuels et les droits collectifs, et entre les personnes et l\u2019\u00c9tat. M\u00eame lorsque les syst\u00e8mes de valeurs et les traditions juridiques de communaut\u00e9s autochtones pr\u00e9cises m\u00e8nent au m\u00eame r\u00e9sultat que celui auquel conduit la Charte, leur mode de raisonnement peut diff\u00e9rer. Plut\u00f4t que de recourir \u00e0 une forme monolithique d\u2019analyse des droits, les communaut\u00e9s autochtones peuvent \u00e9laborer des mesures de protection des droits de la personne qui int\u00e8grent leurs formes particuli\u00e8res et distinctes de droit autochtone.\nBien que les protections pr\u00e9vues par la Charte n\u2019aillent pas intrins\u00e8quement \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des souhaits des communaut\u00e9s autochtones, y compris la VGFN, et bien qu\u2019il ne faille pas pr\u00e9sumer que les droits individuels sont n\u00e9cessairement en opposition avec la gouvernance autochtone collective, ni que les communaut\u00e9s autochtones sont immuables, il est clair que la Charte ne devrait pas \u00eatre impos\u00e9e aux peuples autochtones. Imposer unilat\u00e9ralement la Charte au moyen d\u2019une interpr\u00e9tation discutable du par. 32(1) aurait pour effet de revenir \u00e0 une \u00e9poque o\u00f9 les peuples autochtones n\u2019avaient souvent pas la possibilit\u00e9 de participer \u00e0 la prise de d\u00e9cisions importantes concernant leurs droits constitutionnels. Il n\u2019y a pas lieu d\u2019examiner minutieusement les choix de la VGFN en transposant un instrument con\u00e7u par et pour les gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux aux Vuntut Gwitchin, lesquels n\u2019ont pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 sa cr\u00e9ation ni souscrit \u00e0 ses modalit\u00e9s. Cela reviendrait \u00e0 soumettre la VGFN au genre de surveillance auquel elle a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 se soustraire.\nEnfin, la VGFN n\u2019a jamais consenti \u00e0 adopter les protections \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans la Charte ou \u00e0 appliquer les protections conf\u00e9r\u00e9es par la Charte \u00e0 sa Constitution et \u00e0 ses lois. Ni l\u2019Entente d\u00e9finitive de la VGFN ni l\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale de la VGFN ne mentionnent la Charte. Aucune de leurs dispositions ne tend \u00e0 indiquer, et encore moins ne pr\u00e9voit clairement et sans \u00e9quivoque, que la VGFN a souscrit \u00e0 l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 de la Charte. La VGFN a plut\u00f4t adopt\u00e9 ses propres mesures de protection des droits de ses citoyens, dont bon nombre correspondent \u00e0 celles \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans la Charte mais sont adapt\u00e9es aux lois, coutumes et pratiques de son peuple. La VGFN respecte les droits individuels et les citoyens de la VGFN ne sont pas priv\u00e9s de droits fondamentaux; ils ne vivent pas non plus dans une zone sans droits. Les structures de gouvernance de la VGFN comprennent des protections des droits \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9. De plus, la VGFN a constitutionnellement consacr\u00e9 des droits et libert\u00e9s ainsi que des m\u00e9canismes permettant \u00e0 ses citoyens de contester ses lois. Toute contestation d\u2019une disposition de la Constitution de la VGFN doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9e conform\u00e9ment aux structures et processus internes propres \u00e0 la VGFN. Comme D cherche \u00e0 contester une r\u00e8gle interne de la VGFN afin de participer \u00e0 sa gouvernance, sa demande doit donc \u00eatre examin\u00e9e en fonction des droits consacr\u00e9s dans la Constitution de la VGFN, conform\u00e9ment aux structures et processus de gouvernance propres \u00e0 la VGFN, et non au regard de la Charte.\nJurisprudence\nCit\u00e9e par les juges Kasirer et Jamal\nArr\u00eats appliqu\u00e9s : Godbout c.

Vue d\u2019ensemble\n[1] En tant que communaut\u00e9 autochtone autonome du Yukon, la Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation (ou la VGFN) est dot\u00e9e de sa propre Constitution, qui reconna\u00eet \u00e0 ses citoyens certains droits et libert\u00e9s et \u00e9nonce des r\u00e8gles concernant l\u2019organisation de son gouvernement, ainsi que des r\u00e8gles et des normes \u00e9lectorales. Au c\u0153ur du pr\u00e9sent pourvoi se trouve la disposition de la Constitution de la VGFN qui exige que le chef et les conseillers \u00e9lus r\u00e9sident sur les terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es de la Premi\u00e8re Nation ou y d\u00e9m\u00e9nagent dans les 14 jours suivant leur \u00e9lection. Le si\u00e8ge du gouvernement de la VGFN se trouve \u00e0 Old Crow, un village qui est situ\u00e9 \u00e0 environ 800 kilom\u00e8tres au nord de Whitehorse, dans le territoire traditionnel des Vuntut Gwitchin, et qui constitue la principale communaut\u00e9 de la VGFN sur ses terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es.\n[2] Citoyenne de la VGFN et du Canada, Cindy Dickson vit \u00e0 Whitehorse et est contrainte, pour des raisons personnelles, d\u2019y demeurer. Elle souhaite se porter candidate au poste de conseill\u00e8re de la VGFN et affirme que l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence est discriminatoire \u00e0 son \u00e9gard en tant que personne qui ne r\u00e9side pas sur les terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es. Elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 en Cour supr\u00eame du Yukon une requ\u00eate all\u00e9guant que cette obligation viole \u00e0 la fois le droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 que lui garantit le par. 15(1) de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s et le droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 qui lui est reconnu par l\u2019article IV de la Constitution de la VGFN (devant notre Cour, Mme Dickson a abandonn\u00e9 l\u2019argument qu\u2019elle avait formul\u00e9 au d\u00e9part sur la base de la garantie d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 que lui accorde la Constitution de la VGFN).\n[3] Devant nous, le d\u00e9bat s\u2019est focalis\u00e9 sur l\u2019application de la Charte \u00e0 la VGFN, sur la port\u00e9e du droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 garanti \u00e0 Mme Dickson par le par. 15(1) et sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation qu\u2019il convient de donner \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25 de la Charte. La VGFN dit qu\u2019en tant que premi\u00e8re nation autonome, elle est soustraite \u00e0 l\u2019application de la Charte. \u00c0 titre subsidiaire, elle fait valoir que, si la Charte s\u2019applique, l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence ne viole pas le droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 de Mme Dickson, et que, m\u00eame si c\u2019\u00e9tait le cas, l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence est n\u00e9anmoins valide car elle est \u00ab prot\u00e9g\u00e9e \u00bb par l\u2019art. 25 de la Charte, qui agit comme \u00ab bouclier \u00bb. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, la VGFN soutient que l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence prot\u00e8ge les droits collectifs minoritaires qui ont trait \u00e0 ses modes de gouvernement et de leadership de tradition autochtone. Le droit individuel que garantit la Charte \u00e0 Mme Dickson ne saurait porter atteinte \u00e0 cette disposition de la Constitution de la VGFN, laquelle prot\u00e8ge un droit autochtone collectif.\n[4] Le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi soul\u00e8ve deux questions in\u00e9dites concernant l\u2019application de la Charte \u00e0 une communaut\u00e9 autochtone autonome. Premi\u00e8rement, il invite la Cour \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si, selon le par. 32(1) de la Charte, la VGFN est un gouvernement par nature, ou si elle exerce une activit\u00e9 gouvernementale, de sorte que le droit individuel que la Charte reconna\u00eet \u00e0 Mme Dickson s\u2019appliquerait \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence. Deuxi\u00e8mement, si la Charte s\u2019applique effectivement \u00e0 la VGFN, la Cour doit d\u00e9cider si la VGFN peut invoquer l\u2019art. 25 pour prot\u00e9ger l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence contre la contestation de Mme Dickson fond\u00e9e sur la Charte. La Cour supr\u00eame et la Cour d\u2019appel du Yukon ont toutes deux jug\u00e9 que la Charte s\u2019appliquait et que, s\u2019il y avait violation du droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 garanti \u00e0 Mme Dickson par le par. 15(1), l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence \u00e9tait prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par l\u2019art. 25. Madame Dickson a interjet\u00e9 appel sur la question de la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence. La VGFN a form\u00e9 un appel incident sur la question de l\u2019application de la Charte.\n[5] Nous sommes d\u2019avis de rejeter le pourvoi de Mme Dickson. La Charte s\u2019applique \u00e0 la VGFN et \u00e0 ses citoyens comme Mme Dickson, principalement, mais pas seulement, parce que la VGFN est un gouvernement par nature. Les circonstances de la pr\u00e9sente esp\u00e8ce montrent que, pour les communaut\u00e9s autochtones, le par. 32(1) et l\u2019art. 25 sont \u00e9troitement li\u00e9s. Il est vrai que l\u2019application de droits individuels garantis par la Charte \u00e0 une communaut\u00e9 autochtone autonome pourrait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme g\u00eanant l\u2019application de r\u00e8gles destin\u00e9es \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger les droits et les int\u00e9r\u00eats des minorit\u00e9s autochtones. Cependant, en assurant la protection des int\u00e9r\u00eats autochtones collectifs en tant que bienfait social et constitutionnel \u00e0 l\u2019avantage de l\u2019ensemble des Canadiens, l\u2019art. 25 agit comme contrepoids. Interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 correctement, cet article permet l\u2019affirmation des droits individuels garantis par la Charte, sauf lorsqu\u2019ils entrent en conflit avec des \u00ab droits ou libert\u00e9s \u00bb \u2014 ancestraux, issus de trait\u00e9s ou \u00ab autres \u00bb \u2014 qui, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9, prot\u00e8gent la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone.\n[6] Bien que Mme Dickson ait r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que, en tant que non-r\u00e9sidente briguant un poste au sein du gouvernement de la VFGN, il y a \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue une violation du droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 qui lui est garanti par le par. 15(1) de la Charte, la VGFN nous a convaincus que l\u2019art. 25 prot\u00e8ge son obligation de r\u00e9sidence contre toute atteinte d\u00e9coulant de ce droit. Li\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u2019anciennes pratiques de gouvernance qui rattachent l\u2019exercice du leadership au sein de la communaut\u00e9 de la VGFN aux terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es, l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence prot\u00e8ge la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25, il ne peut y \u00eatre port\u00e9 atteinte par le droit individuel garanti par la Charte \u00e0 Mme Dickson avec lequel cette obligation entre irr\u00e9conciliablement en conflit.\nII. Contexte\nA. Les parties\n[7] L\u2019appelante, Cindy Dickson, est citoyenne canadienne et citoyenne de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la VGFN, dont le territoire traditionnel est situ\u00e9 dans le nord du Yukon. Le si\u00e8ge du gouvernement de la VGFN se trouve dans le village d\u2019Old Crow, situ\u00e9 sur les terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es de la VGFN. Madame Dickson vit actuellement \u00e0 Whitehorse, la capitale du Yukon, \u00e0 environ 800 kilom\u00e8tres au sud d\u2019Old Crow.\n[8] Old Crow est la communaut\u00e9 du Yukon situ\u00e9e le plus au nord, ainsi que la communaut\u00e9 la plus \u00e9loign\u00e9e dans le nord\u2011ouest du Canada. Comme il n\u2019existe pas de route praticable en toute saison desservant Old Crow, la communaut\u00e9 n\u2019est r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement accessible que par avion. Environ 260 citoyens de la VGFN vivent \u00e0 Old Crow, et environ 301 autres vivent ailleurs, principalement \u00e0 Whitehorse mais \u00e9galement \u00e0 d\u2019autres endroits au Canada. Les Vuntut Gwitchin formaient traditionnellement un peuple nomade.\n[9] Au cours de sa vie, Mme Dickson a v\u00e9cu \u00e0 Whitehorse et \u00e0 Old Crow, ainsi que dans d\u2019autres communaut\u00e9s du Yukon et \u00e0 Victoria, en Colombie\u2011Britannique. N\u00e9e \u00e0 Whitehorse, elle a v\u00e9cu \u00e0 Old Crow de l\u2019\u00e2ge de neuf \u00e0 seize ans, puis elle est retourn\u00e9e \u00e0 Whitehorse pour terminer ses \u00e9tudes secondaires, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas de programme d\u2019\u00e9tudes secondaires complet offert \u00e0 Old Crow. Elle s\u2019y rendait l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9, et elle y poss\u00e8de toujours un chalet. Elle a \u00e9galement de la famille et des amis \u00e0 Old Crow.\nB. La contestation constitutionnelle de Mme Dickson\n[10] Madame Dickson souhaite se porter candidate au poste de conseill\u00e8re de la VGFN, un poste r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 temps plein. Dans la requ\u00eate qu\u2019elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la Cour supr\u00eame du Yukon, elle a plaid\u00e9 qu\u2019une disposition de la Constitution de la VGFN obligeant le chef et les conseillers \u00e9lus \u00e0 r\u00e9sider sur les terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es de la VGFN au moment de leur \u00e9lection ou \u00e0 y d\u00e9m\u00e9nager dans les 14 jours qui suivent leur \u00e9lection viole de mani\u00e8re injustifiable le droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 que lui garantit le par. 15(1) de la Charte ou, subsidiairement, \u00e0 la garantie d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 que lui reconna\u00eet l\u2019article IV de la Constitution de la VGFN. Madame Dickson affirme qu\u2019elle ne peut pas d\u00e9m\u00e9nager \u00e0 Old Crow, principalement parce que son fils a besoin de soins m\u00e9dicaux qui n\u2019y sont pas offerts, mais \u00e9galement parce que son emploi et le p\u00e8re de son fils se trouvent \u00e0 Whitehorse.\n[11] La VGFN dit que l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence refl\u00e8te la pratique de longue date de la VGFN voulant que son chef et ses conseillers vivent sur son territoire traditionnel. Comme l\u2019a conclu le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, les Vuntut Gwitchin se gouvernent conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 leurs pratiques traditionnelles depuis bien avant la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration. Depuis des temps imm\u00e9moriaux, tous les chefs et conseillers de la VGFN ont v\u00e9cu sur le territoire traditionnel de celle\u2011ci. Au cours des 30 derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, ils ont toujours v\u00e9cu \u00e0 Old Crow. Aux termes des ententes de financement conclues avec le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et celui du Yukon, la plupart des programmes et des services administr\u00e9s par le gouvernement de la VGFN sont destin\u00e9s aux citoyens de la VGFN qui vivent sur les terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es de cette derni\u00e8re.\nC. Le cadre juridique de l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale de la VGFN et l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence\n[12] La contestation par Mme Dickson de l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence s\u2019inscrit dans le contexte du cadre juridique \u00e9tabli par le processus moderne relatif aux trait\u00e9s sur les revendications territoriales, d\u2019une part, et les ententes sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 conclues entre la VGFN et le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et celui du Yukon, d\u2019autre part. Ce cadre juridique comprend un \u00ab accord\u2011cadre \u00bb n\u00e9goci\u00e9 avec l\u2019ensemble des 14 premi\u00e8res nations du Yukon, ainsi que des trait\u00e9s modernes et des ententes sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale sp\u00e9cifiques qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 conclus de mani\u00e8re individuelle avec 11 premi\u00e8res nations, dont la VGFN, et qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9s et mis en vigueur par des lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales et territoriales.\n[13] La contestation de Mme Dickson s\u2019inscrit \u00e9galement dans le contexte du cadre juridique d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale appliqu\u00e9 par les Vuntut Gwitchin depuis des temps imm\u00e9moriaux. De nombreux aspects de ce cadre se retrouvent dans la Constitution de la VGFN. L\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence ferait, dit-on, partie de la culture, du droit et des valeurs des Vuntut Gwitchin, et serait l\u2019expression de leur syst\u00e8me de gouvernance de longue date fond\u00e9 sur le territoire.\n(1) L\u2019Accord\u2011cadre\n[14] En 1993, apr\u00e8s 20 ans de n\u00e9gociations, des repr\u00e9sentants de l\u2019ensemble des premi\u00e8res nations du Yukon ont conclu avec le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et celui du Yukon un \u00ab accord\u2011cadre \u00bb visant \u00e0 cr\u00e9er un cadre pour des ententes globales modernes sur les revendications territoriales au Yukon. L\u2019accord\u2011cadre pr\u00e9voyait la conclusion d\u2019ententes particuli\u00e8res entre le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, le gouvernement du Yukon et les premi\u00e8res nations qui seraient prot\u00e9g\u00e9es constitutionnellement en tant que trait\u00e9s vis\u00e9s par l\u2019art. 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982.\n[15] L\u2019accord\u2011cadre a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit comme \u00e9tant une \u00ab r\u00e9alisation des plus imposantes \u00bb (Beckman c.

Il a cr\u00e9\u00e9 un r\u00e9gime visant l\u2019exercice de l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale autochtone et la gestion du territoire et des ressources par les premi\u00e8res nations du Yukon. Aux termes de trait\u00e9s conclus apr\u00e8s de \u00ab longues n\u00e9gociations entre des parties qui sont averties et disposent de ressources importantes \u00bb, les premi\u00e8res nations du Yukon \u00ab ont c\u00e9d\u00e9 leurs droits ancestraux sur presque 484 000 kilom\u00e8tres carr\u00e9s, soit environ la superficie de l\u2019Espagne, contre des droits d\u00e9finis par trait\u00e9s au chapitre de la tenure et une certaine quantit\u00e9 de terres vis\u00e9es par le r\u00e8glement (41 595 kilom\u00e8tres carr\u00e9s), l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux terres de la Couronne, \u00e0 la r\u00e9colte de poissons et d\u2019animaux sauvages et aux ressources patrimoniales, une indemnisation p\u00e9cuniaire et la participation \u00e0 la gestion des ressources publiques \u00bb (par. 9).\n[16] L\u2019accord\u2011cadre a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9 de \u00ab mod\u00e8le \u00e0 suivre sur la voie de la r\u00e9conciliation \u00bb (First Nation of Nacho Nyak Dun c. Yukon, 2017 CSC 58, [2017] 2 R.C.S. 576, par. 10). Les 11 trait\u00e9s sp\u00e9cifiques qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9goci\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019accord-cadre contribuent \u00e0 la r\u00e9conciliation \u00ab non seulement en r\u00e9pondant aux griefs relatifs aux revendications territoriales, mais en cr\u00e9ant le fondement juridique propre \u00e0 favoriser une relation \u00e0 long terme harmonieuse \u00bb entre les communaut\u00e9s autochtones et non autochtones et en inscrivant cette relation \u00ab dans le syst\u00e8me juridique g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, avec les avantages que cela pr\u00e9sente au plan de la continuit\u00e9, de la transparence et de la pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 \u00bb (Beckman, par. 10 et 12). Les trait\u00e9s du Yukon sont des trait\u00e9s modernes de \u00ab nature sui generis \u00bb qui \u00ab \u00e9nonce[nt] en des termes pr\u00e9cis une relation de gouvernance ax\u00e9e sur la collaboration \u00bb (First Nation of Nacho Nyak Dun, par. 33).\n(2) L\u2019Entente d\u00e9finitive de la VGFN\n[17] En 1993, la VGFN ainsi que le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et celui du Yukon ont conclu l\u2019Entente d\u00e9finitive de la premi\u00e8re nation des Gwitchin Vuntut, un accord portant r\u00e8glement de revendications territoriales en vertu de l\u2019accord\u2011cadre. L\u2019Entente d\u00e9finitive pr\u00e9voit la n\u00e9gociation d\u2019une entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale concernant de nombreux pouvoirs de la VGFN en la mati\u00e8re \u00ab conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la Constitution du Canada \u00bb (art. 24.1.2). Elle pr\u00e9voit \u00e9galement que toute entente en mati\u00e8re d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale \u00ab n\u2019[a] [. . .] pour effet de porter atteinte \u00bb ni aux droits des membres de la VGFN \u00ab en tant que citoyens canadiens \u00bb ni, sauf disposition contraire d\u2019une entente en mati\u00e8re d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale ou d\u2019une loi adopt\u00e9e en vertu d\u2019une telle entente, \u00e0 leur droit \u00ab de jouir de tous les services, avantages et mesures de protection reconnus aux autres citoyens \u00bb (art. 24.1.3). L\u2019Entente d\u00e9finitive pr\u00e9cise notamment que, pour lui permettre d\u2019\u00eatre exon\u00e9r\u00e9e d\u2019imp\u00f4t en vertu du par. 149(1) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, L.R.C. 1985, c. 1 (5e suppl.), la VGFN se voit conf\u00e9rer le statut de \u00ab municipalit\u00e9 ou organisme public remplissant une fonction gouvernementale ou [de] corporation municipale \u00bb (art. 24.8.1). Sauf convention contraire, la VGFN est limit\u00e9e \u00ab \u00e0 la prestation de services gouvernementaux ou d\u2019autres services publics \u00bb, et elle ne peut exercer des activit\u00e9s commerciales (art. 24.8.2).\n[18] \u00c0 l\u2019instar des autres ententes conclues avec des premi\u00e8res nations du Yukon en mati\u00e8re de revendications territoriales, l\u2019Entente d\u00e9finitive de la VGFN a \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9e et mise en vigueur par des textes l\u00e9gislatifs f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et territorial. L\u2019entente a \u00e9galement obtenu le statut de trait\u00e9 en vertu de l\u2019art. 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 (voir Loi sur le r\u00e8glement des revendications territoriales des premi\u00e8res nations du Yukon, L.C. 1994, c. 34, par. 6(1); Loi approuvant les ententes d\u00e9finitives avec les Premi\u00e8res nations du Yukon, L.R.Y. 2002, c. 240, art. 2). La loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale pr\u00e9cise que la Loi sur les Indiens, L.R.C. 1985, c. I\u20115, ne s\u2019applique plus aux terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es de la VGFN, mais que, sous r\u00e9serve de cela, les r\u00e8gles de droit f\u00e9d\u00e9rales et territoriales continuent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement de s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 la VGFN et \u00e0 ses terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es (Loi sur le r\u00e8glement des revendications territoriales des premi\u00e8res nations du Yukon, art. 12 et 13).\n(3) L\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale de la VGFN, la l\u00e9gislation sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale et la Constitution de la VGFN\na) L\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale de la VGFN\n[19] Comme l\u2019envisageait l\u2019Entente d\u00e9finitive, la VGFN de m\u00eame que le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et celui du Yukon ont conclu l\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale de la premi\u00e8re nation des Gwitchin Vuntut (1993), qui reconna\u00eet \u00e0 la VGFN des pouvoirs d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale, y compris le pouvoir d\u2019adopter sa propre Constitution (art. 10.0), des pouvoirs l\u00e9gislatifs (art. 13.0) et des pouvoirs en mati\u00e8re de taxation (art. 14.0).\n[20] Comme l\u2019exige l\u2019Entente d\u00e9finitive, l\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale \u00ab ne porte pas atteinte aux droits des citoyens [de la VGFN] en tant que citoyens canadiens \u00bb ni, sauf disposition contraire pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019Entente ou dans une loi \u00e9dict\u00e9e par la VGFN, \u00ab au droit des citoyens [de la VGFN] de jouir de tous les avantages, services et protections reconnus ou \u00e9ventuellement reconnus aux autres citoyens canadiens \u00bb (art. 3.6).\n[21] Contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019Entente d\u00e9finitive, l\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale n\u2019a pas le statut de trait\u00e9 au sens de l\u2019art. 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 (Entente d\u00e9finitive, art. 24.12.1). Cela n\u2019emp\u00eache toutefois pas la VGFN d\u2019acqu\u00e9rir ult\u00e9rieurement une protection constitutionnelle pour son autonomie gouvernementale en vertu de futures modifications constitutionnelles, si la VGFN et le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral s\u2019entendent \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard (Entente d\u00e9finitive, art. 24.12.2).\n[22] La VGFN dit que l\u2019Entente d\u00e9finitive et l\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale sont muettes en ce qui concerne l\u2019application de la Charte et que, au cours des n\u00e9gociations, elle s\u2019est oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019adoption de dispositions qui auraient eu pour effet de soumettre l\u2019exercice de son autonomie gouvernementale \u00e0 la Charte. Sa position est la suivante : la [traduction] \u00ab VGFN n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u2019accord pour que la Charte s\u2019applique. [Elle a] plut\u00f4t adopt\u00e9 [sa] propre Constitution, qui prot\u00e8ge les droits individuels de ses citoyens dans le cadre de l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale contemporaine de la VGFN \u00bb (m.i., par. 3).\nb) La l\u00e9gislation sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale\n[23] L\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale de la VGFN a \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9e et mise en vigueur par des lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et territoriale (Loi sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale des premi\u00e8res nations du Yukon, L.C. 1994, c. 35; Loi sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale des premi\u00e8res nations du Yukon, L.R.Y. 2002, c. 90). La loi du Yukon approuve les diff\u00e9rentes ententes sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale et leur conf\u00e8re \u00ab force de loi \u00bb (art. 2). La loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale encadre de fa\u00e7on plus d\u00e9taill\u00e9e l\u2019exercice par les premi\u00e8res nations du Yukon de leurs pouvoirs d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale :\n\u2022 Les accords sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale des premi\u00e8res nations du Yukon doivent \u00eatre \u00ab conformes \u00e0 la Constitution du Canada \u00bb (pr\u00e9ambule).\n\u2022 Chaque premi\u00e8re nation du Yukon est \u00ab une entit\u00e9 juridique dot\u00e9e de la capacit\u00e9 d\u2019une personne physique \u00bb (art. 7). Elle est par ailleurs \u00ab substitu\u00e9e dans les droits et obligations de la bande ant\u00e9rieure [qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 constitu\u00e9e en tant que bande en vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens et] la bande cesse d\u00e8s lors d\u2019exister \u00bb (art. 2, par. 6(1) et ann. I).\n\u2022 La constitution d\u2019une premi\u00e8re nation du Yukon doit notamment pr\u00e9voir, \u00ab conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019accord qui la concerne, [. . .] la composition et les attributions de ses corps dirigeants, ainsi que les r\u00e8gles de fonctionnement qui les r\u00e9gissent \u00bb et \u00ab la reconnaissance et la protection des droits et libert\u00e9s de ses citoyens \u00bb (al. 8(1)b) et d)).\n\u2022 Les r\u00e8gles de droit f\u00e9d\u00e9rales et territoriales s\u2019appliquent aux premi\u00e8res nations du Yukon (art. 16), sauf la Loi sur les Indiens, qui ne s\u2019applique plus aux premi\u00e8res nations du Yukon, \u00e0 l\u2019exception de ses dispositions sur le droit des citoyens des premi\u00e8res nations du Yukon \u00e0 l\u2019inscription \u00e0 titre d\u2019\u00ab Indiens \u00bb (par. 17(1)).\n\u2022 La loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale prescrit des r\u00e8gles et des proc\u00e9dures qui encadrent l\u2019exercice, par une premi\u00e8re nation du Yukon, de son pouvoir de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer. Les premi\u00e8res nations du Yukon doivent maintenir un registre des textes l\u00e9gislatifs et adopter des proc\u00e9dures pour en assurer la consignation; et la loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e9nonce des r\u00e8gles concernant l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur et le mode de preuve des textes l\u00e9gislatifs (art. 10). La loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e9num\u00e8re \u00e9galement les pouvoirs l\u00e9gislatifs que les premi\u00e8res nations du Yukon peuvent exercer (art. 11 et ann. III).\n\u2022 Chaque premi\u00e8re nation du Yukon est r\u00e9put\u00e9e constituer \u00ab un organisme public remplissant une fonction gouvernementale au Canada \u00bb pour pouvoir b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de l\u2019exon\u00e9ration d\u2019imp\u00f4t pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019al. 149(1)c) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu (par. 18(1)).\n\u2022 Il est entendu que les terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es des premi\u00e8res nations du Yukon \u00ab demeurent toutefois des terres r\u00e9serv\u00e9es pour les Indiens au sens du point 24 de l\u2019article 91 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 \u00bb (par. 22(4)).\nc) La Constitution de la VGFN\n[24] Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, la Constitution de la VGFN d\u00e9finit les r\u00e8gles de gouvernance de la VGFN et \u00e9nonce qu\u2019elle constitue la loi supr\u00eame de la VGFN, sous r\u00e9serve uniquement de l\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale de la VGFN (article II(3)). La Constitution de la VGFN pr\u00e9voit que [traduction] \u00ab [l]e si\u00e8ge du gouvernement de la Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation est situ\u00e9 sur les terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es \u00bb (article II(2)). Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, l\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale d\u00e9cr\u00e8te qu\u2019elle \u00ab ne porte pas atteinte aux droits des citoyens [de la VGFN] en tant que citoyens canadiens \u00bb (art. 3.6.1).\n[25] Les droits et libert\u00e9s \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la Constitution de la VGFN [traduction] \u00ab ne peuvent [eux\u2011m\u00eames] \u00eatre restreints que dans des limites raisonnables dont la justification puisse se d\u00e9montrer dans le cadre d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Vuntut Gwitchin libre et d\u00e9mocratique \u00bb (article IV(1)). La Constitution de la VGFN garantit certains droits aux citoyens de la VGFN (article IV) et d\u00e9clare notamment que les lois de la VGFN ne font acception de personne et s\u2019appliquent \u00e9galement \u00e0 tous, et que tous ont droit \u00e0 la m\u00eame protection et au m\u00eame b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de la loi de la VGFN, ind\u00e9pendamment de toute discrimination (article IV(7)). La Constitution reconna\u00eet \u00e0 chaque citoyen de la VGFN [traduction] \u00ab le droit de faire des choix politiques, de participer \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s politiques et d\u2019exprimer son point de vue sur toute question d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00bb (article IV(3)). La Constitution d\u00e9crit \u00e9galement l\u2019organisation du gouvernement de la VGFN (article V), et \u00e9tablit un conseil \u00e9lu charg\u00e9 de gouverner la VGFN, compos\u00e9 d\u2019un chef et de quatre conseillers (article VIII).\n[26] Selon la Constitution de la VGFN, tout citoyen de la VGFN qui souhaite se porter candidat au poste de chef ou de conseiller doit \u00eatre \u00e2g\u00e9 d\u2019au moins 18 ans et ne doit pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu coupable d\u2019un acte criminel au cours des cinq ann\u00e9es qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent l\u2019\u00e9lection (article XI(1)). Les candidats doivent \u00e9galement satisfaire \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence : ils doivent r\u00e9sider sur les terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es de la VGFN ou y d\u00e9m\u00e9nager [traduction] \u00ab dans les 14 jours qui suivent le jour de l\u2019\u00e9lection \u00bb (article XI(2)). Il s\u2019agit de la disposition que conteste Mme Dickson.\n[27] La validit\u00e9 des textes l\u00e9gislatifs de la VGFN (y compris sa Constitution) peut \u00eatre contest\u00e9e devant la Cour supr\u00eame du Yukon jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que la VGFN \u00e9tablisse son propre tribunal (article II(5)). \u00c0 ce jour, aucun tribunal de la VGFN n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 constitu\u00e9.\nIII. Historique judiciaire\nA. Cour supr\u00eame du Yukon, 2020 YKSC 22, 461 C.R.R. (2d) 230 (le juge en chef Veale)\n[28] Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a rejet\u00e9 la contestation constitutionnelle de Mme Dickson qui visait l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence pr\u00e9vue par la Constitution de la VGFN. Il a reconnu que la Charte s\u2019appliquait \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence, mais a jug\u00e9 que cette exigence ne viole pas le par. 15(1), \u00e0 l\u2019exception de la r\u00e8gle du d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement dans les 14 jours, qu\u2019il aurait retranch\u00e9e. Subsidiairement, le premier juge a statu\u00e9 que, m\u00eame si l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence viole le par. 15(1) de la Charte, l\u2019art. 25 de la Charte agit comme bouclier pour emp\u00eacher que des droits prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par la Charte, comme ceux garantis \u00e0 Mme Dickson par le par. 15(1), portent atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019exercice de droits \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale par la VGFN.\n[29] Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a reconnu qu\u2019on [traduction] \u00ab ne trouve ni dans l\u2019Entente d\u00e9finitive de la VGFN ni dans l\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale de la VGFN de disposition indiquant explicitement que la Charte ne s\u2019applique pas au gouvernement de la VGFN \u00bb (par. 118). Il a fait remarquer que l\u2019Entente d\u00e9finitive et l\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale [traduction] \u00ab ne font pas express\u00e9ment mention de l\u2019application de la Charte \u00bb (par. 110). Il a ajout\u00e9 que, suivant l\u2019art. 24.1.2 de l\u2019Entente d\u00e9finitive, l\u2019entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale \u00e0 n\u00e9gocier devait \u00eatre [traduction] \u00ab conforme \u00e0 la Constitution du Canada \u00bb, qui comprend la Charte (par. 110).\n[30] Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a conclu que la Charte s\u2019appliquait \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence inscrite dans la Constitution de la VGFN, peu importe que l\u2019on consid\u00e8re l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence comme l\u2019exercice d\u2019un droit inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale, ou comme [traduction] \u00ab la mise en application de l\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale de la VGFN au moyen de textes l\u00e9gislatifs f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et territorial \u00bb (par. 130). Il a \u00e9galement statu\u00e9 que [traduction] \u00ab [l]es deux font partie du tissu constitutionnel du Canada \u00bb (par. 130). Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a estim\u00e9 que [traduction] \u00ab [l]e gouvernement, la Constitution et les textes l\u00e9gislatifs de la VGFN font partie du tissu constitutionnel du Canada \u00bb (par. 131). \u00c0 son avis, la Charte s\u2019applique au gouvernement, \u00e0 la Constitution et aux lois de la VGFN, et [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019exercice des droits et libert\u00e9s qui sont garantis par la Charte aux citoyens de la VGFN fait partie des droits qui leur sont reconnus en tant que citoyens canadiens \u00bb (par. 131). Comme la VGFN agit en tant que gouvernement et exerce des activit\u00e9s gouvernementales, elle est assujettie \u00e0 la Charte (par. 131).\n[31] Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a rejet\u00e9 la contestation de l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Mme Dickson sur le fondement du par. 15(1) de la Charte et n\u2019a pas examin\u00e9 le moyen subsidiaire qu\u2019elle avait avanc\u00e9 sur le fondement de la garantie d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 que lui reconna\u00eet la Constitution de la VGFN. Il a conclu que le fait d\u2019obliger un parlementaire salari\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9sider sur des terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es qui seront au c\u0153ur de la fonction l\u00e9gislative exerc\u00e9e par le chef et le Conseil ne constituait pas une mesure discriminatoire (par. 156). Il a toutefois jug\u00e9 que la r\u00e8gle du d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement dans les 14 jours cr\u00e9e un d\u00e9savantage susceptible d\u2019entra\u00eener une privation arbitraire du droit de se porter candidate, en contravention du par. 15(1) de la Charte, et que cette r\u00e8gle ne peut se justifier au regard de l\u2019article premier de la Charte (par. 162\u2011165). Il a retranch\u00e9 cet aspect de l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence, mais a suspendu l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de la d\u00e9claration d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 pour 18 mois afin de donner \u00e0 la VGFN le temps de revoir la question avant la date des prochaines \u00e9lections (par. 166\u2011171).\n[32] Subsidiairement, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a ajout\u00e9 que, si l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence viole le par. 15(1) de la Charte m\u00eame une fois les mots [traduction] \u00ab dans les 14 jours qui suivent le jour de l\u2019\u00e9lection \u00bb retranch\u00e9s, l\u2019art. 25 de la Charte a pour effet de \u00ab prot\u00e9ger \u00bb le droit de la VGFN d\u2019inscrire cette obligation dans sa Constitution. \u00c0 son avis, le droit de Mme Dickson d\u2019\u00eatre \u00e9lue mais de demeurer \u00e0 Whitehorse, \u00e0 quelque 800 kilom\u00e8tres des terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es de la VGFN, porterait atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence que la VGFN a constitutionnalis\u00e9e en sa qualit\u00e9 de premi\u00e8re nation autonome (par. 210).\nB. Cour d\u2019appel du Yukon, 2021 YKCA 5, 495 C.R.R. (2d) 98 (le juge en chef Bauman et la juge Newbury, le juge Frankel (dissident en partie))\n[33] Madame Dickson a interjet\u00e9 appel de la d\u00e9cision du juge de premi\u00e8re instance au motif qu\u2019il avait commis une erreur en concluant que seule la r\u00e8gle du d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement dans les 14 jours viole le par. 15(1) de la Charte, et, subsidiairement, que l\u2019art. 25 de la Charte prot\u00e8ge toute violation. La VGFN a form\u00e9 un appel incident \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la d\u00e9cision du juge de premi\u00e8re instance portant que la Charte s\u2019applique \u00e0 la VGFN et \u00e0 sa Constitution, et que la r\u00e8gle du d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement viole le par. 15(1) de la Charte.\n[34] Les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel du Yukon ont accueilli l\u2019appel de Mme Dickson et l\u2019appel incident de la VGFN, concluant que l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence (y compris la r\u00e8gle du d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement dans les 14 jours) ne viole pas la Charte. La cour a reconnu que la Charte s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence et a jug\u00e9 que l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence dans son ensemble viole le par. 15(1) de la Charte, mais a conclu que l\u2019art. 25 de la Charte emp\u00eache les droits individuels garantis par la Charte de porter atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence. Le juge Frankel a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 une opinion partiellement dissidente en ce qui concerne le dispositif pr\u00e9cis de l\u2019appel et la question de savoir si la cour devrait rendre des jugements d\u00e9claratoires, mais notre Cour n\u2019est pas saisie de ces questions. Il a souscrit aux motifs des juges majoritaires selon lesquels la contestation de l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence formul\u00e9e par Mme Dickson sur le fondement de la Charte devait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e. Il s\u2019est \u00e9galement dit d\u2019accord avec les juges majoritaires pour annuler le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance et rejeter la requ\u00eate. Il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u2019avis que l\u2019ordonnance de la cour devait contenir des jugements d\u00e9claratoires. Il aurait rejet\u00e9 l\u2019appel de Mme Dickson, accueilli l\u2019appel incident de la VGFN et se serait abstenu de rendre les jugements d\u00e9claratoires figurant dans le dispositif des juges majoritaires.\n[35] Bien que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance ait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son ordonnance que la Charte s\u2019applique [traduction] \u00ab au gouvernement, \u00e0 la Constitution et aux textes l\u00e9gislatifs \u00bb de la VGFN, la Cour d\u2019appel a circonscrit la question \u00e0 celle de savoir si la Charte s\u2019applique sp\u00e9cifiquement \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence (par. 74 et 83). En ce qui concerne la question de savoir si l\u2019Entente d\u00e9finitive et l\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale traitaient express\u00e9ment de l\u2019application de la Charte \u00e0 la VGFN, la Cour d\u2019appel a fait observer que, [traduction] \u00ab tout comme les n\u00e9gociateurs de la VGFN ne souhaitaient pas reconna\u00eetre qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient assujettis \u00e0 la Charte, les n\u00e9gociateurs du Canada ne pouvaient pas \u00eatre per\u00e7us comme avalisant des \u201czones soustraites \u00e0 la Charte\u201d, vu le statut de la Charte en tant que \u201cloi supr\u00eame\u201d du Canada \u00bb (par. 97). La cour a affirm\u00e9 que l\u2019Entente d\u00e9finitive et l\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale appuient la th\u00e8se selon laquelle la Charte s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence, et que tous les citoyens de la VGFN [traduction] \u00ab continuent de jouir des droits que leur reconna\u00eet la Charte au m\u00eame titre que les autres citoyens du Canada \u00bb (par. 97).\n[36] La Cour d\u2019appel a reconnu que la Charte s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence, et ce, que le pouvoir de la VGFN d\u2019imposer cette obligation d\u00e9coule de son droit inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale ou encore de l\u2019Entente d\u00e9finitive et de l\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale de la VGFN telles que ratifi\u00e9es par des lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales et territoriales. La Cour d\u2019appel a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que, dans un cas comme dans l\u2019autre, la VGFN exerce [traduction] \u00ab de par sa nature m\u00eame \u00bb des pouvoirs gouvernementaux au sens du par. 32(1) de la Charte, de sorte que la Charte s\u2019applique (par. 98).\n[37] La Cour d\u2019appel a conclu que l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence viole le par. 15(1) de la Charte en obligeant Mme Dickson \u00e0 choisir entre le droit de briguer un poste et le droit de demeurer \u00e0 Whitehorse (par. 110 et 112). Elle a toutefois jug\u00e9 que l\u2019art. 25 de la Charte \u00ab prot\u00e8ge \u00bb l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence dans son int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 (par. 149 et 158). Comme l\u2019a expliqu\u00e9 la cour, [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019application du par. 15(1) porterait effectivement atteinte aux droits des Vuntut Gwitchin de se gouverner eux\u2011m\u00eames \u00bb conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 leurs valeurs, \u00e0 leurs traditions et \u00e0 leurs ententes en mati\u00e8re d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale (par. 149). Par cons\u00e9quent, la cour a conclu \u00e0 la validit\u00e9 de l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence, y compris de la r\u00e8gle du d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement dans les 14 jours. Elle a \u00e9galement soulign\u00e9 que, bien que Mme Dickson ait plaid\u00e9 l\u2019appel sur le fondement de la Charte, elle [traduction] \u00ab pourrait d\u00e9cider ult\u00e9rieurement de faire valoir un moyen similaire en se fondant sur la Constitution de la VGFN \u00bb (par. 157), moyen qu\u2019elle avait invoqu\u00e9 \u00e0 titre subsidiaire dans sa requ\u00eate, mais que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance n\u2019avait pas examin\u00e9.\nIV. Dispositions constitutionnelles pertinentes\n[38] Les dispositions pertinentes de la Charte et de la Constitution de la VGFN sont r\u00e9dig\u00e9es ainsi :\nCharte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s\n1 La Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s garantit les droits et libert\u00e9s qui y sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9s. Ils ne peuvent \u00eatre restreints que par une r\u00e8gle de droit, dans des limites qui soient raisonnables et dont la justification puisse se d\u00e9montrer dans le cadre d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 libre et d\u00e9mocratique.\n15 (1) La loi ne fait acception de personne et s\u2019applique \u00e9galement \u00e0 tous, et tous ont droit \u00e0 la m\u00eame protection et au m\u00eame b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de la loi, ind\u00e9pendamment de toute discrimination, notamment des discriminations fond\u00e9es sur la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, le sexe, l\u2019\u00e2ge ou les d\u00e9ficiences mentales ou physiques.\n25 Le fait que la pr\u00e9sente charte garantit certains droits et libert\u00e9s ne porte pas atteinte aux droits ou libert\u00e9s \u2014 ancestraux, issus de trait\u00e9s ou autres \u2014 des peuples autochtones du Canada, notamment :\na) aux droits ou libert\u00e9s reconnus par la proclamation royale du 7 octobre 1763;\nb) aux droits ou libert\u00e9s existants issus d\u2019accords sur des revendications territoriales ou ceux susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre ainsi acquis.\n32 (1) La pr\u00e9sente charte s\u2019applique :\na) au Parlement et au gouvernement du Canada, pour tous les domaines relevant du Parlement, y compris ceux qui concernent le territoire du Yukon et les territoires du Nord\u2011Ouest;\nb) \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislature et au gouvernement de chaque province, pour tous les domaines relevant de cette l\u00e9gislature.\nConstitution de la Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation\n[traduction]\nARTICLE II \u2014 AUTORIT\u00c9\/SI\u00c8GE DE LA VUNTUT GWITCHIN FIRST NATION\n2. Le si\u00e8ge du gouvernement de la Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation est situ\u00e9 sur les terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es sur l\u2019avis de l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n3. La pr\u00e9sente Constitution est la loi supr\u00eame de la Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation, sous r\u00e9serve seulement :\na) de l\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale de la premi\u00e8re nation des Gwitchin Vuntut;\nb) des droits et libert\u00e9s \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la pr\u00e9sente Constitution.\nARTICLE XI \u2014 MANDAT ET QUALIT\u00c9S REQUISES\n1. Quiconque d\u00e9sire se porter candidat au poste de chef ou de conseiller doit satisfaire aux exigences suivantes :\na) \u00eatre \u00e2g\u00e9 d\u2019au moins 18 ans;\nb) r\u00e9sider habituellement au Canada;\nc) ne pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu coupable d\u2019un acte criminel au cours des 5 ann\u00e9es qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent l\u2019\u00e9lection;\nd) \u00eatre citoyen [de la VGFN].\n2. Si un candidat \u00e9ligible au poste de chef ou de conseiller ne r\u00e9side pas sur les terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es au moment de l\u2019\u00e9lection et remporte le si\u00e8ge qu\u2019il convoite, il doit d\u00e9m\u00e9nager sur les terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es dans les 14 jours qui suivent le jour de l\u2019\u00e9lection.\nV. Questions en litige\n[39] Le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi soul\u00e8ve deux questions. La premi\u00e8re consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si la Charte s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence impos\u00e9e par la VGFN. Dans l\u2019affirmative, la seconde question consiste \u00e0 se demander si cette obligation viole de mani\u00e8re injustifiable le par. 15(1) de la Charte en interdisant \u00e0 Mme Dickson de si\u00e9ger au Conseil de la VGFN \u00e0 moins qu\u2019elle ne d\u00e9m\u00e9nage de Whitehorse \u00e0 Old Crow dans les 14 jours suivant son \u00e9lection au Conseil de la VGFN. La deuxi\u00e8me question am\u00e8ne la Cour \u00e0 se pencher sur le cadre d\u2019analyse permettant de d\u00e9terminer si, interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 ad\u00e9quatement, le droit garanti \u00e0 Mme Dickson par le par. 15(1) de la Charte porte atteinte \u00e0 des droits ou libert\u00e9s \u2014 ancestraux, issus de trait\u00e9s ou autres \u2014 des peuples autochtones du Canada vis\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25 de la Charte, ainsi que sur les cons\u00e9quences qui s\u2019ensuivent selon qu\u2019il y a atteinte ou non.\nVI. Analyse\nA. La Charte s\u2019applique\u2011t\u2011elle \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence de la VGFN?\n(1) Le paragraphe 32(1) de la Charte : Principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux\n[40] L\u2019application de la Charte est trait\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on plus particuli\u00e8re au par. 32(1) :\n32 (1) La pr\u00e9sente charte s\u2019applique :\na) au Parlement et au gouvernement du Canada, pour tous les domaines relevant du Parlement, y compris ceux qui concernent le territoire du Yukon et les territoires du Nord\u2011Ouest;\nb) \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislature et au gouvernement de chaque province, pour tous les domaines relevant de cette l\u00e9gislature.\n[41] Le paragraphe 32(1) \u00e9num\u00e8re certaines entit\u00e9s auxquelles la Charte s\u2019applique, dont la l\u00e9gislature et le gouvernement de chaque province pour les domaines de comp\u00e9tence provinciale, de m\u00eame que le Parlement et le gouvernement du Canada pour les domaines de comp\u00e9tence f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, y compris ceux qui concernent les gouvernements territoriaux et les domaines relevant de leur comp\u00e9tence. Par cons\u00e9quent, selon le par. 32(1), la Charte s\u2019applique de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale aux branches l\u00e9gislative, ex\u00e9cutive et administrative du gouvernement pour tous les domaines qui rel\u00e8vent de leur autorit\u00e9 (Greater Vancouver Transportation Authority c. F\u00e9d\u00e9ration canadienne des \u00e9tudiantes et \u00e9tudiants \u2014 Section Colombie\u2011Britannique, 2009 CSC 31, [2009] 2 R.C.S. 295, par. 14; SDGMR c. Dolphin Delivery Ltd., [1986] 2 R.C.S. 573, p. 598).\n[42] Le paragraphe 32(1) envisage en outre explicitement la possibilit\u00e9 que la Charte s\u2019applique \u00e0 d\u2019autres entit\u00e9s que le Parlement, les l\u00e9gislatures ou les gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, provinciaux ou territoriaux. C\u2019est le cas parce que le par. 32(1) s\u2019applique aux \u00ab domaines relevant \u00bb de l\u2019assembl\u00e9e l\u00e9gislative qui a cr\u00e9\u00e9 les entit\u00e9s en question, ce qui englobe les \u00ab entit\u00e9s faisant l\u2019objet d\u2019un contr\u00f4le gouvernemental ou ex\u00e9cutant des fonctions v\u00e9ritablement gouvernementales \u00bb (Godbout c. Longueuil (Ville), [1997] 3 R.C.S. 844, par. 48).\n[43] Par cons\u00e9quent, tous les pouvoirs gouvernementaux exerc\u00e9s par le Parlement ou les l\u00e9gislatures en vertu de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 sont assujettis \u00e0 la Charte. Les mots \u00ab relevant du Parlement \u00bb et \u00ab relevant de [la] l\u00e9gislature [de chaque province] \u00bb aux al. 32(1)a) et b) renvoient au \u00ab partage des comp\u00e9tences pr\u00e9vu aux art. 91 et 92 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 \u00bb (Operation Dismantle Inc. c. La Reine, [1985] 1 R.C.S. 441, p. 463\u2011464, la juge Wilson, et p. 455, le juge Dickson (plus tard juge en chef), pour la majorit\u00e9). Ainsi que l\u2019ont fait remarquer les professeurs Peter W. Hogg et Wade K. Wright, l\u2019expression [traduction] \u00ab \u201cpour tous les domaines relevant de\u201d [. . .] a pour effet de limiter l\u2019application de la Charte aux textes l\u00e9gislatifs ressortissant au pouvoir du Parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou \u00e0 celui des l\u00e9gislatures des provinces selon le partage des comp\u00e9tences \u00bb (Constitutional Law of Canada (5e \u00e9d. suppl.), \u00a7 15:2; voir aussi H. Brun, G. Tremblay et E. Brouillet, Droit constitutionnel (6e \u00e9d. 2014), p. 971 et suiv.).\n[44] La formulation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale utilis\u00e9e au par. 32(1) de la Charte a pour objectif d\u2019emp\u00eacher le Parlement, les l\u00e9gislatures ainsi que les gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, provinciaux et territoriaux de se soustraire aux obligations que leur impose la Charte en d\u00e9l\u00e9guant une partie de leurs responsabilit\u00e9s ou de leurs pouvoirs l\u00e9gislatifs \u00e0 d\u2019autres entit\u00e9s qui ne sont pas normalement assujetties \u00e0 la Charte (Eldridge c. Colombie\u2011Britannique (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), [1997] 3 R.C.S. 624, par. 42; Godbout, par. 48; Greater Vancouver Transportation Authority, par. 14 et 22).\n[45] En tant que point d\u2019entr\u00e9e pour l\u2019application de la Charte, le par. 32(1) de la Charte doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019une mani\u00e8re souple, t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique et lib\u00e9rale, plut\u00f4t que technique, \u00e9troite ou l\u00e9galiste. Une telle interpr\u00e9tation permet de faire en sorte que les individus et les minorit\u00e9s collectives concern\u00e9s b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient pleinement des mesures de protection que leur accorde la Charte et d\u2019emp\u00eacher l\u2019action gouvernementale qui serait incompatible avec ces protections (R. c. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., [1985] 1 R.C.S. 295, p. 344; Hunter c. Southam Inc., [1984] 2 R.C.S. 145, p. 156; Hogg et Wright, \u00a736:18\u201136:20). Les mots employ\u00e9s au par. 32(1) indiquent que \u00ab l\u2019application de la Charte se restreint \u00e0 l\u2019action gouvernementale \u00bb et que la Charte est \u00ab essentiellement un instrument de contr\u00f4le des pouvoirs du gouvernement sur le particulier \u00bb (McKinney c. Universit\u00e9 de Guelph, [1990] 3 R.C.S. 229, p. 261).\n(2) L\u2019autonomie gouvernementale autochtone et la Charte\n[46] Avant de nous demander si la Charte s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence impos\u00e9e par la VGFN, il est utile de passer en revue le contexte historique et politique \u00e0 l\u2019origine de l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale autochtone au Canada, qui comprend notamment l\u2019Accord de Charlottetown de 1992, la \u00ab Politique sur le droit inh\u00e9rent \u00bb appliqu\u00e9e par le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral depuis 1995 et le Rapport final de la Commission royale sur les peuples autochtones publi\u00e9 en 1996. Il est \u00e9galement utile d\u2019examiner la mani\u00e8re dont les tribunaux ont syst\u00e9matiquement appliqu\u00e9 la Charte aux gouvernements autochtones.\n[47] D\u2019entr\u00e9e de jeu, nous soulignons que, bien que notre Cour n\u2019ait pas encore reconnu que le droit inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale autochtone constitue un droit ancestral prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par l\u2019art. 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 (voir R. c. Pamajewon, [1996] 2 R.C.S. 821, par. 24; Delgamuukw c. Colombie\u2011Britannique, [1997] 3 R.C.S. 1010, par. 171), un tel droit est maintenant affirm\u00e9 sur le plan international par l\u2019article 4 de la D\u00e9claration des Nations Unies sur les droits des peuples autochtones, Doc. N.U. A\/RES\/61\/295, 2 octobre 2007. En 2016, le gouvernement canadien a appuy\u00e9 la D\u00e9claration et s\u2019est engag\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019adopter et \u00e0 la mettre en \u0153uvre en conformit\u00e9 avec la Constitution canadienne. Une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale r\u00e9cente a confirm\u00e9 que la D\u00e9claration constituait \u00ab un instrument international universel en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne qui trouve application en droit canadien \u00bb, ajoutant que cette loi avait pour objet \u00ab d\u2019encadrer la mise en \u0153uvre de la D\u00e9claration par le gouvernement du Canada \u00bb (Loi sur la D\u00e9claration des Nations Unies sur les droits des peuples autochtones, L.C. 2021, c. 14 (\u00ab Loi sur la DNUDPA \u00bb), art. 4). \u00c0 titre d\u2019exemple, la D\u00e9claration a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en \u0153uvre sp\u00e9cifiquement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la prestation des services fournis aux enfants et aux familles autochtones aux termes de la Loi concernant les enfants, les jeunes et les familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations, des Inuits et des M\u00e9tis, L.C. 2019, c. 24 (voir Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la Loi concernant les enfants, les jeunes et les familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations, des Inuits et des M\u00e9tis, 2024 CSC 5).\na) L\u2019Accord de Charlottetown de 1992\n[48] Le paragraphe 32(1) de la Charte ne pr\u00e9voit pas express\u00e9ment que la Charte s\u2019applique aux gouvernements autochtones. Toutefois, le Projet de texte juridique de l\u2019Accord de Charlottetown de 1992 proposait de modifier l\u2019art. 32 de la Charte afin de reconna\u00eetre, \u00e0 l\u2019al. 32(1)c), que la Charte s\u2019applique \u00e0 \u00ab tous les corps l\u00e9gislatifs et gouvernements des peuples autochtones du Canada, pour tous les domaines relevant de leurs corps l\u00e9gislatifs respectifs \u00bb (p. 36). Elle proposait aussi d\u2019ins\u00e9rer dans la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 un nouvel art. 35.1, qui aurait notamment pr\u00e9vu que \u00ab [l]es peuples autochtones du Canada ont le droit inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale au sein du Canada \u00bb (p. 37). L\u2019Accord avait \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9 par les gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, provinciaux et territoriaux, ainsi que par l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e des Premi\u00e8res Nations, Inuit Tapirisat du Canada, le Conseil national des Autochtones du Canada et le Ralliement national des M\u00e9tis, mais n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 ratifi\u00e9, faute d\u2019avoir recueilli l\u2019appui de la majorit\u00e9 des Canadiens lors d\u2019un r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum national (voir Hogg et Wright, \u00a7 4:3 et 28:42). Il convient malgr\u00e9 tout de noter que ces propositions de modifications constitutionnelles consid\u00e9raient que le droit inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale \u00e9tait compatible avec l\u2019obligation des gouvernements autochtones de se conformer \u00e0 la Charte.\nb) Politique du gouvernemental f\u00e9d\u00e9ral depuis 1995\n[49] Depuis 1995, malgr\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9chec de l\u2019Accord de Charlottetown, la politique du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, d\u2019abord \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans sa \u00ab Politique sur le droit inh\u00e9rent \u00bb, a consist\u00e9 \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre que les peuples autochtones du Canada poss\u00e8dent un droit inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale garanti par l\u2019art. 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982, mais \u00e9galement \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer que la Charte s\u2019applique aux gouvernements autochtones. La politique reconna\u00eet le fait historique que les peuples autochtones vivaient dans des communaut\u00e9s autonomes avant l\u2019arriv\u00e9e des Europ\u00e9ens et vise \u00e0 s\u2019assurer que les gouvernements autochtones respectent la Charte, au m\u00eame titre que les autres gouvernements au Canada. Le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral consid\u00e8re que ces deux objectifs sont compatibles. Comme il l\u2019a expliqu\u00e9 dans sa \u00ab Politique sur le droit inh\u00e9rent \u00bb :\nLe gouvernement tient au respect du principe selon lequel tous les gouvernements du Canada sont li\u00e9s par la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s, de fa\u00e7on que l\u2019ensemble des Canadiens, tant les Autochtones que les non\u2011Autochtones, puissent continuer de jouir \u00e9galement des droits et libert\u00e9s garantis par la Charte. En cons\u00e9quence, les ententes en mati\u00e8re d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale, y compris les trait\u00e9s, devront pr\u00e9voir des dispositions mentionnant que la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s s\u2019applique aux gouvernements et institutions autochtones relativement \u00e0 toutes les questions relevant de leurs comp\u00e9tences et pouvoirs respectifs.\nD\u2019ailleurs, la Charte comporte d\u00e9j\u00e0 une disposition (l\u2019article 25) pr\u00e9cisant que celle\u2011ci n\u2019a pas pour effet de porter atteinte aux droits ancestraux et issus de trait\u00e9s, droits qui, selon l\u2019approche f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, comprennent le droit inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale. La Charte vise donc \u00e0 \u00e9tablir un juste \u00e9quilibre entre les droits et libert\u00e9s individuels et les valeurs et traditions propres aux peuples autochtones du Canada.\n(Relations Couronne\u2011Autochtones et Affaires du Nord Canada, L\u2019approche du gouvernement du Canada concernant la mise en \u0153uvre du droit inh\u00e9rent des peuples autochtones \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale et la n\u00e9gociation de cette autonomie, derni\u00e8re mise \u00e0 jour 1er mars 2023 (en ligne); voir aussi Relations Couronne\u2011Autochtones et Affaires du Nord Canada, Note d\u2019information g\u00e9n\u00e9rale sur les politiques relatives \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale et aux revendications territoriales globales du Canada et sur l\u2019\u00e9tat actuel des n\u00e9gociations, derni\u00e8re mise \u00e0 jour 16 ao\u00fbt 2016 (en ligne).)\n[50] Depuis 1995, le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral a n\u00e9goci\u00e9, avec des communaut\u00e9s autochtones de partout au Canada, de nombreuses ententes en mati\u00e8re d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale qui confirment que la Charte, la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, c. H\u20116, et le Code criminel, L.R.C. 1985, c. C\u201146, continuent de s\u2019appliquer aux peuples autochtones (Relations Couronne\u2011Autochtones et Affaires du Nord Canada, Autonomie gouvernementale, derni\u00e8re mise \u00e0 jour 25 ao\u00fbt 2020 (en ligne); voir, p. ex., l\u2019Accord d\u00e9finitif de la Premi\u00e8re Nation de Tsawwassen (2007), c. 2, art. 9, qui pr\u00e9voit que la Charte s\u2019applique au gouvernement tsawwassen en ce qui concerne toutes les mati\u00e8res relevant de sa comp\u00e9tence; Nisga\u2019a Final Agreement (1999), c. 2, art. 9; Accord d\u00e9finitif des premi\u00e8res nations maa\u2011nulthes (2009), art. 1.3.2). Le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral a \u00e9galement confirm\u00e9, en tant que principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, que les ententes sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale n\u00e9goci\u00e9es avant 1995 \u00ab continueront de s\u2019appliquer selon les modalit\u00e9s et conditions qu\u2019elles pr\u00e9voient \u00bb (L\u2019approche du gouvernement du Canada concernant la mise en \u0153uvre du droit inh\u00e9rent des peuples autochtones \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale et la n\u00e9gociation de cette autonomie). Cela inclut l\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale conclue avec la VGFN.\nc) Le d\u00e9bat sur la politique juridique concernant l\u2019application de la Charte aux gouvernements autochtones\n[51] Peu de temps apr\u00e8s la non-ratification de l\u2019Accord de Charlottetown de 1992, la Commission royale sur les peuples autochtones a \u00e9tudi\u00e9 en profondeur la question de savoir si la Charte devrait s\u2019appliquer aux gouvernements autochtones qui exercent des pouvoirs inh\u00e9rents d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale. La Commission royale a conclu que la Charte s\u2019appliquait, mais que, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25, \u00ab une certaine souplesse doit pr\u00e9sider \u00e0 son interpr\u00e9tation pour tenir compte des philosophies, des traditions et des pratiques culturelles propres aux peuples autochtones \u00bb (Rapport de la Commission royale sur les peuples autochtones (\u00ab Rapport final de la CRPA \u00bb), vol. 2, Une relation \u00e0 red\u00e9finir (1996), p. 258). Nous reviendrons plus loin sur l\u2019optique dans laquelle la Commission royale a abord\u00e9 le lien \u00e9troit entre les art. 32 et 25 de la Charte. Cette optique adopte une conception large de l\u2019application de la Charte aux gouvernements autochtones au regard du par. 32(1), mais interpr\u00e8te aussi la Charte \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de l\u2019art. 25, d\u2019une mani\u00e8re sensible aux droits collectifs des peuples autochtones, afin de prot\u00e9ger ce que la Commission royale appelle les \u00ab philosophies, [. . .] traditions et [. . .] pratiques culturelles propres aux peuples autochtones \u00bb \u2014 ou ce que le professeur Patrick Macklem a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 par l\u2019expression [traduction] \u00ab sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone \u00bb (Indigenous Difference and the Constitution of Canada (2001)). Comme nous l\u2019expliquons plus loin, l\u2019art. 25 a \u00e9t\u00e9 ins\u00e9r\u00e9 dans la Charte pour prot\u00e9ger les droits minoritaires distinctifs des peuples autochtones auxquels l\u2019application de droits individuels garantis par la Charte pourrait porter atteinte.\n[52] Le Rapport final de la CRPA, publi\u00e9 en 1996, propose deux fa\u00e7ons de d\u00e9cider si la Charte s\u2019applique aux gouvernements autochtones exer\u00e7ant des pouvoirs inh\u00e9rents d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale. Selon la premi\u00e8re approche, les gouvernements autochtones devraient \u00eatre assujettis \u00e0 la Charte en application des principes constitutionnels fondamentaux, car \u00ab il serait tout \u00e0 fait anormal [. . .] que les citoyens canadiens b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient de la protection de la Charte dans leurs rapports avec tous les gouvernements au Canada sauf les gouvernements autochtones \u00bb (vol. 2, p. 251). Selon cette approche, la Charte n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessairement incompatible avec les valeurs autochtones, puisque la Charte elle\u2011m\u00eame \u00ab s\u2019inspir[e] de normes internationales d\u2019application universelle \u00bb (p. 252).\n[53] Suivant la seconde approche expos\u00e9e dans le Rapport final de la CRPA, les gouvernements autochtones ne devraient pas \u00eatre assujettis \u00e0 la Charte, parce que les peuples autochtones n\u2019ont pas \u00ab exprim\u00e9 [leur] assentiment \u00e0 l\u2019application de la Charte dans un document constitutionnel contraignant, par exemple un trait\u00e9 d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale conclu avec la Couronne \u00bb (vol. 2, p. 252\u2011253). Toujours suivant cette approche, \u00ab certaines dispositions de la Charte refl\u00e8tent des valeurs individualistes qui sont fondamentalement contraires \u00e0 celles de nombreuses cultures autochtones, celles\u2011ci mettant davantage l\u2019accent sur les responsabilit\u00e9s de chacun \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la collectivit\u00e9 \u00bb (p. 254). Enfin, le fait d\u2019appliquer la Charte aux gouvernements autochtones \u00ab pourrait entraver, voire bloquer les efforts entrepris par les nations autochtones pour ranimer et renforcer leurs cultures et leurs traditions \u00bb et \u00ab risquerait ainsi de se mettre, malgr\u00e9 ses buts, au service des forces de l\u2019assimilation et de la domination \u00bb (p. 254).\n[54] Apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9tudi\u00e9 en profondeur ces questions, la Commission royale a opt\u00e9 pour une approche m\u00e9diane qui refl\u00e8te trois principes de base. Premi\u00e8rement, tous les Canadiens \u2014 qu\u2019ils soient autochtones ou non autochtones \u2014 ont \u00ab le droit de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de la protection des dispositions g\u00e9n\u00e9rales de la Charte dans leurs rapports avec les gouvernements au Canada, o\u00f9 qu\u2019[ils] se trouvent au Canada ou quel que soit le gouvernement concern\u00e9 \u00bb (p. 255). Deuxi\u00e8mement, \u00ab la position des gouvernements autochtones par rapport \u00e0 la Charte est fondamentalement identique \u00e0 celle des gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux \u00bb (p. 255). Troisi\u00e8mement, la Charte devrait s\u2019appliquer aux gouvernements autochtones et \u00eatre \u00ab interpr\u00e9t[\u00e9e] [. . .] en prenant largement en consid\u00e9ration les conceptions philosophiques, les cultures et les traditions distinctives des autochtones \u00bb en fonction de la \u00ab r\u00e8gle d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation [. . .] donn\u00e9e par l\u2019article 25 de la Charte \u00bb (p. 255).\n[55] La Commission royale a donc propos\u00e9, dans ses recommandations finales, que la Charte s\u2019applique aux gouvernements autochtones, mais que, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25, elle soit interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e avec souplesse pour tenir compte des philosophies, des traditions et des pratiques culturelles propres aux peuples autochtones (Rapport final de la CRPA, vol. 2, p. 258\u2011259; voir aussi Commission royale sur les peuples autochtones, Partenaires au sein de la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration : Les peuples autochtones, l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale et la Constitution (1993), p. 39\u201142; Commission royale sur les peuples autochtones, Par\u2011del\u00e0 les divisions culturelles : Un rapport sur les autochtones et la justice p\u00e9nale au Canada (1996), p. 286\u2011289).\n[56] Le d\u00e9bat sur la question de savoir si la Charte devrait s\u2019appliquer aux gouvernements autochtones est complexe et a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 une abondante doctrine appuyant l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre th\u00e8se, dont la Commission royale s\u2019est inspir\u00e9e, en partie, pour tirer ses conclusions et faire ses recommandations (voir, p. ex., B.

Canada (Ministre des Affaires indiennes et du Nord canadien), [1999] 2 R.C.S. 203; Taypotat c. Taypotat, 2013 CAF 192, par. 36\u201139 (CanLII), inf. par 2015 CSC 30, [2015] 2 R.C.S. 548; McCarthy c.

Napash, 2014 QCCQ 10367, [2015] 1 C.N.L.R. 16, par. 49\u2011106).\n[59] Nous allons maintenant examiner plus en d\u00e9tail le cadre juridique de l\u2019application du par. 32(1) de la Charte, puis l\u2019appliquer \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence impos\u00e9e par la VGFN.\n(3) Le cadre d\u2019analyse de l\u2019arr\u00eat Eldridge pour l\u2019application du par. 32(1) de la Charte\n[60] Une jurisprudence abondante a \u00e9tudi\u00e9 la question de l\u2019application de la Charte aux termes du par. 32(1).

Il a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019une entit\u00e9 pouvait \u00eatre assujettie \u00e0 la Charte de deux mani\u00e8res. Premi\u00e8rement, une entit\u00e9 peut \u00eatre jug\u00e9e faire partie du \u00ab gouvernement \u00bb pour l\u2019application du par. 32(1) si elle peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme un gouvernement de par sa nature m\u00eame ou en raison du degr\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le gouvernemental exerc\u00e9 sur elle. En pareil cas, toutes les activit\u00e9s de l\u2019entit\u00e9 sont assujetties \u00e0 la Charte. Deuxi\u00e8mement, m\u00eame si l\u2019entit\u00e9 elle\u2011m\u00eame ne fait pas partie du \u00ab gouvernement \u00bb pour l\u2019application du par. 32(1), elle sera assujettie \u00e0 la Charte pour ce qui est de ses activit\u00e9s qui peuvent \u00eatre attribu\u00e9es au gouvernement parce qu\u2019elles sont \u00ab de nature \u201cgouvernementale\u201d \u00bb (par. 44; voir aussi Greater Vancouver Transportation Authority, par. 16; Lokan et Fenrick, \u00a72:21\u20112:23; R\u00e9gimbald et Newman, \u00a718.15).\n[62] Il est utile d\u2019examiner la fa\u00e7on dont notre Cour a appliqu\u00e9 les deux volets du cadre d\u2019analyse de l\u2019arr\u00eat Eldridge.\na) Premier volet : Gouvernement \u00ab par nature \u00bb ou \u00ab contr\u00f4le \u00bb\n[63] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Godbout, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu peu de temps apr\u00e8s Eldridge, la Cour devait d\u00e9cider si une obligation de r\u00e9sidence impos\u00e9e par une municipalit\u00e9 \u00e0 ses employ\u00e9s violait la Charte des droits et libert\u00e9s de la personne, L.R.Q., c. C\u201112, du Qu\u00e9bec ou la Charte canadienne. Les juges majoritaires ont tranch\u00e9 l\u2019affaire en fonction de la Charte qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise, tandis que les juges minoritaires l\u2019ont fait au regard de la Charte canadienne. S\u2019exprimant au nom de la minorit\u00e9, le juge La Forest (avec l\u2019accord des juges L\u2019Heureux\u2011Dub\u00e9 et McLachlin, plus tard juge en chef) a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les municipalit\u00e9s sont des gouvernements par nature et qu\u2019elles sont par cons\u00e9quent assujetties \u00e0 la Charte canadienne, m\u00eame si elles sont \u00ab institutionnellement distinctes des gouvernements provinciaux qui les ont cr\u00e9\u00e9es \u00bb (par. 50). Il a soulign\u00e9 que les conseils municipaux : (1) sont \u00e9lus d\u00e9mocratiquement par les citoyens et doivent leur rendre compte, au m\u00eame titre que le Parlement et les l\u00e9gislatures provinciales; (2) jouissent d\u2019un pouvoir g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de taxation qui ne se distingue pas des pouvoirs de taxation qu\u2019exercent le Parlement ou les provinces; (3) ont le pouvoir d\u2019\u00e9tablir des r\u00e8gles de droit, de les appliquer et de les faire respecter dans les limites d\u2019un territoire donn\u00e9, ce qui constitue une \u00ab fonction purement gouvernementale \u00bb (par. 51 (soulignement omis), citant McKinney, p. 270); et (4) sont des cr\u00e9atures des provinces dont elles tirent leur pouvoir de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer, et exercent des pouvoirs que les provinces devraient autrement exercer (par. 51). Le juge La Forest a estim\u00e9 que, \u00ab [c]omme la Charte canadienne s\u2019applique incontestablement aux l\u00e9gislatures et aux gouvernements provinciaux, elle ne peut que s\u2019appliquer aussi [. . .] aux entit\u00e9s qu\u2019ils investissent de pouvoirs gouvernementaux relevant de leur comp\u00e9tence, sinon les provinces pourraient [. . .] \u00e9viter tout simplement l\u2019application de la Charte en attribuant certains pouvoirs aux municipalit\u00e9s \u00bb (par. 51).\n[64] Plus tard, dans l\u2019affaire Greater Vancouver Transportation Authority, la juge Deschamps, s\u2019exprimant pour la Cour, a statu\u00e9 que deux commissions de transport en commun qui avaient interdit toute publicit\u00e9 \u00e0 caract\u00e8re politique sur leurs v\u00e9hicules de transport \u00e9taient des \u00ab gouvernements \u00bb et \u00e9taient assujetties \u00e0 la Charte, car soumises \u00e0 un contr\u00f4le gouvernemental au sens du premier volet d\u2019Eldridge. Elle a conclu que la province de la Colombie\u2011Britannique exer\u00e7ait un contr\u00f4le substantiel sur les activit\u00e9s des deux commissions de transport en commun. L\u2019une d\u2019entre elles avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e par une loi qui la d\u00e9signait [traduction] \u00ab mandataire du gouvernement \u00bb; de plus, elle \u00e9tait dot\u00e9e d\u2019un conseil d\u2019administration dont les membres \u00e9taient nomm\u00e9s par le lieutenant\u2011gouverneur en conseil; et ses activit\u00e9s pouvaient \u00eatre dirig\u00e9es par le truchement de r\u00e8glements (par. 17). Cette commission de transport ne pouvait donc pas \u00ab \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une entit\u00e9 ind\u00e9pendante du gouvernement provincial \u00bb (par. 17). L\u2019autre commission de transport en commun appartenait elle aussi \u00e0 \u00ab l\u2019appareil gouvernemental \u00bb, parce qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait contr\u00f4l\u00e9e par un gouvernement de district en vertu d\u2019une loi, lequel faisait lui-m\u00eame partie du \u00ab gouvernement \u00bb au sens du par. 32(1) de la Charte (par. 18). En outre, comme l\u2019a signal\u00e9 la juge Deschamps, la seconde commission de transport en commun avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e dans le but de transf\u00e9rer les responsabilit\u00e9s de la province en mati\u00e8re de transport en commun \u00e0 des gouvernements locaux, ce qui faisait intervenir le principe suivant lequel \u00ab le gouvernement ne devrait pas pouvoir se soustraire aux obligations que lui impose la Charte en octroyant simplement ses pouvoirs \u00e0 une autre entit\u00e9 \u00bb (par. 22). Elle a jug\u00e9 qu\u2019on \u00ab ne saurait [. . .] conclure que ce transfert de pouvoirs provinciaux [. . .] a soustrait le r\u00e9seau de transport en commun [. . .] \u00e0 l\u2019application de la Charte \u00bb (par. 22). Les deux commissions de transport en commun \u00e9taient donc assujetties \u00e0 la Charte.\nb) Deuxi\u00e8me volet : \u00ab Activit\u00e9s gouvernementales \u00bb\n[65] L\u2019affaire Eldridge est elle\u2011m\u00eame un exemple du second volet du cadre d\u2019analyse issu de cet arr\u00eat, selon lequel la Charte s\u2019applique \u00e0 une entit\u00e9 non gouvernementale pour ce qui est des activit\u00e9s gouvernementales qu\u2019elle exerce. S\u2019exprimant pour la Cour, le juge La Forest a conclu que l\u2019omission par un h\u00f4pital d\u2019offrir des services d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation gestuelle aux personnes recevant des services m\u00e9dicaux en vertu d\u2019une loi provinciale \u00e9tait soumis \u00e0 un examen fond\u00e9 sur la Charte. En d\u00e9cidant de ne pas offrir de services d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation gestuelle, l\u2019h\u00f4pital avait exerc\u00e9 le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire, conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par la loi provinciale, de d\u00e9finir la fa\u00e7on de fournir les services m\u00e9dicalement n\u00e9cessaires (par. 19 et 51). La d\u00e9cision de l\u2019h\u00f4pital n\u2019\u00e9tait donc \u00ab pas simplement une question de r\u00e9gie interne de l\u2019h\u00f4pital \u00bb, mais \u00e9tait plut\u00f4t \u00ab intimement li\u00e9e au r\u00e9gime de prestation de services m\u00e9dicaux \u00e9tabli par la loi \u00bb (par. 51). Le juge La Forest a par cons\u00e9quent d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l\u2019h\u00f4pital \u00e9tait assujetti \u00e0 la Charte dans l\u2019exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de fournir des services m\u00e9dicaux en vertu de la loi.\n[66] De m\u00eame, dans l\u2019affaire Blencoe c. Colombie\u2011Britannique (Human Rights Commission), 2000 CSC 44, [2000] 2 R.C.S. 307, le juge Bastarache a conclu, au nom de la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour, que la British Columbia Human Rights Commission \u00e9tait assujettie \u00e0 la Charte pour le traitement tardif d\u2019une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. M\u00eame si la commission \u00e9tait \u00ab autonom[e] ou ind\u00e9pendan[te] vis\u2011\u00e0\u2011vis du gouvernement \u00bb, elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e par une loi et elle \u00ab accompli[ssait] tous ses actes en vertu du pouvoir que lui conf[\u00e9rait] la loi en cause \u00bb (par. 34\u201135). La conduite de la commission ne pouvait pas \u00e9chapper \u00e0 un examen fond\u00e9 sur la Charte \u00ab du seul fait qu\u2019elle ne fait pas partie du gouvernement ou qu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas sous son contr\u00f4le \u00bb (par. 37). Le juge Bastarache a conclu que la commission \u00e9tait assujettie \u00e0 la Charte parce qu\u2019elle \u00ab met[tait] en \u0153uvre un programme gouvernemental particulier et exer[\u00e7ait] des pouvoirs de contrainte \u00e9manant de la loi \u00bb (par. 37).\n[67] Les professeurs Hogg et Wright ont expliqu\u00e9 pourquoi les mesures prises en vertu d\u2019une loi qui impliquent un pouvoir de contrainte sont un facteur pertinent pour d\u00e9cider si la Charte s\u2019applique. Ils ont fait remarquer que, m\u00eame si une entit\u00e9 est par ailleurs ind\u00e9pendante des gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provincial, l\u2019existence d\u2019un pouvoir de contrainte d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 par la loi signifie que l\u2019entit\u00e9 d\u00e9tient un [traduction] \u00ab pouvoir coercitif de gouvernance \u00bb que les personnes physiques, les personnes morales ou les organisations ne poss\u00e8dent pas (\u00a7 37:8). Comme l\u2019expliquent les auteurs, [traduction] \u00ab c\u2019est l\u2019exercice d\u2019un pouvoir de contrainte qui fait en sorte que les organismes exer\u00e7ant un pouvoir conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par une loi sont assujettis \u00e0 la Charte \u00bb (\u00a7 37:8). Nous sommes du m\u00eame avis.\n[68] Comme le font remarquer les professeurs Hogg et Wright, l\u2019existence d\u2019un pouvoir de contrainte d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 par la loi permet de comprendre pourquoi, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Blencoe, la Cour a jug\u00e9 que la Charte s\u2019appliquait \u00e0 la commission des droits de la personne, et pourquoi, dans ses d\u00e9cisions ant\u00e9rieures, la Cour a conclu que la Charte s\u2019appliquait \u00e0 un arbitre exer\u00e7ant des pouvoirs conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par la loi (Slaight Communications Inc. c. Davidson, [1989] 1 R.C.S. 1038); \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement municipal, adopt\u00e9 en vertu d\u2019une loi, qui interdisait l\u2019affichage sur une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 publique (Ramsden c. Peterborough (Ville), [1993] 2 R.C.S. 1084); aux r\u00e8glements d\u2019un barreau qui restreignaient l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la profession par des cabinets d\u2019avocats provenant de l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de la province (Black c. Law Society of Alberta, [1989] 1 R.C.S. 591); et aux conditions d\u2019une police d\u2019assurance \u00e9tablies par la loi (Miron c. Trudel, [1995] 2 R.C.S. 418). Voir aussi Brun, Tremblay et Brouillet, p. 972\u2011973 (\u00ab Le mot \u201cgouvernement\u201d de l\u2019article 32 re\u00e7oit [. . .] une interpr\u00e9tation fonctionnelle [. . .]. La Charte canadienne [. . .] s\u2019applique donc \u00e0 toutes les instances paragouvernementales de l\u2019administration publique lorsque celles\u2011ci exercent une fonction gouvernementale, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire lorsqu\u2019elles exercent en vertu de la loi la puissance publique, en contraignant de fa\u00e7on unilat\u00e9rale les comportements humains \u00bb).\nc) R\u00e9sum\u00e9\n[69] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, la Charte s\u2019applique de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale aux branches l\u00e9gislative, ex\u00e9cutive et administrative du gouvernement. La Charte s\u2019applique au Parlement, aux l\u00e9gislatures ainsi qu\u2019aux gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, provinciaux et territoriaux pour tous les domaines relevant de la comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative du Parlement et des provinces, ce qui englobe des entit\u00e9s qui ne sont pas express\u00e9ment mentionn\u00e9es au par. 32(1). Les entit\u00e9s assujetties \u00e0 la Charte ne peuvent se soustraire aux obligations qui en d\u00e9coulent en conf\u00e9rant une partie de leurs responsabilit\u00e9s ou de leurs pouvoirs l\u00e9gislatifs \u00e0 d\u2019autres entit\u00e9s qui ne sont pas normalement assujetties \u00e0 la Charte.\n[70] Une entit\u00e9 peut \u00eatre assujettie \u00e0 la Charte de l\u2019une de deux mani\u00e8res. Une entit\u00e9 peut faire partie du gouvernement, soit de par sa nature m\u00eame, soit parce que le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou un gouvernement provincial exerce un contr\u00f4le substantiel sur elle, auquel cas toutes ses activit\u00e9s sont assujetties \u00e0 la Charte. Subsidiairement, m\u00eame si l\u2019entit\u00e9 ne fait pas partie du gouvernement, elle sera assujettie \u00e0 la Charte pour ce qui est des activit\u00e9s gouvernementales qu\u2019elle exerce.\n(4) Application du par. 32(1) \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire\n[71] Nous allons maintenant appliquer ces principes \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence impos\u00e9e par la VGFN.\n[72] La Cour supr\u00eame du Yukon a conclu que, suivant le cadre d\u2019analyse de l\u2019arr\u00eat Eldridge, la Charte s\u2019appliquait \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence impos\u00e9e par la VGFN, parce que la VGFN est [traduction] \u00ab un \u201cgouvernement\u201d [par nature], ou exerce des activit\u00e9s intrins\u00e8quement \u201cgouvernementales\u201d \u00bb (par. 130), et ce, que l\u2019on consid\u00e8re l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence comme l\u2019exercice d\u2019un droit inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale ou comme l\u2019application de l\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale mise en \u0153uvre par des lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et territoriale (par. 130).\n[73] La Cour d\u2019appel a elle aussi conclu que le Conseil de la VGFN exer\u00e7ait \u00ab de par sa nature m\u00eame \u00bb des pouvoirs \u00ab gouvernementaux \u00bb, et ce, peu importe qu\u2019il tienne ces pouvoirs d\u2019un droit inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale ou d\u2019un texte de loi f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou territorial (par. 98). Ailleurs dans ses motifs, la Cour d\u2019appel semble nuancer la port\u00e9e de cette conclusion, soulignant qu\u2019elle traitait uniquement de l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence et non de la question de l\u2019application de la Charte \u00e0 la VGFN de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale (par. 74 et 83). Mais si (comme l\u2019a reconnu la Cour d\u2019appel) la VGFN est un gouvernement par nature, il s\u2019ensuit que la Charte s\u2019applique \u00e0 toutes ses activit\u00e9s, et non seulement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9diction et \u00e0 l\u2019application de l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence (Eldridge, par. 44; Greater Vancouver Transportation Authority, par. 16). Comme le plaide l\u2019intervenant le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada \u2014 et nous le disons avec \u00e9gards \u2014 la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019appel est parfois [traduction] \u00ab floue en ce qui concerne la ligne de d\u00e9marcation entre les deux volets \u00bb du crit\u00e8re de l\u2019arr\u00eat Eldridge (m. interv., par. 17).\n[74] Devant notre Cour, les parties et les intervenants ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un \u00e9ventail complet de points de vue sur la question de savoir si la Charte s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence au motif que la VGFN est un \u00ab gouvernement par nature \u00bb. Il n\u2019y avait pas non plus de consensus parmi les groupes qui d\u00e9fendaient les int\u00e9r\u00eats des peuples autochtones en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce sur la question de savoir si la Charte s\u2019applique aux gouvernements autochtones. Certaines organisations autochtones ont insist\u00e9 sur le fait que la Charte s\u2019applique (ou devrait s\u2019appliquer) aux gouvernements autochtones en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, affirmant que cela est essentiel pour prot\u00e9ger les droits et l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 de statut en mati\u00e8re de citoyennet\u00e9 des peuples autochtones et pour s\u2019assurer que les Autochtones vuln\u00e9rables (comme les membres des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant hors r\u00e9serve ou en r\u00e9gion \u00e9loign\u00e9e ou les femmes autochtones) ne soient pas victimes de discrimination de la part de leurs propres gouvernements autochtones (voir m. interv., Congr\u00e8s des peuples autochtones, par. 5\u201115; m. interv., Band Members Alliance and Advocacy Association of Canada, par. 10\u201129). D\u2019autres organisations autochtones se sont oppos\u00e9es \u00e0 ce point de vue, affirmant que la Charte ne s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019exercice d\u2019un droit inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale que si le peuple autochtone concern\u00e9 y donne express\u00e9ment son assentiment (voir m. interv., Teslin Tlingit Council, par. 2 et 16\u201129; m. interv., Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations, par. 13\u201117; m. interv., Nation m\u00e9tisse de l\u2019Ontario et M\u00e9tis Nation of Alberta, par. 14\u201121).\n[75] Dans la prochaine section, nous abordons cette question en appliquant le cadre d\u2019analyse \u00e9tabli par notre Cour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Eldridge pour d\u00e9terminer dans quels cas la Charte s\u2019applique en vertu du par. 32(1).\na) La Charte s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence parce que la VGFN est un \u00ab gouvernement \u00bb par nature\n[76] \u00c0 notre avis, la VGFN ne constitue pas un gouvernement selon le crit\u00e8re relatif au \u00ab contr\u00f4le \u00bb du premier volet du cadre d\u2019analyse de l\u2019arr\u00eat Eldridge puisque ni le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ni celui du Yukon n\u2019exercent un contr\u00f4le substantiel sur elle. Par le truchement de l\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale, la VGFN exerce des pouvoirs d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale par elle-m\u00eame et pour son propre compte (Loi sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale des premi\u00e8res nations du Yukon, art. 2, \u00ab accord \u00bb). La VGFN est \u00ab institutionnellement distinct[e] \u00bb des gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et territorial (Godbout, par. 50). Sa fonction essentielle consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9fendre les int\u00e9r\u00eats des Vuntut Gwitchin conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 leurs \u00ab structures traditionnelles de d\u00e9cision \u00bb et \u00e0 \u00ab appuyer et encourager [leurs] institutions et processus politiques [. . .], sous leur forme actuelle et future \u00bb (Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale, pr\u00e9ambule). \u00c0 cette fin, l\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale pr\u00e9voit que la VGFN \u00ab a le pouvoir exclusif d\u2019\u00e9dicter des textes l\u00e9gislatifs \u00bb portant sur une liste de mati\u00e8res convenues, dont l\u2019administration de ses \u00ab affaires, ainsi que son fonctionnement et sa r\u00e9gie interne \u00bb (Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale, art. 13.1). Par cons\u00e9quent, la VGFN agit de mani\u00e8re autonome du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et de celui du Yukon, qui n\u2019exercent pas sur elle un contr\u00f4le substantiel.\n[77] En revanche, nous estimons que la Charte s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence impos\u00e9e par la VGFN en vertu de sa Constitution, parce que la VGFN est un \u00ab gouvernement \u00bb par nature. Rappelons que, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Godbout, le juge La Forest a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que bien qu\u2019il ne puisse y avoir de liste pr\u00e9d\u00e9termin\u00e9e de facteurs permettant de conclure \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de fonctions \u00ab gouvernementales \u00bb (par. 49), une entit\u00e9 qui pr\u00e9sente quatre caract\u00e9ristiques peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme un gouvernement par nature (par. 51). Ces quatre caract\u00e9ristiques ne sont ni essentielles ni d\u00e9terminantes pour qu\u2019une entit\u00e9 puisse \u00eatre jug\u00e9e gouvernementale par nature, mais elles constituent des indices utiles \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard (par. 51) :\n1. L\u2019entit\u00e9 est dot\u00e9e d\u2019un conseil qui est \u00ab \u00e9l[u] d\u00e9mocratiquement par les citoyens et doi[t] leur rendre compte de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on que le Parlement et les l\u00e9gislatures provinciales sont responsables devant leur \u00e9lectorat respectif \u00bb.\n2. Elle jouit \u00ab d\u2019un pouvoir g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de taxation qui, pour ce qui est de d\u00e9terminer si on peut l\u00e9gitimement [la] consid\u00e9rer comme [une] entit[\u00e9] \u201cgouvernemental[e]\u201d, ne se distingue pas des pouvoirs de taxation que le Parlement ou les provinces exercent \u00bb.\n3. Fait important, elle a le pouvoir d\u2019\u00e9tablir des r\u00e8gles de droit contraignantes, de les appliquer et de les faire respecter dans les limites d\u2019un territoire d\u00e9termin\u00e9, ce qui constitue essentiellement une fonction gouvernementale.\n4. Plus important encore, elle tire son existence et son pouvoir de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou provincial; c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire qu\u2019elle exerce des pouvoirs conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par le Parlement ou une l\u00e9gislature provinciale, des pouvoirs et des fonctions que le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou provincial exercerait autrement lui\u2011m\u00eame.\n[78] Nous sommes d\u2019accord avec les observations de Mme Dickson et de plusieurs intervenants gouvernementaux et autochtones selon lesquelles, en tant que gouvernement autochtone, la VGFN pr\u00e9sente les indices repr\u00e9sentatifs d\u2019un \u00ab gouvernement par nature \u00bb identifi\u00e9s par notre Cour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Godbout, ce qui fait en sorte que la Charte s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence impos\u00e9e par la VGFN (m.i. au pourvoi incident, par. 34; m. interv., p.g. Canada, par. 18\u201119; m. interv., p.g. Qu\u00e9bec, par. 6; m. interv., p.g. Alberta, par. 7; m. interv., Congr\u00e8s des peuples autochtones, par. 6\u20117; m. interv., Band Members Alliance and Advocacy Association of Canada, par. 14\u201121).\n[79] Premi\u00e8rement, le Conseil de la VGFN est form\u00e9 de membres qui sont \u00e9lus par les \u00e9lecteurs admissibles de la VGFN et qui sont d\u00e9mocratiquement responsables devant l\u2019\u00e9lectorat, \u00e0 l\u2019instar des d\u00e9put\u00e9s f\u00e9d\u00e9raux et provinciaux (Constitution de la VGFN, article VIII). Une fois \u00e9lus, les membres jurent ou affirment leur fid\u00e9lit\u00e9 \u00e0 la VGFN ainsi que leur ob\u00e9issance \u00e0 la Constitution de la VGFN en tant que [traduction] \u00ab responsabilit\u00e9 sacr\u00e9e du gouvernement \u00bb (ann. II).\n[80] Deuxi\u00e8mement, la VGFN dispose de pouvoirs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de taxation qui sont pratiquement identiques \u00e0 ceux du Parlement ou des provinces. La VGFN a le statut de \u00ab municipalit\u00e9 ou organisme public remplissant une fonction gouvernementale ou [de] corporation municipale \u00bb au sens de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu (Entente d\u00e9finitive, art. 24.8.1), \u00e0 condition de limiter ses activit\u00e9s \u00ab \u00e0 la prestation de services gouvernementaux ou d\u2019autres services publics \u00bb (art. 24.8.2; voir aussi l\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale, art. 14.0 (Fiscalit\u00e9) et 15.0 (R\u00e9gime fiscal); Loi sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale des premi\u00e8res nations du Yukon, art. 18).\n[81] Troisi\u00e8mement, \u00e0 l\u2019instar du Parlement et des l\u00e9gislatures provinciales, la VGFN a le pouvoir d\u2019\u00e9tablir, d\u2019appliquer et de faire respecter des r\u00e8gles de droit contraignantes pour ses citoyens et le public en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral dans les limites de ses terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es (Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale, art. 13.0; Loi sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale des premi\u00e8res nations du Yukon, art. 9 \u00e0 12). Pour citer le juge La Forest dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Godbout, il s\u2019agit d\u2019une \u00ab fonction purement gouvernementale \u00bb (par. 51 (soulignement omis), citant McKinney, p. 270).\n[82] Quatri\u00e8mement, bien que (comme l\u2019a conclu le juge de premi\u00e8re instance) les Vuntut Gwitchin se gouvernent eux\u2011m\u00eames depuis des temps imm\u00e9moriaux, et m\u00eame si la VGFN a le pouvoir de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer en vertu de son droit inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale, elle se voit \u00e9galement reconna\u00eetre le statut d\u2019entit\u00e9 juridique en vertu de la loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de mise en \u0153uvre. Dans cette mesure, elle tient au moins une partie de son pouvoir de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer d\u2019un texte de loi f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. En d\u2019autres termes, le pouvoir de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer de la VGFN \u00e9mane au moins en partie du Parlement, en ce que la VGFN exerce des pouvoirs que le Parlement aurait autrement exerc\u00e9s en vertu de la comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative qu\u2019il d\u00e9tient en vertu du par. 91(24) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867. Bien entendu, cela ne signifie pas que l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale autochtone est forc\u00e9ment une \u00e9manation du pouvoir f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. Le Parlement peut, comme dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, \u00eatre une source du pouvoir d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale, et c\u2019est ce fait qui d\u00e9clenche l\u2019application de la Charte en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[83] En premier lieu, la loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale reconna\u00eet la VGFN comme \u00ab une entit\u00e9 juridique dot\u00e9e de la capacit\u00e9 d\u2019une personne physique \u00bb (Loi sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale des premi\u00e8res nations du Yukon, art. 7). Elle pr\u00e9voit \u00e9galement que la VGFN est substitu\u00e9e dans les \u00ab droits et obligations \u00bb de l\u2019entit\u00e9 qui l\u2019a pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e, en l\u2019occurrence le Vuntut Gwitchin Tribal Council, qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 constitu\u00e9 en tant que bande au sens de la Loi sur les Indiens et qui \u00ab cesse d\u00e8s lors d\u2019exister \u00bb (art. 2, par. 6(1) et ann. I). En soulignant cet aspect, nous distinguons la VGFN en tant qu\u2019entit\u00e9 juridique reconnue par une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, et les Vuntut Gwitchin en tant que peuple autochtone qui ne d\u00e9pend pas de la l\u00e9gislation f\u00e9d\u00e9rale pour exercer des pouvoirs d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale, pouvoirs qu\u2019ils exercent depuis des temps imm\u00e9moriaux, comme a conclu le juge de premi\u00e8re instance. \u00c0 notre avis, il suffit, dans le pr\u00e9sent contexte, que la VGFN soit reconnue comme une entit\u00e9 juridique et qu\u2019une source de son pouvoir de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer soit une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, sans que l\u2019ensemble de son pouvoir de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer, ou son existence, d\u00e9coule d\u2019une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Godbout, le juge La Forest a expliqu\u00e9 que les municipalit\u00e9s devaient leur \u00ab existence \u00bb \u00e0 des textes de loi f\u00e9d\u00e9raux ou provinciaux, mais c\u2019est parce que les municipalit\u00e9s sont enti\u00e8rement des cr\u00e9ations de la loi, ce qui n\u2019est manifestement pas le cas des gouvernements autochtones autonomes. En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, le Parlement peut reconna\u00eetre l\u2019existence d\u2019un gouvernement autochtone auquel il conf\u00e8re une partie de son pouvoir de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer en vertu du par. 91(24) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867, sans pour autant cr\u00e9er ce gouvernement autochtone et sans n\u00e9cessairement \u00eatre l\u2019unique source de son pouvoir de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer.\n[84] En second lieu, m\u00eame si la VGFN poss\u00e8de un pouvoir inh\u00e9rent d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale qui ne d\u00e9coule pas d\u2019une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, il est ind\u00e9niable qu\u2019elle exerce aussi des pouvoirs qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par le Parlement en vertu du par. 91(24) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 et qui seraient autrement exerc\u00e9s par le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou territorial, comme c\u2019\u00e9tait effectivement le cas avant que l\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale ne soit mise en \u0153uvre par une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. La VGFN exerce des pouvoirs l\u00e9gislatifs que le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et elle ont convenu qu\u2019elle exercerait en vertu de l\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale, une fois cette entente approuv\u00e9e par les lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et territoriale de mise en \u0153uvre. La Loi sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale des premi\u00e8res nations du Yukon f\u00e9d\u00e9rale est l\u2019exercice du pouvoir d\u2019\u00e9dicter des lois concernant \u00ab [l]es Indiens et les terres r\u00e9serv\u00e9es pour les Indiens \u00bb que le Parlement d\u00e9tient aux termes du par. 91(24) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867. La loi impose des r\u00e8gles, accept\u00e9es par la VGFN, qui ont trait \u00e0 l\u2019exercice des pouvoirs d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale de la VGFN, des r\u00e8gles qui trouvent leur source au moins en partie dans la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867, m\u00eame s\u2019ils d\u00e9coulent \u00e9galement du pouvoir inh\u00e9rent d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale dont jouissent les Vuntut Gwitchin.\n[85] Il est \u00e9galement important de noter que la loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale pr\u00e9voit express\u00e9ment que les terres transf\u00e9r\u00e9es \u00e0 une premi\u00e8re nation du Yukon conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 une entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale \u00ab demeurent toutefois des terres r\u00e9serv\u00e9es pour les Indiens au sens du point 24 de l\u2019article 91 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 \u00bb (par. 22(4)). Cela refl\u00e8te le fait que le Parlement n\u2019a pas renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 son pouvoir de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer en ce qui concerne les terres transf\u00e9r\u00e9es, m\u00eame si la VGFN exerce des pouvoirs d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale en vertu de l\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale. En effet, comme l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 notre Cour dans R. c. Sparrow, [1990] 1 R.C.S. 1075, le \u00ab pouvoir \u00bb de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer accord\u00e9 au Parlement par le par. 91(24) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 doit \u00eatre \u00ab concili\u00e9 \u00bb avec son \u00ab obligation \u00bb envers les peuples autochtones \u00e9nonc\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019art. 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 (p. 1109). Le Parlement ne peut pas renoncer \u00e0 son obligation constitutionnelle envers les peuples autochtones. Tant le \u00ab pouvoir \u00bb du Parlement de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer en vertu du par. 91(24) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 que son \u00ab obligation \u00bb envers les peuples autochtones \u00e9nonc\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019art. 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 subsistent, m\u00eame apr\u00e8s la conclusion d\u2019une entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale avec un peuple autochtone.\n[86] De plus, quelle que soit la source des pouvoirs d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale de la VGFN \u2014 qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse d\u2019un droit inh\u00e9rent, d\u2019une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ou des deux \u2014 il ne fait aucun doute que la Loi sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale des premi\u00e8res nations du Yukon f\u00e9d\u00e9rale r\u00e9git aussi l\u2019exercice par la VGFN de ses pouvoirs d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale et les rend opposables aux tiers. En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, tous les pouvoirs d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale qui sont reconnus \u00e0 la VGFN par l\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale et qui sont mis en \u0153uvre par les lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et territoriale sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale doivent \u00eatre exerc\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ces lois. \u00c0 notre avis, ce rattachement au Parlement est suffisant pour entra\u00eener l\u2019application de la Charte.\n[87] Bien que cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment ne soit pas d\u00e9terminant, il convient de souligner que, lors de la deuxi\u00e8me lecture du projet de loi f\u00e9d\u00e9ral sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale devant la Chambre des communes, le ministre des Affaires indiennes et du Nord canadien, l\u2019hon. Ron Irwin, avait lui aussi exprim\u00e9 l\u2019opinion que la Charte s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019exercice par la VGFN de ses pouvoirs d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que \u00ab [l]es principes inscrits dans la Charte des droits et libert\u00e9s et dans la Constitution du Canada dans son ensemble continueront de s\u2019appliquer \u00bb (D\u00e9bats de la Chambre des communes, vol. 133, no 76, 1re sess., 35e l\u00e9g., 1er juin 1994, p. 4716). Il a ajout\u00e9 que \u00ab [l]es constitutions des premi\u00e8res nations garantiront aussi la protection des droits et libert\u00e9s des citoyens des premi\u00e8res nations \u00bb (p. 4716). Ainsi, de l\u2019avis du ministre, les citoyens des premi\u00e8res nations autonomes auraient le droit d\u2019invoquer les droits garantis par la Charte parall\u00e8lement aux droits que leur reconnaissent les constitutions des premi\u00e8res nations, tout comme Mme Dickson l\u2019a fait en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Malgr\u00e9 les lacunes de la preuve bas\u00e9e sur les d\u00e9bats parlementaires, notre Cour a reconnu qu\u2019une telle preuve peut \u00ab jouer un r\u00f4le limit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gislative \u00bb (Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 R.C.S. 27, par. 35). \u00c0 notre avis, la d\u00e9claration du ministre devant la Chambre des communes appuie dans une certaine mesure l\u2019opinion selon laquelle le Parlement entendait que l\u2019exercice des pouvoirs d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale reconnus par la Loi sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale des premi\u00e8res nations du Yukon f\u00e9d\u00e9rale soit assujetti \u00e0 la Charte.\n[88] Nous nous empressons d\u2019ajouter qu\u2019en concluant que la VGFN pr\u00e9sente chacun des quatre indices repr\u00e9sentatifs identifi\u00e9s par la Cour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Godbout pour conclure qu\u2019une entit\u00e9 est un gouvernement par nature, nous ne voulons \u00e9videmment pas sugg\u00e9rer par l\u00e0 qu\u2019un gouvernement autochtone qui, comme la VGFN, exerce des pouvoirs d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale est une entit\u00e9 similaire \u00e0 une municipalit\u00e9. Contrairement aux municipalit\u00e9s, qui n\u2019ont pas de statut constitutionnel ind\u00e9pendant, qui sont enti\u00e8rement des cr\u00e9ations de la loi et qui exercent seulement les pouvoirs qui leur sont conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par la loi, les peuples autochtones sont express\u00e9ment reconnus par la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 (par. 91(24)), la Charte (art. 25) et la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 (art. 35 et 35.1). Les peuples autochtones existaient avant la venue des colons europ\u00e9ens et la fondation du Canada en tant que pays; leur existence en tant que peuples autonomes se gouvernant eux\u2011m\u00eames ne d\u00e9pend pas de la l\u00e9gislation f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, provinciale ou territoriale.\n[89] Notre raisonnement et notre conclusion portant que la Charte s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence impos\u00e9e par la VGFN trouvent \u00e9galement appui dans l\u2019analyse r\u00e9alis\u00e9e par Peter W. Hogg et Mary Ellen Turpel dans leur important article intitul\u00e9 \u00ab La mise en \u0153uvre de l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale des peuples autochtones : aspects constitutionnels et questions de comp\u00e9tence \u00bb, pr\u00e9par\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019origine pour la Commission royale sur les peuples autochtones (et ult\u00e9rieurement publi\u00e9 dans la Revue du Barreau canadien). Les professeurs Hogg et Turpel ont soutenu qu\u2019il \u00e9tait \u00ab probable \u00bb que les tribunaux concluraient que la Charte s\u2019applique aux gouvernements autochtones, soit parce que les institutions qui exercent l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9es par un texte de loi, et ce, parce que \u00ab la Charte s\u2019applique \u00e0 tous les organismes exer\u00e7ant des pouvoirs conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives \u00bb, ou encore parce que les lois en vertu desquelles les ententes sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale sont mises en \u0153uvre constitueraient \u00ab sans doute [. . .] une participation suffisante du Parlement du Canada pour entra\u00eener l\u2019application de la Charte \u00bb :\nMalgr\u00e9 le silence de l\u2019article 32 au sujet des gouvernements autochtones, il est probable que les tribunaux arriveraient \u00e0 la conclusion que ces gouvernements sont assujettis \u00e0 la Charte. Ce serait certainement le cas lorsque c\u2019est un texte de loi qui a cr\u00e9\u00e9 les institutions concr\u00e9tisant l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale ou leur a conf\u00e9r\u00e9 leurs pouvoirs, du fait que la Charte s\u2019applique \u00e0 tous les organismes exer\u00e7ant des pouvoirs conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives. Quand les institutions par le truchement desquelles s\u2019exerce l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9es par le peuple autochtone et que leurs pouvoirs d\u00e9coulent d\u2019une entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale, la source des pouvoirs relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale est probablement un droit issu d\u2019un trait\u00e9 (si l\u2019entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale est assimil\u00e9e \u00e0 un trait\u00e9) ou un droit ancestral (droit inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale), ou les deux \u00e0 la fois. Mais m\u00eame dans ce cas, comme nous l\u2019avons signal\u00e9, l\u2019entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale doit \u00eatre compl\u00e9t\u00e9e par un texte l\u00e9gislatif afin qu\u2019il soit \u00e9tabli clairement qu\u2019elle a force obligatoire pour les tiers. La loi en vertu de laquelle l\u2019entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale est mise en application constitue sans doute alors une participation suffisante du Parlement du Canada pour entra\u00eener l\u2019application de la Charte. [Nous soulignons; notes en bas de page omises; p. 475\u2011476.]\n[90] Dans le Rapport final de la CRPA, la Commission a mentionn\u00e9 que l\u2019analyse des professeurs Hogg et Turpel l\u2019a \u00ab aid\u00e9[e] \u00bb \u00e0 parvenir \u00e0 sa propre conclusion selon laquelle la Charte s\u2019applique aux gouvernements autochtones (vol. 2, p. 256). L\u2019article de Hogg et Turpel est \u00e9galement important parce qu\u2019il \u00ab fait fr\u00e9quemment \u00e9tat \u00bb de fa\u00e7on sp\u00e9cifique des ententes sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale conclues avec les premi\u00e8res nations du Yukon, que les auteurs ont utilis\u00e9es comme cas de figure pour illustrer leur raisonnement sur la fa\u00e7on dont les ententes sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale pouvaient \u00eatre mises en \u0153uvre \u00ab dans le cadre constitutionnel existant \u00bb du Canada (p. 442\u2011452, 457\u2011469 et 472\u2011473).\n[91] Nous ajoutons que notre conclusion suivant laquelle la Charte s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence impos\u00e9e par la VGFN dans le cadre de la loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale diff\u00e8re des conclusions apparemment tir\u00e9es par le juge de premi\u00e8re instance et par la Cour d\u2019appel \u2014 et a une port\u00e9e plus \u00e9troite que celles\u2011ci. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance (au par. 130) et la Cour d\u2019appel (au par. 98) semblent en effet avoir d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la Charte s\u2019appliquait \u00e0 l\u2019exercice par la VGFN de ses pouvoirs d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale, que cet exercice soit consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme d\u00e9coulant du droit inh\u00e9rent de la VGFN \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale ou d\u2019ententes sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale conclues avec le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et celui du Yukon telles que mises en \u0153uvre par la l\u00e9gislation f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et territoriale. Nous concluons que la Charte s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence \u00e9dict\u00e9e par la VGFN seulement dans la mesure o\u00f9 cette obligation d\u00e9coule de l\u2019exercice du pouvoir de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer en vertu du par. 91(24) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867. Nous ne faisons pas de commentaires sur la question de savoir si l\u2019exercice d\u2019un droit inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale non rattach\u00e9 \u00e0 une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale serait assujetti \u00e0 la Charte, car nous estimons qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de trancher cette question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, compte tenu des arrangements en mati\u00e8re d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale en cause. Comme l\u2019a souvent rappel\u00e9 notre Cour, \u00ab [l]a r\u00e8gle de conduite qui dicte la retenue dans les affaires constitutionnelle[s] est sens\u00e9e \u00bb, car elle \u00ab repose sur l\u2019id\u00e9e que toute d\u00e9claration inutile sur un point de droit constitutionnel risque de causer \u00e0 des affaires \u00e0 venir un pr\u00e9judice dont les cons\u00e9quences n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vues \u00bb (Phillips c. Nouvelle\u2011\u00c9cosse (Commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate sur la trag\u00e9die de la mine Westray), [1995] 2 R.C.S. 97, par. 9; voir aussi Conseil canadien pour les r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s c.

Au paragraphe 105 du Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la s\u00e9cession du Qu\u00e9bec, [1998] 2 R.C.S. 217 (\u00ab Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la s\u00e9cession \u00bb), notre Cour a d\u00e9crit cette approche comme \u00e9tant \u00ab la r\u00e8gle de prudence requise en mati\u00e8re constitutionnelle \u00bb. La r\u00e8gle de prudence est particuli\u00e8rement salutaire dans le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi, qui peut, \u00e0 notre avis, \u00eatre tranch\u00e9 sans que l\u2019on se demande si un droit autochtone inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale exerc\u00e9 en dehors du cadre l\u00e9gislatif serait assujetti \u00e0 la Charte.\n[92] Nous sommes par cons\u00e9quent d\u2019avis que la Charte s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence \u00e9dict\u00e9e par la VGFN, parce que cette derni\u00e8re est un gouvernement par nature.\n[93] Bien qu\u2019il ne soit pas n\u00e9cessaire, vu cette conclusion, d\u2019examiner le second volet du cadre d\u2019analyse de l\u2019arr\u00eat Eldridge, nous l\u2019examinerons bri\u00e8vement par souci d\u2019exhaustivit\u00e9.\nb) La Charte s\u2019applique \u00e9galement \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme \u00ab activit\u00e9 gouvernementale \u00bb\n[94] Ind\u00e9pendamment de notre conclusion selon laquelle la Charte s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence impos\u00e9e par la VGFN parce que cette derni\u00e8re est un gouvernement par nature, nous concluons \u00e9galement que la Charte s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9diction et \u00e0 l\u2019application de l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence, qui constituent une \u00ab activit\u00e9 gouvernementale \u00bb sp\u00e9cifique.\n[95] L\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence inscrite dans la Constitution de la VGFN a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e au moins en partie en vertu d\u2019une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (m\u00eame en supposant qu\u2019elle refl\u00e8te aussi l\u2019exercice d\u2019un droit inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale). L\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence implique l\u2019exercice d\u2019un pouvoir de contrainte pr\u00e9vu par la loi, car elle impose des restrictions juridiques aux personnes susceptibles de servir comme chef ou conseiller de la VGFN. Elle a force de loi parce qu\u2019elle fait partie de la Constitution de la VGFN, adopt\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale, qui a elle\u2011m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9e et s\u2019est vu donner effet par les lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et territoriale de mise en \u0153uvre. Comme le d\u00e9clare de fa\u00e7on succincte l\u2019art. 2 de la Loi sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale des premi\u00e8res nations du Yukon : \u00ab L\u2019entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale est approuv\u00e9e et a force de loi \u00bb (voir aussi la Loi sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale des premi\u00e8res nations du Yukon, par. 5(1) (qui donne effet \u00e0 l\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale), et l\u2019al. 8(1)b) (selon lequel, \u00ab conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019accord qui la concerne \u00bb, une premi\u00e8re nation du Yukon comme la VGFN adopte une constitution qui pr\u00e9voit notamment \u00ab la composition et les attributions de ses corps dirigeants, ainsi que les r\u00e8gles de fonctionnement qui les r\u00e9gissent \u00bb)). La loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale conf\u00e8re donc la force de la loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e0 la Constitution de la VGFN en vertu de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867, et ce, m\u00eame si la Constitution de la VGFN avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 force de loi en tant que loi autochtone.\n[96] Il s\u2019ensuit, \u00e0 notre avis, que l\u2019\u00e9diction et l\u2019application de l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence constituent une \u00ab activit\u00e9 gouvernementale \u00bb au sens du second volet du cadre d\u2019analyse \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Eldridge. Cette obligation peut donc faire l\u2019objet d\u2019un examen fond\u00e9 sur la Charte.\nc) Autres arguments en faveur de l\u2019application de la Charte\n[97] En terminant, nous allons traiter bri\u00e8vement de deux autres arguments invoqu\u00e9s devant notre Cour relativement \u00e0 la question de savoir si la Charte s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence.\n[98] Premi\u00e8rement, Mme Dickson et certains intervenants affirment que la Charte s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence parce que cette derni\u00e8re constitue une \u00ab r\u00e8gle de droit \u00bb vis\u00e9e par l\u2019article qui consacre la primaut\u00e9 de la Constitution, le par. 52(1) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982, qui \u00ab rend inop\u00e9rantes les dispositions incompatibles de toute autre r\u00e8gle de droit \u00bb. Nous n\u2019acceptons pas cet argument. La jurisprudence de notre Cour \u00e9tablit que \u00ab [l]e champ d\u2019application de la Charte est d\u00e9limit\u00e9 au par. 32(1) \u00bb de celle\u2011ci (R. c. McGregor, 2023 CSC 4, par. 18; voir aussi Godbout, par. 43; Blencoe, par. 10; Greater Vancouver Transportation Authority, par. 13). Le paragraphe 52(1) ne peut s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 titre de r\u00e9paration constitutionnelle que si une r\u00e8gle de droit est incompatible avec la Constitution. Il ne d\u00e9limite pas le champ d\u2019application de la Charte.\n[99] Deuxi\u00e8mement, la VGFN soutient que la Charte ne s\u2019applique pas \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence parce que la VGFN n\u2019a pas consenti \u00e0 ce que la Charte s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019exercice de ses pouvoirs d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale. Madame Dickson pr\u00e9tend que la Charte s\u2019applique parce que l\u2019Entente d\u00e9finitive pr\u00e9voit elle\u2011m\u00eame que la VGFN doit exercer ses pouvoirs d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale \u00ab conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la Constitution du Canada \u00bb (art. 24.1.2), ce qui englobe la Charte, et que les ententes en mati\u00e8re d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale \u00ab n\u2019ont pas pour effet de porter atteinte \u00bb aux droits des membres de la VGFN \u00ab en tant que citoyens canadiens \u00bb (art. 24.1.3), ce qui a \u00e9galement pour effet d\u2019englober les droits garantis par la Charte. Contrairement \u00e0 d\u2019autres ententes sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale conclues apr\u00e8s 1995, les ententes intervenues avec la VGFN ne d\u00e9clarent pas express\u00e9ment que la Charte s\u2019applique.\n[100] Puisque nous avons conclu que la Charte s\u2019applique dans le cadre de l\u2019application normale du par. 32(1), il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de se demander si le consentement \u00e0 l\u2019application de la Charte peut constituer un fondement ad\u00e9quat pour l\u2019application de celle\u2011ci, ou si, sur le plan constitutionnel, il est m\u00eame loisible au gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou au Parlement d\u2019accepter que la Charte, en tant qu\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment de la \u00ab loi supr\u00eame du Canada \u00bb (Loi constitutionnelle de 1982, par. 52(1)), ne s\u2019applique pas \u00e0 des domaines relevant de la comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative du Parlement. M\u00eame si l\u2019on fait abstraction de cet enjeu juridique, nous tenons \u00e0 souligner qu\u2019il demeure utile que les ententes sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale pr\u00e9voient express\u00e9ment que la Charte s\u2019applique aux gouvernements autochtones, car de telles ententes peuvent [traduction] \u00ab apporter suffisamment de clart\u00e9 pour \u00e9viter que ces questions soient port\u00e9es devant les tribunaux \u00bb (Hogg et Wright, \u00a7 28:20; voir aussi Watson, p. 110, note 162).\nd) Conclusion\n[101] Nous concluons que la Charte s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence, soit parce que la VGFN est un gouvernement par nature, soit parce que l\u2019\u00e9diction et l\u2019application de l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence constituent une \u00ab activit\u00e9 gouvernementale \u00bb exerc\u00e9e en vertu d\u2019un pouvoir l\u00e9gal de contrainte. Nous arrivons \u00e0 cette conclusion en appliquant le cadre d\u2019analyse de l\u2019arr\u00eat Eldridge aux ententes particuli\u00e8res, aux lois de mise en \u0153uvre et \u00e0 la constitution autochtone en cause dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Nous nous abstenons express\u00e9ment de tout commentaire sur la question de savoir si la Charte s\u2019appliquerait \u00e0 l\u2019exercice par un gouvernement autochtone d\u2019un pouvoir inh\u00e9rent d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale non rattach\u00e9 \u00e0 une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, provinciale ou territoriale.\nB. Articles 15, 25 et premier de la Charte\n(1) Vue d\u2019ensemble\n[102] L\u2019article 25 de la Charte est un aspect central de l\u2019\u00e9valuation de la pr\u00e9tention de Mme Dickson selon laquelle l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence pr\u00e9vue dans la Constitution de la VGFN viole le droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 que lui garantit le par. 15(1) de la Charte. La VGFN convient avec la Cour supr\u00eame et la Cour d\u2019appel du Yukon que l\u2019art. 25 agit comme un bouclier pour prot\u00e9ger l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence contre les contestations fond\u00e9es sur le droit garanti par le par. 15(1) de la Charte. Madame Dickson r\u00e9pond que l\u2019art. 25 ne fait pas obstacle \u00e0 sa demande. Selon elle, si l\u2019on soup\u00e8se de mani\u00e8re appropri\u00e9e l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence et la protection offerte aux droits autochtones vis\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25 en tenant compte de l\u2019article premier de la Charte, la conclusion qui s\u2019impose est que cette obligation viole de mani\u00e8re injustifi\u00e9e dans les circonstances son droit de ne pas faire l\u2019objet de discrimination.\n[103] Les articles 15, 25 et premier de la Charte sont r\u00e9dig\u00e9s ainsi :\n15 (1) La loi ne fait acception de personne et s\u2019applique \u00e9galement \u00e0 tous, et tous ont droit \u00e0 la m\u00eame protection et au m\u00eame b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de la loi, ind\u00e9pendamment de toute discrimination, notamment des discriminations fond\u00e9es sur la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, le sexe, l\u2019\u00e2ge ou les d\u00e9ficiences mentales ou physiques.\n(2) Le paragraphe (1) n\u2019a pas pour effet d\u2019interdire les lois, programmes ou activit\u00e9s destin\u00e9s \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer la situation d\u2019individus ou de groupes d\u00e9favoris\u00e9s, notamment du fait de leur race, de leur origine nationale ou ethnique, de leur couleur, de leur religion, de leur sexe, de leur \u00e2ge ou de leurs d\u00e9ficiences mentales ou physiques.\n25 Le fait que la pr\u00e9sente charte garantit certains droits et libert\u00e9s ne porte pas atteinte aux droits ou libert\u00e9s \u2014 ancestraux, issus de trait\u00e9s ou autres \u2014 des peuples autochtones du Canada, notamment :\na) aux droits ou libert\u00e9s reconnus par la proclamation royale du 7 octobre 1763;\nb) aux droits ou libert\u00e9s existants issus d\u2019accords sur des revendications territoriales ou ceux susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre ainsi acquis.\n1 La Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s garantit les droits et libert\u00e9s qui y sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9s. Ils ne peuvent \u00eatre restreints que par une r\u00e8gle de droit, dans des limites qui soient raisonnables et dont la justification puisse se d\u00e9montrer dans le cadre d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 libre et d\u00e9mocratique.\n[104] Depuis l\u2019av\u00e8nement de la Charte, la Cour a eu relativement peu d\u2019occasions de se pencher sur le sens de l\u2019art. 25. Lorsqu\u2019elle l\u2019a fait \u2014 par exemple dans R. c. Kapp, 2008 CSC 41, [2008] 2 R.C.S. 483, et Corbiere \u2014, elle a examin\u00e9 le droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 dans des circonstances diff\u00e9rentes de celles de l\u2019affaire qui nous occupe. La pr\u00e9sente esp\u00e8ce porte sur un diff\u00e9rend entre une premi\u00e8re nation et l\u2019une de ses propres membres et invite notre Cour \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019art. 25 relativement \u00e0 une obligation de r\u00e9sidence qui fait elle\u2011m\u00eame partie de la loi constitutionnelle d\u2019une premi\u00e8re nation autonome.\n[105] L\u2019arr\u00eat Corbiere portait effectivement sur la constitutionnalit\u00e9 d\u2019une exigence relative au droit de vote qui pourrait \u00eatre compar\u00e9e \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle contest\u00e9e par Mme Dickson, mais dans cette affaire\u2011l\u00e0 l\u2019exigence relevait de la Loi sur les Indiens, et non de la constitution d\u2019un peuple autochtone. Dans l\u2019affaire Kapp, il \u00e9tait question d\u2019une plainte pour discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le par. 15(1) de la Charte, ainsi que de l\u2019application possible de l\u2019art. 25 en guise de r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette contestation, mais cette affaire avait \u00e9t\u00e9 intent\u00e9e par une personne non autochtone et ne concernait pas une loi autochtone. Et, bien que l\u2019arr\u00eat Taypotat (CSC) ait port\u00e9 sur la contestation d\u2019une r\u00e8gle d\u2019\u00e9ligibilit\u00e9 \u00e9lectorale d\u2019une premi\u00e8re nation pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par un membre d\u2019une communaut\u00e9 autochtone en vertu du par. 15(1) de la Charte, cet appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9 sans que l\u2019art. 25 ne soit examin\u00e9. Ce qui complique encore davantage le lien entre le droit collectif de la VGFN pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25 et le droit individuel invoqu\u00e9 par Mme Dickson, c\u2019est le fait qu\u2019en d\u00e9finitive les deux sont enracin\u00e9s dans l\u2019autochtonit\u00e9 (voir, de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Swiffen, p. 34).\n[106] Dans d\u2019autres affaires, la Cour a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25, mais elle n\u2019a pas eu l\u2019occasion, comme en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, d\u2019examiner en profondeur l\u2019application et les effets de la disposition. La jurisprudence de la Cour offre donc uniquement de modestes indications pour trancher le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi. Cela invite \u00e0 la prudence. Les commentaires formul\u00e9s par la majorit\u00e9 dans Kapp sur les subtilit\u00e9s de l\u2019art. 25 m\u00e9ritent d\u2019\u00eatre rappel\u00e9s : \u00ab . . . il serait plus prudent de laisser \u00e0 la Cour le soin de trancher ces questions au fur et \u00e0 mesure qu\u2019elles seront soulev\u00e9es dans des cas particuliers \u00bb (par. 65). En cons\u00e9quence, nos motifs s\u2019attachent principalement \u00e0 la t\u00e2che \u00e0 accomplir : d\u00e9cider comment l\u2019art. 25 s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence qui est pr\u00e9vue par la constitution d\u2019une premi\u00e8re nation autonome et que conteste l\u2019une de ses membres en vertu du par. 15(1) de la Charte.\n[107] L\u2019objet de l\u2019art. 25 est de faire respecter certains droits et libert\u00e9s collectifs des peuples autochtones lorsque ces droits collectifs entrent en conflit avec des droits garantis \u00e0 un particulier par la Charte. Lorsqu\u2019un tel droit porterait atteinte \u00e0 un droit ancestral, issu de trait\u00e9 ou autre, l\u2019art. 25 exige que le droit autochtone collectif ait pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance, m\u00eame si le demandeur invoquant la Charte est un membre de la premi\u00e8re nation concern\u00e9e.\n[108] Lorsque des \u00ab droits ou libert\u00e9s \u00bb \u2014 ancestraux, issus de trait\u00e9s ou \u00ab autres \u00bb \u2014 pr\u00e9cis\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25 sont en jeu, les limites d\u2019un droit individuel concurrent garanti par la Charte n\u2019ont pas \u00e0 \u00eatre justifi\u00e9es comme ce serait habituellement le cas en application de l\u2019article premier de la Charte. Contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019article premier, l\u2019art. 25 est l\u2019expression du choix constitutionnel de prot\u00e9ger les droits et libert\u00e9s collectifs des peuples autochtones au Canada en tant que minorit\u00e9 distincte. Au paragraphe 49 du Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la s\u00e9cession, la Cour a identifi\u00e9 \u00ab le respect des droits des minorit\u00e9s \u00bb comme un principe constitutionnel sous\u2011jacent qui impr\u00e8gne l\u2019ensemble de la Constitution. La protection des minorit\u00e9s linguistiques et religieuses est un exemple de ce principe sous\u2011jacent, tout comme la protection des droits des peuples autochtones en tant que minorit\u00e9 distincte. Notre Cour a mentionn\u00e9 que, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 une longue tradition de respect des minorit\u00e9s, l\u2019art. 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 prot\u00e8ge les droits existants \u2014 ancestraux ou issus de trait\u00e9s \u2014, tandis que l\u2019art. 25 \u00e9nonce de mani\u00e8re semblable une \u00ab clause de non\u2011atteinte aux droits des peuples autochtones \u00bb (Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la s\u00e9cession, par. 82). La Cour a rattach\u00e9 la protection de l\u2019art. 25 \u00e0 la \u00ab force [de la] promesse \u00bb faite envers les peuples autochtones du Canada \u00e0 l\u2019art. 35 qu\u2019elle avait expliqu\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Sparrow, p. 1083. Cette promesse \u00ab reconna[issait] non seulement l\u2019occupation pass\u00e9e de terres par les autochtones, mais aussi leur contribution \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9dification du Canada et les engagements sp\u00e9ciaux pris envers eux par des gouvernements successifs \u00bb (Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la s\u00e9cession, par. 82)\n[109] Conform\u00e9ment au principe de protection des peuples autochtones en tant que minorit\u00e9 distincte, les \u00ab droits ou libert\u00e9s [. . .] autres \u00bb vis\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25 se limitent aux droits et libert\u00e9s qui prot\u00e8gent la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone. Tous les droits et libert\u00e9s autochtones collectifs dont il est question \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25 doivent \u00eatre maintenus, m\u00eame s\u2019ils entrent en conflit avec des droits individuels garantis par la Charte, afin d\u2019assurer le respect des droits des minorit\u00e9s en tant que valeur constitutionnelle.\n[110] La protection des droits \u2014 ancestraux, issus de trait\u00e9s ou autres \u2014 vis\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25 n\u2019est toutefois pas absolue. La priorit\u00e9 est seulement donn\u00e9e aux droits collectifs autochtones lorsqu\u2019ils entrent en conflit avec un droit individuel garanti par la Charte. Il est possible, dans une affaire donn\u00e9e, que le droit individuel ainsi que les droits collectifs vis\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25 ne soient pas r\u00e9ellement en conflit. Certains droits individuels font partie du droit autochtone et coexistent avec les int\u00e9r\u00eats collectifs, comme l\u2019indiquent clairement tant la Loi sur la DNUDPA que la Constitution de la VGFN (voir Metallic, p. 15; G. Otis, \u00ab \u00c9lection, gouvernance traditionnelle et droits fondamentaux chez les peuples autochtones du Canada \u00bb (2004), 49 R.D. McGill 393, p. 409\u2011411). En outre, l\u2019art. 25 ne s\u2019appliquerait pas si le droit individuel garanti par la Charte en question entrait en conflit avec un droit autochtone qui ne repose pas sur la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone. Dans de telles circonstances, toute limite au droit individuel doit \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e au regard de l\u2019article premier de la Charte. Et, tout comme les droits reconnus \u00e0 l\u2019art. 35, la primaut\u00e9 accord\u00e9e aux droits collectifs vis\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25 est assujettie \u00e0 la garantie d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 dont b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient les \u00ab personnes des deux sexes \u00bb en vertu de l\u2019art. 28 de la Charte et du par. 35(4) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982.\n[111] Dans les motifs qui suivent, nous entendons \u00e9laborer un cadre d\u2019analyse permettant d\u2019appliquer l\u2019art. 25 aux circonstances de la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Les parties et les intervenants ont d\u00e9crit l\u2019art. 25 comme \u00e9tant soit \u00ab un bouclier \u00bb, soit un \u00ab prisme interpr\u00e9tatif \u00bb, mais, \u00e0 notre humble avis, aucun de ces termes ne d\u00e9crit ad\u00e9quatement cette disposition. L\u2019article 25 dispose que, lorsqu\u2019un droit garanti par la Charte porte atteinte \u00e0 un droit \u2014 ancestral, issu de trait\u00e9 ou autre \u2014 des peuples autochtones du Canada, il peut agir comme bouclier et \u00ab prot\u00e9ger \u00bb les droits collectifs autochtones contre certaines applications de la Charte. Cependant, pour d\u00e9terminer si le droit individuel garanti par la Charte entre en conflit avec le droit ou la libert\u00e9 qui appartient collectivement aux Autochtones, le droit individuel garanti par la Charte doit d\u2019abord, suivant la version anglaise de l\u2019art. 25, \u00eatre \u00ab construed \u00bb (c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire \u00ab interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00bb). De m\u00eame, pour d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence inscrite dans la Constitution de la VGFN constitue l\u2019un des \u00ab autres \u00bb droits ou libert\u00e9s des \u00ab peuples autochtones du Canada \u00bb vis\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25, il faut interpr\u00e9ter cette obligation.\n[112] Dans les paragraphes qui suivent, nous allons d\u2019abord examiner l\u2019art. 25 \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de son objet, en tenant d\u00fbment compte de son texte, de la nature et de l\u2019objectif plus large de la Charte, ainsi que de l\u2019historique de cette disposition. Ensuite, nous allons aborder les \u00ab autres \u00bb droits et libert\u00e9s collectifs vis\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25 et leur rapport avec la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone. Enfin, nous analyserons la port\u00e9e des dimensions dites \u00ab protectrice \u00bb et \u00ab interpr\u00e9tative \u00bb de l\u2019art. 25 avant de nous demander si cette disposition prot\u00e8ge l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence pr\u00e9vue dans la Constitution de la VGFN contre la contestation de Mme Dickson fond\u00e9e sur le par. 15(1), et \u00e9galement si la VGFN doit justifier son obligation de r\u00e9sidence au regard de l\u2019article premier de la Charte.\n(2) Objet de l\u2019art. 25\n[113] Notre Cour reconna\u00eet depuis longtemps que la Charte doit recevoir une interpr\u00e9tation t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique (voir Hunter, p. 156\u2011157; R. c. Poulin, 2019 CSC 47, [2019] 3 R.C.S. 566, par. 32). Dans le cadre d\u2019une telle approche, le tribunal examine, en guise de premier facteur, le texte de la disposition en question, puis se penche sur \u00ab la nature et [l]es objectifs plus larges de la Charte elle\u2011m\u00eame [. . .], [l]es origines historiques des concepts ench\u00e2ss\u00e9s et, s\u2019il y a lieu, [le] sens et [. . .] l\u2019objet des autres libert\u00e9s et droits particuliers qui s\u2019y rattachent \u00bb (Poulin, par. 32, citant Big M Drug Mart, p. 344; voir aussi Qu\u00e9bec (Procureure g\u00e9n\u00e9rale) c. 9147\u20110732 Qu\u00e9bec inc., 2020 CSC 32, [2020] 3 R.C.S. 426, par. 10).\n[114] De plus, comme l\u2019a \u00e9crit le juge en chef Lamer dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Van der Peet, [1996] 2 R.C.S. 507, le rapport de fiduciaire entre la Couronne et les peuples autochtones suppose que \u00ab les trait\u00e9s, le par. 35(1) et les autres dispositions l\u00e9gislatives et constitutionnelles prot\u00e9geant les droits des peuples autochtones doivent recevoir une interpr\u00e9tation g\u00e9n\u00e9reuse et lib\u00e9rale \u00bb (par. 24, citant R. c. George, [1966] R.C.S. 267, p. 279). \u00c0 notre avis, la protection des int\u00e9r\u00eats de la minorit\u00e9 autochtone vis\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25 devrait \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e dans le m\u00eame esprit.\n[115] Devant notre Cour, Mme Dickson affirme que l\u2019objet de l\u2019art. 25, [traduction] \u00ab tout comme celui de l\u2019art. 35, est la r\u00e9conciliation des peuples autochtones du Canada avec l\u2019\u00c9tat canadien au sens large \u00bb (m.a., par. 57). Pour elle, l\u2019art. 25 s\u2019accorde avec les instruments internationaux assurant un \u00e9quilibre dans lequel les peuples autochtones ont droit \u00e0 la [traduction] \u00ab pleine jouissance \u00bb de leurs droits et libert\u00e9s collectifs et individuels, ce qui signifie que l\u2019art. 25 est \u00ab une disposition interpr\u00e9tative ayant pour objectif la r\u00e9conciliation \u00bb (recueil condens\u00e9 de l\u2019appelante, p. 10). La VGFN exhorte la Cour \u00e0 examiner diff\u00e9remment l\u2019art. 25 et l\u2019objectif de r\u00e9conciliation. Elle affirme que l\u2019art. 25 a pour objet de [traduction] \u00ab prot\u00e9ger l\u2019espace n\u00e9cessaire pour que les peuples autochtones continuent d\u2019\u00eatre autochtones \u00bb \u00e0 mesure que se d\u00e9roule le processus de r\u00e9conciliation (recueil condens\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, p. 1). La VGFN plaide que cet \u00ab espace \u00bb comprend le droit collectif \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale, fond\u00e9 sur les [traduction] \u00ab soci\u00e9t\u00e9s pr\u00e9existantes des peuples autochtones \u00bb (p. 1). \u00c0 notre avis, les deux points de vue sont fond\u00e9s : l\u2019art. 25 op\u00e8re dans le but de \u00ab concilier \u00bb des droits individuels et collectifs oppos\u00e9s et de cr\u00e9er une dynamique in\u00e9dite permettant de r\u00e9soudre tout conflit de ce genre, mais il donne aussi la pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance \u00e0 certains droits autochtones sur des droits individuels oppos\u00e9s garantis par la Charte, cela afin de promouvoir la conciliation entre les peuples autochtones et l\u2019affirmation de la souverainet\u00e9 de la Couronne (voir R. c. Desautel, 2021 CSC 17, [2021] 1 R.C.S. 533, par. 22).\n[116] Les deux premi\u00e8res juridictions (voir motifs de premi\u00e8re instance, par. 198; motifs de la C.A., par. 148) se sont fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 d\u2019objet de l\u2019art. 25 que le juge Bastarache a d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 dans ses motifs concordants dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Kapp : \u00ab . . . prot\u00e9ger les droits des peuples autochtones lorsque l\u2019application des protections \u00e9tablies dans la Charte \u00e0 l\u2019endroit des individus diminuerait l\u2019identit\u00e9 distinctive, collective et culturelle d\u2019un groupe autochtone . . . \u00bb (par. 89, citant J. M. Arbour, \u00ab The Protection of Aboriginal Rights within a Human Rights Regime : In Search of an Analytical Framework for Section 25 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms \u00bb (2003), 21 S.C.L.R. (2d) 3, p. 60). Une doctrine abondante appuie aussi la th\u00e8se selon laquelle l\u2019art. 25 a essentiellement un objectif de protection \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des int\u00e9r\u00eats collectifs autochtones (voir, p. ex., W. Pentney, \u00ab The Rights of the Aboriginal Peoples of Canada and the Constitution Act, 1982 : Part I \u2014 The Interpretive Prism of Section 25 \u00bb (1988), 22 U.B.C. L. Rev. 21, p. 28); K. McNeil, \u00ab The Constitutional Rights of the Aboriginal Peoples of Canada \u00bb (1982), 4 S.C.L.R. 255, p. 262; Macklem, p. 225; C. Hutchinson, \u00ab Case Comment on R. v. Kapp : An Analytical Framework for Section 25 of the Charter \u00bb (2007), 52 R.D. McGill 173, p. 179). \u00c0 l\u2019instar de certains intervenants, y compris le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (m. interv., par. 29), la VGFN demande \u00e0 notre Cour de faire sien l\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 d\u2019objet du juge Bastarache (m.i., par. 104).\n[117] La Cour, \u00e0 la majorit\u00e9, n\u2019a jamais analys\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re exhaustive l\u2019objet de l\u2019art. 25 de la Charte. Le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi nous oblige \u00e0 le faire. Nous sommes d\u2019avis que l\u2019objet de l\u2019art. 25 de la Charte est de veiller \u00e0 ce que les droits et libert\u00e9s d\u00e9sign\u00e9s des peuples autochtones soient prot\u00e9g\u00e9s lorsque le fait de donner effet \u00e0 des droits et libert\u00e9s individuels oppos\u00e9s et garantis par la Charte diminuerait la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone. Cet objet s\u2019harmonise avec les objectifs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de l\u2019art. 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982, en plus d\u2019\u00eatre en phase avec le cadre retenu par notre Cour pour concilier la souverainet\u00e9 de la Couronne avec la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 que les peuples autochtones vivaient ici, dans des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s distinctes dot\u00e9es de lois, traditions et coutumes, bien avant le contact avec les Europ\u00e9ens (voir Van der Peet, par. 31). L\u2019article 25 se fait l\u2019\u00e9cho de la volont\u00e9 de concilier les droits et libert\u00e9s individuels garantis par la Charte \u00e0 tous les Canadiens avec les droits collectifs distinctifs des peuples autochtones. Cette protection des droits et libert\u00e9s collectifs s\u2019accorde aussi avec la D\u00e9claration des Nations Unies sur les droits des peuples autochtones, incorpor\u00e9e en droit canadien par la Loi sur la DNUDPA. Nous rappelons en particulier l\u2019article 34 de la D\u00e9claration : \u00ab Les peuples autochtones ont le droit de promouvoir, de d\u00e9velopper et de conserver leurs structures institutionnelles et leurs coutumes, spiritualit\u00e9, traditions, proc\u00e9dures ou pratiques particuli\u00e8res et, lorsqu\u2019ils existent, leurs syst\u00e8mes ou coutumes juridiques, en conformit\u00e9 avec les normes internationales relatives aux droits de l\u2019homme. \u00bb\n[118] Quatre indices interpr\u00e9tatifs \u00e9tayent notre point de vue selon lequel l\u2019art. 25 a pour objet de prot\u00e9ger la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone contre une \u00e9rosion inappropri\u00e9e caus\u00e9e par les droits individuels garantis par la Charte : (1) le texte de la disposition; (2) la nature et les objectifs plus larges de la Charte; (3) l\u2019origine, le sens et l\u2019objet des droits ancestraux et issus de trait\u00e9s auxquels il est fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25; (4) la preuve extrins\u00e8que relative \u00e0 l\u2019adoption de l\u2019art. 25.\na) Texte de l\u2019art. 25\n[119] Premi\u00e8rement, le texte de l\u2019art. 25 indique clairement l\u2019objectif protecteur de cette disposition. Deux aspects du libell\u00e9 sont importants. Le premier aspect a trait aux mots\u2011cl\u00e9s utilis\u00e9s dans les versions anglaise et fran\u00e7aise de la disposition \u2014 \u00ab shall not be construed so as to abrogate or derogate \u00bb en anglais, et \u00ab ne porte pas atteinte \u00bb en fran\u00e7ais \u2014 qui signalent que l\u2019art. 25 prot\u00e8ge les droits collectifs autochtones contre les violations qui d\u00e9couleraient de l\u2019application de droits ou libert\u00e9s individuels oppos\u00e9s garantis par la Charte. Ce langage fort a \u00e9t\u00e9 vu par certains comme le signe le plus clair que l\u2019art. 25 fait \u00ab obstacle \u00bb ou agit comme \u00ab bouclier \u00bb contre l\u2019application d\u2019un droit garanti par la Charte qui diminuerait un int\u00e9r\u00eat autochtone collectif prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Le second aspect a trait \u00e0 la nature des droits autochtones qui sont pertinents pour l\u2019application de l\u2019art. 25. Les passages \u00ab that pertain to the aboriginal peoples of Canada \u00bb en anglais, et \u00ab des peuples autochtones du Canada \u00bb en fran\u00e7ais, sugg\u00e8rent l\u2019existence d\u2019un guide quant \u00e0 la port\u00e9e concr\u00e8te de la protection accord\u00e9e par l\u2019art. 25.\n[120] Pour certains, la pr\u00e9sence dans la version anglaise des mots \u00ab shall not be construed \u00bb \u2014 qui sont absents dans la version fran\u00e7aise \u2014 sugg\u00e8re que l\u2019art. 25 poss\u00e8de une dimension interpr\u00e9tative. De plus, les mots \u00ab pertain to \u00bb utilis\u00e9s dans le texte anglais tendent \u00e0 indiquer que les autres droits se rapportant aux peuples autochtones couvrent un large \u00e9ventail; pour d\u2019autres par contre, la mention \u00ab des peuples autochtones \u00bb dans la version fran\u00e7aise est plus limitative. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que la d\u00e9marche en vue d\u2019appr\u00e9hender l\u2019objet de l\u2019art. 25 commence par l\u2019examen de son texte, il est important d\u2019examiner attentivement ces deux indices. Il convient d\u2019\u00e9carter toute id\u00e9e que les versions fran\u00e7aise et anglaise de la disposition divergent ou ne permettent pas de d\u00e9gager un sens commun bas\u00e9 sur un seul et unique objet, \u00e0 savoir la protection des int\u00e9r\u00eats autochtones collectifs contre la diminution qui proviendrait de l\u2019application de droits individuels garantis par la Charte.\n[121] Bien entendu, les textes fran\u00e7ais et anglais ont \u00e9galement force de loi, en tant qu\u2019expressions de l\u2019intention exprim\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25 (voir l\u2019art. 57 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982; R. Sullivan, The Construction of Statutes (7e \u00e9d. 2022), p. 114\u2011115). Suivant un principe d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation bilingue reconnu, applicable \u00e0 la Charte, l\u2019exercice consistant \u00e0 d\u00e9gager l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur peut \u00e0 bon droit inclure la recherche d\u2019un sens commun aux deux textes linguistiques, typiquement d\u00e9termin\u00e9 par une lecture conjointe des deux versions (R. c. Collins, [1987] 1 R.C.S. 265, p. 287\u2011288; R. c. Lewis, [1996] 1 R.C.S. 921, par. 72; voir aussi P.\u2011A. C\u00f4t\u00e9 et M. Devinat, Interpr\u00e9tation des lois (5e \u00e9d. 2021), no 1126).\n[122] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Kapp, le juge Bastarache a longuement analys\u00e9 le texte de l\u2019art. 25, s\u2019int\u00e9ressant notamment aux discordances possibles entre les versions fran\u00e7aise et anglaise en tant que mesures du sens de la disposition. Nous souscrivons \u00e0 sa conclusion portant que les diff\u00e9rences observables entre le libell\u00e9 des versions fran\u00e7aise et anglaise ne sont pas d\u00e9terminantes quant au sens \u00e0 donner \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25, et que l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation conjointe \u00e9taie la th\u00e8se de l\u2019existence d\u2019un seul et unique objectif protecteur (voir les par. 86 et 101\u2011103).\n[123] Les mots \u00ab abrogate or derogate \u00bb et \u00ab porte [. . .] atteinte \u00bb sugg\u00e8rent que l\u2019objet de l\u2019art. 25 est ce que notre Cour a parfois appel\u00e9 une \u00ab clause de non\u2011atteinte aux droits des peuples autochtones \u00bb (Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la s\u00e9cession, par. 82), ou une disposition qui \u00ab prot\u00e8ge \u00bb les droits ancestraux contre une abrogation ou une d\u00e9rogation (Desautel, par. 39). Les expressions choisies indiquent toutes deux que l\u2019art. 25 peut emp\u00eacher que des droits individuels oppos\u00e9s garantis par la Charte portent atteinte aux int\u00e9r\u00eats collectifs autochtones. Les deux textes expriment cette id\u00e9e un peu diff\u00e9remment. L\u2019auteure Jane M. Arbour a utilement fait remarquer que le texte fran\u00e7ais est plus [traduction] \u00ab d\u00e9claratoire \u00bb quant \u00e0 l\u2019effet protecteur de l\u2019art. 25 qui op\u00e9rerait si un droit individuel garanti par la Charte portait atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat collectif autochtone en cause (p. 27). Par comparaison, a\u2011t\u2011elle \u00e9crit, les mots \u00ab shall not be construed \u00bb dans le texte anglais renvoient express\u00e9ment \u00e0 un exercice interpr\u00e9tatif (p. 27). Elle n\u2019a toutefois pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que cette diff\u00e9rence d\u2019accentuation avait quelque cons\u00e9quence en droit.\n[124] Il y a un sens commun \u00e0 l\u2019objectif central de protection v\u00e9hicul\u00e9 par les deux versions linguistiques. Pour d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat collectif autochtone en cause devrait avoir pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance sur le droit individuel que la Charte garantit \u00e0 un demandeur (ou \u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9 contre ce droit), il faut d\u00e9cider si ce que le juge Bastarache a appel\u00e9 les deux \u00ab droits inconciliables \u00bb entrent en conflit, ce qui exige qu\u2019ils soient \u00ab interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s \u00bb (Kapp, par. 87). Cet exercice interpr\u00e9tatif est mentionn\u00e9 explicitement dans le texte anglais, alors qu\u2019il est implicite dans le texte fran\u00e7ais plus d\u00e9claratoire : il faut interpr\u00e9ter les deux droits en cause pour \u00eatre en mesure de conclure que le droit individuel garanti par la Charte \u00ab porte [. . .] atteinte \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat collectif autochtone. De m\u00eame, il est uniquement possible de conclure que le droit individuel garanti par la Charte a pour effet de \u00ab porter atteinte \u00bb (\u00ab to abrogate \u00bb \u2014 c.\u2011\u00e0\u2011d. abroger ou annuler \u2014 ou \u00ab to derogate from \u00bb \u2014 c.\u2011\u00e0\u2011d. d\u00e9roger \u00e0 \u2014 dans la version anglaise) au droit collectif apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9termin\u00e9, au terme d\u2019un exercice initial d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des int\u00e9r\u00eats oppos\u00e9s, si le droit collectif est incompatible avec le droit ou la libert\u00e9 individuel garanti par la Charte. En employant une expression g\u00e9n\u00e9rique, le texte fran\u00e7ais met l\u2019accent sur l\u2019effet du conflit (\u00ab porter [. . .] atteinte \u00bb), tandis que le texte anglais renvoie \u00e0 la m\u00eame r\u00e9alit\u00e9 en pr\u00e9cisant comment l\u2019effet du conflit se manifeste (\u00ab abrogate \u00bb or \u00ab derogate \u00bb). Le sens commun qui se d\u00e9gage des textes fran\u00e7ais et anglais sugg\u00e8re ainsi que l\u2019art. 25 poss\u00e8de \u00e0 la fois une dimension interpr\u00e9tative et une dimension protectrice, qui sont toutes deux pertinentes en ce qui concerne l\u2019objet de la disposition. Ce sont les exigences de forme linguistique qui expliquent le mieux la diff\u00e9rence d\u2019expression.\n[125] Cependant, le libell\u00e9 imp\u00e9ratif du texte anglais (\u00ab shall not be construed \u00bb) et la formulation d\u00e9claratoire du texte fran\u00e7ais (\u00ab ne porte pas atteinte \u00bb) sugg\u00e8rent que l\u2019\u00e9tendue de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation est limit\u00e9e, et, dans les deux textes, tout pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire dont disposent les tribunaux pour interpr\u00e9ter les int\u00e9r\u00eats individuels et collectifs oppos\u00e9s est restreint par la directive selon laquelle le droit individuel ne peut entrer en conflit avec l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat prot\u00e9g\u00e9 de la minorit\u00e9. En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, les deux versions linguistiques de la Charte \u00ab ne sont pas seulement compatibles, mais constituent \u00e9galement des mani\u00e8res diff\u00e9rentes d\u2019exprimer la m\u00eame id\u00e9e \u00bb (9147\u20110732 Qu\u00e9bec inc., par. 65, la juge Abella, dissidente, mais non sur ce point).\n[126] Dans un contexte \u00e9troitement li\u00e9, la Loi sur la DNUDPA contient une disposition, situ\u00e9e dans la section \u00ab D\u00e9finitions et interpr\u00e9tation \u00bb de la version fran\u00e7aise et la section \u00ab Interpretation \u00bb de la version anglaise, respectivement, qui maintient les droits autochtones de mani\u00e8re semblable. Le paragraphe 2(2) pr\u00e9voit : en fran\u00e7ais, \u00ab [l]a pr\u00e9sente loi maintient les droits des peuples autochtones reconnus et confirm\u00e9s par l\u2019article 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982; elle n\u2019y porte pas atteinte \u00bb; et, en anglais, \u00ab [t]his Act is to be construed as upholding the rights of Indigenous peoples recognized and affirmed by section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982, and not as abrogating or derogating from them \u00bb. Cela appuie le point de vue selon lequel le \u00ab maintien \u00bb ou \u00ab upholding \u00bb en anglais, des droits autochtones en vertu de l\u2019objet protecteur de l\u2019art. 25 de la Charte peut impliquer des \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui tiennent \u00e0 la fois d\u2019un bouclier et d\u2019un exercice interpr\u00e9tatif.\n[127] De m\u00eame, la diff\u00e9rence sur le plan de l\u2019accentuation entre l\u2019expression fran\u00e7aise \u00ab des peuples autochtones \u00bb et l\u2019expression anglaise \u00ab pertain to the aboriginal peoples \u00bb, n\u2019a aucune cons\u00e9quence juridique \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re du sens qui est clairement commun aux deux versions. Il est vrai que l\u2019expression \u00ab pertain to \u00bb a un sens potentiellement large, qui s\u2019\u00e9tend au\u2011del\u00e0 des droits qui appartiendraient aux peuples autochtones pour inclure ceux qui pourraient se rapporter \u00e0 eux de mani\u00e8re plus accessoire. L\u2019utilisation du d\u00e9terminant \u00ab des \u00bb en fran\u00e7ais a un sens nettement plus \u00e9troit. Les professeurs Pierre\u2011Andr\u00e9 C\u00f4t\u00e9 et Mathieu Devinat expliquent qu\u2019en pareil cas, \u00ab [l]e sens commun aux deux versions est alors celui du texte ayant le sens le plus restreint \u00bb (no 1131). En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le sens le plus \u00e9troit communiqu\u00e9 par la version fran\u00e7aise est commun \u00e0 la version anglaise : \u00ab des peuples autochtones \u00bb renvoie aux droits qui appartiennent ou b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient aux peuples autochtones en tant que peuples autochtones ou, comme l\u2019a fait remarquer le juge Bastarache dans Kapp, aux droits \u00ab qui leur sont propres \u00bb (par. 101). Ce lien plus \u00e9troit entre le droit ou la libert\u00e9 et les peuples autochtones s\u2019av\u00e9rera important, comme nous le verrons, pour d\u00e9gager ce que les auteurs ont d\u00e9crit comme \u00e9tant la \u00ab sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone \u00bb, dont il est question dans les droits ou libert\u00e9s vis\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25.\n[128] Nous notons \u00e9galement que la disposition est d\u00e9crite ainsi dans les notes marginales de l\u2019art. 25 : \u00ab Maintien des droits et libert\u00e9s des autochtones \u00bb en fran\u00e7ais et \u00ab Aboriginal rights and freedoms not affected by Charter \u00bb en anglais. Les notes marginales ne font \u00e9videmment pas partie int\u00e9grante du texte de la disposition, et aucun poids d\u00e9terminant ne devrait donc leur \u00eatre attribu\u00e9 dans l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des dispositions de la Charte (voir R. c. Wigglesworth, [1987] 2 R.C.S. 541, p. 556\u2011558). Cependant, aussi limit\u00e9e que soit leur valeur interpr\u00e9tative, ces notes appuient l\u2019opinion selon laquelle l\u2019art. 25 a pour objet de prot\u00e9ger les droits appartenant aux peuples autochtones du Canada contre certains effets que l\u2019application de la Charte aurait autrement.\n[129] Enfin, il convient de souligner que les termes utilis\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25 se retrouvent \u00e9galement aux art. 21 et 22 de la Charte sur le maintien de certains droits linguistiques, et \u00e0 l\u2019art. 29 sur le maintien de droits relatifs \u00e0 certaines \u00e9coles. Ces dispositions utilisent effectivement un libell\u00e9 similaire \u00e0 celui de l\u2019art. 25 : en anglais \u00ab [n]othing in [the relevant provisions] abrogates or derogates from [pre\u2011existing rights] \u00bb, et en fran\u00e7ais \u00ab n\u2019ont pas pour effet de porter atteinte \u00bb. L\u2019article 29, une disposition de la Charte qui se trouve (tout comme l\u2019art. 25) dans la section \u00ab Dispositions g\u00e9n\u00e9rales \u00bb \/ \u00ab General \u00bb de la Charte, a \u00e9t\u00e9 rattach\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25, car il se rapporte au principe constitutionnel sous\u2011jacent de la protection des droits des minorit\u00e9s (Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la s\u00e9cession, par. 79 et 82). L\u2019article 29, qui a une vocation semblable \u00e0 celle de l\u2019art. 25, a \u00e9t\u00e9 interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 par notre Cour dans l\u2019affaire Renvoi relatif au projet de loi 30, An Act to amend the Education Act (Ont.), [1987] 1 R.C.S. 1148, o\u00f9 la juge Wilson a \u00e9crit que \u00ab l\u2019art. 29 est l\u00e0 pour prot\u00e9ger contre tout examen en vertu de la Charte les droits ou privil\u00e8ges qui autrement, n\u2019\u00e9tait\u2011ce de cet article, pourraient faire l\u2019objet d\u2019un tel examen. [. . .] [I]ls sont \u00e0 l\u2019abri de toute contestation fond\u00e9e sur la Charte \u00bb (p. 1198). Commentant la pertinence de ces dispositions connexes pour l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique de l\u2019art. 25, le professeur Kenneth M. Lysyk a \u00e9crit, avant d\u2019acc\u00e9der \u00e0 la magistrature, que \u00ab [t]outes ces dispositions [c.\u2011\u00e0\u2011d. les art. 21, 25, 26 et 29] ont ceci en commun [qu\u2019]elles visent \u00e0 sauvegarder et \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger des droits qui existent ind\u00e9pendamment de la Charte \u00bb (\u00ab Les droits et libert\u00e9s des peuples autochtones du Canada \u00bb, dans G.\u2011A. Beaudoin et W. S. Tarnopolsky, dir., Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s (1982), 591, p. 596). Cela \u00e9taye davantage l\u2019id\u00e9e que le texte de l\u2019art. 25 a un objectif protecteur qui consiste \u00e0 sauvegarder les droits autochtones contre certains empi\u00e8tements imputables aux droits individuels garantis par la Charte.\nb) Nature et objectifs plus larges de la Charte\n[130] La nature et les objectifs plus larges de la Charte sont conformes \u00e0 l\u2019id\u00e9e que l\u2019objet de l\u2019art. 25 est, comme le sugg\u00e8re le texte, la protection des int\u00e9r\u00eats collectifs de la minorit\u00e9 autochtone contre l\u2019empi\u00e8tement imputable \u00e0 des droits et libert\u00e9s individuels oppos\u00e9s et garantis par la Charte. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Oakes, [1986] 1 R.C.S. 103, le juge en chef Dickson a \u00e9crit que les \u00ab valeurs et [l]es principes essentiels \u00e0 une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 libre et d\u00e9mocratique \u00bb qui peuvent justifier des restrictions aux droits garantis par la Charte comprennent le \u00ab respect de chaque culture et de chaque groupe \u00bb (p. 136). Comme nous l\u2019avons vu, cette derni\u00e8re id\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crite au par. 82 du Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la s\u00e9cession comme une \u00ab valeur constitutionnelle sous\u2011jacente \u00bb \u2014 celle de la protection des droits des minorit\u00e9s. Elle trouve son expression dans le texte constitutionnel par l\u2019entremise, entre autres dispositions, de l\u2019art. 25 de la Charte (voir aussi Metallic, p. 13). Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Van der Peet, le juge en chef Lamer a expliqu\u00e9 que c\u2019est l\u2019occupation ant\u00e9rieure de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique du Nord par les peuples autochtones qui \u00ab [les] distingue [. . .] de tous les autres groupes minoritaires du pays et qui commande leur statut juridique \u2014 et maintenant constitutionnel \u2014 particulier \u00bb (par. 30).\n[131] M\u00eame si la Charte prot\u00e8ge indubitablement les droits individuels (voir McKinney, p. 261), ces arr\u00eats de principe et la jurisprudence plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de notre Cour confirment que la Charte ne vise pas \u00e0 le faire au d\u00e9triment des droits collectifs des peuples autochtones du Canada en tant que minorit\u00e9 distincte m\u00e9ritant la protection de la Constitution. Reconna\u00eetre que l\u2019art. 25 prot\u00e8ge certains droits et libert\u00e9s contre les atteintes qui pourraient d\u00e9couler du fait qu\u2019il est donn\u00e9 effet \u00e0 des droits et libert\u00e9s oppos\u00e9s garantis par la Charte est, par cons\u00e9quent, conforme \u00e0 la nature et aux objectifs primordiaux de la Charte elle\u2011m\u00eame.\nc) Origines historiques, sens et objet des droits ancestraux et issus de trait\u00e9s\n[132] Les droits ancestraux et issus de trait\u00e9s vis\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 nous \u00e9clairent sur la protection accord\u00e9e par l\u2019art. 25, qui renvoie en partie aux m\u00eames droits. L\u2019article 35 conf\u00e8re \u00e0 ces droits un statut constitutionnel en les prot\u00e9geant contre les violations injustifi\u00e9es d\u00e9coulant des actes des d\u00e9tenteurs du pouvoir l\u00e9gislatif et ex\u00e9cutif (voir Sparrow).\n[133] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Van der Peet, le juge en chef Lamer a expliqu\u00e9 que la doctrine des droits ancestraux et la m\u00e9thode d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation lib\u00e9rale de ces droits dans la Constitution s\u2019expliquent par un simple fait historique : \u00ab . . . quand les Europ\u00e9ens sont arriv\u00e9s en Am\u00e9rique du Nord, les peuples autochtones s\u2019y trouvaient d\u00e9j\u00e0, ils vivaient en collectivit\u00e9s sur ce territoire et participaient \u00e0 des cultures distinctives, comme ils l\u2019avaient fait pendant des si\u00e8cles \u00bb (par. 30 (soulignement dans l\u2019original)). Il a en cons\u00e9quence d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l\u2019art. 35 \u00ab \u00e9tablit le cadre constitutionnel qui permet de reconna\u00eetre que les autochtones vivaient sur le territoire en soci\u00e9t\u00e9s distinctives, poss\u00e9dant leurs propres cultures, pratiques et traditions, et de concilier ce fait avec la souverainet\u00e9 de Sa Majest\u00e9 \u00bb (par. 31).\n[134] L\u2019article 35 a en outre constitutionnalis\u00e9 les droits issus de trait\u00e9s que d\u00e9tiennent les peuples autochtones du Canada et, aux termes du par. 35(3), il est entendu que \u00ab sont compris parmi les droits issus de trait\u00e9s [. . .] les droits existants issus d\u2019accords sur des revendications territoriales ou ceux susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre ainsi acquis \u00bb. Cette garantie constitutionnelle est justifi\u00e9e, car \u00ab un trait\u00e9 est un \u00e9change de promesses solennelles entre la Couronne et les diverses [premi\u00e8res] nations [. . .] concern\u00e9es, un accord dont le caract\u00e8re est sacr\u00e9 \u00bb (R. c. Badger, [1996] 1 R.C.S. 771, par. 41).\n[135] La Cour a donn\u00e9 sa pleine expression \u00e0 l\u2019objet de l\u2019art. 35, en reconnaissant que les droits ancestraux et issus de trait\u00e9s s\u2019\u00e9tendent \u00e0 un large \u00e9ventail d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats constitutionnels sous\u2011jacents. Par exemple, la reconnaissance constitutionnelle des liens que les peuples autochtones entretiennent avec la terre peut fonder le droit de ces peuples de d\u00e9tenir un titre foncier qui, dans certaines circonstances, repose sur l\u2019art. 35 (voir Delgamuukw; Nation Tsilhqot\u2019in c. Colombie\u2011Britannique, 2014 CSC 44, [2014] 2 R.C.S. 257). De plus, les trait\u00e9s peuvent porter sur divers int\u00e9r\u00eats, y compris ceux li\u00e9s \u00e0 la terre ou \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale (voir, p. ex., First Nation of Nacho Nyak Dun, par. 10).\n[136] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Kapp, le juge Bastarache s\u2019est inspir\u00e9 de la th\u00e8se du professeur Macklem selon laquelle la vaste gamme des int\u00e9r\u00eats des peuples autochtones du Canada qui peuvent \u00eatre reconnus comme \u00e9tant consacr\u00e9s constitutionnellement sont ceux li\u00e9s \u00e0 la \u00ab sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone \u00bb. Le professeur Macklem a fait observer que la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone s\u2019explique par [traduction] \u00ab quatre faits sociaux complexes [qui] se situent au c\u0153ur de la relation entre les peuples autochtones et l\u2019\u00c9tat canadien \u00bb (p. 4). Ces faits sont : [traduction] \u00ab . . . la diff\u00e9rence culturelle autochtone, l\u2019occupation ant\u00e9rieure des Autochtones, la souverainet\u00e9 autochtone ant\u00e9rieure et la participation des Autochtones au processus de n\u00e9gociation de trait\u00e9s . . . \u00bb (p. 4).\n[137] Se fondant sur l\u2019avis exprim\u00e9 par la Cour dans le Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la s\u00e9cession qui relie les art. 35 et 25 \u00e0 une tradition de protection constitutionnelle des droits des minorit\u00e9s, Mme Dickson affirme que l\u2019art. 25 prot\u00e8ge les initiatives con\u00e7ues pour pr\u00e9server ou promouvoir la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone. L\u2019intervenant le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l\u2019Alberta a plaid\u00e9, au m\u00eame effet, que l\u2019art. 25 [traduction] \u00ab permet une approche qui prot\u00e8ge les int\u00e9r\u00eats li\u00e9s \u00e0 la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone contre l\u2019\u00e9rosion caus\u00e9e par des droits individuels garantis par la Charte \u00bb (m. interv., par. 20). La VGFN conteste cette conclusion et r\u00e9pond que cette caract\u00e9risation exclurait un large \u00e9ventail de droits li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale et limiterait ind\u00fbment les protections de l\u2019art. 25. La VGFN rattache plut\u00f4t l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence contest\u00e9e \u00e0 la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone et \u00e0 la continuit\u00e9 de l\u2019ordre juridique autochtone ant\u00e9rieur au contact avec les Europ\u00e9ens.\n[138] La sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone est un crit\u00e8re appropri\u00e9 pour circonscrire les \u00ab autres \u00bb droits ou libert\u00e9s vis\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25, parce qu\u2019elle aide \u00e0 d\u00e9finir les contours de l\u2019objet protecteur de la disposition en cas de conflit avec un droit individuel garanti par la Charte. La sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone rattache l\u2019\u00ab autr[e] \u00bb droit ou libert\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat collectif de la minorit\u00e9 que l\u2019art. 25 vise \u00e0 servir. Lorsqu\u2019il n\u2019est pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone sous\u2011tend l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat collectif invoqu\u00e9 en opposition au droit individuel garanti par la Charte, la justification ultime de la mise \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cart du droit individuel s\u2019\u00e9croule. Le concept de sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone rattache les \u00ab autres \u00bb droits au reste de l\u2019art. 25 et jette ainsi de la lumi\u00e8re sur ce que signifie le fait qu\u2019un droit ou une libert\u00e9 appartient ou b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie aux peuples autochtones du Canada \u2014 constitue v\u00e9ritablement un droit ou une libert\u00e9 \u00ab des \u00bb peuples autochtones du Canada.\n[139] Le lien \u00e9vident entre les art. 25 et 35 tend \u00e0 indiquer que leurs objectifs doivent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme apparent\u00e9s. L\u2019article 35 illustre la mani\u00e8re dont la Constitution du Canada prot\u00e8ge la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone contre les empi\u00e8tements l\u00e9gislatifs et ex\u00e9cutifs injustifi\u00e9s. Dans la m\u00eame veine, l\u2019art. 25 veille \u00e0 ce que les droits individuels garantis par la Charte ne sapent pas eux\u2011m\u00eames la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone quand ils portent atteinte aux mesures qui prot\u00e8gent cette diff\u00e9rence.\nd) Preuve extrins\u00e8que\n[140] Enfin, l\u2019objet protecteur de l\u2019art. 25 est confirm\u00e9 par les t\u00e9moignages et les d\u00e9bats parlementaires entourant la gen\u00e8se de la disposition. Ces documents extrins\u00e8ques indiquent que l\u2019art. 25 \u00e9tait consid\u00e9r\u00e9 initialement, pour reprendre les propos du ministre de la Justice \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, Jean Chr\u00e9tien, comme un moyen d\u2019identifier les droits autochtones auxquels \u00ab la Charte ne portera pas atteinte \u00bb (S\u00e9nat et Chambre des communes, Proc\u00e8s\u2011verbaux et t\u00e9moignages du Comit\u00e9 mixte sp\u00e9cial du S\u00e9nat et de la Chambre des communes sur la Constitution du Canada, n\u00ba 36, 1re sess., 32e l\u00e9g., 12 janvier 1981, p. 18; voir aussi n\u00ba 38, 1re sess., 32e l\u00e9g., 15 janvier 1981, p. 67\u201169 (hon. Jean Chr\u00e9tien; M. Roger Tass\u00e9); Arbour, p. 30\u201137). Comme nous l\u2019avons mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, le gouvernement du Canada a couramment eu pour politique que la Charte doit s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 tous les Canadiens, y compris aux peuples autochtones autonomes, et que l\u2019art. 25 est un m\u00e9canisme pr\u00e9vu par la Constitution qui requiert que la Charte soit interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 respecter et \u00e0 maintenir les droits ancestraux, issus de trait\u00e9s et autres droits semblables (L\u2019approche du gouvernement du Canada concernant la mise en \u0153uvre du droit inh\u00e9rent des peuples autochtones \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale et la n\u00e9gociation de cette autonomie; voir, de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Hogg et Turpel).\n[141] \u00c0 notre avis, cela appuie l\u2019approche g\u00e9n\u00e9reuse qui doit \u00eatre suivie dans l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des \u00ab autres \u00bb droits vis\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25 et du crit\u00e8re de la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone, approche qui aide \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir une application trop z\u00e9l\u00e9e de la Charte aux peuples autochtones autonomes. Avant d\u2019\u00eatre nomm\u00e9 \u00e0 la magistrature, le professeur S\u00e9bastien Grammond a d\u00e9crit la protection de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat collectif vis\u00e9 par l\u2019art. 25 comme une sorte de contrepoids \u00e0 l\u2019application de la Charte aux peuples autochtones autonomes :\nC\u2019est peut\u2011\u00eatre l\u00e0 que r\u00e9side la mani\u00e8re la plus \u00e9l\u00e9gante de transcender le d\u00e9bat : une interpr\u00e9tation souple de l\u2019article 25 pourrait mener \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer la Charte applicable en principe aux gouvernements autochtones, mais d\u2019une mani\u00e8re att\u00e9nu\u00e9e, qui cherche \u00e0 \u00e9viter de porter atteinte \u00e0 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments centraux de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 autochtone. [p. 342]\n[142] M\u00eame si nous n\u2019accordons pas un poids d\u00e9terminant \u00e0 la preuve extrins\u00e8que concernant l\u2019objet de cette disposition de la Charte (voir Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la Motor Vehicle Act (C.\u2011B.), [1985] 2 R.C.S. 486, p. 504\u2011507), cette preuve appuie elle aussi l\u2019objet protecteur de l\u2019art. 25.\ne) Conclusion sur l\u2019objet de l\u2019art. 25\n[143] Nous concluons donc que l\u2019art. 25 a pour objet de prot\u00e9ger certains droits collectifs autochtones contre l\u2019application de droits ou libert\u00e9s individuels oppos\u00e9s garantis par la Charte, lorsque l\u2019application des seconds diminuerait la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone prot\u00e9g\u00e9e et reconnue par les droits collectifs. Lorsque l\u2019application du droit individuel minerait de mani\u00e8re essentielle ou non accessoire la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par le droit collectif, l\u2019art. 25 exige que l\u2019on accorde la primaut\u00e9 au droit collectif. Cela diff\u00e8re du processus qui consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019atteinte \u00e0 un droit individuel garanti par la Charte est justifi\u00e9e dans le cadre d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 libre et d\u00e9mocratique au regard de l\u2019article premier de la Charte, processus qui ne vise pas seulement la protection du droit collectif de la minorit\u00e9 en tant que bienfait social et constitutionnel.\n(3) Droits relevant du champ d\u2019application de l\u2019art. 25\n[144] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de l\u2019objet de l\u2019art. 25, quels droits ou libert\u00e9s collectifs de la minorit\u00e9 rel\u00e8vent du champ d\u2019application de cette disposition? L\u2019article 25 mentionne les \u00ab droits ou libert\u00e9s \u2014 ancestraux, issus de trait\u00e9s ou autres \u2014 \u00bb et pr\u00e9cise qu\u2019ils comprennent les droits ou libert\u00e9s a) reconnus par la Proclamation royale (1763) (G.\u2011B.), 3 Geo. 3 (reproduite dans L.R.C. 1985, app. II, no 1), ou b) issus d\u2019accords sur des revendications territoriales. En incluant les \u00ab autres \u00bb droits et libert\u00e9s parmi ceux m\u00e9ritant la protection constitutionnelle dans ce contexte, l\u2019art. 25 \u00e9voque un \u00e9ventail plus large de droits que l\u2019art. 35 (voir, p. ex., B. Slattery, \u00ab The Constitutional Guarantee of Aboriginal and Treaty Rights \u00bb (1982), 8 Queen\u2019s L.J. 232, p. 237; Hogg et Wright, \u00a7 28:41). Le professeur Lysyk souligne que les sous\u2011cat\u00e9gories de droits ou libert\u00e9s vis\u00e9s aux al. 25a) et b) \u00ab illustrent mais ne limitent pas la port\u00e9e des droits et libert\u00e9s que prot\u00e8ge l\u2019article 25 \u00bb (p. 597).\n[145] La question de savoir si un droit revendiqu\u00e9 est un droit ancestral ou issu de trait\u00e9 d\u00e9pend \u00e9videmment des r\u00e8gles de droit applicables \u00e0 la reconnaissance de tels droits (voir, p. ex., Van der Peet; Pamajewon; R. c. Gladstone, [1996] 2 R.C.S. 723; Mitchell c. M.R.N., 2001 CSC 33, [2001] 1 R.C.S. 911; R. c. Sappier, 2006 CSC 54, [2006] 2 R.C.S. 686; Bande indienne des Lax Kw\u2019alaams c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2011 CSC 56, [2011] 3 R.C.S. 535; Desautel; et voir, p. ex., R. c. Sioui, [1990] 1 R.C.S. 1025; R. c. Sundown, [1999] 1 R.C.S. 393; Manitoba Metis Federation Inc. c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2013 CSC 14, [2013] 1 R.C.S. 623). Toutefois, aucun cadre d\u2019analyse permettant de d\u00e9terminer l\u2019appartenance \u00e0 la troisi\u00e8me cat\u00e9gorie de droits prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par l\u2019art. 25 \u2014 les \u00ab autres \u00bb droits \u2014 n\u2019a encore \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9finitive.\n[146] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Kapp, les juges majoritaires ont examin\u00e9, dans des remarques incidentes, l\u2019\u00e9tendue des droits inclus \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25 et ont \u00e9crit que ce ne sont pas tous les int\u00e9r\u00eats autochtones qui rel\u00e8vent du champ d\u2019application de cette disposition. Au contraire, \u00ab seuls les droits de nature constitutionnelle sont susceptibles de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de la protection de l\u2019art. 25 \u00bb (par. 63, la juge en chef McLachlin et la juge Abella). Le juge Bastarache a propos\u00e9 une approche plus large, compatible avec l\u2019id\u00e9e que l\u2019art. 25 prot\u00e8ge tous les droits qui sont \u00ab propres [aux peuples autochtones] en raison de leur statut sp\u00e9cial \u00bb, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire les droits qui prot\u00e8gent la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone (par. 103; voir aussi le par. 106).\n[147] Devant notre Cour, Mme Dickson affirme que seuls les droits poss\u00e9dant un [traduction] \u00ab statut constitutionnel \u00bb, dans le sens qu\u2019ils ne peuvent pas \u00eatre abrog\u00e9s ou modifi\u00e9s par une loi ordinaire, sont prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par l\u2019art. 25 (m.a., par. 66a)). La VGFN s\u2019oppose \u00e0 une telle restriction. Subsidiairement, elle plaide que m\u00eame si les droits prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par application de l\u2019art. 25 doivent poss\u00e9der une \u00ab nature constitutionnelle \u00bb, cela ne saurait signifier [traduction] \u00ab qu\u2019un jugement d\u00e9claratoire d\u2019un tribunal ou la reconnaissance par la Couronne d\u2019un droit ancestral \u201cexistant\u201d est une condition pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 l\u2019application de l\u2019art. 25 \u00bb (m.i., par. 112).\n[148] Il est reconnu que les droits garantis par la Charte ne sont pas absolus (voir Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. JTI\u2011Macdonald Corp., 2007 CSC 30, [2007] 2 R.C.S. 610, par. 36). Cela vaut \u00e9galement pour une disposition comme l\u2019art. 25 qui prot\u00e8ge certains droits et libert\u00e9s autochtones (voir Kapp, par. 97, le juge Bastarache). Parmi les limitations potentielles du champ des \u00ab autres \u00bb droits vis\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25, mentionnons les limites quant aux sources des droits vis\u00e9s, que nous appelons les restrictions \u00ab formelles \u00bb, et les limites quant \u00e0 la nature de ces droits, que nous appelons les restrictions \u00ab substantielles \u00bb.\n[149] Il ressort clairement du texte et de l\u2019objet de l\u2019art. 25 que, contrairement \u00e0 ce qu\u2019a affirm\u00e9 Mme Dickson, les protections pr\u00e9vues par cette disposition ne se limitent pas aux droits qui poss\u00e8dent un \u00ab statut constitutionnel \u00bb en ce qu\u2019ils ne peuvent \u00eatre abrog\u00e9s ou modifi\u00e9s par une loi ordinaire. La possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une telle restriction formelle est exclue, en particulier par l\u2019inclusion expresse des droits reconnus par la Proclamation royale (1763), qui n\u2019est pas l\u2019un des documents compris dans la Constitution du Canada aux termes du par. 52(2), et qui est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme ayant \u00ab force de loi \u00bb d\u2019une mani\u00e8re analogue au statut de la Magna Carta (Calder c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Colombie\u2011Britannique, [1973] R.C.S. 313, p. 395, le juge Hall). De plus, comme l\u2019intervenant le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada le fait remarquer, si l\u2019art. 25 \u00e9tait cens\u00e9 prot\u00e9ger uniquement les droits et libert\u00e9s poss\u00e9dant un statut constitutionnel, [traduction] \u00ab la disposition aurait vraisemblablement parl\u00e9 de droits ou libert\u00e9s garantis en vertu de la Constitution du Canada, comme c\u2019est le cas \u00e0 l\u2019art. 29 de la Charte \u00bb (m. interv., par. 45). Par cons\u00e9quent, les droits prot\u00e9g\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25 ne se limitent pas \u00e0 ceux qui sont inscrits dans la Constitution, mais peuvent plut\u00f4t comprendre des droits pr\u00e9vus par des lois ordinaires (voir aussi Corbiere, par. 52, la juge L\u2019Heureux\u2011Dub\u00e9).\n[150] Bien que nous ne soyons pas d\u2019avis de donner effet \u00e0 la restriction formelle quant \u00e0 la source des \u00ab autres \u00bb droits qu\u2019a propos\u00e9e Mme Dickson, le texte et l\u2019objet de l\u2019art. 25 sugg\u00e8rent toutefois l\u2019existence d\u2019une restriction substantielle. Puisque l\u2019art. 25 visait \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger les droits associ\u00e9s \u00e0 la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone \u2014 consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme les int\u00e9r\u00eats li\u00e9s \u00e0 la diff\u00e9rence culturelle, \u00e0 l\u2019occupation ant\u00e9rieure, \u00e0 la souverainet\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieure ou encore \u00e0 la participation au processus de n\u00e9gociation de trait\u00e9s \u2014 le fait qu\u2019un droit m\u00e9rite ou non la protection de l\u2019art. 25 au motif qu\u2019il fait partie des \u00ab autres \u00bb droits d\u00e9pendra de la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la question de savoir s\u2019il prot\u00e8ge ou reconna\u00eet ces int\u00e9r\u00eats. Bref, la partie qui sollicite la protection de l\u2019art. 25 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un droit qui ferait partie des \u00ab autres \u00bb droits doit \u00e9tablir \u00e0 la fois l\u2019existence du droit en question et le fait que ce droit prot\u00e8ge ou reconna\u00eet la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone.\n[151] L\u2019intervenant le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada soutient qu\u2019une restriction applicable en ce qui concerne l\u2019\u00e9tendue des \u00ab autres \u00bb droits vis\u00e9s est que ces droits doivent \u00eatre de \u00ab nature constitutionnelle \u00bb sur le plan substantiel plut\u00f4t que sur le plan formel (voir, p. ex., m. interv., par. 44). Bien que le juge Bastarache ait sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 qu\u2019une exigence fond\u00e9e sur la \u00ab nature constitutionnelle \u00bb des droits s\u2019oppose \u00e0 une approche plus large \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des droits de la minorit\u00e9 ax\u00e9e sur la protection des droits associ\u00e9s \u00e0 la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone (Kapp, par. 102\u2011103), il est possible que les deux soient compatibles si la protection de la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone a une importance constitutionnelle inh\u00e9rente. Toutefois, comme le droit revendiqu\u00e9 qui est en cause dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire poss\u00e8de une nature constitutionnelle, nous remettons \u00e0 une autre occasion l\u2019examen de la question de savoir si la \u00ab nature constitutionnelle \u00bb constitue une restriction substantielle distincte en ce qui concerne les \u00ab autres \u00bb droits.\n(4) Application de l\u2019art. 25\n[152] Lorsqu\u2019il est d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019un droit fait partie des droits ou libert\u00e9s ancestraux, issus de trait\u00e9s ou \u00ab autres \u00bb, les protections pr\u00e9vues par l\u2019art. 25 ne s\u2019appliquent pas automatiquement. Ces protections s\u2019appliquent uniquement s\u2019il est jug\u00e9 qu\u2019il existe un conflit irr\u00e9conciliable entre le droit garanti par la Charte qui est revendiqu\u00e9 et le droit vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25, de telle sorte qu\u2019en donnant effet au droit garanti par la Charte on minerait la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone prot\u00e9g\u00e9e ou reconnue par le droit collectif. Il s\u2019agit alors de savoir quel genre de protection la disposition accorde. Il existe un large consensus voulant que l\u2019art. 25 ne cr\u00e9e pas de nouveaux droits ou libert\u00e9s substantiels (voir Hogg et Wright, \u00a7 28:41; voir aussi R. c. Steinhauer (1985), 63 A.R. 381 (B.R.), par. 19; R. c. Augustine (1986), 74 R.N.\u2011B. (2e) 156 (C.A.), par. 50; R. c. Nicholas (1988), 91 R.N.\u2011B. (2e) 248 (B.R.), par. 10; R. c. Willocks (1992), 14 C.R.R. (2d) 373 (C.J. Ont. (Div. prov.)), p. 383, conf. par (1995), 22 O.R. (3d) 552 (C.J. (Div. g\u00e9n.)); R. c. Redhead (1995), 99 C.C.C. (3d) 559 (B.R. Man.), p. 573; Kapp, par. 79, le juge Bastarache; Rice c. Agence du revenu du Qu\u00e9bec, 2016 QCCA 666, [2016] 3 C.N.L.R. 311, par. 50). Cependant, les d\u00e9tails de l\u2019application de l\u2019art. 25 demeurent dans une large mesure incertains.\na) L\u2019effet de l\u2019art. 25\n(i) Approches oppos\u00e9es concernant l\u2019effet de l\u2019art. 25\n[153] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Kapp, la Cour a examin\u00e9 deux approches oppos\u00e9es concernant l\u2019effet de l\u2019art. 25 (par. 64, la juge en chef McLachlin et la juge Abella; par. 79\u201180 et 94\u201197, le juge Bastarache). La premi\u00e8re approche consid\u00e8re l\u2019art. 25 comme un \u00ab bouclier \u00bb. Suivant cette approche, le fait d\u2019invoquer avec succ\u00e8s l\u2019art. 25 fait obstacle \u00e0 une revendication fond\u00e9e sur la Charte dans les cas o\u00f9 l\u2019application d\u2019un droit garanti par la Charte porterait atteinte au droit vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25 (par. 64; par. 80 et 94\u201197).\n[154] La seconde approche consid\u00e8re l\u2019art. 25 comme un \u00ab prisme interpr\u00e9tatif \u00bb ou une r\u00e8gle d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation (voir Pentney, p. 27\u201129). Dans Kapp, les juges majoritaires ont \u00e9crit que l\u2019art. 25 est une disposition servant \u00e0 \u00ab interpr\u00e9ter des droits garantis par la Charte qui sont susceptibles d\u2019entrer en conflit \u00bb plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00e0 faire obstacle \u00e0 l\u2019application de la Charte (par. 64). Suivant cette approche, les tribunaux tentent d\u2019abord d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter le droit garanti par la Charte qui est revendiqu\u00e9 et de lui donner effet sans porter atteinte au droit identifi\u00e9 vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25. En cas de conflit, toutefois, le droit ancestral, issu de trait\u00e9 ou autre ne se verrait accorder aucune priorit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale; la question de savoir si le droit autochtone collectif devrait \u00eatre maintenu serait laiss\u00e9e \u00e0 la discr\u00e9tion du tribunal, qui la trancherait au cas par cas (voir, p. ex., B. H. Wildsmith, Aboriginal peoples and Section 25 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (1988), p. 10\u201111).\n[155] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Kapp, le juge Bastarache a privil\u00e9gi\u00e9 l\u2019approche fond\u00e9e sur le \u00ab bouclier \u00bb plut\u00f4t que celle fond\u00e9e sur le \u00ab prisme interpr\u00e9tatif \u00bb, soulignant que l\u2019art. 25 vise \u00e0 donner la \u00ab primaut\u00e9 \u00bb aux droits ancestraux, issus de trait\u00e9s ou autres (par. 81; voir aussi les par. 94\u201197). Pour leur part, les juges majoritaires dans cette affaire ont tranch\u00e9 le litige sur la base du par. 15(2) de la Charte, et ont donc refus\u00e9 de statuer sur ce point (par. 62\u201165).\n[156] Devant notre Cour, Mme Dickson plaide que l\u2019art. 25 ne devrait pas agir comme un bouclier \u00ab absolu \u00bb (voir m.a., par. 97; voir aussi les par. 11, 47, 56, 92\u201193, 96, 100 et 102). Elle soutient plut\u00f4t que l\u2019art. 25 devrait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019article premier, \u00e0 savoir une mise en balance dans laquelle le tribunal soup\u00e8se [traduction] \u00ab le pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 aux droits des communaut\u00e9s autochtones \u00bb et \u00ab le pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 par la violation du droit garanti par la Charte \u00bb (par. 97; voir aussi les par. 50\u201152). Par contraste, la VGFN pr\u00e9tend que l\u2019art. 25 r\u00e9alise son objet qui est de veiller \u00e0 ce que [traduction] \u00ab les droits et libert\u00e9s des peuples autochtones de m\u00eame que leur place sp\u00e9ciale au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne ne soient pas \u00e9rod\u00e9s par la garantie des droits et libert\u00e9s que la Charte reconna\u00eet aux Canadiens et aux Canadiennes \u00bb en \u00ab constituant un \u201cbouclier\u201d prot\u00e9geant les droits et libert\u00e9s autochtones \u00bb (m.i., par. 104). La VGFN d\u00e9crit l\u2019art. 25 comme un [traduction] \u00ab bouclier complet \u00bb contre la revendication de Mme Dickson fond\u00e9e sur le par. 15(1), bouclier qui n\u2019est pas assujetti \u00e0 des limites, y compris celles li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019article premier de la Charte (titre du par. 122; voir aussi le par. 126).\n[157] Dans la jurisprudence peu abondante relative \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25, la m\u00e9taphore du \u00ab bouclier \u00bb qui \u00ab prot\u00e8ge \u00bb est parfois utilis\u00e9e pour d\u00e9crire l\u2019effet protecteur de la disposition. Avant l\u2019arr\u00eat Kapp, la juge L\u2019Heureux\u2011Dub\u00e9 avait parl\u00e9 de protection dans les motifs concordants qu\u2019elle avait r\u00e9dig\u00e9s dans Corbiere (par. 51\u201153). Plus r\u00e9cemment, s\u2019exprimant au nom de la majorit\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Desautel, le juge Rowe a affirm\u00e9 que l\u2019art. 25 \u00ab prot\u00e8ge les droits et libert\u00e9s des peuples autochtones du Canada contre une abrogation par la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s \u00bb (par. 39). Les juridictions inf\u00e9rieures ont souvent d\u00e9crit l\u2019art. 25 comme un \u00ab bouclier \u00bb (voir, p. ex., Steinhauer, par. 19; Willocks (C.J. Ont. (Div. prov.)), p. 383; Campbell c. British Columbia (Attorney General), 2000 BCSC 1123, 79 B.C.L.R. (3d) 122, par. 156\u2011158). En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance et la Cour d\u2019appel ont tous deux employ\u00e9 le terme \u00ab bouclier \u00bb dans leur analyse relative \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25 (motifs de premi\u00e8re instance, par. 180; motifs de la C.A., par. 158). Des approches relatives \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25 bas\u00e9es sur la notion de \u00ab bouclier \u00bb ont \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9es par certains professeurs de droit, bien qu\u2019il n\u2019existe pas de consensus doctrinal sur cette question (voir Swiffen, p. 27 et 32\u201134).\n(ii) L\u2019approche appropri\u00e9e quant \u00e0 l\u2019effet de l\u2019art. 25\n1. L\u2019article 25 donne la primaut\u00e9 aux droits autochtones en cas de conflit irr\u00e9conciliable\n[158] \u00c0 notre avis, l\u2019approche qu\u2019il convient d\u2019adopter \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019art. 25 inclut des \u00e9l\u00e9ments tir\u00e9s \u00e0 la fois de l\u2019approche fond\u00e9e sur le \u00ab bouclier \u00bb et de celle fond\u00e9e sur le \u00ab prisme interpr\u00e9tatif \u00bb. Comme nous l\u2019expliquons, il est possible d\u2019affirmer que l\u2019art. 25 produit un effet de \u00ab bouclier \u00bb, en ce qu\u2019il donne la primaut\u00e9 aux droits ancestraux, issus de trait\u00e9s ou autres. Toutefois, un droit relevant du champ d\u2019application de l\u2019art. 25 se voit accorder la priorit\u00e9 uniquement si un exercice interpr\u00e9tatif d\u00e9montre qu\u2019il existe un conflit irr\u00e9conciliable entre le droit collectif et le droit individuel garanti par la Charte qui est revendiqu\u00e9.\n[159] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de l\u2019analyse t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique expos\u00e9e ci\u2011dessus, la disposition sert parfois de \u00ab bouclier \u00bb au profit des droits ancestraux, issus de trait\u00e9s et autres afin de prot\u00e9ger l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat collectif minoritaire des peuples autochtones. Cependant, nous sommes \u00e9galement d\u2019accord avec le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada pour dire que l\u2019analyse relative \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25 ne devrait pas trop s\u2019appuyer sur la m\u00e9taphore du \u00ab bouclier \u00bb (m. interv., par. 31\u201133). Une conception absolutiste de l\u2019art. 25 qui [traduction] \u00ab bloquerait [. . .] le dialogue sur des int\u00e9r\u00eats concurrents et, \u00e0 l\u2019occasion, oppos\u00e9s \u00bb, est incompatible avec une approche t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique (par. 32, citant Arbour, p. 13). Elle s\u2019oppose aussi \u00e0 l\u2019id\u00e9e que, dans les cultures juridiques autochtones, tout comme en droit constitutionnel canadien, les droits individuels et les droits collectifs sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme coexistant en harmonie. Bien que la disposition ne soit pas une simple lentille interpr\u00e9tative pour l\u2019analyse de la Charte, pour bien d\u00e9gager l\u2019\u00e9tendue de la protection offerte par l\u2019art. 25 il faut emprunter certains aspects de ces deux approches. Cette position a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9fendue par une partie de la doctrine : par exemple, l\u2019autrice Arbour soutient que l\u2019effet protecteur de l\u2019art. 25 entre seulement en jeu lorsque le tribunal a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 qu\u2019il est impossible d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter le droit particulier vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25 et le droit garanti par la Charte d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui permet de respecter les deux droits (p. 61\u201162).\n[160] Comme nous l\u2019avons vu, le texte de l\u2019art. 25 tend \u00e0 indiquer qu\u2019il est justifi\u00e9e de prioriser les droits ancestraux, issus de trait\u00e9s et autres uniquement dans les cas o\u00f9 donner effet au droit garanti par la Charte qui est revendiqu\u00e9 porterait atteinte \u00e0 ces droits collectifs. S\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de conflit entre le droit garanti par la Charte et le droit ancestral, issu de trait\u00e9 ou autre, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de prot\u00e9ger le droit collectif contre l\u2019intrusion caus\u00e9e par le droit individuel. Le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l\u2019Alberta se joint au procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada et \u00e0 d\u2019autres intervenants pour plaider que, en raison de l\u2019art. 25, les droits garantis par la Charte doivent c\u00e9der devant les droits particuliers vis\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25 dans la mesure du conflit qui les oppose. La Nation m\u00e9tisse de l\u2019Ontario et la M\u00e9tis Nation of Alberta soutiennent de mani\u00e8re semblable que, lorsqu\u2019il existe une possibilit\u00e9 de [traduction] \u00ab conflit v\u00e9ritable \u00bb entre l\u2019exercice d\u2019un droit vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25 et un droit individuel garanti par la Charte, \u00ab les droits garantis par la Charte doivent c\u00e9der \u00bb (m. interv., par. 29).\n[161] La principale question devient alors celle de savoir quel genre de conflit doit \u00eatre d\u00e9montr\u00e9 entre les droits collectifs et les droits individuels concern\u00e9s pour que le bouclier de l\u2019art. 25 op\u00e8re. Des normes allant du conflit \u00ab potentiel \u00bb au conflit \u00ab v\u00e9ritable \u00bb ont \u00e9t\u00e9 propos\u00e9es. \u00c0 notre avis, le conflit entre les droits doit \u00eatre r\u00e9el et irr\u00e9conciliable, de sorte qu\u2019il est impossible de donner effet au droit individuel garanti par la Charte sans porter atteinte au droit relevant de l\u2019art. 25. Adopter une norme moins rigoureuse, par exemple la simple possibilit\u00e9 de conflit, att\u00e9nuerait la gravit\u00e9 de la compromission d\u2019un droit individuel garanti par la Charte. L\u2019article 25 prot\u00e8ge l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat autochtone collectif dans les cas o\u00f9 le conflit n\u2019est pas hypoth\u00e9tique et qu\u2019il ne peut \u00eatre \u00e9vit\u00e9.\n[162] L\u2019exigence requ\u00e9rant l\u2019existence d\u2019un conflit irr\u00e9conciliable entre les deux droits s\u2019accorde mieux avec l\u2019objet et le texte de l\u2019art. 25, parce que s\u2019il est possible pour les tribunaux, au moyen d\u2019une interpr\u00e9tation juste et minutieuse, de donner effet au droit garanti par la Charte et au droit vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25 identifi\u00e9, alors \u00ab [l]es deux droits sont respect\u00e9s, et le conflit \u00e9cart\u00e9 \u00bb (R. c. N.S., 2012 CSC 72, [2012] 3 R.C.S. 726, par. 32). En de tels cas, le droit individuel garanti par la Charte a \u00e9t\u00e9 interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ne pas porter atteinte au droit relevant du champ d\u2019application de l\u2019art. 25.\n[163] D\u00e9terminer s\u2019il existe un conflit irr\u00e9conciliable entre les droits en cause constitue un exercice interpr\u00e9tatif. Cet exercice requiert que les tribunaux interpr\u00e8tent tant la substance du droit garanti par la Charte que celle du droit ancestral, issu de trait\u00e9 ou autre en cause (voir Hutchinson, p. 185). Ils doivent prendre en compte et respecter les points de vue autochtones (voir Corbiere, par. 54, la juge L\u2019Heureux\u2011Dub\u00e9). En m\u00eame temps, les tribunaux doivent veiller \u00e0 ne pas s\u2019\u00e9carter de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation g\u00e9n\u00e9reuse des droits et libert\u00e9s individuels garantis par la Charte prescrite par la jurisprudence de notre Cour. Le professeur Ghislain Otis fait observer que l\u2019art. 25 peut \u00eatre compris \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re d\u2019une r\u00e8gle fondamentale de coh\u00e9rence interne des textes constitutionnels selon laquelle l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation doit \u00eatre entreprise en pr\u00e9sumant qu\u2019il n\u2019existe pas de conflit : \u00ab . . . lorsque deux principes ou dispositions paraissent conflictuels, ils doivent n\u00e9anmoins pouvoir coexister et chacun doit produire un effet . . . \u00bb ((2005), p. 240). De plus, \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse, il faut tenir compte de toute autre r\u00e9paration sollicit\u00e9e par le demandeur, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que diff\u00e9rentes r\u00e9parations demand\u00e9es en vertu de la Charte peuvent \u00eatre plus ou moins dommageables au droit ancestral, issu de trait\u00e9 ou autre concern\u00e9.\n[164] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, l\u2019art. 25 ne sert pas de \u00ab bouclier \u00bb chaque fois qu\u2019un droit relevant de son champ d\u2019application est en cause. Lorsqu\u2019un droit garanti par la Charte est en jeu par suite de l\u2019exercice d\u2019un droit ancestral, issu de trait\u00e9 ou autre, le tribunal doit plut\u00f4t se demander si ces deux droits peuvent \u00eatre concili\u00e9s. Si le fait de donner effet \u00e0 un droit garanti par la Charte influerait seulement de mani\u00e8re accessoire ou non essentielle sur le droit particulier vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25 \u2014 en ce que cela ne minerait pas la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone \u2014, ou si le droit garanti par la Charte peut \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019une mani\u00e8re compatible avec le droit ancestral, issu de trait\u00e9 ou autre, il serait alors inappropri\u00e9 de donner la priorit\u00e9 au droit relevant du champ d\u2019application de l\u2019art. 25. C\u2019est uniquement dans les cas o\u00f9 le droit vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25 est affect\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re non accessoire, cr\u00e9ant ainsi un conflit irr\u00e9conciliable entre les deux droits, que l\u2019art. 25 prot\u00e9gera le droit autochtone en rendant le droit individuel inop\u00e9rant dans la mesure du conflit. En ce sens, pour reprendre la description donn\u00e9e par l\u2019autrice Arbour, l\u2019art. 25 jouera parfois le r\u00f4le de [traduction] \u00ab bouclier d\u2019appoint \u00bb (p. 13). D\u2019autres fois, il jouera simplement un r\u00f4le interpr\u00e9tatif.\n2. Un seul cadre d\u2019analyse s\u2019applique aux conflits internes et externes\n[165] L\u2019article 25 vise \u00e0 sauvegarder les droits ancestraux, issus de trait\u00e9s ou autres qui tendent \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone. En cons\u00e9quence, l\u2019art. 25 s\u2019attache principalement aux droits collectifs, ind\u00e9pendamment de l\u2019identit\u00e9 de l\u2019individu ou de l\u2019entit\u00e9 qui pr\u00e9sente la contestation fond\u00e9e sur la Charte. Il s\u2019ensuit que le m\u00eame cadre d\u2019analyse s\u2019applique, et ce, que le demandeur invoquant la Charte soit autochtone, que l\u2019art. 25 soit invoqu\u00e9 par un groupe autochtone ou, comme en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, que les deux parties soient autochtones. Le bouclier de l\u2019art. 25 s\u2019applique imm\u00e9diatement si le droit garanti par la Charte qui est invoqu\u00e9 porte atteinte \u00e0 un droit collectif vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25, quelles que soient les parties en cause.\n[166] Nous rejetons, et cela pour plusieurs raisons, l\u2019id\u00e9e de cr\u00e9er une analyse distincte pour ce que l\u2019on nomme les revendications \u00ab internes \u00bb, soit celles qui surviennent au sein m\u00eame d\u2019une communaut\u00e9 autochtone.\n[167] Premi\u00e8rement, le fait que la Charte s\u2019applique aux actes accomplis par les gouvernements autochtones, comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 expliqu\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, r\u00e9pond aux pr\u00e9occupations soulev\u00e9es par de nombreux intervenants selon lesquelles les gouvernements autochtones ne seraient pas tenus de rendre compte des violations all\u00e9gu\u00e9es des droits garantis \u00e0 leurs citoyens par la Charte (voir, p. ex., m. interv., Forum pancanadien sur les droits autochtones et la Constitution, par. 22; m. interv., Band Members Alliance and Advocacy Association of Canada, par. 26\u201127; m. interv., Congr\u00e8s des peuples autochtones, par. 8). Un gouvernement autochtone doit d\u00e9montrer, au terme d\u2019un exercice interpr\u00e9tatif, que le droit garanti par la Charte, qu\u2019il soit revendiqu\u00e9 par un Autochtone ou un non\u2011Autochtone, est en conflit irr\u00e9conciliable avec un droit collectif reconnu par l\u2019art. 25. Une fois cette d\u00e9monstration faite, le droit collectif est prot\u00e9g\u00e9 contre les atteintes par l\u2019effet de l\u2019art. 25.\n[168] Deuxi\u00e8mement, la protection par l\u2019art. 25 de la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone vise \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger un droit collectif. La question de savoir si le droit garanti par la Charte qui est revendiqu\u00e9 diminuerait la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone invite l\u2019examen de la protection de la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone telle qu\u2019elle est comprise et d\u00e9montr\u00e9e par la collectivit\u00e9 plut\u00f4t que par les membres individuels de la communaut\u00e9.\n[169] Troisi\u00e8mement, rien dans le texte de l\u2019art. 25 ne permet de conclure que le bouclier protecteur devrait s\u2019appliquer diff\u00e9remment selon l\u2019identit\u00e9 des parties. L\u2019auteur Kerry Wilkins souligne que [traduction] \u00ab [r]ien dans l\u2019article 25 lui\u2011m\u00eame [. . .] ne sugg\u00e8re qu\u2019il s\u2019applique diff\u00e9remment \u00e0 certains droits ancestraux ou \u00e0 certains droits garantis par la Charte, qu\u2019\u00e0 d\u2019autres \u00bb (p. 110). De m\u00eame, dans Kapp, le juge Bastarache a fait remarquer qu\u2019un demandeur autochtone pouvait contester une loi en vertu de la Charte sans invoquer sa propre autochtonit\u00e9, soulignant qu\u2019une personne peut avoir des identit\u00e9s multiples qui n\u2019entrent pas toujours en jeu de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re (par. 99).\n[170] Quatri\u00e8mement, il n\u2019est pas toujours \u00e9vident, en pratique, de dire si on est en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019une revendication \u00ab interne \u00bb. Par exemple, il peut arriver que des revendications soient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par des personnes qui se consid\u00e8rent comme membres de la collectivit\u00e9, mais dont l\u2019appartenance \u00e0 celle\u2011ci est contest\u00e9e par le groupe autochtone, ce qui rend toute distinction entre les revendications internes et externes insoutenable. Il peut \u00e9galement y avoir une contestation intent\u00e9e par une personne contre une r\u00e8gle d\u00e9coulant de la collaboration entre un gouvernement autochtone et un gouvernement ou acteur priv\u00e9 non autochtone. En pareil cas, toute distinction entre les demandes internes et les demandes externes est tout aussi difficile \u00e0 \u00e9tablir.\n[171] Enfin, l\u2019objet protecteur de l\u2019art. 25 n\u2019est pas incompatible avec la reconnaissance \u2014 clairement \u00e9nonc\u00e9e \u00e0 la fois dans la Loi sur la DNUDPA et la Constitution de la VGFN \u2014 que les droits autochtones individuels et collectifs peuvent coexister. Fondamentalement, la protection de la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25 refl\u00e8te la place centrale qu\u2019occupent les peuples autochtones et leurs gouvernements dans le tissu constitutionnel canadien. La reconnaissance de la protection constitutionnelle accord\u00e9e par l\u2019art. 25 permet aux peuples autochtones de prendre des d\u00e9cisions au sujet des besoins individuels et collectifs de leurs communaut\u00e9s.\n[172] Bien que nous ne souscrivions pas \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de cadres d\u2019analyse distincts pour les revendications internes et externes, nous reconnaissons qu\u2019une grande prudence s\u2019impose lorsque la revendication est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par une personne autochtone contre sa propre communaut\u00e9. Une telle cause se distingue des cas comme l\u2019affaire Corbiere, o\u00f9 la disposition contest\u00e9e figurait dans une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, et l\u2019affaire Kapp, o\u00f9 la personne qui invoquait la Charte n\u2019\u00e9tait pas autochtone. Dans une revendication pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par une personne autochtone contre sa propre communaut\u00e9, le tribunal devrait proc\u00e9der avec prudence afin d\u2019\u00e9viter d\u2019imposer inutilement ou involontairement au r\u00e9gime juridique autochtone distinct des notions ou des principes juridiques incompatibles. Comme l\u2019affirme l\u2019intervenante Carcross\/Tagish First Nation, [traduction] \u00ab [l]es institutions canadiennes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9es d\u2019agir avec prudence sur le terrain des droits inh\u00e9rents que les peuples autochtones poss\u00e8dent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de leurs propres syst\u00e8mes de gouvernance et de justice \u00bb (m. interv., par. 21, citant la Commission de v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et r\u00e9conciliation du Canada, Commission de v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et r\u00e9conciliation du Canada : Appels \u00e0 l\u2019action (2015), appel \u00e0 l\u2019action num\u00e9ro 42).\n3. Autres limitations\n[173] M\u00eame dans les cas o\u00f9 un droit ancestral, issu de trait\u00e9 ou autre serait normalement prioris\u00e9 en vertu de l\u2019art. 25, il peut y avoir d\u2019autres limitations pertinentes ayant trait \u00e0 l\u2019application et \u00e0 l\u2019effet de l\u2019art. 25. L\u2019article 28 de la Charte et le par. 35(4) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 sont des exemples de tels cas. L\u2019article 28 qui figure, comme l\u2019art. 25, dans la section \u00ab Dispositions g\u00e9n\u00e9rales \u00bb de la Charte, pr\u00e9voit que, \u00ab [i]nd\u00e9pendamment des autres dispositions de la pr\u00e9sente charte, les droits et libert\u00e9s qui y sont mentionn\u00e9s sont garantis \u00e9galement aux personnes des deux sexes. \u00bb Le paragraphe 35(4) pr\u00e9cise ce qui suit : \u00ab Ind\u00e9pendamment de toute autre disposition de la pr\u00e9sente loi, les droits \u2014 ancestraux ou issus de trait\u00e9s \u2014 vis\u00e9s au paragraphe (1) sont garantis \u00e9galement aux personnes des deux sexes. \u00bb Ces dispositions \u2014 qui s\u2019appliquent ind\u00e9pendamment de toute autre disposition de la Charte ou de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982, respectivement \u2014 veillent \u00e0 ce qu\u2019un droit prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par l\u2019art. 25 ne permette pas de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe (voir, p. ex., McNeil (1996), p. 76\u201179; Wildsmith, p. 23\u201124; Arbour, p. 68; Slattery (1982), p. 241\u2011242; Kapp, par. 97, le juge Bastarache). Cela dit, il est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de d\u00e9finir de fa\u00e7on pr\u00e9cise les limites des protections pr\u00e9vues par l\u2019art. 25, y compris celles qui d\u00e9coulent d\u2019autres sources constitutionnelles, dans des affaires o\u00f9 ces limites se soul\u00e8vent \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des faits.\nb) L\u2019ordre de l\u2019analyse\n[174] Une derni\u00e8re question consiste \u00e0 se demander \u00e0 quelle \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur la Charte il convient d\u2019examiner l\u2019art. 25. La VGFN soutient que [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019art. 25 entre en jeu d\u00e8s le d\u00e9part \u00bb, avant tout examen du bien-fond\u00e9 de la revendication fond\u00e9e sur la Charte (m.i., par. 109). Le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada et la British Columbia Treaty Commission, suivant les commentaires formul\u00e9s par le juge Bastarache dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Kapp, font valoir que l\u2019art. 25 devrait \u00eatre pris en compte uniquement une fois que le tribunal est convaincu que la Charte est \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue en jeu (m. interv., p.g. Canada, par. 41; m. interv., British Columbia Treaty Commission, par. 12; Kapp, par. 108\u2011109). Puisque Mme Dickson plaide que l\u2019art. 25 devrait \u00eatre int\u00e9gr\u00e9 en tant qu\u2019outil d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation dans l\u2019analyse de la justification fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019article premier, elle estime que l\u2019art. 25 doit \u00eatre pris en compte apr\u00e8s un examen complet du droit pertinent garanti par la Charte.\n[175] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de l\u2019approche d\u00e9crite ci\u2011dessus \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019art. 25, bon nombre des points de vue avanc\u00e9s quant \u00e0 l\u2019ordre de r\u00e9alisation de l\u2019analyse peuvent \u00eatre ais\u00e9ment rejet\u00e9s. Comme l\u2019art. 25 ne constitue pas un bouclier imperm\u00e9able, il faudra toujours une certaine compr\u00e9hension du droit garanti par la Charte en cause pour d\u00e9terminer si la protection de l\u2019art. 25 s\u2019applique v\u00e9ritablement. Par cons\u00e9quent, la position de la VGFN quant \u00e0 l\u2019ordre de r\u00e9alisation de l\u2019analyse ne saurait \u00eatre accept\u00e9e. De plus, comme l\u2019art. 25 accorde la priorit\u00e9 aux droits ancestraux, issus de trait\u00e9s ou autres lorsqu\u2019il existe un conflit irr\u00e9conciliable avec le droit garanti par la Charte en question, il repr\u00e9sente davantage qu\u2019un simple outil d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation dans une analyse fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019article premier. En cons\u00e9quence, la th\u00e8se avanc\u00e9e par Mme Dickson concernant l\u2019ordre de r\u00e9alisation de l\u2019analyse doit elle aussi \u00eatre \u00e9cart\u00e9e.\n[176] L\u2019ordre de l\u2019analyse doit tenir compte de l\u2019objet de l\u2019art. 25 qui consiste \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone en tant que composante de la protection constitutionnelle des droits des minorit\u00e9s. Une application ind\u00fbment tardive de l\u2019art. 25 serait contraire \u00e0 cet objet. Lorsque l\u2019on conclut en d\u00e9finitive que l\u2019art. 25 donne la priorit\u00e9 \u00e0 un droit ancestral, issu de trait\u00e9 ou autre, le fait d\u2019obliger une partie \u00e0 se d\u00e9fendre pleinement contre une revendication fond\u00e9e sur la Charte ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 justifier toute violation au regard de l\u2019article premier serait superflu et op\u00e9rerait une ponction inutile sur les ressources des parties. En outre, l\u2019intervenante Carcross\/Tagish First Nation soutient qu\u2019une telle approche pourrait amener les communaut\u00e9s autochtones \u00e0 prioriser l\u2019harmonisation de leurs lois avec les valeurs v\u00e9hicul\u00e9es par la Charte, potentiellement au d\u00e9triment de leurs propres ordres juridiques, et ce, afin d\u2019\u00e9viter d\u2019interminables litiges. Un tel r\u00e9sultat aurait pour effet de contrecarrer, plut\u00f4t que de favoriser, la valeur constitutionnelle sous\u2011jacente qu\u2019est le respect des droits des minorit\u00e9s, en particulier la protection de la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone.\n[177] Lorsqu\u2019une partie veut invoquer l\u2019art. 25 \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019une revendication fond\u00e9e sur la Charte, le tribunal devrait envisager d\u2019appliquer l\u2019art. 25 le plus t\u00f4t possible, sans porter ind\u00fbment pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 la contestation fond\u00e9e sur le droit individuel garanti par la Charte. Vu les int\u00e9r\u00eats oppos\u00e9s qui doivent \u00eatre pris en compte dans le cadre d\u2019analyse de l\u2019art. 25, le point le plus h\u00e2tif o\u00f9 cette disposition pourrait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 bon droit est une fois que le demandeur qui invoque la Charte a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 une violation \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue de son droit. Toute justification au regard de l\u2019article premier ne devrait \u00eatre exig\u00e9e que si le tribunal juge que l\u2019art. 25 est inapplicable. C\u2019est le cas lorsqu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de droits \u00ab ancestraux, issus de trait\u00e9s ou autres \u00bb en jeu, que l\u2019\u00ab autre \u00bb droit ne fait pas intervenir la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone, ou qu\u2019il n\u2019existe pas de conflit irr\u00e9conciliable entre le droit collectif autochtone prot\u00e9g\u00e9 et le droit individuel garanti par la Charte. Dans de telles circonstances, la partie qui d\u00e9fend l\u2019acte contest\u00e9 peut toujours chercher \u00e0 justifier la restriction en vertu de l\u2019article premier de la Charte.\n(5) R\u00e9sum\u00e9 du cadre d\u2019analyse de l\u2019art. 25\n[178] L\u2019analyse qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de sugg\u00e8re que le cadre d\u2019analyse pour l\u2019application de l\u2019art. 25 se d\u00e9cline en quatre \u00e9tapes.\n[179] Premi\u00e8rement, le demandeur qui invoque la Charte doit d\u00e9montrer que la conduite contest\u00e9e viole \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue un droit individuel garanti par la Charte. Si aucune violation \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue n\u2019est \u00e9tablie, alors la revendication bas\u00e9e sur la Charte \u00e9choue, et il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de passer \u00e0 l\u2019examen fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019art. 25.\n[180] Deuxi\u00e8mement, la partie qui invoque l\u2019art. 25 \u2014 habituellement la partie qui se fonde sur un int\u00e9r\u00eat collectif de la minorit\u00e9 \u2014 doit convaincre le tribunal que la conduite contest\u00e9e est un droit, ou l\u2019exercice d\u2019un droit, prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par l\u2019art. 25. Il lui incombe de d\u00e9montrer que le droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard duquel il r\u00e9clame la protection de l\u2019art. 25 est un droit ancestral, issu de trait\u00e9 ou autre. Si le droit en cause fait partie des \u00ab autres \u00bb droits, alors la partie qui l\u2019invoque doit d\u00e9montrer l\u2019existence du droit revendiqu\u00e9 et le fait que ce droit prot\u00e8ge ou reconna\u00eet la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone.\n[181] Troisi\u00e8mement, la partie qui invoque l\u2019art. 25 doit d\u00e9montrer l\u2019existence d\u2019un conflit irr\u00e9conciliable entre le droit garanti par la Charte et le droit ancestral, issu de trait\u00e9 ou autre, ou l\u2019exercice de ce droit. Si les droits sont irr\u00e9conciliablement en conflit, l\u2019art. 25 agira comme bouclier afin de prot\u00e9ger la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone.\n[182] Quatri\u00e8mement, le tribunal doit se demander s\u2019il existe quelque limite applicable \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat collectif invoqu\u00e9. Par exemple, lorsque les protections de l\u2019art. 25 s\u2019appliquent, le droit collectif peut c\u00e9der devant les restrictions impos\u00e9es par l\u2019art. 28 de la Charte ou le par. 35(4) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982.\n[183] Enfin, dans les cas o\u00f9 le tribunal conclut que l\u2019art. 25 ne s\u2019applique pas, le d\u00e9fendeur peut d\u00e9montrer que l\u2019acte contest\u00e9 est justifi\u00e9 au regard de l\u2019article premier de la Charte.\n(6) Application du par. 15(1) et de l\u2019art. 25 \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire\n[184] Appliquant l\u2019analyse qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, nous concluons que le droit garanti \u00e0 Mme Dickson par le par. 15(1) de la Charte a \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9 \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue par l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence, laquelle a cr\u00e9\u00e9 une distinction fond\u00e9e sur le statut de non\u2011r\u00e9sident dans une communaut\u00e9 autochtone autonome, en plus de renforcer et d\u2019accentuer le d\u00e9savantage qu\u2019elle subit en tant que membre non r\u00e9sident de la VGFN.\n[185] Deuxi\u00e8mement, la VGFN a \u00e9tabli que l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence pr\u00e9vue dans sa Constitution est l\u2019exercice d\u2019un droit ancestral, issu de trait\u00e9 ou autre vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25. Il s\u2019agit de l\u2019exercice d\u2019un \u00ab autre \u00bb droit, \u00e0 savoir celui d\u2019\u00e9noncer des crit\u00e8res de participation \u00e0 son corps dirigeant \u2014 un droit qui prot\u00e8ge la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone.\n[186] Troisi\u00e8mement, la VGFN a \u00e9tabli que, interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 ad\u00e9quatement, son droit vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25 et le droit garanti \u00e0 Mme Dickson par le par. 15(1) sont irr\u00e9conciliablement en conflit, de sorte que si on donnait effet au droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 de Mme Dickson, il serait port\u00e9 atteinte au droit particulier vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25. Cela entra\u00eene l\u2019application de l\u2019art. 25 en tant que bouclier protecteur, mettant ainsi le droit collectif \u00e0 l\u2019abri de la revendication individuelle fond\u00e9e sur la Charte.\n[187] Enfin, nous concluons qu\u2019il n\u2019existe pas d\u2019autres limites pertinentes \u00e9cartant l\u2019application de l\u2019art. 25 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\na) Il y a violation \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue du par. 15(1) de la Charte\n(i) Qu\u2019est\u2011ce qui constitue une violation \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue du par. 15(1)?\n[188] Aux termes du par. 15(1) de la Charte, \u00ab [l]a loi ne fait acception de personne et s\u2019applique \u00e9galement \u00e0 tous, et tous ont droit \u00e0 la m\u00eame protection et au m\u00eame b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de la loi, ind\u00e9pendamment de toute discrimination, notamment des discriminations fond\u00e9es sur la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, le sexe, l\u2019\u00e2ge ou les d\u00e9ficiences mentales ou physiques. \u00bb Dans une contestation fond\u00e9e sur le par. 15(1) de la Charte, le demandeur doit d\u00e9montrer que la loi ou la mesure \u00e9tatique contest\u00e9e : a) cr\u00e9e, \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue ou de par son effet, une distinction fond\u00e9e sur un motif \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9 ou analogue; b) impose un fardeau ou nie un avantage d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui a pour effet de renforcer, de perp\u00e9tuer ou d\u2019accentuer le d\u00e9savantage (R. c. Sharma, 2022 CSC 39, par. 28, R. c. C.P., 2021 CSC 19, [2021] 1 R.C.S. 679, par. 56 et 141; Fraser c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2020 CSC 28, [2020] 3 R.C.S. 113, par. 27; Taypotat (CSC), par. 19\u201120). Lorsque l\u2019art. 25 est invoqu\u00e9, le demandeur qui se fonde sur la Charte doit d\u00e9montrer l\u2019existence d\u2019une violation \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue du par. 15(1) avant que le tribunal ne se demande si l\u2019art. 25 s\u2019applique.\n[189] La VGFN et certains intervenants se sont oppos\u00e9s au fait d\u2019exiger une analyse compl\u00e8te fond\u00e9e sur le par. 15(1) avant que l\u2019art. 25 ne puisse \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9. Leur argument est que la d\u00e9monstration d\u2019une distinction fond\u00e9e sur un motif \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9 ou analogue fournit aux tribunaux suffisamment d\u2019information pour appr\u00e9cier l\u2019\u00e9tendue d\u2019un conflit potentiel entre le droit garanti par la Charte et le droit ancestral, issu de trait\u00e9 ou autre en cause, tout en constituant un crit\u00e8re peu exigeant \u00e0 respecter pour proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019examen de l\u2019incidence de l\u2019art. 25. Un examen complet de la revendication fond\u00e9e sur le par. 15(1) ne serait donc pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019un point de vue logique et gr\u00e8verait inutilement les ressources que les communaut\u00e9s autochtones peuvent consacrer aux recours judiciaires \u2014 ainsi que les ressources des tribunaux et celles des demandeurs qui invoquent la Charte \u2014, en plus d\u2019assujettir les ordres juridiques autochtones \u00e0 un contr\u00f4le inutile \u00e0 l\u2019aune de normes non autochtones (voir m.i., par. 125\u2011126; m. interv., p.g. Canada, par. 41; m. interv., Carcross\/Tagish First Nation, par. 30; voir aussi Wilkins, p. 115\u2011117).\n[190] \u00c0 notre avis, toutefois, restreindre le d\u00e9bat \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur le par. 15(1) ne fournit pas aux tribunaux suffisamment de renseignements pour interpr\u00e9ter le droit garanti par la Charte avant de d\u00e9cider s\u2019il porte atteinte au droit relevant du champ d\u2019application de l\u2019art. 25. Il se peut que les motifs \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s ou analogues constituent des \u00ab indicateurs permanents de l\u2019existence d\u2019un processus d\u00e9cisionnel suspect ou de discrimination potentielle \u00bb (Corbiere, par. 8), mais ils ne fournissent pas de renseignements sur la revendication particuli\u00e8re en cause. Comme l\u2019a soulign\u00e9 la Cour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Corbiere, \u00ab [des distinctions] qui reposent sur des motifs analogues peuvent fort bien ne pas \u00eatre discriminatoires \u00bb (par. 8). La question de savoir si un motif est utilis\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re discriminatoire ou non est tributaires des faits propres \u00e0 chaque affaire, et la r\u00e9ponse \u00e9merge \u00e0 la seconde \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur le par. 15(1). Pour bien saisir l\u2019effet de la distinction sur le demandeur, le tribunal doit savoir si la distinction renforce, perp\u00e9tue ou accentue le d\u00e9savantage que subit le demandeur.\n(ii) Madame Dickson a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 l\u2019existence d\u2019une violation \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue du par. 15(1)\n1. L\u2019autochtonit\u00e9\u2011lieu de r\u00e9sidence ne suffit pas en tant que motif analogue\n[191] En ce qui concerne la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur le par. 15(1), Mme Dickson plaide que l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence cr\u00e9e une distinction bas\u00e9e sur le motif analogue de l\u2019\u00ab autochtonit\u00e9\u2011lieu de r\u00e9sidence \u00bb, s\u2019appuyant sur l\u2019arr\u00eat Corbiere de notre Cour \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. La VGFN fait une distinction entre l\u2019affaire Corbiere et celle qui nous occupe au motif que Corbiere avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9e relativement \u00e0 des membres hors r\u00e9serve d\u2019une bande indienne en vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens. La VGFN soutient que toute distinction \u00e9tablie par l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ne repose pas sur un motif analogue.\n[192] Nous sommes d\u2019accord pour dire que l\u2019arr\u00eat Corbiere ne tranche pas enti\u00e8rement la question. Cette affaire concernait une demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vertu du par. 15(1) sur la base d\u2019une obligation de r\u00e9sidence pr\u00e9vue par la Loi sur les Indiens qui exigeait que les membres de la bande indienne r\u00e9sident sur la r\u00e9serve pour pouvoir voter aux \u00e9lections de la bande. Contrairement \u00e0 la disposition en litige dans Corbiere, l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce fait partie de la constitution d\u2019une premi\u00e8re nation autonome. Comme le fait observer la VGFN, l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence [traduction] \u00ab n\u2019est pas impos\u00e9e par la Couronne, mais par les citoyens de la VGFN qui exercent librement et d\u00e9mocratiquement leur droit inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale \u00bb (m.i., par. 143). Comme l\u2019autochtonit\u00e9\u2011lieu de r\u00e9sidence, telle qu\u2019elle est \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans Corbiere, ne prend pas cette diff\u00e9rence en consid\u00e9ration, nous n\u2019allons pas en tenir compte en tant que motif analogue dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\n2. Le statut de non\u2011r\u00e9sident dans une communaut\u00e9 autochtone autonome est un motif analogue\n[193] Les principes directeurs permettant d\u2019identifier les motifs analogues et sur lesquels se sont appuy\u00e9s les juges majoritaires dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Corbiere demeurent utiles en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Les motifs \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s et les motifs analogues servent \u00e0 \u00e9carter les demandes [traduction] \u00ab qui n\u2019ont rien \u00e0 voir avec l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle et de mettre l\u2019accent sur l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 dans le cas de groupes qui sont d\u00e9favoris\u00e9s dans un contexte social et \u00e9conomique plus large \u00bb (L. Smith et W. Black, \u00ab The Equality Rights \u00bb (2013), 62 S.C.L.R. (2d) 301, p. 336; voir aussi Taypotat (CSC), par. 19). Le crit\u00e8re commun aux motifs \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s et aux motifs analogues du par. 15(1) est le caract\u00e8re \u00ab immuable \u00bb des caract\u00e9ristiques personnelles, y compris celles qui sont \u00ab consid\u00e9r\u00e9es immuables \u00bb, par exemple la religion ou la citoyennet\u00e9. De telles caract\u00e9ristiques sont \u00ab modifiable[s] uniquement \u00e0 un prix inacceptable du point de vue de l\u2019identit\u00e9 personnelle \u00bb, de sorte que \u00ab le gouvernement ne peut l\u00e9gitimement s\u2019attendre que nous [les] changions pour avoir droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 de traitement garantie par la loi \u00bb (Corbiere, par. 13). Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Corbiere, les juges McLachlin et Bastarache ont reconnu que le fait qu\u2019une personne autochtone r\u00e9side hors de la r\u00e9serve est un motif analogue parce que cette caract\u00e9ristique est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme immuable. Elle est essentielle \u00e0 l\u2019identit\u00e9 personnelle d\u2019un membre d\u2019une bande et modifiable uniquement \u00e0 un prix consid\u00e9rable.\n[194] Madame Dickson affirme que [traduction] \u00ab [l]es personnes autochtones vivant dans des zones urbaines ou autrement \u00e9loign\u00e9es de leurs communaut\u00e9s sont historiquement d\u00e9savantag\u00e9es en raison des politiques coloniales d\u2019assimilation et de d\u00e9placement \u00e9tablies par le Canada \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de tous les peuples autochtones et maintenues pendant des g\u00e9n\u00e9rations \u00bb (m.i. au pourvoi incident, par. 52). Elle plaide que [traduction] \u00ab les d\u00e9savantages historiques, les pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s et les conditions socio\u2011\u00e9conomiques v\u00e9cus par les personnes autochtones r\u00e9sidant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cart de leur communaut\u00e9 n\u2019ont pas automatiquement disparu lorsque leurs nations ont conclu des ententes en mati\u00e8re d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale \u00bb (par. 45). Madame Dickson fait valoir que le fait de refuser aux membres non r\u00e9sidents de la VGFN la protection offerte par le par. 15(1) au motif qu\u2019ils ne sont plus assujettis \u00e0 la Loi sur les Indiens reviendrait \u00e0 [traduction] \u00ab ne pas reconna\u00eetre le pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 long terme caus\u00e9 par les politiques du Canada \u00bb (par. 52).\n[195] La VGFN soutient pour sa part que son obligation de r\u00e9sidence n\u2019est fond\u00e9e sur aucun des motifs \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s ou analogues (m.i., par 51). La VGFN plaide, \u00e0 bon droit sur ce point, que l\u2019on n\u2019identifie pas \u00e0 la l\u00e9g\u00e8re de nouveaux motifs analogues (par. 145, citant Fraser, par. 114\u2011123). Elle fait \u00e9tat de la directive donn\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Corbiere selon laquelle le fait de d\u00e9finir un motif analogue implique d\u2019identifier \u00ab un certain processus d\u00e9cisionnel [qui] est suspect parce qu\u2019il aboutit souvent \u00e0 la discrimination et au d\u00e9ni du droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle \u00bb (par. 146, citant Corbiere, par. 8). Selon la VGFN, la distinction en jeu dans l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence n\u2019est pas intrins\u00e8quement suspecte, car elle [traduction] \u00ab ne fait pas subir \u00e0 un groupe un d\u00e9savantage historique, une diff\u00e9rence de traitement, ni ne comporte le genre de stigmate dont il est question dans Corbiere \u00bb (par. 147).\n[196] Nous sommes en d\u00e9saccord avec la position de la VGFN. Bien que l\u2019arr\u00eat Corbiere ne soit pas directement applicable dans le cas o\u00f9 la disposition contest\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e par une premi\u00e8re nation autonome, l\u2019analyse par notre Cour des d\u00e9savantages auxquels sont expos\u00e9s les Autochtones non r\u00e9sidents n\u2019\u00e9tait pas circonscrite au contexte des dispositions de la Loi sur les Indiens, et elle fournit des indications utiles. L\u2019analyse de la juge L\u2019Heureux\u2011Dub\u00e9 sur l\u2019autochtonit\u00e9\u2011lieu de r\u00e9sidence, \u00e0 laquelle ont souscrit les juges majoritaires, souligne les difficult\u00e9s auxquelles sont expos\u00e9s les Autochtones qui vivent loin de leurs communaut\u00e9s. La juge a insist\u00e9 sur le fait que, pour les membres hors r\u00e9serve des bandes indiennes, la d\u00e9cision de vivre dans la r\u00e9serve ou \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de celle\u2011ci \u00ab est importante pour leur identit\u00e9 et leur personnalit\u00e9 \u00bb, du point de vue du rattachement \u00e0 une communaut\u00e9 et \u00e0 un territoire qui ont une \u00ab importance sociale et culturelle significative pour plusieurs ou la plupart des membres de la bande \u00bb (Corbiere, par. 62). La juge L\u2019Heureux\u2011Dub\u00e9 a en outre fait observer que \u00ab les membres hors r\u00e9serve des bandes indiennes ont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement souffert de d\u00e9savantages, st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes et pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s, et font partie d\u2019une \u201cminorit\u00e9 discr\u00e8te et isol\u00e9e\u201d, d\u00e9finie par la race et le lieu de r\u00e9sidence \u00bb (par. 62).\n[197] Intervenant pour le compte des Autochtones vivant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cart de leurs terres traditionnelles, le Congr\u00e8s des peuples autochtones plaide que la discrimination dont sont victimes les membres hors r\u00e9serve ou \u00e9loign\u00e9s est un h\u00e9ritage direct des [traduction] \u00ab politiques et pratiques coloniales et assimilatrices \u00bb, y compris le syst\u00e8me des pensionnats et les droits in\u00e9gaux conf\u00e9r\u00e9s aux personnes vivant dans les r\u00e9serves et hors de celles\u2011ci en vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens (m. interv., par. 9; voir aussi le par. 10). En raison de ce pass\u00e9, dit le Congr\u00e8s, [traduction] \u00ab un grand nombre d\u2019Indiens inscrits vivant hors r\u00e9serve qui sont nominalement membres des Premi\u00e8res Nations n\u2019ont que peu ou pas de lien avec les r\u00e9serves ou leurs communaut\u00e9s \u201cd\u2019origine\u201d \u00bb (par. 12). Pourtant ces personnes demeurent [traduction] \u00ab assujetties aux d\u00e9cisions des gouvernements des Premi\u00e8res Nations qui contr\u00f4lent l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux avantages sociaux, possibilit\u00e9s et services qui leur sont destin\u00e9s, mais ne priorisent pas toujours leurs int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00bb (par. 12).\n[198] Nous concluons que le fait de remanier le motif potentiellement analogue de Mme Dickson pour parler non plus d\u2019\u00ab autochtonit\u00e9\u2011lieu de r\u00e9sidence \u00bb mais plut\u00f4t de \u00ab statut de non\u2011r\u00e9sident dans une communaut\u00e9 autochtone autonome \u00bb en fait un motif analogue conforme \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat Corbiere. Le d\u00e9savantage historique et continu que subissent les Autochtones vivant \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de leurs terres traditionnelles signifie que les distinctions fond\u00e9es sur \u00ab le statut de non-r\u00e9sident dans une communaut\u00e9 autochtone autonome \u00bb constituent des \u00ab indicateurs permanents de l\u2019existence d\u2019un processus d\u00e9cisionnel suspect ou de discrimination potentielle \u00bb (Corbiere, par. 8).\n3. L\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence renforce, perp\u00e9tue ou accentue le d\u00e9savantage\n[199] \u00c0 la seconde \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur le par. 15(1), il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9terminer si la distinction bas\u00e9e sur des motifs \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s ou analogues renforce, perp\u00e9tue ou accentue le d\u00e9savantage (Taypotat (CSC), par. 19\u201120). L\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence, qui \u00e9tablit une distinction sur la base du statut de non\u2011r\u00e9sident dans une premi\u00e8re nation autonome, renforce\u2011t\u2011elle, perp\u00e9tue\u2011t\u2011elle ou accentue\u2011t\u2011elle le d\u00e9savantage subi par Mme Dickson en tant que citoyenne de la VGFN non r\u00e9sidente?\n[200] Madame Dickson y r\u00e9pond par l\u2019affirmative. Un th\u00e8me central de ses observations est que l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence renforce un st\u00e9r\u00e9otype selon lequel [traduction] \u00ab les citoyens non r\u00e9sidents sont moins familiers avec la culture autochtone de leur nation et moins int\u00e9ress\u00e9s \u00e0 la pr\u00e9server \u00bb (m.a., par. 14). La VGFN r\u00e9plique que [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence ne contribue pas au d\u00e9savantage pr\u00e9existant que subit [Mme Dickson] en tant que membre d\u2019un groupe, et n\u2019impose pas de marginalisation, de stigmatisation et de st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes, soit les maux vis\u00e9s par l\u2019art. 15 \u00bb (m.i., par. 153). Reconnaissant que les Autochtones, y compris Mme Dickson, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 et sont toujours victimes de discrimination au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne, la VGFN plaide qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de preuve d\u2019un d\u00e9savantage historique v\u00e9cu par les citoyens de la VGFN qui vivent \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur du territoire traditionnel (par. 154\u2011155). La VGFN souligne la conclusion du juge de premi\u00e8re instance selon laquelle les citoyens de la VGFN qui r\u00e9sident dans des centres urbains comme Whitehorse b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient de plus de possibilit\u00e9s et de ressources (par. 155; motifs de premi\u00e8re instance, par. 151 et 156).\n[201] Nous ne pouvons retenir les arguments de la VGFN sur ce point. Comme l\u2019a soulign\u00e9 la Cour d\u2019appel, la conclusion du juge de premi\u00e8re instance suivant laquelle Mme Dickson avait \u00e9t\u00e9 avantag\u00e9e du fait qu\u2019elle vivait \u00e0 Whitehorse est contraire aux enseignements de l\u2019arr\u00eat Corbiere, et la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans cette affaire, expliqu\u00e9e en d\u00e9tail pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, demeure applicable aux citoyens non r\u00e9sidents des communaut\u00e9s autochtones. La Commission royale sur les peuples autochtones a fait observer que les perceptions d\u2019incompatibilit\u00e9 entre les cultures autochtones et la vie urbaine ont amen\u00e9 les gens \u00e0 \u00ab croire que les autochtones citadins doivent renier leur culture et leur patrimoine \u2014 s\u2019assimiler, somme toute \u2014 s\u2019ils veulent r\u00e9ussir leur insertion dans cet autre monde. Le corollaire de ce point de vue est que les autochtones perdent leur sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 culturelle d\u00e8s que s\u2019amorce leur migration vers la ville \u00bb (Rapport final de la CRPA, vol. 4, Perspectives et r\u00e9alit\u00e9s (1996), p. 583\u2011584). De m\u00eame, dans le rapport publi\u00e9 en 2019 par l\u2019Enqu\u00eate nationale sur les femmes et les filles autochtones disparues et assassin\u00e9es, il est mentionn\u00e9 que, en raison de la conduite pass\u00e9e des gouvernements, les femmes autochtones vivant en milieu urbain \u00ab ont pu \u00eatre exclues de leur communaut\u00e9 d\u2019appartenance, se retrouvant parfois m\u00e8res monoparentales devant subvenir seules aux besoins de leurs enfants \u00bb, et se trouvent \u00ab souvent \u00e0 des centaines de kilom\u00e8tres de leur domicile et de leurs syst\u00e8mes de soutien social [subissant] une discrimination raciale qui [est] profond\u00e9ment ancr\u00e9e dans les services urbains et les exp\u00e9riences offertes en milieu urbain \u00bb (R\u00e9clamer notre pouvoir et notre place : le rapport final de l\u2019Enqu\u00eate nationale sur les femmes et les filles autochtones disparues et assassin\u00e9es, vol. 1a (2019), p. 296\u2011297).\n[202] Il est utile de rappeler l\u2019explication que la juge Abella a donn\u00e9e dans Taypotat de la pertinence du d\u00e9savantage discriminatoire enracin\u00e9 dans l\u2019arbitraire pour ce qui est du second volet de l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur le par. 15(1). Un tribunal devrait examiner \u00ab la question de savoir si la loi contest\u00e9e ne r\u00e9pond pas aux capacit\u00e9s et aux besoins concrets des membres du groupe et leur impose plut\u00f4t un fardeau ou leur nie un avantage d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui a pour effet de renforcer, de perp\u00e9tuer ou d\u2019accentuer le d\u00e9savantage dont ils sont victimes \u00bb (par. 20).\n[203] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, Mme Dickson se voit refuser ou du moins fortement dissuader d\u2019exercer un droit d\u00e9mocratique fondamental \u2014 le droit de briguer un poste au Conseil \u2014 en raison de son statut de non\u2011r\u00e9sidente. Cette distinction fond\u00e9e sur le motif analogue du statut de non\u2011r\u00e9sident dans une communaut\u00e9 autochtone autonome renforce, perp\u00e9tue et accentue le d\u00e9savantage qu\u2019elle subit en tant que non\u2011r\u00e9sidente. Ne pas lui permettre de participer au processus \u00e9lectoral et \u00e0 la vie politique de sa communaut\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9loigne davantage de cette communaut\u00e9, ce qui rend difficile [traduction] \u00ab la pr\u00e9servation de son identit\u00e9 en tant que citoyenne de la VGFN \u00bb (m.i. au pourvoi incident, par. 65). Nous concluons que Mme Dickson a satisfait aux deux volets requis pour \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019une violation \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue du par. 15(1).\nb) L\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence rel\u00e8ve du champ d\u2019application de l\u2019art. 25 en tant qu\u2019\u00ab autre \u00bb droit\n[204] L\u2019adoption de l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence constitue l\u2019exercice d\u2019un \u00ab autre \u00bb droit vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25. La VGFN a le droit de restreindre la composition de ses corps dirigeants et la participation \u00e0 ceux\u2011ci en tant que membres. L\u2019exercice de ce droit par la VGFN au moyen de l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence prot\u00e8ge des int\u00e9r\u00eats associ\u00e9s \u00e0 la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone. Que l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence puisse ou non repr\u00e9senter aussi l\u2019exercice d\u2019un droit inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale, nous concluons qu\u2019elle constitue un \u00ab autre \u00bb droit prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par l\u2019art. 25.\n[205] Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a conclu que le droit de la VGFN d\u2019adopter l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence constitue un \u00ab autre \u00bb droit des peuples autochtones du Canada (par. 212). Il a affirm\u00e9 que, m\u00eame s\u2019il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire que de tels droits soient de \u00ab nature constitutionnelle \u00bb, ce crit\u00e8re serait respect\u00e9 puisque l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence [traduction] \u00ab n\u2019est pas simplement une r\u00e8gle de droit adopt\u00e9e par le chef et le Conseil \u00bb, mais plut\u00f4t \u00ab la volont\u00e9 de la Premi\u00e8re Nation exprim\u00e9e \u00e0 son Assembl\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale en tant que partie int\u00e9grante de sa Constitution [. . .] bas\u00e9e sur des centaines d\u2019ann\u00e9es de leadership exerc\u00e9 par ceux qui r\u00e9sident sur le territoire, comprennent l\u2019essence d\u2019\u00eatre Vuntut Gwitchin, et le fait que la coutume ou tradition existe aujourd\u2019hui \u00bb (par. 207).\n[206] La Cour d\u2019appel a elle aussi reconnu que l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence est prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par l\u2019art. 25, expliquant que les Vuntut Gwitchin ont toujours insist\u00e9 sur [traduction] \u00ab le lien entre [leurs] dirigeants et le territoire, leur attente d\u2019interactions personnelles continues entre les dirigeants et les autres membres, et leur d\u00e9sir de r\u00e9sister \u00e0 \u201cl\u2019attraction\u201d des influences ext\u00e9rieures \u00bb (par. 147). La cour a conclu que l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence refl\u00e9tait l\u2019exercice, sous une forme moderne, d\u2019un droit ancien des peuples autochtones.\n[207] La VGFN plaide que l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence constitue un exercice de son droit inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale. Selon elle, ce droit \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale, lequel comprend le droit de choisir ses dirigeants, est un droit ancestral ou \u00ab autre \u00bb au sens de l\u2019art. 25 (m.i., par. 114). Subsidiairement, la VGFN soutient que son droit d\u2019adopter l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence est aussi un droit qui existe en vertu d\u2019un accord de r\u00e8glement de revendications territoriales, car les parties \u00e0 l\u2019Entente d\u00e9finitive [traduction] \u00ab entendaient reconna\u00eetre le droit collectif et exclusif de la VGFN \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de [ses] propres terres et affaires internes, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 [ses] propres Constitution et lois \u00bb (par. 117).\n[208] Par contraste, Mme Dickson pr\u00e9tend que l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence ne constitue pas l\u2019exercice d\u2019un droit ancestral, issu de trait\u00e9 ou autre. Elle affirme que cette obligation n\u2019est express\u00e9ment pas un droit issu de trait\u00e9, ni un droit ancestral \u00e9tabli conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019analyse pr\u00e9vue par l\u2019arr\u00eat Van der Peet. Madame Dickson ajoute que le droit en cause n\u2019est pas un \u00ab autre \u00bb droit, parce qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas de statut constitutionnel, ne se rapporte pas \u00e0 une pratique historique de la VGFN, et n\u2019est pas un droit collectif puisqu\u2019il cr\u00e9e des distinctions au sein du groupe entre les citoyens de la VGFN.\n[209] Pour qu\u2019une partie qui revendique la protection de l\u2019art. 25 d\u00e9montre qu\u2019un droit autochtone collectif ou l\u2019exercice de celui\u2011ci constitue un \u00ab autre \u00bb droit ou libert\u00e9, elle doit \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence du droit en plus de d\u00e9montrer que le droit ou l\u2019exercice de ce droit prot\u00e8ge des int\u00e9r\u00eats associ\u00e9s \u00e0 la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone. \u00c0 notre avis, ces deux conditions sont r\u00e9unies en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce :\n(i) La VGFN poss\u00e8de le droit l\u00e9gal de pr\u00e9voir la composition de ses corps dirigeants et qui peut en \u00eatre membre.\n(ii) Il n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9 que la VGFN a le droit d\u2019\u00e9dicter une constitution pr\u00e9voyant la composition de ses corps dirigeants et qui peut \u00eatre membre de ceux\u2011ci. Comme nous l\u2019avons vu, l\u2019Entente d\u00e9finitive, qui est un trait\u00e9 au sens de l\u2019art. 35, pr\u00e9cise que les n\u00e9gociations relatives aux constitutions des Premi\u00e8res Nations peuvent porter notamment sur la composition, les structures et les pouvoirs des institutions gouvernementales de la premi\u00e8re nation du Yukon, ainsi que sur la qualit\u00e9 de membre de la premi\u00e8re nation et la proc\u00e9dure r\u00e9gissant les \u00e9lections (art. 24.5.1 en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, et voir surtout art. 24.5.1.1, 24.5.1.2 et 24.5.1.3). L\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale et la Loi sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale des premi\u00e8res nations du Yukon f\u00e9d\u00e9rale comportent des dispositions libell\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on similaire qui exigent des premi\u00e8res nations telle la VGFN qu\u2019elles traitent de ces questions dans leur constitution (voir, respectivement, l\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale, art. 10.1.2, et la Loi sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale des premi\u00e8res nations du Yukon, al. 8(1)b)). L\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale stipule que la \u00ab Constitution de la premi\u00e8re nation des Gwitchin Vuntut \u00e9tablit des organes directeurs et fixe leurs attributions, leur structure, leur composition ainsi que leurs modalit\u00e9s de fonctionnement \u00bb (art. 10.1). Enfin, l\u2019al. 8(1)b) de la Loi sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale des premi\u00e8res nations du Yukon f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dispose que la constitution d\u2019une premi\u00e8re nation pr\u00e9voit, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019accord qui la concerne, \u00ab la composition et les attributions de ses corps dirigeants, ainsi que les r\u00e8gles de fonctionnement qui les r\u00e9gissent \u00bb. Un tel droit comprend n\u00e9cessairement celui d\u2019\u00e9tablir des crit\u00e8res r\u00e9gissant la composition de ces corps dirigeants. Il serait impossible de doter un tel organe de membres sans \u00e9tablir les param\u00e8tres r\u00e9gissant sa composition. La VGFN a donc le droit d\u2019\u00e9tablir des restrictions concernant la composition de son corps dirigeant. En cons\u00e9quence, nous passons maintenant \u00e0 la question de savoir si ce droit ou l\u2019exercice de celui\u2011ci prot\u00e8ge ou reconna\u00eet la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone.\nc) L\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence prot\u00e8ge et reconna\u00eet les int\u00e9r\u00eats associ\u00e9s \u00e0 la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone\n[210] Comme l\u2019a fait observer la Cour d\u2019appel, le droit de d\u00e9finir la composition de ses corps dirigeants sur la base de restrictions fond\u00e9es sur le lieu de r\u00e9sidence permet \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Vuntut Gwitchin de pr\u00e9server l\u2019insistance particuli\u00e8re qu\u2019elle accorde au [traduction] \u00ab lien entre ses dirigeants et le territoire \u00bb (par. 147). Il s\u2019agit clairement d\u2019un fondement permettant d\u2019\u00e9tablir un lien entre la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone et l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence dans la Constitution de la VGFN.\n[211] En premi\u00e8re instance, le juge a tir\u00e9 des conclusions de fait d\u00e9terminantes sur le contexte historique et culturel li\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence. Il souligne que la preuve historique \u00e9tablit que [traduction] \u00ab les Vuntut Gwitchin manifestent une pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour des dirigeants qui d\u00e9montrent une connaissance du territoire et des traditions, un engagement envers le service \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9 ainsi que d\u2019efficaces habilet\u00e9s de communication, et qui sont fortun\u00e9s \u00bb, et que \u00ab le th\u00e8me qui revient constamment dans les propos des a\u00een\u00e9s au sujet du leadership est l\u2019id\u00e9e de reddition de compte aux citoyens Vuntut sur une base quotidienne \u00e0 Old Crow et lors de l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale annuelle \u00bb (par. 7).\n[212] Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 ses conclusions de fait relatives au leadership de la VGFN et au fait de r\u00e9sider sur son territoire (au par. 44), notamment :\n[traduction]\n1. Les Vuntut Gwitchin se gouvernent eux\u2011m\u00eames conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 leurs pratiques traditionnelles ant\u00e9rieures \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation du Canada en 1867.\n2. Depuis des temps imm\u00e9moriaux jusqu\u2019\u00e0 aujourd\u2019hui, tous les chefs et conseillers de la VGFN ont r\u00e9sid\u00e9 sur le territoire traditionnel de celle\u2011ci.\n3. M\u00eame \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque moderne, depuis l\u2019Entente d\u00e9finitive de 1993, les citoyens \u00e9lus ont pour pratique de r\u00e9sider \u00e0 Old Crow. Le chef Tizya\u2011Tramm, les anciens chefs Bruce Charlie et Robert Bruce fils ont tous r\u00e9sid\u00e9 \u00e0 Whitehorse \u00e0 diff\u00e9rents moments, mais ils sont tous retourn\u00e9s \u00e0 Old Crow durant leurs mandats en tant que chefs.\n[213] La Cour d\u2019appel a elle aussi soulign\u00e9 l\u2019importance du lien entre les dirigeants de la VGFN et le territoire de celle\u2011ci, prenant acte de la d\u00e9position d\u2019un ancien chef de la VGFN selon lequel [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019identit\u00e9 m\u00eame des Vuntut Gwitchin a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 profond\u00e9ment enracin\u00e9e dans le territoire lui\u2011m\u00eame \u00bb, et \u00ab les pratiques, coutumes et traditions des Vuntut Gwitchin li\u00e9es au leadership et \u00e0 la gouvernance sont aussi enracin\u00e9es dans le territoire lui\u2011m\u00eame (par. 27 (italique omis); d.a., vol. VI, p. 136\u2011137). D\u2019apr\u00e8s le chef de la VGFN, les [traduction] \u00ab processus d\u00e9cisionnels [de la VGFN] sont fond\u00e9s sur l\u2019obtention d\u2019un consensus, et le fait d\u2019avoir un conseil compos\u00e9 de membres qui ne r\u00e9sident pas dans notre communaut\u00e9 serait totalement incompatible avec notre gouvernance traditionnelle \u00bb (motifs de la C.A., par. 28 (italique omis), citant d.a., vol. VI, p. 139\u2011140).\n[214] Devant notre Cour, la VGFN invoque les conclusions de la Cour supr\u00eame et de la Cour d\u2019appel du Yukon concernant l\u2019importance du lieu de r\u00e9sidence sur son autonomie gouvernementale et son identit\u00e9 en tant qu\u2019organe repr\u00e9sentant les Vuntut Gwitchin. La VGFN plaide que, par l\u2019adoption de l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence, elle [traduction] \u00ab cherche \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger et \u00e0 promouvoir le lien spirituel et \u00e9conomique que la VGFN entretient avec le territoire traditionnel; le mode de vie des Vuntut Gwitchin, y compris les d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations d\u00e9mocratiques et le processus d\u00e9cisionnel bas\u00e9 sur le consensus entre les citoyens; et le bien\u2011\u00eatre g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la communaut\u00e9 \u00bb (m.i., par. 116). La VGFN affirme que l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence [traduction] \u00ab est une disposition qui vise \u00e0 pr\u00e9server et \u00e0 consolider la \u201csp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone\u201d par la continuit\u00e9 d\u2019un ordre juridique autochtone inh\u00e9rent qui a surv\u00e9cu \u00e0 la colonisation et auquel la VGFN a su assurer une place dans le tissu du syst\u00e8me juridique canadien \u00bb (par. 121).\n[215] Madame Dickson soutient que l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence ne prot\u00e8ge pas la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone. Se fondant sur la preuve par affidavit de citoyens de la VGFN, elle pr\u00e9tend que l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence a pour effet de d\u00e9connecter de la communaut\u00e9 les citoyens qui vivent \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de celle\u2011ci, [traduction] \u00ab avec pour cons\u00e9quence qu\u2019il leur est difficile de conserver leur culture et leur identit\u00e9 \u00bb (m.a., par. 83). Comme l\u2019obligation exclut effectivement du Conseil les citoyens non r\u00e9sidents, Mme Dickson plaide que cette mesure ne pr\u00e9serve pas la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone ni ne la prot\u00e8ge, [traduction] \u00ab mais la mine, et traite [ces citoyens] comme [des] membres \u201cde moindre valeur\u201d de la VGFN \u00bb (par. 90). Madame Dickson pr\u00e9sente aussi plusieurs arguments contestant l\u2019id\u00e9e que l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence repose sur l\u2019identit\u00e9 traditionnelle de la VGFN. Elle affirme que l\u2019obligation r\u00e9sulte de l\u2019adoption contemporaine d\u2019un syst\u00e8me de gouvernance d\u00e9mocratique, [traduction] \u00ab une addition r\u00e9cente [. . .] \u00e9dict\u00e9e en 2006 \u00bb (par. 82; voir aussi le par. 84).\n[216] \u00c0 ce stade\u2011ci de l\u2019analyse, il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence prot\u00e8ge la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone, de sorte qu\u2019elle doit \u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9e afin d\u2019\u00e9viter que le droit garanti \u00e0 Mme Dickson par le par. 15(1) de la Charte y porte atteinte. Nous avons examin\u00e9 les arguments de Mme Dickson portant, d\u2019une part, que l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence a pour effet d\u2019\u00e9roder la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone en amenant les citoyens non r\u00e9sidents \u00e0 se sentir des membres \u00ab de moindre valeur \u00bb de la communaut\u00e9 et en les \u00e9loignant des structures de gouvernance de la communaut\u00e9, et d\u2019autre part, que l\u2019obligation ne repose pas sur des pratiques traditionnelles. Toutefois, nous ne pouvons pas accepter les arguments de Mme Dickson selon lesquels il n\u2019existe pas de preuve que le fait que les conseillers r\u00e9sident sur les terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es est [traduction] \u00ab d\u00e9monstratif de leur connaissance du territoire ou leur int\u00e9r\u00eat pour celui\u2011ci \u00bb, ou que l\u2019obligation est bas\u00e9e sur des notions modernes de d\u00e9mocratie (par. 83).\n[217] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de la preuve et des conclusions de fait en premi\u00e8re instance, nous sommes convaincus que l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence est l\u2019exercice d\u2019un droit qui prot\u00e8ge des int\u00e9r\u00eats associ\u00e9s \u00e0 la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone. Obliger les dirigeants de la VGFN \u00e0 r\u00e9sider sur les terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es aide \u00e0 pr\u00e9server le lien entre les dirigeants et le territoire, qui est profond\u00e9ment ancr\u00e9 dans la culture et les pratiques de gouvernance distinctives de la VGFN. L\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence favorise le respect des attentes de la VGFN que ses dirigeants seront en mesure de maintenir des interactions personnelles continues avec les autres membres de la communaut\u00e9. Elle renforce aussi la capacit\u00e9 de la VGFN de r\u00e9sister aux forces ext\u00e9rieures qui attirent les citoyens loin de ses terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es, en plus de pr\u00e9venir l\u2019\u00e9rosion de son important lien avec le territoire. De tels int\u00e9r\u00eats sont associ\u00e9s \u00e0 divers aspects de la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone, y compris la diff\u00e9rence culturelle et la souverainet\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieure des Vuntut Gwitchin, ainsi que leur participation au processus de n\u00e9gociation de trait\u00e9s qui a abouti \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9diction de la Constitution de la VGFN.\n[218] Enfin, \u00e0 l\u2019instar des deux juridictions inf\u00e9rieures, nous sommes d\u2019avis que l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence poss\u00e8de une \u00ab nature constitutionnelle \u00bb sur le plan substantiel, plut\u00f4t que formel (motifs de premi\u00e8re instance, par. 207; motifs de la C.A., par. 147). Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9cider si une \u00ab nature constitutionnelle \u00bb sera toujours une condition requise pour que s\u2019applique la protection de l\u2019art. 25 : en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il est \u00e9vident que l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence a une importante dimension constitutionnelle. Au\u2011del\u00e0 du simple fait que l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence fait partie de la Constitution de la VGFN, elle constitue un aspect du droit de la Premi\u00e8re Nation qui pr\u00e9serve et consacre une dimension importante des traditions et pratiques de la VGFN en mati\u00e8re de leadership, et du lien de ses dirigeants avec le territoire. Nous soulignons sp\u00e9cialement la conclusion de la Cour d\u2019appel selon laquelle l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence [traduction] \u00ab a clairement pour objet d\u2019exprimer et de promouvoir les traditions et coutumes particuli\u00e8res de la VGFN en mati\u00e8re de gouvernance et de leadership \u2014 une question d\u2019importance fondamentale pour une petite premi\u00e8re nation habitant un endroit vaste et \u00e9loign\u00e9 \u00bb (par. 147). Suivant toute d\u00e9finition raisonnable qui pourrait \u00eatre donn\u00e9e d\u2019un droit, ou de l\u2019exercice d\u2019un droit, qui pr\u00e9sente une \u00ab nature constitutionnelle \u00bb, l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence satisfait \u00e0 cette d\u00e9finition.\nd) La VGFN a \u00e9tabli que le conflit entre les deux droits est irr\u00e9conciliable\n[219] La Cour doit ensuite d\u00e9terminer si la VGFN a \u00e9tabli que le conflit entre les deux droits est irr\u00e9conciliable, de telle sorte que le droit vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25 serait prot\u00e9g\u00e9 contre l\u2019atteinte qui d\u00e9coulerait du fait de donner effet au droit garanti \u00e0 Mme Dickson par le par. 15(1). Nous concluons que la VGFN a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que le conflit entre les deux droits est irr\u00e9conciliable et que, par cons\u00e9quent, il est possible d\u2019invoquer l\u2019art. 25 afin de prot\u00e9ger l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence de la VGFN.\n[220] Le conflit est \u00e9vident lorsque les deux droits sont d\u2019abord interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s correctement, puis compar\u00e9s l\u2019un \u00e0 l\u2019autre, comme l\u2019exige le cadre d\u2019analyse de l\u2019art. 25.\n[221] Pour ce qui est du contenu du droit que le par. 15(1) garantit \u00e0 Mme Dickson, cette derni\u00e8re a \u00e9tabli \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue l\u2019existence d\u2019une distinction bas\u00e9e sur le motif analogue que constitue le statut de non\u2011r\u00e9sident dans une communaut\u00e9 autochtone autonome. Elle est inhabile \u00e0 occuper un poste au sein du Conseil de la VGFN parce qu\u2019elle vit \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur des terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es. Cette distinction bas\u00e9e sur son statut de non\u2011r\u00e9sidente renforce et accentue le d\u00e9savantage historique auquel sont toujours expos\u00e9s les Autochtones qui vivent \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de leur territoire traditionnel.\n[222] Quant au contenu de l\u2019\u00ab autre \u00bb droit : \u00e0 la base, l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence prot\u00e8ge et reconna\u00eet la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone en pr\u00e9servant le lien entre le leadership de la VGFN et les terres de cette derni\u00e8re. Les autres fa\u00e7ons dont l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence prot\u00e8ge cette diff\u00e9rence, par exemple en favorisant la capacit\u00e9 de la VGFN \u00e0 r\u00e9sister \u00e0 l\u2019attraction des influences ext\u00e9rieures, se rattachent \u00e0 ce lien.\n[223] Madame Dickson plaide que la VGFN aurait pu adopter des mesures qui [traduction] \u00ab donn[eraient] effet \u00e0 la fois aux droits d\u00e9mocratiques individuels en cause et aux droits collectifs de la VGFN de gouverner et d\u2019\u00e9tablir des crit\u00e8res d\u2019\u00e9ligibilit\u00e9 pour ses dirigeants \u00e9lus \u00bb (m.a., par. 13). \u00c0 titre d\u2019exemple, lors de l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de 2019, Mme Dickson a propos\u00e9 qu\u2019un seul conseiller soit choisi parmi les citoyens de la VGFN vivant \u00e0 Whitehorse (par. 119). Elle avance cette solution dans le contexte de son argument relatif \u00e0 l\u2019atteinte minimale dans le cadre de l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019article premier de la Charte. Cependant, son argument selon lequel cette solution donnerait effet \u00e0 la fois \u00e0 son droit individuel garanti par la Charte et au droit de la VGFN justifie un examen au regard de l\u2019art. 25, car il revient essentiellement \u00e0 dire que les deux droits sont, en fait, conciliables.\n[224] La VGFN souligne la conclusion de la Cour d\u2019appel portant que [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019application du par. 15(1) porterait de fait atteinte aux droits des Vuntut Gwitchin de se gouverner eux\u2011m\u00eames conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 leurs propres valeurs et traditions particuli\u00e8res et conform\u00e9ment aux arrangements en mati\u00e8re d\u2019\u201cautonomie gouvernementale\u201d conclus avec le Canada et le Yukon en 1993 \u00bb (m.i., par. 122, citant les motifs de la C.A., par. 149 (en italique dans l\u2019original)).\n[225] Nous sommes d\u2019accord avec la Cour d\u2019appel. Le fait de permettre \u00e0 un conseiller de r\u00e9sider \u00e0 Whitehorse minerait, de mani\u00e8re non accessoire, le droit de la VGFN de d\u00e9cider qui peut \u00eatre membre de ses corps dirigeants. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 expliqu\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence est inextricablement rattach\u00e9e au lien entre les dirigeants et les terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es. La Cour d\u2019appel a cit\u00e9 la d\u00e9position du directeur ex\u00e9cutif de la VGFN, qui disait que la raison pour laquelle la proposition initiale de Mme Dickson d\u2019\u00e9liminer l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence n\u2019avait pas re\u00e7u d\u2019appui \u00e9tait qu\u2019elle entrait en conflit [traduction] \u00ab avec l\u2019opinion largement r\u00e9pandue que l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale des Vuntut Gwitchin et la protection de notre culture sont li\u00e9es de mani\u00e8re cruciale au fait que le si\u00e8ge de notre gouvernement se trouve \u00e0 Old Crow \u00bb (par. 30 (italique omis); d.a., vol. VIII, p. 158). \u00c0 notre avis, le fait pour notre Cour d\u2019autoriser l\u2019un des quatre conseillers \u00e0 r\u00e9sider \u00e0 Whitehorse diminuerait ce lien de mani\u00e8re inacceptable.\n[226] En cons\u00e9quence, nous ne pouvons pas accepter que les effets d\u2019un tel changement \u00e0 la composition du Conseil de la VGFN sur les int\u00e9r\u00eats que favorise l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence seraient simplement accessoires. Pour reprendre les propos du professeur Macklem, donner effet de cette mani\u00e8re au droit garanti par la Charte \u00e0 Mme Dickson repr\u00e9senterait [traduction] \u00ab un v\u00e9ritable risque pour la vitalit\u00e9 durable de la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone \u00bb (p. 232). Donner effet au droit garanti par le par. 15(1) \u00e0 Mme Dickson porterait atteinte \u00e0 un \u00ab autre \u00bb droit, qui appartient \u00e0 la VGFN. Les deux droits sont, par cons\u00e9quent, irr\u00e9conciliablement en conflit.\ne) Aucune autre limite ne s\u2019applique\n[227] Bien que les protections de l\u2019art. 25 puissent \u00eatre assorties d\u2019autres limites, y compris celles impos\u00e9es en lien avec l\u2019art. 28 de la Charte et le par. 35(4) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982, aucune restriction de la sorte n\u2019est pertinente dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. La Cour d\u2019appel a conclu que les protections de l\u2019art. 25 s\u2019\u00e9tendaient \u00e0 tous les aspects de l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence, y compris la r\u00e8gle du d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement dans les 14 jours. Devant notre Cour, Mme Dickson n\u2019a pas sollicit\u00e9 de r\u00e9paration fond\u00e9e sur la Charte \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cette r\u00e8gle (d.a., vol. I, p. 209\u2011210), ni pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d\u2019arguments sur la question du retranchement. Compte tenu des fardeaux qui incombent aux demandeurs qui invoquent l\u2019art. 25 de la Charte, nous ne sommes pas d\u2019avis de limiter la protection de l\u2019art. 25 relativement \u00e0 cette r\u00e8gle. Enfin, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que l\u2019art. 25 s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence, la VGFN n\u2019est pas tenue de justifier l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence en vertu de l\u2019article premier de la Charte.\n[228] Nous concluons que l\u2019art. 25 agit comme bouclier et prot\u00e8ge l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence contre la revendication de Mme Dickson fond\u00e9e sur le par. 15(1).\nVII. Conclusion et dispositif\n[229] Nous proposons de r\u00e9pondre comme suit aux questions constitutionnelles de l\u2019appelante, Mme Dickson, et de l\u2019appelante au pourvoi incident, la VGFN :\n1. La Charte s\u2019applique\u2011t\u2011elle \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence contenue \u00e0 l\u2019article XI(2) de la Constitution de la Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation?\nOui.\n2. Dans l\u2019affirmative,\na) L\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence viole\u2011t\u2011elle le par. 15(1) de la Charte, et le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, une telle violation est\u2011elle une limite raisonnable prescrite par une r\u00e8gle de droit dont la justification peut se d\u00e9montrer dans le cadre d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 libre et d\u00e9mocratique au sens de l\u2019article premier de la Charte?\nOui, en partie. L\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence viole \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue le par. 15(1) de la Charte. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9terminer si une telle violation est une limite raisonnable au sens de l\u2019article premier de la Charte.\nb) L\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence constitue\u2011t\u2011elle l\u2019exercice de l\u2019un des droits ou libert\u00e9s \u2014 ancestraux, issus de trait\u00e9s ou autres \u2014 des peuples autochtones du Canada au titre de l\u2019art. 25 de la Charte, et le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, les droits garantis par la Charte en vertu du par. 15(1) portent\u2011ils atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019un de ces droits ou libert\u00e9s ancestraux, issus de trait\u00e9s ou autres?\nOui. L\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence est l\u2019exercice d\u2019un \u00ab autre \u00bb droit ou libert\u00e9 des peuples autochtones du Canada vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25 de la Charte, et la demande fond\u00e9e sur le par. 15(1) porte atteinte \u00e0 ce droit, de sorte qu\u2019il ne peut \u00eatre donn\u00e9 effet \u00e0 cette demande.\n[230] En ce qui concerne la demande de Mme Dickson fond\u00e9e sur le droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019article IV de la Constitution de la VGFN, laquelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 plaid\u00e9e subsidiairement devant la Cour supr\u00eame du Yukon, nous prenons bonne note de l\u2019observation faite par la juge d\u2019appel Newbury dans les motifs de la Cour d\u2019appel selon lesquels, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que Mme Dickson a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande en vertu de la Charte, elle peut choisir par la suite de soumettre une demande similaire en vertu de la Constitution de la VGFN (par. 157). Comme notre Cour n\u2019a pas trait\u00e9 de l\u2019application de l\u2019article IV, nous nous abstenons de faire d\u2019autres commentaires sur cette question.\n[231] En cons\u00e9quence, nous sommes d\u2019avis de rejeter le pourvoi de Mme Dickson. Nous sommes \u00e9galement d\u2019avis de rejeter le pourvoi incident de la VGFN compte tenu de notre conclusion que la Charte s\u2019applique. Nous sommes d\u2019avis de confirmer l\u2019ordonnance des juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel annulant le jugement de la Cour supr\u00eame et rejetant la requ\u00eate de Mme Dickson. Nous sommes d\u2019avis de ne pas rendre d\u2019ordonnance concernant les d\u00e9pens.\nVersion fran\u00e7aise des motifs rendus par\nLes juges Martin et O\u2019Bonsawin \u2014\nI. Aper\u00e7u\n[232] Cindy Dickson est une citoyenne de la Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation (\u00ab VGFN \u00bb) qui souhaite se porter candidate au poste de conseill\u00e8re. Quelque chose l\u2019emp\u00eache de servir ainsi sa communaut\u00e9 : une disposition de la Constitution de la VGFN, adopt\u00e9e par celle\u2011ci en vertu de ses pouvoirs d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale, qui oblige les conseillers \u00e0 vivre d\u00e9j\u00e0 sur les terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es (aussi appel\u00e9es \u00ab terres vis\u00e9es par le r\u00e8glement \u00bb) de la VGFN ou \u00e0 y d\u00e9m\u00e9nager dans les 14 jours qui suivent leur \u00e9lection (article XI(2) (\u00ab obligation de r\u00e9sidence \u00bb)). L\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence exclut des centaines de citoyens de la VGFN qui ne vivent pas sur les terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es \u2014 mais conservent leurs identit\u00e9 et liens culturels avec leur communaut\u00e9 \u2014 d\u2019un aspect essentiel de la participation d\u00e9mocratique \u00e0 la VGFN, et ce, malgr\u00e9 le pass\u00e9 colonial et les imp\u00e9ratifs socio\u2011\u00e9conomiques en d\u00e9coulant qui ont \u00e9loign\u00e9 bien des citoyens de la VGFN de leurs terres traditionnelles.\n[233] Madame Dickson, l\u2019une de ces citoyens, vit pr\u00e9sentement \u00e0 Whitehorse, au Yukon, depuis de nombreuses ann\u00e9es. Elle a quitt\u00e9 les terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es de la VGFN \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 16 ans afin de terminer ses \u00e9tudes secondaires, de faire des \u00e9tudes postsecondaires et de chercher des possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019emploi. \u00c0 l\u2019heure actuelle, il lui est impossible de r\u00e9sider sur les terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es pour plusieurs raisons, y compris le fait que les ressources m\u00e9dicales limit\u00e9es disponibles l\u00e0\u2011bas ne r\u00e9pondraient pas aux besoins sp\u00e9ciaux de son enfant en mati\u00e8re de soins de sant\u00e9. D\u2019apr\u00e8s son t\u00e9moignage non contredit, elle ne peut d\u00e9m\u00e9nager pour respecter l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence prescrite, car il lui est impossible d\u2019abandonner les services th\u00e9rapeutiques et services de soutien dont a besoin son enfant. Elle conteste cette obligation de r\u00e9sidence en vertu de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s au motif qu\u2019emp\u00eacher les non\u2011r\u00e9sidents de jouer un r\u00f4le utile dans la gouvernance de la communaut\u00e9 op\u00e8re une discrimination injustifi\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des membres du groupe qui ne vivent pas sur les terres traditionnelles.\n[234] La pr\u00e9sente demande soul\u00e8ve bien des enjeux d\u2019importance fondamentale en ce qui concerne la mesure dans laquelle la Charte prot\u00e8ge les droits et libert\u00e9s des Autochtones relativement aux mesures prises par les gouvernements autochtones. \u00c0 notre avis, la Charte s\u2019applique aux mesures gouvernementales prises par des nations autochtones autonomes parce qu\u2019elles sont de nature gouvernementale et que l\u2019objet du par. 32(1) \u00e9tait d\u2019\u00e9tendre les protections de la Charte pour rem\u00e9dier au d\u00e9s\u00e9quilibre des forces entre les gouvern\u00e9s et les gouvernants au Canada. Au fur et \u00e0 mesure que les contours de l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale autochtone \u00e9voluent, il est essentiel qu\u2019aucune zone soustraite \u00e0 l\u2019application de la Charte ne soit cr\u00e9\u00e9e au Canada, que tout un chacun soit prot\u00e9g\u00e9 \u00e9galement par ses garanties inscrites dans la Constitution, et que toutes les formes de gouvernement soient assujetties \u00e0 ses limites.\n[235] L\u2019ajout \u00e0 la Charte de l\u2019art. 25, aux termes duquel les droits individuels reconnus par la Charte \u00ab ne porte[nt] pas atteinte aux droits ou libert\u00e9s \u2014 ancestraux, issus de trait\u00e9s ou autres \u2014 des peuples autochtones du Canada \u00bb, \u00e9tait motiv\u00e9 par une pr\u00e9occupation pr\u00e9cise au sujet de la diff\u00e9rence autochtone et des droits distincts que poss\u00e8dent les peuples autochtones \u00e0 titre de \u00ab peuples autochtones du Canada \u00bb. L\u2019article 25 est une disposition unique \u00e0 l\u2019objet particulier, qui sert d\u2019important outil d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation pour aider \u00e0 emp\u00eacher qu\u2019il soit port\u00e9 atteinte \u00e0 ces droits collectifs sp\u00e9ciaux d\u00e9tenus par les peuples autochtones ou y d\u00e9roge. L\u2019article 25 emp\u00eache principalement les non-Autochtones de pr\u00e9senter des r\u00e9clamations qui auraient pour effet d\u2019enlever aux peuples autochtones ce qui leur revient de droit justement parce qu\u2019ils sont des peuples autochtones.\n[236] Nous n\u2019acceptons pas la th\u00e8se plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale selon laquelle l\u2019art. 25 met les mesures d\u2019une nation autochtone autonome \u00e0 l\u2019abri des demandes pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es au titre de la Charte par des membres de cette communaut\u00e9. Interpr\u00e9ter ainsi l\u2019art. 25 de mani\u00e8re non t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique aurait pour r\u00e9sultat consid\u00e9rable de cr\u00e9er et de confirmer des zones soustraites \u00e0 l\u2019application de la Charte, de telle sorte que les minorit\u00e9s au sein des communaut\u00e9s autochtones ne seraient pas prot\u00e9g\u00e9es des mesures de leurs propres gouvernements. Tous les Canadiens et Canadiennes, notamment les Autochtones, ont besoin d\u2019outils constitutionnels pour tenir leurs gouvernements responsables des atteintes \u00e0 leurs droits et libert\u00e9s consacr\u00e9s. Refuser aux membres de nations autochtones autonomes des droits, mesures de redressement et recours semblables va \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des objets de la Charte et de l\u2019art. 25, en plus d\u2019\u00eatre profond\u00e9ment in\u00e9quitable.\n[237] Nous appliquons donc la Charte, ainsi que le droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 revendiqu\u00e9 au titre du par. 15(1), \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence attaqu\u00e9e. Nous concluons que la demande de Mme Dickson fond\u00e9e sur le par. 15(1) de la Charte doit \u00eatre accueillie. L\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence \u00e9tablit une distinction discriminatoire entre les citoyens de la VGFN qui vivent sur les terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es et ceux qui vivent ailleurs. Le motif analogue de l\u2019\u00ab autochtonit\u00e9\u2011lieu de r\u00e9sidence \u00bb s\u2019applique dans ce contexte. Nous ne sommes pas convaincues que l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence rel\u00e8ve du champ d\u2019application de l\u2019art. 25, vu que l\u2019obligation est ax\u00e9e sur la r\u00e9gie interne de la VGFN et ne vise pas \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre le statut sp\u00e9cial de groupes autochtones au sein de l\u2019\u00c9tat canadien au sens large. M\u00eame si l\u2019on applique l\u2019article premier de la Charte en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce de mani\u00e8re contextuelle et adapt\u00e9e \u00e0 la culture, ancr\u00e9e dans la diff\u00e9rence autochtone et respectueuse de celle\u2011ci, l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence n\u2019\u00e9quivaut pas \u00e0 une atteinte minimale, et sa justification ne peut donc se d\u00e9montrer dans le cadre d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 libre et d\u00e9mocratique.\n[238] Nous sommes d\u2019avis d\u2019accueillir le pourvoi et de rejeter le pourvoi incident pour les motifs qui suivent.\nII. Paragraphe 32(1) de la Charte\n[239] Les gouvernements modernes sont assujettis \u00e0 toute une gamme de limites. Respecter ces limites, y compris les protections des droits individuels et les garanties collectives, est une pierre angulaire de la gouvernance responsable. L\u2019insertion de droits constitutionnalis\u00e9s dans la Charte a marqu\u00e9 un tournant dans la relation entre les gouvern\u00e9s et les gouvernants.\n[240] Plusieurs ordres de gouvernement au Canada, notamment le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, les gouvernements provinciaux et territoriaux, ainsi que les gouvernements autochtones, poss\u00e8dent le pouvoir d\u2019empi\u00e9ter sur les libert\u00e9s individuelles (Commission royale sur les peuples autochtones (\u00ab Commission royale \u00bb), Rapport de la Commission royale sur les peuples autochtones, vol. 2, Une relation \u00e0 red\u00e9finir (1996), p. 265\u2011267). Particuli\u00e8rement depuis l\u2019adoption de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982, les gouvernements et les tribunaux se sont mis \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre \u00e0 juste titre les communaut\u00e9s autochtones comme des l\u00e9gislateurs et des titulaires de droits. \u00c0 titre d\u2019exemple de cette reconnaissance, l\u2019Accord\u2011cadre d\u00e9finitif conclu en 1993 entre des repr\u00e9sentants des premi\u00e8res nations du Yukon, du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et de celui du Yukon \u00e9tablissait un cadre d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale autochtone dans le territoire. Des accords d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale ont suivi, notamment l\u2019entente concernant la VGFN au c\u0153ur de la pr\u00e9sente affaire. L\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale de la premi\u00e8re nation des Gwitchin Vuntut (1993) (\u00ab Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale de la VGFN \u00bb) reconna\u00eet des pouvoirs l\u00e9gislatifs \u00e9tendus sur des mati\u00e8res comme les affaires internes de la VGFN, la prestation de certains programmes et services et les mati\u00e8res de nature locale ou priv\u00e9e (art. 13.1, 13.2 et 13.3; voir aussi le m.i., par. 20). \u00c0 l\u2019instar de n\u2019importe quel autre ordre de gouvernement, la VGFN adopte des lois coercitives qui lient les particuliers.\n[241] \u00c0 notre avis, une interpr\u00e9tation t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique du par. 32(1) de la Charte fait en sorte que la VGFN, en tant que communaut\u00e9 autochtone autonome, est tenue de respecter les droits que la Charte garantit \u00e0 ses citoyens. Nous convenons avec les juges Kasirer et Jamal que l\u2019\u00e9diction par la VGFN de l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence est assujettie \u00e0 la Charte et que la VGFN est \u00ab \u201cgouvernement[ale]\u201d par nature \u00bb. Nous parvenons toutefois \u00e0 cette conclusion en raison d\u2019autres consid\u00e9rations.\n[242] Nous expliquons d\u2019abord en quoi le par. 32(1) vise le rapport entre les gouvern\u00e9s et les gouvernants. Son objet est de soumettre l\u2019action gouvernementale au contr\u00f4le constitutionnel afin de prot\u00e9ger les droits et libert\u00e9s individuels.\n[243] Deuxi\u00e8mement, nous expliquons pourquoi la jurisprudence existante sur le par. 32(1), laquelle traite d\u2019autres types d\u2019entit\u00e9s, ne s\u2019applique pas directement \u00e0 la situation unique des gouvernements autochtones sur les plans historique et juridique. \u00c0 notre avis, la VGFN ne tire pas son origine de la loi, son pouvoir l\u00e9gislatif ne lui a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9, et elle n\u2019a pas \u00e0 fonder son statut gouvernemental en renvoyant \u00e0 ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9, d\u00e9volu ou accord\u00e9 par un autre ordre de gouvernement.\n[244] Troisi\u00e8mement, nous d\u00e9crivons comment le par. 32(1) englobe l\u2019action gouvernementale \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des \u00ab domaines relevant \u00bb du Parlement et des l\u00e9gislatures provinciales, et la Charte s\u2019applique donc aux gouvernements autochtones parce qu\u2019ils disposent d\u2019un pouvoir de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer sur des mati\u00e8res l\u00e9gislatives vis\u00e9es par le par. 32(1). Il en est ainsi peu importe que l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale autochtone soit confirm\u00e9e ou reconnue par une loi, repose sur la modalit\u00e9 d\u2019un trait\u00e9 ou soit enracin\u00e9e dans un droit ancestral inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale. L\u2019analyse centrale fond\u00e9e sur le par. 32(1) consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019entit\u00e9 se livre \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s gouvernementales susceptibles de toucher \u00e0 ces domaines et d\u2019empi\u00e9ter sur les droits des gouvern\u00e9s. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que la mesure attaqu\u00e9e d\u00e9coule d\u2019un pouvoir conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, provinciale ou territoriale pour qu\u2019elle fasse l\u2019objet d\u2019un examen fond\u00e9 sur la Charte. La reconnaissance de nations autochtones autonomes en tant que gouvernements \u00e0 part enti\u00e8re rel\u00e8ve clairement de l\u2019objet et de la port\u00e9e du par. 32(1).\n[245] Enfin, nous concluons que la VGFN est un gouvernement de par sa nature m\u00eame parce qu\u2019elle exerce des pouvoirs l\u00e9gislatifs et ex\u00e9cutifs \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de \u00ab domaines relevant \u00bb du Parlement et des l\u00e9gislatures provinciales qui touchent consid\u00e9rablement aux droits et libert\u00e9s individuels prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par la Charte. Par cons\u00e9quent, toutes les activit\u00e9s de la VGFN, notamment son \u00e9diction de l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence, peuvent faire l\u2019objet d\u2019un examen fond\u00e9 sur la Charte. Cette approche refl\u00e8te l\u2019objet du par. 32(1), s\u2019accorde avec les pratiques de longue date en mati\u00e8re d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale autochtone, et favorise la r\u00e9conciliation au Canada.\nA. La Charte vise la relation entre les gouvern\u00e9s et les gouvernants\n(1) D\u00e9terminer la port\u00e9e du par. 32(1)\n[246] Le paragraphe 32(1) indique [traduction] \u00ab sur qui p\u00e8se le fardeau des droits garantis par la Charte, ou, autrement dit, qui est li\u00e9 par la Charte \u00bb (P. W. Hogg et W. K. Wright, Constitutional Law of Canada (5e \u00e9d. suppl.), \u00a7 37:6 (en italique dans l\u2019original)). Il pr\u00e9voit ce qui suit :\n32 (1) La pr\u00e9sente charte s\u2019applique :\na) au Parlement et au gouvernement du Canada, pour tous les domaines relevant du Parlement, y compris ceux qui concernent le territoire du Yukon et les territoires du Nord\u2011Ouest;\nb) \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislature et au gouvernement de chaque province, pour tous les domaines relevant de cette l\u00e9gislature.\n[247] Le texte m\u00eame du par. 32(1) pr\u00e9voit que la Charte s\u2019applique \u00ab au Parlement et au gouvernement du Canada \u00bb de m\u00eame qu\u2019\u00e0 \u00ab la l\u00e9gislature et au gouvernement de chaque province \u00bb, pour tous les domaines relevant de la comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative de chaque ordre de gouvernement. Fait important, dans sa jurisprudence sur le par. 32(1), notre Cour a toujours confirm\u00e9 la vaste gamme d\u2019entit\u00e9s vis\u00e9es par la disposition. D\u00e8s l\u2019arr\u00eat SDGMR c. Dolphin Delivery Ltd., [1986] 2 R.C.S. 573, le juge McIntyre s\u2019est dit d\u2019avis qu\u2019aux termes du par. 32(1), celui\u2011ci pr\u00e9cise que la Charte s\u2019applique aux \u00ab branches l\u00e9gislative, ex\u00e9cutive et administrative [du gouvernement] \u00bb (p. 598).\n[248] Selon le par. 32(1), la Charte s\u2019applique lorsque le gouvernement agit; [traduction] \u00ab [l]es droits garantis par la Charte ne jouent qu\u2019\u00e0 titre de restrictions au pouvoir du gouvernement sur les titulaires de ces droits \u00bb (Hogg et Wright, \u00a7 37:13). Notre Cour a d\u00e9fini \u00ab gouvernement \u00bb comme visant \u00ab [l\u2019organe] qui peut adopter et appliquer des r\u00e8gles et qui peut porter atteinte p\u00e9remptoirement \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 individuelle \u00bb (McKinney c. Universit\u00e9 de Guelph, [1990] 3 R.C.S. 229, p. 262). La n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9server les droits individuels compte tenu de ce pouvoir consid\u00e9rable exige que les gouvernements se voient \u00ab imposer des contraintes dans la Constitution \u00bb (p. 262; voir aussi Dolphin Delivery, p. 593).\n[249] L\u2019objet qui sous\u2011tend le champ d\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 de la Charte est donc de rem\u00e9dier au d\u00e9s\u00e9quilibre des forces entre les gouvern\u00e9s et les gouvernants. Dans Hunter c. Southam Inc., [1984] 2 R.C.S. 145, le juge Dickson (plus tard juge en chef) a reconnu explicitement cet objet \u00e0 la p. 156 :\nLa Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s est un document qui vise un but. Ce but est de garantir et de prot\u00e9ger, dans des limites raisonnables, la jouissance des droits et libert\u00e9s qu\u2019elle ench\u00e2sse. Elle vise \u00e0 emp\u00eacher le gouvernement d\u2019agir \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de ces droits et libert\u00e9s; elle n\u2019autorise pas en soi le gouvernement \u00e0 agir. [Nous soulignons.]\nDe m\u00eame, comme l\u2019a fait remarquer le juge Lauwers dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Spence c. BMO Trust Co., 2016 ONCA 196, 129 O.R. (3d) 561, par. 125, [traduction] \u00ab la Charte a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e pour contr\u00f4ler les activit\u00e9s du gouvernement, comme le pr\u00e9voit le par. 32(1), en vue de prot\u00e9ger l\u2019autonomie de la personne et le droit \u00e0 la protection contre les activit\u00e9s gouvernementales \u00bb. Notre Cour reconna\u00eet dans sa jurisprudence l\u2019importance de ce d\u00e9s\u00e9quilibre des forces lorsque vient le temps de d\u00e9cider si une entit\u00e9 est vis\u00e9e par le par. 32(1) (voir, p. ex., McKinney, p. 261\u2011262; Dolphin Delivery, p. 593 et 597; Stoffman c. Vancouver General Hospital, [1990] 3 R.C.S. 483, p. 505).\n[250] Cet objet appuie une conception large des entit\u00e9s vis\u00e9es par le par. 32(1). Vu les int\u00e9r\u00eats importants en jeu, la juge Wilson a clairement indiqu\u00e9 dans Lavigne c. Syndicat des employ\u00e9s de la fonction publique de l\u2019Ontario, [1991] 2 R.C.S. 211, que \u00ab la Charte s\u2019applique aux entit\u00e9s \u201cgouvernementales\u201d au sens large \u00bb (p. 240 (nous soulignons)). Le juge La Forest a repris cette position dans Godbout c. Longueuil (Ville), [1997] 3 R.C.S. 844, o\u00f9 il a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il faut se garder de restreindre ind\u00fbment l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 de la Charte et de permettre ainsi aux gouvernements de se soustraire aux obligations que leur impose la Charte (par. 48).\n[251] Cet objet doit sous\u2011tendre toute conception et toute interpr\u00e9tation du par. 32(1). Pour d\u00e9terminer \u00e0 qui s\u2019applique la Charte, il faut se concentrer sur les entit\u00e9s qui ont le droit d\u2019exercer un pouvoir gouvernemental \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de particuliers d\u2019une mani\u00e8re susceptible de restreindre leurs droits et libert\u00e9s. Toute interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 de la Charte qui a pour effet de cr\u00e9er une zone soustraite \u00e0 l\u2019application de la Charte malgr\u00e9 cette forme de d\u00e9s\u00e9quilibre des forces compromettrait les objectifs et l\u2019importance de la Charte.\n[252] Le fait qu\u2019il ne convient pas de donner une interpr\u00e9tation restrictive au par. 32(1) a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re limpide par le juge La Forest au par. 47 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Godbout :\n. . . lorsque ces entit\u00e9s sont en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 de nature \u00ab gouvernementale \u00bb \u2014 en raison, par exemple, du degr\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le gouvernemental dont elles font l\u2019objet ou de la nature gouvernementale des fonctions qu\u2019elles ex\u00e9cutent \u2014 elles ne peuvent se soustraire \u00e0 l\u2019examen fond\u00e9 sur la Charte. En d\u2019autres termes, l\u2019art. 32 est de port\u00e9e assez large pour englober toutes les entit\u00e9s qui sont essentiellement de nature gouvernementale et son champ d\u2019application ne se limite pas aux seuls organismes qui font officiellement partie de la structure gouvernementale f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ou provinciale. [Nous soulignons.]\n(Voir aussi le par. 48.)\nSelon cette jurisprudence, ce serait une erreur que de se concentrer sur la question de savoir si ou en quoi une entit\u00e9 s\u2019inscrit dans la structure gouvernementale f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ou provinciale.\n[253] Dans Godbout, le juge La Forest a souscrit \u00e0 une conception large du par. 32(1). Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, il a expliqu\u00e9 comment, vu l\u2019objet g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de soumettre l\u2019action gouvernementale \u00e0 un examen constitutionnel, une interpr\u00e9tation qui limite l\u2019application de la Charte aux entit\u00e9s faisant officiellement partie de la structure gouvernementale f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ou provinciale souffrirait d\u2019une lacune fatale :\nD\u2019un point de vue pratique, en outre, il est tout \u00e0 fait sens\u00e9 d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019art. 32 comme incluant d\u2019autres entit\u00e9s gouvernementales que celles qui y sont express\u00e9ment \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es. Si la Charte devait en effet ne s\u2019appliquer qu\u2019aux organismes faisant institutionnellement partie du gouvernement et non \u00e0 ceux qui sont de nature gouvernementale (ou qui accomplissent des actes gouvernementaux) dans les faits, le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et les provinces pourraient facilement se soustraire aux obligations que la Charte leur impose en octroyant certains de leurs pouvoirs \u00e0 d\u2019autres entit\u00e9s et en leur faisant ex\u00e9cuter des fonctions ou appliquer des politiques qui sont, en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, gouvernementales. Autrement dit, le Parlement, les l\u00e9gislatures provinciales et la branche ex\u00e9cutive des gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou provinciaux n\u2019auraient qu\u2019\u00e0 cr\u00e9er des organismes distincts d\u2019eux et \u00e0 leur conf\u00e9rer le pouvoir d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter des fonctions gouvernementales pour \u00e9chapper aux contraintes que la Charte impose \u00e0 leurs activit\u00e9s. De toute \u00e9vidence, cette fa\u00e7on de faire r\u00e9duirait indirectement la port\u00e9e de la protection pr\u00e9vue par la Charte d\u2019une mani\u00e8re que le l\u00e9gislateur pourrait difficilement avoir voulue et entra\u00eenerait des cons\u00e9quences pour le moins ind\u00e9sirables. En effet, compte tenu de leur importance fondamentale, les droits garantis par la Charte doivent \u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9s contre toute tentative visant \u00e0 en r\u00e9duire ind\u00fbment la port\u00e9e ou \u00e0 \u00e9chapper compl\u00e8tement aux obligations qui en d\u00e9coulent. [Nous soulignons; par. 48.]\n(Voir aussi Eldridge c. Colombie\u2011Britannique (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), [1997] 3 R.C.S. 624, par. 42.)\n[254] Ce passage tir\u00e9 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Godbout exprime la pr\u00e9occupation fondamentale que des arrangements institutionnels servent de m\u00e9canisme pour contourner l\u2019examen fond\u00e9 sur la Charte dont fait l\u2019objet l\u2019action gouvernementale. Pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette pr\u00e9occupation, le c\u0153ur de l\u2019analyse s\u2019attache toujours \u00e0 la pr\u00e9servation des droits garantis par la Charte, et non aux entit\u00e9s particuli\u00e8res \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es au par. 32(1). Voil\u00e0 pourquoi \u00ab la Charte s\u2019applique non seulement au Parlement, aux l\u00e9gislatures et au gouvernement lui\u2011m\u00eame, mais aussi \u00e0 tous les domaines relevant d\u2019eux \u00bb (Greater Vancouver Transportation Authority c. F\u00e9d\u00e9ration canadienne des \u00e9tudiantes et \u00e9tudiants \u2014 Section Colombie\u2011Britannique, 2009 CSC 31, [2009] 2 R.C.S. 295, par. 14 (nous soulignons)). Autrement dit, l\u2019action gouvernementale qui vise des \u00ab domaines relevant \u00bb du Parlement et des l\u00e9gislatures provinciales \u2014 les chefs de comp\u00e9tence pr\u00e9vus aux art. 91 \u00e0 95 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 \u2014 est assujettie \u00e0 un examen fond\u00e9 sur la Charte. Il en est ainsi quel que soit le lien de l\u2019entit\u00e9 avec la structure gouvernementale f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ou provinciale officielle.\n[255] La port\u00e9e du par. 32(1), quoique large, n\u2019est nullement illimit\u00e9e. L\u2019action priv\u00e9e non gouvernementale n\u2019est pas assujettie \u00e0 la Charte \u2014 le par. 32(1) ne vise pas [traduction] \u00ab [les rapports] entre particuliers \u00bb (Hogg et Wright, \u00a7 37:13; voir aussi Dolphin Delivery, p. 597; Spence, par. 125). Il ne suffit pas non plus qu\u2019\u00ab une entit\u00e9 exerce ce qu\u2019on peut librement appeler une \u201cfonction publique\u201d \u00bb ou qu\u2019\u00ab une activit\u00e9 particuli\u00e8re puisse \u00eatre dite de nature \u201cpublique\u201d \u00bb (Eldridge, par. 43; voir aussi McKinney, p. 268\u2011269). L\u2019entit\u00e9 ou activit\u00e9 en question doit plut\u00f4t \u00eatre de nature gouvernementale.\n(2) Le cadre \u00e9tabli dans Eldridge pour d\u00e9terminer l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 de la Charte\n[256] Le cadre \u00e9tabli dans Eldridge traite de l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 de la Charte au regard du par. 32(1). Selon ce cadre, une entit\u00e9 peut \u00eatre assujettie \u00e0 la Charte de deux mani\u00e8res (par. 44). Tout d\u2019abord, une entit\u00e9 est assujettie \u00e0 la Charte si elle est \u00ab gouvernementale \u00bb au sens du par. 32(1) \u2014 soit de par sa nature m\u00eame, soit en raison du degr\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le gouvernemental dont elle fait l\u2019objet. Si l\u2019entit\u00e9 appartient \u00e0 cette cat\u00e9gorie, toutes ses activit\u00e9s seront examin\u00e9es au regard de la Charte. Ensuite, lorsqu\u2019une entit\u00e9 n\u2019est pas \u00ab gouvernementale \u00bb, mais se livre \u00e0 une activit\u00e9 \u00ab de nature \u201cgouvernementale\u201d \u00bb, elle fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un examen fond\u00e9 sur la Charte relativement \u00e0 cette activit\u00e9.\n[257] Au premier volet du cadre de l\u2019arr\u00eat Eldridge, le tribunal se demande si une entit\u00e9 est gouvernementale \u00ab de par sa nature m\u00eame \u00bb ou parce que le gouvernement exerce un contr\u00f4le substantiel sur elle (par. 44; voir aussi Greater Vancouver Transportation Authority, par. 16). Dans Godbout, le juge La Forest a fait remarquer que les \u00ab facteurs permettant de conclure \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de \u201cfonctions gouvernementales\u201d laissent peu de place \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e0 priori \u00bb, mais il a ensuite dress\u00e9 une liste non exhaustive d\u2019indices d\u2019un gouvernement par nature (par. 49\u201151). Subsidiairement, les entit\u00e9s \u00ab enti\u00e8rement contr\u00f4l\u00e9[es] par le gouvernement \u00bb et qui sont \u00ab essentiellement des \u00e9manations de la l\u00e9gislature [. . .] qui les [a] cr\u00e9\u00e9[es] \u00bb sont \u00e9galement gouvernementales selon le premier volet (par. 47; voir aussi Douglas\/Kwantlen Faculty Assn. c. Douglas College, [1990] 3 R.C.S. 570, p. 584; Lavigne, p. 241\u2011242).\n[258] Au second volet du cadre de l\u2019arr\u00eat Eldridge, on s\u2019attache \u00e0 la \u00ab qualit\u00e9 de l\u2019acte \u00bb et \u00e0 la question de savoir s\u2019il est r\u00e9ellement \u00ab gouvernemental \u00bb (par. 44). Le juge La Forest a cit\u00e9 \u00ab la mise en \u0153uvre d\u2019un r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gal ou d\u2019un programme gouvernemental donn\u00e9 \u00bb comme exemple d\u2019activit\u00e9 gouvernementale soumise \u00e0 un examen fond\u00e9 sur la Charte (par. 44).\n[259] Le cadre de l\u2019arr\u00eat Eldridge pr\u00e9voit donc deux raisons pour lesquelles une entit\u00e9 peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e gouvernementale. Le premier volet de ce cadre concerne la nature de l\u2019entit\u00e9; le deuxi\u00e8me concerne la nature de l\u2019activit\u00e9 (Greater Vancouver Transportation Authority, par. 16). Dans les deux cas, la Charte s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019action gouvernementale.\n(3) Le cadre \u00e9tabli dans Eldridge et les gouvernements autochtones\n[260] \u00c0 l\u2019instar des juges Kasirer et Jamal, nous reconnaissons que la VGFN rel\u00e8ve du premier volet du cadre de l\u2019arr\u00eat Eldridge, car elle est gouvernementale par nature. Nous nous demandons toutefois si les cat\u00e9gories existantes sont ad\u00e9quates dans le cas de nations autochtones autonomes, et nous rejetons l\u2019id\u00e9e que le statut gouvernemental de la VGFN repose sur la d\u00e9l\u00e9gation du pouvoir d\u2019un autre ordre de gouvernement.\n[261] Comme nous l\u2019avons not\u00e9, la jurisprudence actuelle contient des affirmations g\u00e9n\u00e9rales et instructives \u00e0 propos de l\u2019objet du par. 32(1). Toutefois, il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas question dans cette jurisprudence du contexte distinct des gouvernements autochtones; elle traitait plut\u00f4t d\u2019autres circonstances distinctes. Les crit\u00e8res juridiques con\u00e7us pour d\u00e9terminer si les municipalit\u00e9s, universit\u00e9s ou h\u00f4pitaux doivent respecter la Charte d\u00e9coulent du contexte factuel qui leur est propre et r\u00e9pondent forc\u00e9ment \u00e0 ce contexte. Ils ne doivent pas \u00eatre per\u00e7us comme une r\u00e9ponse compl\u00e8te concernant l\u2019\u00e9tendue de l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 de la Charte aux nations autochtones autonomes. Les principes formul\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019entit\u00e9s enti\u00e8rement cr\u00e9\u00e9es par le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou un gouvernement provincial sont incomplets et se pr\u00eatent mal \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9valuation du pouvoir l\u00e9gislatif des premiers habitants du Canada.\n[262] Diff\u00e9rentes consid\u00e9rations entrent en jeu pour ce qui est des gouvernements autochtones \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019ils forment un \u00e9l\u00e9ment fondateur du tissu constitutionnel canadien. Au fil du temps, les gouvernements et les tribunaux ont constat\u00e9 que les questions de droit concernant les peuples autochtones font appel fr\u00e9quemment \u00e0 des consid\u00e9rations, concepts juridiques et points de vue vari\u00e9s, compte tenu du fait qu\u2019ils sont les premiers habitants du Canada. L\u2019analogie avec la jurisprudence actuelle qui identifie des entit\u00e9s gouvernementales est partielle et imparfaite lorsqu\u2019on l\u2019applique aux nations autochtones autonomes. Il ne convient pas de greffer des conditions limites au par. 32(1) lorsque cela ralentirait la croissance de ce qui \u00e9tait cens\u00e9 \u00eatre une constitution vivante, r\u00e9paratrice et adapt\u00e9e. Bien que notre Cour n\u2019ait pas encore reconnu pleinement un droit ancestral inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale, le par. 32(1) ne devrait pas recevoir une interpr\u00e9tation qui g\u00eanerait la reconnaissance d\u2019un tel droit avant que la question ne soit tranch\u00e9e.\n[263] Les approches du pouvoir d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 ou du contr\u00f4le substantiel employ\u00e9es dans Eldridge et McKinney ne sont donc pas particuli\u00e8rement utiles pour \u00e9valuer l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 de la Charte \u00e0 la VGFN. La recherche d\u2019une forme de pouvoir d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 par le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou un gouvernement provincial ne respecte pas le r\u00f4le historique et int\u00e9gral des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s autochtones au Canada et ne tient pas compte du contexte moderne des nations autochtones autonomes.\n[264] Les peuples autochtones formaient des entit\u00e9s autonomes avant l\u2019arriv\u00e9e des colons europ\u00e9ens, et ils continuent de se gouverner eux\u2011m\u00eames \u00e0 ce jour (S. Grammond, \u00ab Treaties as Constitutional Agreements \u00bb, dans P. Oliver, P. Macklem et N. Des Rosiers, dir., The Oxford Handbook of the Canadian Constitution (2017), 305, p. 314). Les pratiques de longue date des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s autochtones en mati\u00e8re d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale sont bien \u00e9tablies dans la jurisprudence de notre Cour : \u00ab Bien avant que les Europ\u00e9ens explorent l\u2019Am\u00e9rique du Nord et s\u2019y installent, les peuples autochtones occupaient et utilisaient la plus grande partie de ce vaste territoire en soci\u00e9t\u00e9s organis\u00e9es et distinctives poss\u00e9dant leurs propres structures sociales et politiques \u00bb (Mitchell c. M.R.N., 2001 CSC 33, [2001] 1 R.C.S. 911, par. 9; voir aussi Nation ha\u00efda c. Colombie\u2011Britannique (Ministre des For\u00eats), 2004 CSC 73, [2004] 3 R.C.S. 511, par. 25). La \u00ab relation particuli\u00e8re \u00bb entre les peuples autochtones et la Couronne repose sur ces pratiques de longue date et la reconnaissance des institutions autochtones qui existaient avant l\u2019affirmation par la Couronne de sa souverainet\u00e9 (Beckman c. Premi\u00e8re nation de Little Salmon\/Carmacks, 2010 CSC 53, [2010] 3 R.C.S. 103, par. 122, la juge Deschamps, motifs concordants; Manitoba Metis Federation Inc. c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2013 CSC 14, [2013] 1 R.C.S. 623, par. 67).\n[265] La reconnaissance de nations autochtones autonomes en tant que gouvernements \u00e0 part enti\u00e8re et non en raison d\u2019un pouvoir d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 rel\u00e8ve nettement du par. 32(1) ainsi que de l\u2019objet de la Charte. Chose importante, elle fait respecter les pratiques autochtones de longue date en mati\u00e8re d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale et favorise la r\u00e9conciliation au Canada. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que la mesure attaqu\u00e9e d\u00e9coule d\u2019un pouvoir conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, provinciale ou territoriale pour qu\u2019elle soit soumise \u00e0 un examen fond\u00e9 sur la Charte. L\u2019accent que les juges majoritaires mettent sur le fait que la VGFN tient au moins une partie de son pouvoir l\u00e9gislatif d\u2019une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019accorde pas un poids suffisant \u00e0 la nature de la VGFN comme gouvernement ind\u00e9pendant.\n[266] Nous rejetons donc l\u2019id\u00e9e qu\u2019un facteur essentiel \u00e0 l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 de la Charte au regard du par. 32(1) est le fait que le pouvoir l\u00e9gislatif de la VGFN \u00e9mane du Parlement. Nous reconnaissons que les juges Kasirer et Jamal prennent bien soin de respecter la position de nations autochtones autonomes comme la VGFN : ils soulignent que la VGFN n\u2019est pas contr\u00f4l\u00e9e par le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou celui du Yukon \u00e0 l\u2019aune du volet \u00ab contr\u00f4le \u00bb (par. 76), que les Vuntut Gwitchin se gouvernent eux\u2011m\u00eames depuis des temps imm\u00e9moriaux (par. 82), que le Parlement peut reconna\u00eetre un gouvernement autochtone \u00e0 qui il conf\u00e8re un pouvoir l\u00e9gislatif en vertu du par. 91(24) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 sans cr\u00e9er ce gouvernement autochtone (par. 83), et qu\u2019il ne faut pas consid\u00e9rer que les motifs laissent entendre que la VGFN s\u2019apparente \u00e0 une municipalit\u00e9 (par. 88). Ils estiment n\u00e9anmoins que \u00ab la VGFN exerce des pouvoirs que le Parlement aurait autrement exerc\u00e9s en vertu de la comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative qu\u2019il d\u00e9tient en vertu du par. 91(24) \u00bb (par. 82), et accordent une grande importance \u00e0 la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 et \u00e0 la loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale comme sources du pouvoir de la VGFN d\u2019instaurer l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence. Par exemple, ils affirment au par. 91 :\nNous concluons que la Charte s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence \u00e9dict\u00e9e par la VGFN seulement dans la mesure o\u00f9 cette obligation d\u00e9coule de l\u2019exercice du pouvoir de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer en vertu du par. 91(24) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867. Nous ne faisons pas de commentaires sur la question de savoir si l\u2019exercice d\u2019un droit inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale non rattach\u00e9 \u00e0 une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale serait assujetti \u00e0 la Charte, car nous estimons qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de trancher cette question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, compte tenu des arrangements en mati\u00e8re d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale en cause. [Nous soulignons.]\n[267] L\u2019importance accord\u00e9e \u00e0 la d\u00e9l\u00e9gation au titre du par. 91(24) ne t\u00e9moigne pas de la situation unique des nations autochtones autonomes et n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire au regard du premier volet du crit\u00e8re de l\u2019arr\u00eat Eldridge pour qu\u2019une entit\u00e9 comme la VGFN fasse l\u2019objet d\u2019un examen fond\u00e9 sur la Charte. Les nations autochtones autonomes ne sont peut-\u00eatre pas express\u00e9ment mentionn\u00e9es au par. 32(1), mais elles traitent de \u00ab domaines \u00bb qui le sont, et il faut appliquer cet article de mani\u00e8re t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique et large de sorte que la protection de la Charte s\u2019applique \u00e0 tous.\n(4) La Charte s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019action gouvernementale relativement \u00e0 des \u00ab domaines relevant \u00bb du Parlement et des l\u00e9gislatures provinciales\n[268] Il importe de souligner que le par. 32(1) a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9 alors que le Parlement, les l\u00e9gislatures provinciales et les entit\u00e9s qui leur \u00e9taient subordonn\u00e9es formaient tout l\u2019univers l\u00e9gislatif. Ces organes \u00e9taient les modalit\u00e9s de l\u2019exercice de toute comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative au Canada. Les peuples autochtones n\u2019\u00e9taient pas reconnus comme \u00e9tant autonomes, et ils n\u2019\u00e9taient souvent pas consult\u00e9s lors de la prise de d\u00e9cisions l\u00e9gislatives. Les mentions de la \u00ab d\u00e9l\u00e9g[ation] \u00bb de pouvoir (Eldridge, par. 42), de l\u2019\u00ab appareil \u00bb gouvernemental (McKinney, p. 275), ou du fait que le Parlement et les l\u00e9gislatures provinciales ont \u00ab cr\u00e9[\u00e9] \u00bb certaines entit\u00e9s (Godbout, par. 47\u201148) devraient \u00eatre situ\u00e9es dans ce contexte. Les ententes d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale qui reconnaissent et confirment le pouvoir l\u00e9gislatif des communaut\u00e9s autochtones, telle l\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale de la VGFN, ont fait leur apparition plus tard.\n[269] Les arr\u00eats Eldridge, Godbout, ainsi que les autres d\u00e9cisions connexes, ne devraient pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s comme imposant la condition qu\u2019un pouvoir soit d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 par le Parlement ou les l\u00e9gislatures provinciales pour que la Charte s\u2019applique. La mention de ces organes t\u00e9moigne plut\u00f4t de l\u2019intention que tout le champ l\u00e9gislatif \u2014 \u00ab tous les domaines relevant \u00bb du Parlement et des l\u00e9gislatures provinciales \u2014 soit couvert par la Charte. Sinon, les particuliers seraient priv\u00e9s de protections essentielles dans des cas de d\u00e9s\u00e9quilibre des forces entre les gouvern\u00e9s et les gouvernants. Cela reviendrait \u00e0 sanctionner des zones soustraites \u00e0 l\u2019application de la Charte.\n[270] La port\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du par. 32(1) trouve \u00e9galement appui dans d\u2019autres dispositions de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982. Par exemple, le par. 52(1) dispose que \u00ab [l]a Constitution du Canada est la loi supr\u00eame du Canada; elle rend inop\u00e9rantes les dispositions incompatibles de toute autre r\u00e8gle de droit. \u00bb Nous ne partageons pas l\u2019avis de Mme Dickson, du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l\u2019Alberta et du gouvernement du Yukon selon lequel le par. 52(1) traite du champ d\u2019application de la Charte. La disposition est de nature r\u00e9paratrice et habilite les tribunaux \u00e0 invalider un texte de loi (G. R\u00e9gimbald et D. Newman, The Law of the Canadian Constitution (2e \u00e9d. 2017), \u00a7 29.23). Comme l\u2019explique notre coll\u00e8gue le juge Rowe dans ses motifs, le par. 52(1) ne permet pas aux parties d\u2019\u00e9luder la question de savoir s\u2019il est possible d\u2019invoquer d\u2019embl\u00e9e la Charte. Cependant, conclure que la Charte ne s\u2019applique qu\u2019aux lois et aux mesures du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et des gouvernements provinciaux ou de leurs d\u00e9l\u00e9gataires serait incompatible avec la port\u00e9e r\u00e9paratrice du par. 52(1), vu que le libell\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du par. 52(1) engloberait ais\u00e9ment les lois adopt\u00e9es par une nation autochtone autonome.\n[271] En outre, nous souscrivons \u00e0 l\u2019argument du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada suivant lequel l\u2019insertion de l\u2019art. 25, qui pr\u00e9voit que les tribunaux doivent interpr\u00e9ter les droits et libert\u00e9s garantis par la Charte dans le respect de la position des peuples autochtones et de leurs droits uniques, est compatible avec l\u2019application de la Charte aux nations autochtones autonomes (voir aussi la Commission royale, vol. 2, p. 256 (selon qui l\u2019application de la Charte aux gouvernements autochtones est \u00ab fa\u00e7onn\u00e9e et pond\u00e9r\u00e9e par les dispositions obligatoires de l\u2019article 25 \u00bb)). Bien que ni le par. 52(1) ni l\u2019art. 25 n\u2019\u00e9largissent directement l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 de la Charte, ils fournissent des rep\u00e8res utiles sur la mani\u00e8re dont toute interpr\u00e9tation particuli\u00e8re du par. 32(1) s\u2019harmoniserait avec l\u2019architecture interne de la Constitution du Canada.\n[272] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, la Charte s\u2019applique de mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 l\u2019action gouvernementale qui touche aux \u00ab domaines relevant \u00bb du Parlement et des l\u00e9gislatures provinciales. Tous les ordres de gouvernement sont vis\u00e9s. Cette interpr\u00e9tation s\u2019accorde avec, et fait respecter, l\u2019objet pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rant du par. 32(1), qui est de rem\u00e9dier au d\u00e9s\u00e9quilibre des forces entre les gouvern\u00e9s et les gouvernants. Interpr\u00e9ter le par. 32(1) et le cadre de l\u2019arr\u00eat Eldridge comme ne s\u2019appliquant que dans les cas de pouvoir d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 privil\u00e9gierait ind\u00fbment une conception trop textuelle du par. 32(1) et priverait les Autochtones des protections de la Charte lorsque leurs propres corps dirigeants violent leurs droits.\nB. Application du par. 32(1) \u00e0 la VGFN\n(1) La d\u00e9l\u00e9gation ne d\u00e9crit pas fid\u00e8lement la relation entre la Couronne et les nations autochtones autonomes\n[273] La reconnaissance et l\u2019acceptation de l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale pass\u00e9e et actuelle de la VGFN sont \u00e9videntes. Le pr\u00e9ambule de l\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale de la VGFN confirme que les \u00ab Gwitchin Vuntut disposent de structures traditionnelles de d\u00e9cision qu\u2019ils souhaitent conserver \u00bb. Il pr\u00e9cise que \u00ab les parties d\u00e9sirent appuyer et encourager les institutions et processus politiques de la premi\u00e8re nation des Gwitchin Vuntut, sous leur forme actuelle et future \u00bb. Le pr\u00e9ambule de la Constitution de la VGFN souligne que la Constitution est adopt\u00e9e pour favoriser la r\u00e9alisation du [traduction] \u00ab d\u00e9si[r] d\u2019exercer notre droit inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale \u00bb.\n[274] L\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale de la VGFN a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnue et confirm\u00e9e par des lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et territoriale (Loi sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale des premi\u00e8res nations du Yukon, L.C. 1994, c. 35; Loi sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale des Premi\u00e8res nations du Yukon, L.R.Y. 2002, c. 90). L\u2019objet d\u00e9clar\u00e9 de la loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale est de \u00ab donner effet aux accords \u00bb d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale conclus avec les nations autochtones, dont la VGFN (art. 4 et par. 5(1)). La loi territoriale pr\u00e9voit notamment l\u2019approbation des ententes d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale, notamment celle de la VGFN, et la reconnaissance du fait que ces ententes ont \u00ab force de loi \u00bb (art. 1 et 2).\n[275] La reconnaissance l\u00e9gislative des pouvoirs de la VGFN en mati\u00e8re d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale ne transforme pas ceux\u2011ci en pouvoirs d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s. Les lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et territoriale confirment les pouvoirs d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale pr\u00e9vus dans les ententes et, comme le dit la VGFN, [traduction] \u00ab cr\u00e9[ent] un espace pour leur exercice concret et contemporain gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la reconnaissance juridique du Canada et du Yukon \u00bb (m.i., par. 51 (note en bas de page omise)). Nous souscrivons \u00e0 l\u2019argument de Mme Dickson que cette reconnaissance l\u00e9gale [traduction] \u00ab ne change en rien le fait que [la] VGFN est une collectivit\u00e9 autochtone titulaire de droits au Canada \u00bb qui a observ\u00e9 ses propres traditions juridiques avant la colonisation europ\u00e9enne et continue de le faire (m.i. au pourvoi incident, par. 34). Vu les pratiques pass\u00e9es et actuelles des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s autochtones en mati\u00e8re d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale, il serait inappropri\u00e9 de qualifier l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale autochtone de pouvoir d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9.\n[276] Comme nous l\u2019avons expliqu\u00e9, toutefois, le fait qu\u2019une entit\u00e9 exerce un pouvoir d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 par le Parlement ou une l\u00e9gislature provinciale n\u2019est pas une condition pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 de la Charte. Nous n\u2019avons donc pas \u00e0 nous attarder davantage sur la source du pouvoir d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale autochtone. Selon le premier volet du cadre de l\u2019arr\u00eat Eldridge, la Charte s\u2019applique plut\u00f4t \u00e0 l\u2019action gouvernementale qui touche aux \u00ab domaines relevant \u00bb du Parlement et des l\u00e9gislatures provinciales. Il s\u2019agit essentiellement de savoir si la VGFN, en tant qu\u2019entit\u00e9, est un gouvernement de par sa nature m\u00eame.\n(2) La VGFN est un gouvernement de par sa nature m\u00eame\n[277] Nous n\u2019h\u00e9sitons aucunement \u00e0 conclure que la VGFN est assujettie \u00e0 la Charte. Elle est intrins\u00e8quement gouvernementale. La longue histoire de la VGFN renforce son caract\u00e8re gouvernemental; comme l\u2019a soulign\u00e9 le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, [traduction] \u00ab [l]es Vuntut Gwitchin formaient une entit\u00e9 politique avant l\u2019affirmation de la souverainet\u00e9 britannique, et ils se gouvernent eux\u2011m\u00eames conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 leurs propres lois depuis des temps imm\u00e9moriaux \u00bb (2020 YKSC 22, 461 C.R.R. (2d) 230, par. 11).\n[278] Une foule de facteurs pertinents d\u00e9montrent que la VGFN est de nature gouvernementale. Par exemple, le Conseil de la VGFN est d\u00e9mocratiquement \u00e9lu, a le pouvoir de lever des imp\u00f4ts et poss\u00e8de de vastes pouvoirs l\u00e9gislatifs \u2014 lesquels ont tous \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crits par le juge La Forest dans Godbout comme des indices non exhaustifs d\u2019un gouvernement (par. 51; voir aussi l\u2019Entente d\u00e9finitive de la premi\u00e8re nation des Gwitchin Vuntut (1993), ch. 24; Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale de la VGFN, art. 13.0; Loi sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale des premi\u00e8res nations du Yukon (Can.), art. 11 et ann. III). La VGFN dispose \u00e9galement du pouvoir exclusif de r\u00e9gir ses affaires internes (Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale de la VGFN, art. 13.1). Cela comprend l\u2019\u00e9diction de l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence elle\u2011m\u00eame \u2014 une mesure l\u00e9gislative qui a une incidence sur les droits des membres en restreignant la participation d\u00e9mocratique. De plus, la VGFN peut \u00e9dicter des lois applicables au Yukon relativement \u00e0 une vaste gamme de mati\u00e8res qui touchent la vie quotidienne de ses citoyens, comme les soins de sant\u00e9, l\u2019\u00e9ducation, l\u2019adoption et la protection de l\u2019enfance, la c\u00e9l\u00e9bration de mariages ainsi que l\u2019administration des successions (art. 13.2). Elle est habilit\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer sur des mati\u00e8res de nature locale ou priv\u00e9e sur les terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es, des mati\u00e8res qui, selon l\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale de la VGFN, s\u2019entendent notamment de l\u2019administration de la justice, l\u2019utilisation des terres, l\u2019expropriation de terres, la protection des poissons, de la faune et de leur habitat, la protection de l\u2019environnement, les v\u00e9hicules, les couvre\u2011feux et la pr\u00e9vention de l\u2019inconduite, la sant\u00e9 publique, l\u2019ordre public et d\u2019autres \u00ab question[s] relative[s] \u00e0 la bonne administration des citoyens sur les terres vis\u00e9es par le r\u00e8glement \u00bb (art. 13.3).\n[279] L\u2019imposant arsenal de pouvoirs l\u00e9gislatifs dont dispose la VGFN touche \u00e0 des \u00ab domaines relevant \u00bb du Parlement et des l\u00e9gislatures provinciales, ainsi que le pr\u00e9voit le par. 32(1). Comme le souligne le Congr\u00e8s des peuples autochtones, bon nombre des services offerts par la VGFN \u00e0 titre de nation autochtone autonome ressortiraient, en son absence, \u00e0 d\u2019autres ordres de gouvernement (m. interv., par. 8). Bien qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse d\u2019une diff\u00e9rente modalit\u00e9 de l\u2019exercice de la comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative, l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de la VGFN en tant que nation autochtone autonome ne touche ou ne lie pas moins ses citoyens et n\u2019est pas moins susceptible de restreindre les droits que leur garantit la Charte.\n[280] La structure et les fonctions de la VGFN refl\u00e8tent son caract\u00e8re intrins\u00e8quement gouvernemental : elle adopte des lois et prend des d\u00e9cisions qui favorisent, ordonnent et restreignent la vie de ses citoyens. Nous concluons par cons\u00e9quent que la VGFN est un gouvernement de par sa nature m\u00eame. Son \u00e9diction de l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence doit faire l\u2019objet d\u2019un examen fond\u00e9 sur la Charte.\nC. Conclusion sur le par. 32(1)\n[281] [traduction] \u00ab La Charte est un instrument d\u2019\u00e9dification du pays \u00bb (J. Harrington, \u00ab Interpreting the Charter \u00bb, dans Oliver, Macklem et Des Rosiers, The Oxford Handbook of the Canadian Constitution, 621, p. 622). Elle visait \u00e0 solidifier une identit\u00e9 nationale et \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger les droits et libert\u00e9s individuels contre l\u2019intervention du gouvernement. Cet objet s\u2019accorde avec son application aux nations autochtones autonomes, y compris la VGFN. Tous les ordres de gouvernement au Canada sont tenus de faire respecter les protections de la Charte, car ces protections repr\u00e9sentent une partie int\u00e9grante de la relation entre les gouvern\u00e9s et les gouvernants. Toute interpr\u00e9tation plus \u00e9troite du par. 32(1) risque de faire appara\u00eetre des zones soustraites \u00e0 l\u2019application de la Charte, et compromettrait l\u2019\u00e9quilibre que vise \u00e0 atteindre la cr\u00e9ation de droits consacr\u00e9s dans la Constitution au Canada.\n[282] On peut consid\u00e9rer que le par. 32(1) reconna\u00eet l\u2019\u00e9volution politique et constitutionnelle qui s\u2019est op\u00e9r\u00e9e au chapitre de l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale autochtone. Les nations autochtones comme la VGFN se gouvernent elles\u2011m\u00eames depuis des temps imm\u00e9moriaux, et nos motifs confirment que, quelle que soit la source de leurs pouvoirs d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale, les nations autochtones autonomes sont assujetties \u00e0 la Charte selon le par. 32(1) et conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 un cadre modifi\u00e9 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Eldridge lorsqu\u2019elles se livrent \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s gouvernementales.\nIII. Article 25 de la Charte\n[283] La place qu\u2019occupent les peuples autochtones dans la Constitution et l\u2019application de la Charte \u00e0 eux font intervenir une s\u00e9rie de consid\u00e9rations sp\u00e9ciales. Si la Charte prot\u00e8ge avant tout les droits individuels, les peuples autochtones ont \u00e9galement des droits et int\u00e9r\u00eats collectifs, y compris un titre collectif sur des terres (Nation Tsilhqot\u2019in c. Colombie\u2011Britannique, 2014 CSC 44, [2014] 2 R.C.S. 257) et le droit \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale reconnu dans la D\u00e9claration des Nations Unies sur les droits des peuples autochtones (Doc. N.U. A\/RES\/61\/295, 2 octobre 2007 (\u00ab DNUDPA \u00bb), articles 3 et 4; voir aussi la Loi sur la D\u00e9claration des Nations Unies sur les droits des peuples autochtones, L.C. 2021, c. 14). Bien qu\u2019elles constituent les premiers peuples au Canada, les diverses nations \u2014 m\u00eame prises ensemble \u2014 forment actuellement une minorit\u00e9 au sein de la population et de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadiennes. Elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9, et continuent d\u2019\u00eatre, soumises aux forces du colonialisme de mani\u00e8res qui les distinguent d\u2019autres groupes prot\u00e9g\u00e9s et reconnus par la Charte. L\u2019article 25 joue un r\u00f4le distinct de celui d\u2019autres dispositions de la Charte, ayant pour effet de pr\u00e9server une forme de droit collectif propre aux peuples autochtones au Canada tout en reconnaissant que, lorsque les gouvernements autochtones \u00e9tablissent des distinctions entre leurs citoyens, comme le font tous les gouvernements, les particuliers et minorit\u00e9s au sein du groupe devraient n\u00e9anmoins b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de toutes les protections de la Charte ench\u00e2ss\u00e9es dans la Constitution.\n[284] Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, c\u2019est la premi\u00e8re fois qu\u2019une majorit\u00e9 de notre Cour se penche sur l\u2019art. 25, dont voici le texte :\n25 Le fait que la pr\u00e9sente charte garantit certains droits et libert\u00e9s ne porte pas atteinte aux droits ou libert\u00e9s \u2014 ancestraux, issus de trait\u00e9s ou autres \u2014 des peuples autochtones du Canada, notamment :\na) aux droits ou libert\u00e9s reconnus par la proclamation royale du 7 octobre 1763;\nb) aux droits ou libert\u00e9s existants issus d\u2019accords sur des revendications territoriales ou ceux susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre ainsi acquis.\nLes deux principaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de l\u2019art. 25 qu\u2019il faut interpr\u00e9ter dans le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi ont trait \u00e0 son application et \u00e0 sa port\u00e9e. Premi\u00e8rement, compte tenu de son texte, de son contexte et de son objet, de quelle mani\u00e8re fonctionne l\u2019art. 25 et de quelle fa\u00e7on un tribunal devrait\u2011il r\u00e9soudre une difficult\u00e9 pos\u00e9e par les droits susceptibles de s\u2019opposer envisag\u00e9s par la disposition? Deuxi\u00e8mement, quels droits sont vis\u00e9s par les \u00ab droits ou libert\u00e9s \u2014 ancestraux, issus de trait\u00e9s ou autres \u2014 des peuples autochtones du Canada \u00bb?\n[285] Nous adoptons un point de vue diff\u00e9rent de ce que proposent les juges Kasirer et Jamal au sujet du fonctionnement de l\u2019art. 25 et de la port\u00e9e des droits et libert\u00e9s vis\u00e9s par la disposition. \u00c0 notre avis, une interpr\u00e9tation t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique de l\u2019art. 25 m\u00e8ne \u00e0 la conclusion qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un outil d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation, et non d\u2019un bouclier imp\u00e9n\u00e9trable. De plus, les droits relevant de l\u2019art. 25 se limitent \u00e0 ceux propres aux peuples autochtones parce qu\u2019ils sont des Autochtones et ne s\u2019\u00e9tendent pas \u00e0 tous les domaines o\u00f9 les gouvernements autochtones peuvent agir. Cette conception \u00e9vite que l\u2019art. 25 serve \u00e0 cr\u00e9er en fait de vastes zones soustraites \u00e0 l\u2019application de la Charte dans le contexte de l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale autochtone, ce qui priverait les peuples autochtones de la protection des droits fondamentaux et mettrait les gouvernements \u00e0 l\u2019abri [traduction] \u00ab des droits et libert\u00e9s minimaux \u00e9tablis dans la Charte \u00bb (m. interv., Canadian Constitution Foundation, par. 17). Bien que nos analyses divergent, nous estimons que le constitutionnalisme canadien en est un o\u00f9 les id\u00e9es contradictoires sont non pas une faille \u00e0 corriger, mais plut\u00f4t essentielles \u00e0 notre d\u00e9mocratie constitutionnelle (voir J. Webber, The Constitution of Canada : A Contextual Analysis (2e \u00e9d. 2021), p. 7\u20118).\nA. De quelle mani\u00e8re fonctionne l\u2019art. 25?\n[286] Les avis divergent sur l\u2019effet de l\u2019art. 25, et on se demande parfois si la disposition est un bouclier ou un prisme d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation. La VGFN plaide que l\u2019art. 25 fait enti\u00e8rement obstacle \u00e0 la demande de Mme Dickson fond\u00e9e sur la Charte, et que l\u2019objet de l\u2019art. 25 est la protection de l\u2019espace o\u00f9 s\u2019exercent les droits ancestraux, issus de trait\u00e9s ou autres \u2014 [traduction] \u00ab non la mise en balance ou la r\u00e9conciliation \u00bb (m.i, par. 103\u2011104 et 122). Madame Dickson soutient pour sa part que l\u2019art. 25 ne fait pas office de bouclier automatique contre l\u2019examen fond\u00e9 sur la Charte, mais envisage plut\u00f4t une certaine mise en balance du droit individuel garanti par la Charte et du droit autochtone collectif (m.a., par. 92 et 97).\n[287] \u00c0 notre avis, l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation est indispensable \u00e0 une analyse relative \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25. Nous souscrivons \u00e0 la th\u00e8se de Mme Dickson et de certains intervenants selon laquelle la [traduction] \u00ab \u201cm\u00e9thode du bouclier\u201d [. . .] constitue un choix \u00e0 faire qui simplifie \u00e0 l\u2019exc\u00e8s le d\u00e9bat \u00e0 propos de l\u2019interaction entre les droits collectifs et les droits individuels \u00bb (m. interv., p.g. Canada, par. 36). Pour les motifs qui suivent, nous concluons qu\u2019il n\u2019est ni n\u00e9cessaire ni souhaitable, \u00e0 ce stade pr\u00e9liminaire de l\u2019application de l\u2019art. 25, de d\u00e9limiter des zones interdites \u00e0 la Charte r\u00e9sultant de la lev\u00e9e de boucliers.\n(1) Une interpr\u00e9tation t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique\n[288] Les dispositions de la Charte, dont l\u2019art. 25, doivent recevoir une interpr\u00e9tation t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique (Hunter, p. 156\u2011157). Le sens d\u2019une disposition se comprend \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des int\u00e9r\u00eats qu\u2019il est cens\u00e9 prot\u00e9ger. Au moment d\u2019\u00e9tablir l\u2019objet d\u2019une disposition de la Charte, le tribunal examine \u00ab la nature et [l]es objectifs plus larges de la Charte elle\u2011m\u00eame, [l]es termes choisis pour \u00e9noncer ce droit ou cette libert\u00e9, [l]es origines historiques des concepts ench\u00e2ss\u00e9s et, s\u2019il y a lieu, [. . .] [le] sens et [. . .] l\u2019objet des autres libert\u00e9s et droits particuliers qui s\u2019y rattachent selon le texte de la Charte \u00bb (R. c. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., [1985] 1 R.C.S. 295, p. 344). Une analyse t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique de l\u2019art. 25 comprend un examen de \u00ab la formulation, [de] la structure et [de] l\u2019historique du texte constitutionnel \u00bb (Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la Public Service Employee Relations Act (Alb.), [1987] 1 R.C.S. 313, p. 394, le juge McIntyre).\n[289] Comme nous l\u2019expliquons, le texte de l\u2019art. 25 ne dicte pas le r\u00e9sultat ni n\u2019aboutit \u00e0 une seule conclusion. Interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 justement, il peut \u00e9tayer l\u2019approche interpr\u00e9tative ou celle du bouclier. Nous sommes toutefois convaincues que l\u2019art. 25 \u00e9tait cens\u00e9 servir de prisme d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation compte tenu de sa nature, de son objet et de son historique. Cette approche est celle qui concorde le mieux avec la fa\u00e7on dont les droits oppos\u00e9s reconnus par la Charte sont mis en balance, et traduit le mieux les besoins de tous les Autochtones, les recommandations finales de la Commission royale ainsi que les droits ench\u00e2ss\u00e9s dans la DNUDPA. Elle ouvre une voie respectueuse et adapt\u00e9e \u00e0 un avenir o\u00f9 les droits garantis par la Charte et les conceptions autochtones des droits seront int\u00e9gr\u00e9s \u00e0 divers forums juridiques.\n(2) Le texte\n[290] D\u2019apr\u00e8s le texte de l\u2019art. 25, les droits individuels garantis par la Charte \u00ab ne porte[nt] pas atteinte aux droits ou libert\u00e9s \u2014 ancestraux, issus de trait\u00e9s ou autres \u2014 des peuples autochtones du Canada \u00bb.\n[291] Nous sommes d\u2019accord avec plusieurs choses que disent les juges Kasirer et Jamal \u00e0 propos du texte de l\u2019art. 25, \u00e0 savoir que :\n\u2022 Les versions fran\u00e7aise et anglaise des textes constitutionnels ont \u00ab \u00e9galement force de loi, en tant qu\u2019expressions de l\u2019intention exprim\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25 \u00bb (par. 121).\n\u2022 Il y a un sens commun v\u00e9hicul\u00e9 par les deux textes linguistiques qui illustre \u00e0 la fois un objectif de protection relativement au droit autochtone collectif et un exercice d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation auquel doit se livrer le tribunal \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des droits oppos\u00e9s (par. 124).\n\u2022 Les articles 21, 25, 26 et 29 de la Charte ont ceci en commun qu\u2019ils \u00ab visent \u00e0 sauvegarder et \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger des droits qui existent ind\u00e9pendamment de la Charte \u00bb (par. 129, citant K. M. Lysyk, \u00ab Les droits et libert\u00e9s des peuples autochtones du Canada \u00bb, dans G.\u2011A. Beaudoin et W. S. Tarnopolsky, dir., Charter canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s (1982), 591, p. 596).\n[292] \u00c0 notre avis, toutefois, le texte de l\u2019art. 25 n\u2019aide gu\u00e8re \u00e0 d\u00e9cider s\u2019il convient de privil\u00e9gier l\u2019approche interpr\u00e9tative ou celle du bouclier. Il ressort du texte que l\u2019insertion de l\u2019art. 25 visait \u00e0 emp\u00eacher qu\u2019il soit port\u00e9 atteinte \u00e0 certains droits autochtones collectifs, comme nous l\u2019expliquons plus en d\u00e9tail dans notre analyse de l\u2019objet et de l\u2019historique de la disposition. Ainsi que le font remarquer les juges Kasirer et Jamal, les mots \u00ab ne porte pas atteinte \u00bb et \u00ab shall not be construed \u00bb \u00e9voquent le caract\u00e8re obligatoire et d\u00e9claratoire de la disposition (par. 125). Nous souscrivons \u00e0 cette observation, mais cela n\u2019\u00e9carte pas l\u2019op\u00e9ration d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation prescrite par l\u2019art. 25 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des droits oppos\u00e9s en jeu. Autrement dit, le tribunal ne r\u00e8gle pas la question en concluant qu\u2019une demande fond\u00e9e sur la Charte met en cause un droit ancestral, issu de trait\u00e9 ou autre \u00ab des peuples autochtones du Canada \u00bb. Le tribunal doit tout de m\u00eame examiner la demande fond\u00e9e sur la Charte dans son contexte et essayer de mettre en balance ou de concilier les int\u00e9r\u00eats oppos\u00e9s en jeu.\n[293] Un examen de l\u2019objet et de l\u2019historique de l\u2019art. 25, la jurisprudence de notre Cour sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de droits constitutionnels oppos\u00e9s ainsi que d\u2019autres sources, dont le Rapport final de la Commission royale et la DNUDPA, se r\u00e9v\u00e8lent donc plus instructifs sur le fonctionnement et la port\u00e9e de l\u2019art. 25. Dans les sections qui suivent, nous d\u00e9montrons pourquoi ces sources \u00e9tayent l\u2019approche interpr\u00e9tative de la disposition.\n(3) L\u2019objet et l\u2019historique de l\u2019art. 25\n[294] L\u2019ench\u00e2ssement constitutionnel d\u2019une d\u00e9claration des droits au Canada en 1982 a marqu\u00e9 un tournant majeur dans la relation entre les particuliers et l\u2019\u00c9tat. La Charte permettrait que les actes du gouvernement soient examin\u00e9s par les tribunaux en fonction de leur conformit\u00e9 avec les protections des droits individuels. Une foule d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats individuels devaient \u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, notamment les libert\u00e9s fondamentales, les droits d\u00e9mocratiques, les droits juridiques et \u2014 chose importante \u2014 les droits \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9.\n[295] On a exprim\u00e9 la crainte qu\u2019il y ait une tension entre, d\u2019une part, la protection et la priorisation de droits individuels garantis par la Charte et, d\u2019autre part, la position, le statut et les droits sp\u00e9ciaux de certains groupes au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, bien des gens, y compris des gouvernements, communaut\u00e9s autochtones et autres int\u00e9ress\u00e9s, se sont mis \u00e0 r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir \u00e0 l\u2019incidence qu\u2019aurait une d\u00e9claration des droits ench\u00e2ss\u00e9e sur les droits collectifs uniques des peuples autochtones et les programmes con\u00e7us pour am\u00e9liorer leurs conditions. Par exemple, le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Saskatchewan, Roy Romanow, a dit ce qui suit \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de la Conf\u00e9rence f\u00e9d\u00e9rale-provinciale des premiers ministres sur la Constitution en 1978 :\n[traduction] En Saskatchewan, par exemple, depuis quelques ann\u00e9es d\u00e9j\u00e0, je crois que le gouvernement a effectivement fait preuve de discrimination, si je peux m\u2019exprimer ainsi [. . .]. R\u00e9cemment, nous avons sign\u00e9 un accord avec une grande soci\u00e9t\u00e9 mini\u00e8re en vue d\u2019un nouveau projet minier dans le nord de la Saskatchewan, et une condition de cet accord exige qu\u2019en 1982, cinquante pour cent des employ\u00e9s soient des r\u00e9sidents du Nord [. . .] dont la plupart seraient, par d\u00e9finition, des Indiens inscrits ou non. D\u00e9sormais, en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019une d\u00e9claration des droits ench\u00e2ss\u00e9e, si vous en jugez par l\u2019exp\u00e9rience am\u00e9ricaine, des politiques comme celles\u2011ci seraient invalid\u00e9es par les tribunaux au motif qu\u2019elles sont discriminatoires . . .\nAu Canada d\u2019aucuns soutiendraient, Monsieur le Premier Ministre, que notre plus grand besoin est d\u2019encourager des programmes d\u2019action positive pour r\u00e9parer certaines injustices sociales, et la charte propos\u00e9e, toute d\u00e9claration des droits en fait, pourrait rendre difficile l\u2019atteinte de cet objectif.\n(Conf\u00e9rence f\u00e9d\u00e9rale\u2011provinciale des premiers ministres sur la Constitution (s\u00e9ance de l\u2019apr\u00e8s\u2011midi du 30 octobre 1978), p. 157; voir aussi le m. interv., Canadian Constitution Foundation, par. 11\u201112.)\nEn d\u2019autres termes, la diff\u00e9rence autochtone serait\u2011elle sap\u00e9e par une conception formaliste de l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9?\n[296] Le premier ministre Pierre Trudeau a r\u00e9pondu que la pr\u00e9occupation du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Romanow li\u00e9e au fait d\u2019autoriser l\u2019action positive \u00e9tait r\u00e9gl\u00e9e par l\u2019art. 26 de ce qui \u00e9tait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque le projet de loi C\u201160, 3e sess., 30e l\u00e9g., 1978, qui proposait que :\nLa pr\u00e9sente Charte ne limite ni ne supprime les droits et libert\u00e9s qu\u2019elle ne reconna\u00eet pas express\u00e9ment et qui pouvaient exister lors de la prise d\u2019effet de la pr\u00e9sente loi, notamment les droits et libert\u00e9s qu\u2019ont pu acqu\u00e9rir les peuples autochtones du Canada par la Proclamation royale du 7 octobre 1763.\n(Voir aussi B. H. Wildsmith, Aboriginal peoples and Section 25 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (1988), p. 5.)\nBien que le projet de loi n\u2019ait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9, l\u2019essence de l\u2019art. 26 a \u00e9t\u00e9 int\u00e9gr\u00e9 \u00e0 des versions subs\u00e9quentes de l\u2019actuel art. 25 de la Charte.\n[297] Les d\u00e9bats l\u00e9gislatifs sur la r\u00e9forme constitutionnelle \u00e9clairent l\u2019objet de l\u2019art. 25. L\u2019ench\u00e2ssement des droits des peuples autochtones dans ce qui est d\u00e9sormais l\u2019art. 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 n\u2019\u00e9tait pas \u00e0 l\u2019ordre du jour au d\u00e9but du processus de rapatriement (voir J. M. Arbour, \u00ab The Protection of Aboriginal Rights within a Human Rights Regime : In Search of an Analytical Framework for Section 25 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms \u00bb (2003), 21 S.C.L.R. (2d) 3, p. 30\u201131). Toutefois, en octobre 1980, le premier ministre Trudeau s\u2019\u00e9tait engag\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de plusieurs dirigeants autochtones \u00e0 se servir de la Constitution comme outil pour mieux prot\u00e9ger leurs droits (D\u00e9bats de la Chambre des communes, vol. IV, 1re sess., 32e l\u00e9g., 17 octobre 1980, p. 3778). Plusieurs mois apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t du train de r\u00e9formes constitutionnelles au Parlement, le ministre de la Justice Jean Chr\u00e9tien a propos\u00e9 le 30 janvier 1981 un nouvel article, figurant dans la partie II de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 et \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de la Charte, qui reconna\u00eetrait et confirmerait les droits ancestraux ou issus de trait\u00e9s des peuples autochtones (Arbour, p. 33\u201134). Cet article a \u00e9t\u00e9 enlev\u00e9 en novembre 1981 \u00e0 la suite d\u2019autres n\u00e9gociations constitutionnelles que le ministre Chr\u00e9tien a d\u00e9crites comme \u00ab d\u00e9coul[ant] d\u2019un processus qui exigeait des compromis \u00bb (D\u00e9bats de la Chambre des communes, vol. XII, 1re sess., 32e l\u00e9g., 20 novembre 1981, p. 13045). Plus tard ce mois\u2011l\u00e0, un autre compromis a men\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9insertion de ce qui est maintenant l\u2019art. 35 pour prot\u00e9ger les \u00ab droits existants \u2014 ancestraux ou issus de trait\u00e9s \u2014 \u00bb des peuples autochtones (D\u00e9bats de la Chambre des communes, vol. XII, 1re sess., 32e l\u00e9g., 24 novembre 1981, p. 13202\u201113203 (nous soulignons); voir aussi Arbour, p. 35; Wildsmith, p. 7).\n[298] Pendant ce temps, des d\u00e9bats entourant ce qui est d\u00e9sormais l\u2019art. 25 avaient lieu dans l\u2019incertitude \u00e0 propos des droits ancestraux, s\u2019il en est, qui seraient constitutionnellement reconnus et confirm\u00e9s. Le sous\u2011ministre adjoint du minist\u00e8re de la Justice, Barry L. Strayer, a dit au Comit\u00e9 mixte sp\u00e9cial du S\u00e9nat et de la Chambre des communes sur la Constitution du Canada qu\u2019aux termes de l\u2019art. 25, \u00ab si ces droits existent r\u00e9ellement, ils continueront \u00e0 exister et la charte ne pourra pas y porter atteinte. Par cons\u00e9quent, on n\u2019essaie pas de d\u00e9terminer si ces droits existent ou n\u2019existent pas, on se contente de pr\u00e9ciser que s\u2019ils existent, la charte n\u2019y porte pas atteinte \u00bb (Proc\u00e8s\u2011verbaux et t\u00e9moignages du Comit\u00e9 mixte sp\u00e9cial du S\u00e9nat et de la Chambre des communes sur la Constitution du Canada, no 38, 1re sess., 32e l\u00e9g., 15 janvier 1981, p. 16 (nous soulignons)). Dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, le secr\u00e9taire parlementaire au ministre des Affaires indiennes et du D\u00e9veloppement du Nord, Ray Ch\u00e9nier, a expliqu\u00e9 l\u2019effet recherch\u00e9 par l\u2019art. 25 :\n. . . continue[r] d\u2019assurer la protection du mode de vie des autochtones en garantissant que les droits et libert\u00e9s des peuples indig\u00e8nes du Canada ne seront pas abrog\u00e9s par l\u2019introduction dans la charte de certains droits et libert\u00e9s visant l\u2019ensemble des Canadiens. Cet article est d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment vague.

V, 1re sess., 32e l\u00e9g., 20 novembre 1980, p. 4915; voir aussi Arbour, p. 31\u201132.)\n[299] Quand le ministre Chr\u00e9tien a \u00e9t\u00e9 interrog\u00e9 devant le Comit\u00e9 mixte sp\u00e9cial, il a expliqu\u00e9 que, de l\u2019avis du gouvernement, la Charte n\u2019aurait pas \u00ab d\u2019incidence \u00bb sur ces droits ni \u00ab [n\u2019]empi[\u00e8terait] sur [c]es droits \u00bb des peuples autochtones (Proc\u00e8s\u2011verbaux et t\u00e9moignages du Comit\u00e9 mixte sp\u00e9cial du S\u00e9nat et de la Chambre des communes sur la Constitution du Canada, no 49, 1re sess., 32e l\u00e9g., 30 janvier 1981, p. 94). Le ministre Chr\u00e9tien a indiqu\u00e9 ainsi que l\u2019art. 25 visait \u00e0 garantir que les droits individuels \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la Charte n\u2019emp\u00eachent pas les peuples autochtones d\u2019exercer leurs droits collectifs.\n[300] Un examen de la r\u00e9daction et de la n\u00e9gociation de la Charte r\u00e9v\u00e8le donc une [traduction] \u00ab d\u00e9marche de pr\u00e9servation des droits \u00bb dans le cas de l\u2019art. 25 \u2014 visant \u00e0 \u00e9viter que la Charte ne restreigne d\u2019autres droits existants, y compris les droits uniques d\u00e9tenus par les peuples autochtones (m. interv., p.g. Alberta, par. 24). En outre, d\u2019anciennes \u00e9bauches de l\u2019art. 25 fournissent des indications compl\u00e9mentaires \u00e0 l\u2019appui de cette approche. En octobre 1980, une \u00e9bauche de la disposition a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e \u00e0 la Chambre des communes et au S\u00e9nat. Elle est r\u00e9dig\u00e9e ainsi :\n. . . La pr\u00e9sente charte ne nie pas l\u2019existence des droits et libert\u00e9s qu\u2019elle ne garantit pas express\u00e9ment et qui existent au Canada, notamment les droits et libert\u00e9s des peuples autochtones du Canada.\n(La Constitution canadienne 1980 : Projet de r\u00e9solution concernant la Constitution du Canada (1980), p. 25)\n[301] De m\u00eame, le ministre Chr\u00e9tien a soumis en janvier 1981 au Comit\u00e9 mixte sp\u00e9cial une autre \u00e9bauche de dispositions, dont voici le texte :\n. . . Le fait que la pr\u00e9sente Charte garantit certains droits et libert\u00e9s ne constitue une n\u00e9gation :\na) ni des droits ou libert\u00e9s \u2014 ancestraux, issus de trait\u00e9s ou autres \u2014 que peuvent avoir les peuples autochtones du Canada, notamment des droits ou libert\u00e9s qui ont pu \u00eatre reconnus par la Proclamation royale du 7 octobre 1763;\nb) ni des autres droits ou libert\u00e9s qui peuvent exister au Canada.\n(Proc\u00e8s\u2011verbaux et t\u00e9moignages du Comit\u00e9 mixte sp\u00e9cial du S\u00e9nat et de la Chambre des communes sur la Constitution du Canada, no 36, 1re sess., 32e l\u00e9g., 12 janvier 1981, p. 18)\n[302] Ces deux \u00e9bauches de disposition ant\u00e9rieures tendent \u00e0 indiquer que le gouvernement souhaitait que la disposition emp\u00eache la revendication de droits individuels en vertu des articles applicables de la Charte de supprimer ou d\u2019\u00e9carter les droits autochtones collectifs. Les \u00e9bauches ne laissent pas croire que le gouvernement voulait que l\u2019art. 25 cr\u00e9e un bouclier imp\u00e9n\u00e9trable pour encercler les droits et libert\u00e9s ancestraux et cr\u00e9er des zones soustraites \u00e0 l\u2019application de la Charte dans certaines r\u00e9gions du pays. L\u2019article 25 a plut\u00f4t pour effet juridique d\u2019indiquer clairement que les droits et libert\u00e9s garantis dans la Charte ne doivent pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s comme minant les droits et libert\u00e9s accord\u00e9s aux peuples autochtones.\n[303] Trois conclusions importantes sur l\u2019objet de l\u2019art. 25 peuvent se d\u00e9gager des origines l\u00e9gislatives de la disposition.\n[304] Premi\u00e8rement, l\u2019insertion de l\u2019art. 25 \u00e9tait motiv\u00e9e par des pr\u00e9occupations li\u00e9es \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re dont les droits et int\u00e9r\u00eats collectifs des peuples autochtones pourraient interagir avec l\u2019ench\u00e2ssement constitutionnel de droits individuels \u2014 surtout le droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 garanti au par. 15(1). Une pr\u00e9occupation principale \u00e0 l\u2019origine de l\u2019art. 25 \u00e9tait la question de savoir si, en son absence, les protections contre la discrimination raciale pr\u00e9vues au par. 15(1) de la Charte nuiraient aux droits ancestraux ou issus de trait\u00e9s d\u00e9tenus par les peuples autochtones en raison de leur autochtonit\u00e9 (Hogg et Wright, \u00a7 28:41; C. Hutchinson, \u00ab Case Comment on R. v. Kapp : An Analytical Framework for Section 25 of the Charter \u00bb (2007), 52 R.D. McGill 173, p. 178). Bien que notre Cour ait d\u00e9sormais confirm\u00e9 \u00e0 maintes reprises que la \u00ab norme fondamentale \u00bb du par. 15(1) est l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle \u2014 qui implique de \u00ab transcende[r] les similitudes et distinctions apparentes \u00bb dans l\u2019\u00e9valuation des demandes fond\u00e9es sur le droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 \u2014 cette tendance jurisprudentielle n\u2019allait aucunement de soi \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque de l\u2019adoption de la Charte (Fraser c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2020 CSC 28, [2020] 3 R.C.S. 113; R. c. Sharma, 2022 CSC 39, par. 37 et 187; Withler c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2011 CSC 12, [2011] 1 R.C.S. 396, par. 39). L\u2019article 25 \u00e9tait motiv\u00e9 par la crainte r\u00e9elle qu\u2019une interpr\u00e9tation formaliste du par. 15(1) porte atteinte aux droits autochtones collectifs. Par exemple, l\u2019art. 25 emp\u00eacherait les non\u2011Autochtones de revendiquer des droits identiques de chasse ou de p\u00eache sur des terres traditionnelles et mettrait \u00e0 l\u2019abri des programmes et dispositions con\u00e7us pour prot\u00e9ger les droits sp\u00e9ciaux des peuples autochtones.\n[305] Deuxi\u00e8mement, l\u2019art. 25 ne visait pas \u00e0 cr\u00e9er ou \u00e0 conf\u00e9rer des droits. L\u2019article 25 est une \u00ab disposition qui a pour but de pr\u00e9server des droits et non d\u2019en cr\u00e9er de nouveaux ou d\u2019augmenter ou de modifier de quelque fa\u00e7on le statut constitutionnel ou l\u00e9gal des droits qui existent d\u00e9j\u00e0 ou qui pourraient \u00eatre cr\u00e9\u00e9s ind\u00e9pendamment de la Charte \u00bb (Lysyk, p. 597; voir aussi J. Borrows, \u00ab Contemporary Traditional Equality : The Effect of the Charter on First Nation Politics \u00bb (1994), 43 R.D. U.N.\u2011B. 19, p. 28; Hogg et Wright, \u00a7 28:41). Le juge Bastarache a fait observer dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Kapp, 2008 CSC 41, [2008] 2 R.C.S. 483, par. 93, qu\u2019\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 l\u2019historique de la disposition, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00ab indiqu\u00e9 d\u2019une fa\u00e7on on ne peut plus claire que l\u2019art. 25 ne cr\u00e9e pas de nouveaux droits \u00bb. On envisageait plut\u00f4t l\u2019art. 25 comme un m\u00e9canisme pour [traduction] \u00ab guider l\u2019application de la Charte \u00bb et \u00ab r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la crainte que la Charte serve \u00e0 enlever des droits \u00bb aux peuples autochtones (Arbour, p. 36). Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un outil d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation, et non d\u2019une source de droits.\n[306] Troisi\u00e8mement, nous admettons que prot\u00e9ger la diff\u00e9rence autochtone est un objectif qui a motiv\u00e9 l\u2019insertion de l\u2019art. 25 dans la Charte, mais d\u2019apr\u00e8s une formulation plus pr\u00e9cise de l\u2019objet de la disposition, celle\u2011ci vise \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger le statut sp\u00e9cial de certains droits collectifs d\u00e9tenus par les peuples autochtones. Il s\u2019agit de droits qui se rapportent uniquement aux peuples autochtones parce qu\u2019ils sont des Autochtones (voir Kapp, par. 103, le juge Bastarache). Ils sont intrins\u00e8quement li\u00e9s \u00e0 [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019identit\u00e9 distinctive, collective [et] culturelle \u00bb d\u2019un groupe autochtone (voir Arbour, p. 60; m. interv., p.g. Canada, par. 29). Par exemple, les droits ancestraux ou issus de trait\u00e9s reconnus par l\u2019art. 35, ainsi que d\u2019autres lois conf\u00e9rant des avantages en raison de l\u2019appartenance \u00e0 un groupe autochtone \u2014 tel le programme d\u2019\u00ab action positive \u00bb d\u00e9crit par le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Romanow en 1978 \u2014 prot\u00e8gent des int\u00e9r\u00eats collectifs qui sont propres aux peuples autochtones et d\u00e9coulent de leur identit\u00e9. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Van der Peet, [1996] 2 R.C.S. 507, par. 19, le juge en chef Lamer a expliqu\u00e9 que :\nToutefois, les droits ancestraux ne peuvent \u00eatre d\u00e9finis par l\u2019application des pr\u00e9ceptes de [la] philosophie [lib\u00e9rale du Si\u00e8cle des lumi\u00e8res]. M\u00eame s\u2019ils ont une port\u00e9e et une importance \u00e9gales aux droits inscrits dans la Charte, les droits ancestraux doivent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s diff\u00e9remment des droits garantis par la Charte, parce qu\u2019ils sont d\u00e9tenus seulement par les autochtones au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne. Les droits ancestraux tirent leur origine du fait que les peuples autochtones sont des autochtones. [Nous soulignons; soulignement dans l\u2019original omis.]\nBien que l\u2019art. 25 ne cr\u00e9e pas de droits et se distingue de dispositions qui les cr\u00e9ent ou les confirment constitutionnellement, il convient de noter que l\u2019art. 25 a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9 et adopt\u00e9 dans le contexte de d\u00e9bats en cours sur les types de droits qui seraient prot\u00e9g\u00e9s en fin de compte par ce qui est d\u00e9sormais l\u2019art. 35. Nous souscrivons \u00e0 l\u2019affirmation du juge Bastarache tir\u00e9e de l\u2019arr\u00eat Kapp selon laquelle, vu la mention \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25 des \u00ab droits ou libert\u00e9s ancestraux ou issus de trait\u00e9s \u00bb, \u00ab [l\u2019art. 25] est ax[\u00e9] sur le caract\u00e8re tout \u00e0 fait particulier des personnes ou des collectivit\u00e9s mentionn\u00e9es dans la Constitution; les droits prot\u00e9g\u00e9s sont ceux qui leur sont propres en raison de leur statut sp\u00e9cial \u00bb (par. 103).\n[307] Cette interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019objet de l\u2019art. 25 concorde tout \u00e0 fait avec la jurisprudence de notre Cour sur la mani\u00e8re dont on reconna\u00eet les droits autochtones et leur donne effet au sein du cadre constitutionnel canadien. Dans Van der Peet, le juge en chef Lamer a affirm\u00e9 que \u00ab le par. 35(1) a pour objet de reconna\u00eetre l\u2019occupation ant\u00e9rieure de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique du Nord par les peuples autochtones \u00bb, et que cette disposition \u00e9tablit \u00ab le cadre constitutionnel qui permet de reconna\u00eetre que les autochtones vivaient sur le territoire en soci\u00e9t\u00e9s distinctives, poss\u00e9dant leurs propres cultures, pratiques et traditions, et de concilier ce fait avec la souverainet\u00e9 de Sa Majest\u00e9 \u00bb (par. 31\u201132). Les articles 35 et 25 ne remplissent pas la m\u00eame fonction, et les droits qui en rel\u00e8vent n\u2019ont pas la m\u00eame port\u00e9e. Les deux dispositions reconnaissent toutefois le statut sp\u00e9cial des communaut\u00e9s autochtones et cherchent \u00e0 concilier les droits et int\u00e9r\u00eats autochtones collectifs et ceux de l\u2019\u00c9tat canadien au sens large (voir, p. ex., Kapp, par. 65; m. interv., Congr\u00e8s des peuples autochtones, par. 20; m.a., par. 61\u201162; m. interv., p.g. Qu\u00e9bec, par. 19; m. interv., p.g. Alberta, par. 14\u201116). L\u2019article 25 confirme que la protection des droits individuels garantis par la Charte n\u2019entrave pas ce processus de r\u00e9conciliation.\n[308] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, l\u2019art. 25 favorise la r\u00e9alisation d\u2019un objectif particulier : \u00e9viter que l\u2019adoption d\u2019une d\u00e9claration des droits constitutionnalis\u00e9e au Canada ait pour effet de porter atteinte aux droits uniques d\u00e9tenus par les peuples autochtones qui d\u00e9coulent de leur identit\u00e9 en tant que tels.\n(4) Jurisprudence sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des droits constitutionnels\n[309] La th\u00e8se suivant laquelle l\u2019art. 25 favorise l\u2019atteinte de cet objectif et fait office de prisme d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation est \u00e9tay\u00e9e par bien d\u2019autres principes importants tir\u00e9s de la jurisprudence constitutionnelle. Notre Cour a toujours affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il faut lire en corr\u00e9lation toutes les parties de la Constitution, et qu\u2019il n\u2019existe aucune hi\u00e9rarchie entre ses diff\u00e9rentes dispositions (voir Gosselin (Tuteur de) c. Qu\u00e9bec (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2005 CSC 15, [2005] 1 R.C.S. 238, par. 2; Renvoi relatif au mariage entre personnes du m\u00eame sexe, 2004 CSC 79, [2004] 3 R.C.S. 698, par. 50; Dagenais c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Radio\u2011Canada, [1994] 3 R.C.S. 835, p. 877). En outre, les droits constitutionnels ne sont pas absolus \u2014 ils sont souvent limit\u00e9s par les droits d\u2019autrui. Cela vaut \u00e9galement pour les droits autochtones (voir R. c. Badger, [1996] 1 R.C.S. 771, par. 80\u201182; R. c. Sparrow, [1990] 1 R.C.S. 1075, p. 1108\u20111109; R. c. Nikal, [1996] 1 R.C.S. 1013, par. 92). En effet, \u00ab [l]es limites impos\u00e9es \u00e0 ces droits sont \u00e9galement un \u00e9l\u00e9ment n\u00e9cessaire de [la r\u00e9conciliation entre les communaut\u00e9s autochtones et la communaut\u00e9 dans son ensemble], si les objectifs qu\u2019elles visent sont suffisamment importants pour la communaut\u00e9 dans son ensemble \u00bb (R. c. Gladstone, [1996] 2 R.C.S. 723, par. 73 (soulignement omis); voir aussi Delgamuukw c. Colombie\u2011Britannique, [1997] 3 R.C.S. 1010, par. 160\u2011161). Bref, les droits n\u2019existent pas dans l\u2019abstrait (Nikal, par. 92).\n[310] L\u2019article 25 le reconna\u00eet. Il n\u2019\u00e9carte pas la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de concilier les int\u00e9r\u00eats oppos\u00e9s, ni ne repr\u00e9sente une exception claire \u00e0 une m\u00e9thode souple et contextuelle d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation constitutionnelle. Comme le signale Mme Dickson, interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019art. 25 comme pr\u00e9voyant un [traduction] \u00ab bouclier automatique et absolu serait une anomalie dans la jurisprudence de notre Cour \u00bb (m.a., par. 93). Les droits ancestraux ou issus de trait\u00e9s confirm\u00e9s par l\u2019art. 35 peuvent \u00eatre restreints en raison d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats pressants de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 (voir Sparrow; Badger; Nation Tsilhqot\u2019in, par. 152). Il serait fort incongru de prot\u00e9ger automatiquement ces m\u00eames droits alors que leur exercice entra\u00eene des violations de la Charte, peu importe leur gravit\u00e9 ou leur \u00e9tendue. La Charte a pav\u00e9 la voie \u00e0 une nouvelle relation entre les gouvern\u00e9s et les gouvernants; la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a un grand int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 concilier les droits collectifs et les droits individuels. Nous n\u2019acceptons pas la th\u00e8se selon laquelle les droits collectifs l\u2019emportent absolument sur les droits individuels. Pareille interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019art. 25 serait [traduction] \u00ab rigide au point d\u2019\u00eatre grossi\u00e8re \u00bb (m. interv., p.g. Canada, par. 36).\n[311] Puisqu\u2019il ne convient pas d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019art. 25 de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 conf\u00e9rer une [traduction] \u00ab immunit\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00bb contre l\u2019examen fond\u00e9 sur la Charte, \u00ab il s\u2019agit alors de r\u00e9gler un conflit entre deux ensembles diff\u00e9rents de droits constitutionnels \u00bb (D. L. Milward, Aboriginal Justice and the Charter : Realizing a Culturally Sensitive Interpretation of Legal Rights (2012), p. 69; voir aussi T. Isaac, \u00ab Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms : The Challenge of the Individual and Collective Rights of Aboriginal People \u00bb (2002), 21 Windsor Y.B. Access Just. 431, p. 437).\n(5) Mobilisation constitutionnelle apr\u00e8s 1982\n[312] Le Rapport final publi\u00e9 en 1996 par la Commission royale rev\u00eat \u00e9galement de l\u2019importance pour l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019art. 25 de la Charte. La Commission royale avait le vaste mandat d\u2019examiner la situation des peuples autochtones de partout au Canada et de proposer des solutions et des rem\u00e8des. Le Rapport final \u00e9non\u00e7ait quatre grands principes servant de lignes directrices en vue d\u2019une \u00ab relation renouvel\u00e9e \u00bb entre les communaut\u00e9s autochtones et les communaut\u00e9s non autochtones : \u00ab . . . reconnaissance mutuelle, respect mutuel, partage et responsabilit\u00e9 mutuelle \u00bb (Rapport de la Commission royale sur les peuples autochtones, vol. 1, Un pass\u00e9, un avenir (1996), p. 743). D\u2019apr\u00e8s la Commission royale, cela suppose trois choses : \u00ab . . . \u00e9galit\u00e9, coexistence et autonomie gouvernementale \u00bb (p. 744). Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que le respect des droits individuels et l\u2019autod\u00e9termination des communaut\u00e9s autochtones soient une \u00e9quation \u00e0 somme nulle. En fait, l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 et la reddition de compte par l\u2019application de la Charte peuvent amener des personnes qui avaient coup\u00e9 les ponts \u00e0 revenir dans leur communaut\u00e9 d\u2019origine. Dans son m\u00e9moire, Band Members Alliance and Advocacy Association of Canada \u00e9crit que les efforts de r\u00e9conciliation ne devraient pas priver davantage les peuples autochtones de leurs droits juridiques. La r\u00e9conciliation exige plut\u00f4t que le droit trace une voie qui r\u00e9unit le droit [traduction] \u00ab colonial \u00bb ainsi que les ordres social et juridique autochtones jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que les deux puissent coexister (par. 23).\n[313] \u00ab [U]ne certaine souplesse doit pr\u00e9sider \u00e0 [l\u2019]interpr\u00e9tation [de l\u2019art. 25] pour tenir compte des philosophies, des traditions et des pratiques culturelles propres aux peuples autochtones \u00bb (Commission royale, vol. 2, p. 258). Bien que notre Cour doive cr\u00e9er un espace dans la Constitution pour que les peuples autochtones d\u00e9veloppent leurs cultures et leurs soci\u00e9t\u00e9s comme ils l\u2019entendent, elle doit garder \u00e0 l\u2019esprit qu\u2019en raison de l\u2019h\u00e9ritage du colonialisme, les peuples autochtones sont d\u00e9savantag\u00e9s et victimes de discrimination syst\u00e9mique. La r\u00e9conciliation ne devrait pas \u00eatre un moyen de les priver davantage de droits juridiques sur leurs propres terres. Par cons\u00e9quent, bien que l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale autochtone fasse partie int\u00e9grante de la gouvernance canadienne, elle devrait, comme tout autre chef de gouvernement, \u00eatre tenue de respecter les contraintes constitutionnelles, y compris les droits et libert\u00e9s garantis par la Charte.\n[314] L\u2019article 25 ne devrait pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 interdire aux demandeurs autochtones d\u2019invoquer d\u2019autres dispositions de la Charte, y compris le par. 15(1), m\u00eame si la contestation vise les lois de leurs propres communaut\u00e9s. Depuis l\u2019adoption de la Charte, on a soulev\u00e9 d\u2019importantes questions \u00e0 propos de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation et la mise en balance des int\u00e9r\u00eats individuels et int\u00e9r\u00eats collectifs (voir J. Koshan et J. Watson Hamilton, \u00ab Kahkewistahaw First Nation v Taypotat \u2014 Whither Section of the Charter? \u00bb (2016), 25:2 Forum const. 39, p. 42). Parmi celles\u2011ci, la demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019Association des femmes autochtones du Canada en vue de jouer un r\u00f4le \u00e9gal dans les d\u00e9bats sur la r\u00e9forme de la Constitution (Assoc. des femmes autochtones du Canada c. Canada, [1994] 3 R.C.S. 627), un litige portant sur les r\u00e8gles d\u2019appartenance \u00e0 la bande qui excluaient certaines femmes et leurs enfants (voir K. Gover, \u00ab When tribalism meets liberalism : Human rights and Indigenous boundary problems in Canada \u00bb (2014), 64 U.T.L.J. 206, p. 230\u2011234), et l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle les codes \u00e9lectoraux de certaines communaut\u00e9s autochtones emp\u00eachent parfois des particuliers de se porter candidats en raison de leur sexe, de leur \u00e9tat matrimonial ou de leur orientation sexuelle (K. Busby, \u00ab Discussed, reformulated and enriched many times \u00bb : The Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s Equality Jurisprudence \u2014 Notes for a presentation at the Canadian Bar Association Annual National Constitutional and Human Rights Conference, juin 2014 (en ligne), p. 4\u20115).\n[315] Le besoin de mettre les droits en balance et de concilier les int\u00e9r\u00eats et les gens \u00e9tait non seulement crucial pour la recommandation finale de la Commission royale, mais il \u00e9tait aussi au c\u0153ur des arguments fond\u00e9s sur l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 qu\u2019a avanc\u00e9s l\u2019Association des femmes autochtones du Canada \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque de l\u2019Accord de Charlottetown. Ses commentaires au sujet du caract\u00e8re discriminatoire de certaines structures de gouvernance autochtones et de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019appliquer la Charte \u00e0 des nations autonomes r\u00e9sonnent encore aujourd\u2019hui :\nL\u2019Association des femmes autochtones du Canada appuie les droits individuels. Ces droits sont si fondamentaux que, si on les \u00e9liminait, l\u2019\u00eatre humain n\u2019existerait plus. Les femmes autochtones sont des \u00eatres humains et nous avons des droits qui ne peuvent pas \u00eatre ni\u00e9s ou retir\u00e9s au gr\u00e9 des caprices de n\u2019importe quel gouvernement. [. . .] Cette conception s\u2019oppose \u00e0 celle de plusieurs leaders autochtones et de th\u00e9oriciens du droit qui pr\u00e9conisent la reconnaissance par le Canada de la souverainet\u00e9, de l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale et des droits collectifs. Le leadership autochtone m\u00e2le soutient, sans jamais d\u00e9vi[er] de cette ligne, que la \u00ab collectivit\u00e9 \u00bb a priorit\u00e9 et que c\u2019est elle qui d\u00e9finira les droits des individus.\n. . .\nL\u2019Association des femmes autochtones du Canada reconna\u00eet l\u2019existence d\u2019un conflit entre les droits collectifs des gouvernements autochtones souverains et les droits individuels des femmes. Priv\u00e9es d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 par les lois patriarcales qui ont fait des \u00ab privil\u00e8ges m\u00e2les \u00bb la norme sur les r\u00e9serves, les femmes autochtones ont d\u00fb mener une lutte extraordinaire pour reconqu\u00e9rir leur position sociale. Nous voulons que la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s s\u2019applique aux gouvernements autochtones.\n(Position Concernant les \u00ab Propositions Constitutionnelles \u00bb (1992), p. 9 et 11; voir aussi Borrows (1994), p. 44.)\n[316] Les femmes autochtones ont pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que, si la Charte ne s\u2019applique pas aux gouvernements autochtones, elles risquent de perdre un outil important pour faire valoir leur droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 au sein de leurs communaut\u00e9s. Personne ne devrait s\u2019\u00e9tonner que les in\u00e9galit\u00e9s existant dans l\u2019ensemble de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne soient \u00e9galement pr\u00e9sentes ou reproduites au sein des communaut\u00e9s autochtones. Selon le professeur John Borrows, les gouvernements autochtones peuvent \u00eatre tout aussi m\u00e9prisants et oppresseurs quand il s\u2019agit de questions d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 entre les sexes que les autres ordres de gouvernement (Freedom and Indigenous Constitutionalism (2016), p. 188). Il existe un besoin similaire et commun de prot\u00e9ger les droits de tous les citoyens autochtones si leurs gouvernements les traitent injustement, surtout s\u2019ils font partie d\u2019une minorit\u00e9 au sein du collectif autochtone plus grand.\n(6) Sources internationales\n[317] Le droit international en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne peut se r\u00e9v\u00e9ler une source utile d\u2019information et d\u2019orientation lorsque vient le temps d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter les dispositions de la Charte. D\u2019apr\u00e8s la pr\u00e9somption de conformit\u00e9, il convient de pr\u00e9sumer que la Charte accorde une protection au moins aussi grande que celle offerte par des dispositions semblables de documents internationaux ratifi\u00e9s par le Canada (Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la Public Service Employee Relations Act, p. 349, le juge en chef Dickson et la juge Wilson, dissidents). Les instruments internationaux contraignants ont un certain poids dans l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la Charte (Qu\u00e9bec (Procureure g\u00e9n\u00e9rale) c. 9147\u20110732 Qu\u00e9bec inc., 2020 CSC 32, [2020] 3 R.C.S. 426, par. 38). En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la DNUDPA lie le Canada et fait donc intervenir la pr\u00e9somption de conformit\u00e9.\n[318] La DNUDPA reconna\u00eet la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de prot\u00e9ger \u00e0 la fois les droits collectifs et les droits individuels des peuples autochtones. Par exemple, les articles 4, 5, 20 et 34 confirment le droit des peuples autochtones \u00e0 l\u2019autod\u00e9termination, \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale et leur capacit\u00e9 de prot\u00e9ger leurs institutions politiques, juridiques, \u00e9conomiques, sociales et culturelles distinctes. De plus, les articles 2 et 9 pr\u00e9voient en outre que tant les peuples que les personnes autochtones ne doivent faire l\u2019objet d\u2019aucune forme de discrimination et \u00eatre \u00e9gaux \u00e0 tous les autres peuples dans l\u2019exercice de leurs droits. Ainsi, les Autochtones ont le droit d\u2019appartenir \u00e0 une communaut\u00e9 ou \u00e0 une nation autochtone et doivent \u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9s contre la discrimination sous toutes ses formes dans l\u2019exercice de ce droit.\n[319] La DNUDPA illustre donc bien qu\u2019un type de droit ne peut supplanter absolument un autre. Une interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019art. 25 qui met les droits et libert\u00e9s autochtones collectifs \u00e0 l\u2019abri de tout empi\u00e8tement, mais qui ne respecte pas le droit des Autochtones de ne pas subir de discrimination serait incompatible avec le caract\u00e8re exhaustif des protections conf\u00e9r\u00e9es par la DNUDPA. Une interpr\u00e9tation globale de la DNUDPA \u00e9taye plut\u00f4t l\u2019opinion selon laquelle l\u2019art. 25 fait office de prisme d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation qui assure le respect des droits collectifs et des droits individuels.\n(7) Conclusion sur le fonctionnement de l\u2019art. 25\n[320] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, l\u2019art. 25 devrait servir de prisme d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation, et non faire office de bouclier. La mesure dans laquelle ce prisme refl\u00e8te et colore l\u2019application de la Charte d\u00e9pend de l\u2019identit\u00e9 de l\u2019auteur de la demande, de l\u2019identit\u00e9 du d\u00e9fendeur et du moment o\u00f9 est d\u00e9pos\u00e9e la demande. L\u2019adaptation au contexte peut faire appara\u00eetre une [traduction] \u00ab cl\u00f4ture solide \u00bb autour des droits ancestraux, issus de trait\u00e9s ou autres dans les contestations de parties externes, tout en garantissant que les contestations de membres fond\u00e9es sur des principes de la Charte peuvent continuer d\u2019exister (G. Christie, \u00ab Aboriginal Citizenship : Sections 35, 25 and 15 of Canada\u2019s Constitution Act, 1982 \u00bb (2003), 7 Citizsh. Stud. 481, p. 491).\n[321] Nous ajoutons ceci. Bien que nous rejetions la vision de l\u2019art. 25 en tant que bouclier, nous ne sugg\u00e9rons pas que la protection de droits fondamentaux ne peut se faire que par le truchement de la Charte, ou que des nations autochtones autonomes n\u2019ont aucun r\u00f4le \u00e0 jouer \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. \u00c0 titre de gouvernements \u00e0 part enti\u00e8re, les nations autochtones peuvent ench\u00e2sser les droits de leurs citoyens dans des documents constitutionnels, et elles le font souvent. La Constitution de la VGFN, par exemple, pr\u00e9voit que [traduction] \u00ab [l]es lois de la Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation ne font acception de personne et s\u2019appliquent \u00e9galement \u00e0 tous, et tous ont droit \u00e0 la m\u00eame protection et au m\u00eame b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de la loi de la Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation, ind\u00e9pendamment de toute discrimination \u00bb (article IV(7)). Les droits et libert\u00e9s \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la Constitution de la VGFN ne peuvent \u00eatre restreints [traduction] \u00ab que dans des limites raisonnables dont la justification p[eut] se d\u00e9montrer dans le cadre d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Vuntut Gwitchin libre et d\u00e9mocratique \u00bb (article IV(1)). La VGFN fait remarquer \u00e0 juste titre que Mme Dickson peut intenter un recours en vertu de l\u2019article IV(7) de la Constitution de la VGFN (m.i., par. 95; voir aussi 2021 YKCA 5, 495 C.R.R. (2d) 98, par. 156\u2011157).\n[322] Les ordres juridiques autochtones ne sont pas distincts et s\u00e9par\u00e9s du droit canadien; ils font partie int\u00e9grante de celui\u2011ci (Mitchell, par. 10\u201111; Pastion c. Premi\u00e8re nation Dene Tha\u2019, 2018 CF 648, [2018] 4 R.C.F. 467, par. 8). Cela ne soustrait toutefois pas les gouvernements autochtones \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 de respecter les droits et libert\u00e9s individuels formul\u00e9s dans la Charte (voir le m. interv., Canadian Constitution Foundation). En fait, la Charte \u00e9tablit un \u00ab plancher \u00bb de droits et libert\u00e9s prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par la Constitution que doivent respecter tous les gouvernements, sous r\u00e9serve de la fonction d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation remplie par l\u2019art. 25 lorsque des droits autochtones collectifs sont en jeu.\n[323] Rien n\u2019emp\u00eache les gouvernements autochtones de prot\u00e9ger des droits ou de les interpr\u00e9ter. Les tribunaux autochtones \u2014 notamment le tribunal des Vuntut Gwitchin (qui n\u2019a pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 constitu\u00e9) \u2014 auront un r\u00f4le important \u00e0 jouer (voir la Constitution de la VGFN, art. XV; motifs de la C.A., par. 23 et 25). La Loi constitutionnelle de 1982, qui comprend la Charte, est un document pluraliste susceptible d\u2019int\u00e9grer et de prendre en compte autant le point de vue des Autochtones que celui des non\u2011Autochtones. La doctrine d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019arbre vivant garantit que l\u2019on pourra s\u2019appuyer sur ces points de vue. Le professeur Borrows \u00e9crit que l\u2019interaction dialectique entre les pratiques autochtones traditionnelles et la Charte fut \u00e0 l\u2019origine d\u2019un \u00e9change culturel productif lors des conf\u00e9rences constitutionnelles et a revitalis\u00e9 les mouvements pour l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 au sein des communaut\u00e9s autochtones. Nous convenons que [traduction] \u00ab [l]\u2019injection de nouvelles conceptions dans les pratiques anciennes coutumi\u00e8res concorde parfaitement avec la vision d\u2019un monde cyclique de bien des peuples des Premi\u00e8res Nations et suit les mod\u00e8les reproducteurs au plan culturel de la tradition orale \u00bb ((1994), p. 31\u201133 (note en bas de page omise)).\n[324] La Charte et le droit des peuples autochtones \u00e0 l\u2019autod\u00e9termination peuvent coexister pacifiquement (m. interv., Band Members Alliance and Advocacy Association of Canada). Notre conception des droits constitutionnels comme l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 est form\u00e9e de normes fondamentales d\u2019application universelle et est influenc\u00e9e par le contexte pertinent. Il ne fait aucun doute que la prolif\u00e9ration d\u2019instruments sur les droits autochtones et une activit\u00e9 accrue des tribunaux autochtones fa\u00e7onnera la mani\u00e8re dont d\u2019autres tribunaux con\u00e7oivent le contexte dans lequel les protections offertes par la Charte entrent en jeu. Les tribunaux doivent apprendre les uns des autres \u00e0 donner effet aux droits individuels, peu importe leur forme, dans le contexte qui leur est propre.\nB. Droits vis\u00e9s par l\u2019art. 25\n[325] L\u2019article 25 prot\u00e8ge les droits ancestraux, issus de trait\u00e9s ou \u00ab autres \u2014 des peuples autochtones du Canada \u00bb. Nous sommes d\u2019accord avec les juges Kasirer et Jamal pour dire que les droits vis\u00e9s par l\u2019art. 25 ne comprennent pas uniquement ceux qui ont un \u00ab statut constitutionnel \u00bb (par. 149). Toutefois, les juges Kasirer et Jamal concluent en outre qu\u2019un \u00ab autr[e] \u00bb droit rel\u00e8ve de l\u2019art. 25 lorsque la partie qui cherche \u00e0 l\u2019invoquer \u00e9tablit que le \u00ab droit prot\u00e8ge ou reconna\u00eet la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone \u00bb (par. 150). \u00c0 notre avis, cette formulation est trop large, en particulier lorsqu\u2019on la situe dans le contexte de l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale autochtone.\n[326] La port\u00e9e de la protection offerte par l\u2019art. 25 est \u00ab subordonn\u00e9[e] \u00e0 [ses] objets \u00bb (R. c. Poulin, 2019 CSC 47, [2019] 3 R.C.S. 566, par. 54; voir aussi Chagnon c. Syndicat de la fonction publique et parapublique du Qu\u00e9bec, 2018 CSC 39, [2018] 2 R.C.S. 687, par. 27). La Cour doit faire attention de ne pas aller au\u2011del\u00e0 des objectifs qui sous\u2011tendent la disposition (voir 9147\u20110732 Qu\u00e9bec inc., par. 10).\n[327] Bien que la protection de la diff\u00e9rence autochtone soit indubitablement l\u2019un des objectifs de l\u2019art. 25, comme nous l\u2019avons expliqu\u00e9, l\u2019objet de la disposition est de prot\u00e9ger certains droits collectifs que seuls d\u00e9tiennent les peuples autochtones parce qu\u2019ils sont des Autochtones (voir Kapp, par. 103). \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, il y a un parall\u00e8le \u00e0 \u00e9tablir avec les droits reconnus et confirm\u00e9s par l\u2019art. 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982; les droits vis\u00e9s par les deux dispositions sont d\u00e9tenus seulement par les peuples autochtones et d\u00e9coulent de leur identit\u00e9 autochtone (voir Van der Peet, par. 19; Terre\u2011Neuve\u2011et\u2011Labrador (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Uashaunnuat (Innus de Uashat et de Mani\u2011Utenam), 2020 CSC 4, [2020] 1 R.C.S. 15, par. 207, les juges Brown et Rowe, dissidents). Ces droits sont intrins\u00e8quement li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019identit\u00e9 distinctive, collective et culturelle d\u2019une communaut\u00e9 autochtone.\n[328] \u00c0 notre avis, il ne suffit pas qu\u2019un droit se rapporte aux peuples autochtones pour qu\u2019il rel\u00e8ve de l\u2019art. 25 (voir Corbiere c. Canada (Ministre des Affaires indiennes et du Nord canadien), [1999] 2 R.C.S. 203, par. 52, la juge L\u2019Heureux\u2011Dub\u00e9, motifs concordants). Nous estimons \u00e9galement qu\u2019il ne suffit pas, pour b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de la protection de l\u2019art. 25 dans le contexte de l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale, qu\u2019une nation autochtone poss\u00e8de de vastes droits de gouverner sa communaut\u00e9. Les actes des gouvernements autochtones ne repr\u00e9sentent pas tous l\u2019exercice d\u2019un droit collectif unique qui puise sa source dans la culture distinctive de la communaut\u00e9. Les nations autochtones autonomes gouvernent souvent de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re que toute autre entit\u00e9 gouvernementale.\n[329] Par cons\u00e9quent, dans le contexte de l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale autochtone, les distinctions au sein du groupe d\u00e9borderont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement du cadre de l\u2019art. 25, y compris les dispositions l\u00e9gislatives qui font des distinctions entre les membres de la communaut\u00e9 autochtone sur le fondement de motifs personnels tels que l\u2019\u00e2ge, le sexe, l\u2019identit\u00e9 de genre, l\u2019orientation sexuelle ou les d\u00e9ficiences, pour n\u2019en nommer que quelques\u2011uns. Le professeur Patrick Macklem explique qu\u2019une interpr\u00e9tation large de l\u2019art. 25 [traduction] \u00ab dans le contexte d\u2019une restriction interne risque de sacrifier les int\u00e9r\u00eats des membres les moins puissants de soci\u00e9t\u00e9s autochtones, dans les cas o\u00f9 la restriction peut \u00eatre source de cons\u00e9quences d\u00e9l\u00e9t\u00e8res graves pour certains membres et n\u2019avoir peut\u2011\u00eatre qu\u2019un rapport distant avec les int\u00e9r\u00eats li\u00e9s \u00e0 la diff\u00e9rence autochtone \u00bb (Indigenous Difference and the Constitution of Canada (2001), p. 226 (nous soulignons); voir aussi le m. interv., Congr\u00e8s des peuples autochtones, par. 18). M\u00eame si un gouvernement autochtone peut chercher \u00e0 justifier de telles dispositions l\u00e9gislatives par des motifs culturels, elles ne visent habituellement pas \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre le statut sp\u00e9cial des collectivit\u00e9s autochtones au sein de l\u2019\u00c9tat canadien au sens large. Par cons\u00e9quent, les gouvernements autochtones qui adoptent des lois \u00e9tablissant des distinctions internes sur la base de caract\u00e9ristiques personnelles \u00e9trang\u00e8res \u00e0 l\u2019identit\u00e9 autochtone se verront g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00ab [tenus de] satisfa[ire] au crit\u00e8re de l\u2019arr\u00eat Oakes pour r\u00e9sister \u00e0 une contestation \u00bb lorsqu\u2019une violation du par. 15(1) de la Charte a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie (Kapp, par. 99, le juge Bastarache; voir aussi Macklem, p. 226\u2011227).\n[330] \u00c0 l\u2019inverse, l\u2019art. 25 peut viser [traduction] \u00ab des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives qui distinguent les Autochtones des non\u2011Autochtones dans le but de prot\u00e9ger les int\u00e9r\u00eats associ\u00e9s \u00e0 la diff\u00e9rence autochtone \u00bb (Macklem, p. 225). Les lois de ce genre peuvent pr\u00e9munir les communaut\u00e9s autochtones [traduction] \u00ab contre les menaces \u00e0 sa diff\u00e9rence que repr\u00e9sente la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral o\u00f9 elle[s] se trouve[nt] \u00bb (p. 225 (note en bas de page omise)). Par exemple, Kapp est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment le type d\u2019affaire o\u00f9 le droit autochtone collectif en cause cadrait avec l\u2019objet de l\u2019art. 25. L\u2019affaire Kapp concernait un programme f\u00e9d\u00e9ral accordant un permis sp\u00e9cial de p\u00eache communautaire \u00e0 trois bandes autochtones. Le permis conf\u00e9rait le droit exclusif de p\u00eacher le saumon \u00e0 l\u2019embouchure du fleuve Fraser pendant une p\u00e9riode de 24 heures. Un groupe principalement compos\u00e9 de p\u00eacheurs commerciaux non autochtones a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une r\u00e9clamation fond\u00e9e sur le par. 15(1), faisant valoir que le permis op\u00e9rait une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la race. Dans ses motifs concordants, o\u00f9 il a conclu que l\u2019art. 25 s\u2019appliquait, le juge Bastarache a reconnu que le permis \u00e9tait un droit unique que poss\u00e9daient les Autochtones auxquels il \u00e9tait accord\u00e9. Il a \u00e9voqu\u00e9 le rapport tout \u00e0 fait particulier des communaut\u00e9s autochtones de la Colombie\u2011Britannique avec la p\u00eache (par. 119); en d\u2019autres termes, le droit \u00e9tait d\u00e9tenu par les peuples autochtones parce qu\u2019ils sont des Autochtones. Par cons\u00e9quent, selon le juge Bastarache, l\u2019art. 25 pouvait \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9 pour s\u2019opposer \u00e0 une revendication fond\u00e9e sur la Charte pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par des plaideurs externes, non autochtones.\n[331] L\u2019article 25 ne visait pas \u00e0 cr\u00e9er des zones soustraites \u00e0 l\u2019application de la Charte. Comme l\u2019a fait observer le juge Bastarache dans Kapp, par. 99 :\nIl n\u2019existe aucune raison de croire que l\u2019art. 25 ait exclu les Autochtones du r\u00e9gime de protection de la Charte. [. . .] Il ne me semble pas du tout \u00e9vident qu\u2019il est n\u00e9cessaire de limiter les droits individuels des Autochtones pour reconna\u00eetre les droits collectifs dont il est question \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25 . . .\nNous craignons toutefois que l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation large que donnent les juges Kasirer et Jamal aux droits vis\u00e9s par l\u2019art. 25 puisse mener \u00e0 ce r\u00e9sultat ou le justifie. Les membres de communaut\u00e9s autochtones doivent pouvoir contester les mesures de leurs propres gouvernements.\n[332] Les juges Kasirer et Jamal concluent que l\u2019\u00e9diction par la VGFN de l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence constitue l\u2019exercice d\u2019un droit prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par l\u2019art. 25. En arrivant \u00e0 cette conclusion, ils expliquent pourquoi ils croient que l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire est associ\u00e9e \u00e0 la diff\u00e9rence autochtone :\nObliger les dirigeants de la VGFN \u00e0 r\u00e9sider sur les terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es aide \u00e0 pr\u00e9server le lien entre les dirigeants et le territoire, qui est profond\u00e9ment ancr\u00e9 dans la culture et les pratiques de gouvernance distinctives de la VGFN. L\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence favorise le respect des attentes de la VGFN que ses dirigeants seront en mesure de maintenir des interactions personnelles continues avec les autres membres de la communaut\u00e9. Elle renforce aussi la capacit\u00e9 de la VGFN de r\u00e9sister aux forces ext\u00e9rieures qui attirent les citoyens loin de ses terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es, en plus de pr\u00e9venir l\u2019\u00e9rosion de son important lien avec le territoire. De tels int\u00e9r\u00eats sont associ\u00e9s \u00e0 divers aspects de la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 autochtone, y compris la diff\u00e9rence culturelle et la souverainet\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieure des Vuntut Gwitchin, ainsi que leur participation au processus de n\u00e9gociation de trait\u00e9s qui a abouti \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9diction de la Constitution de la VGFN. [par. 217]\nNous ne contestons aucune de ces observations, mais nous estimons qu\u2019il convient davantage de les examiner dans le cadre d\u2019une analyse fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019article premier au cours de laquelle un gouvernement autochtone tenterait de justifier une atteinte \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue \u00e0 un droit individuel garanti par la Charte en raison d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats collectifs pressants, au lieu d\u2019expliquer pourquoi les droits garantis par la Charte ne s\u2019appliquent pas du tout.\n[333] De plus, et cela est important, une nation autochtone autonome peut avancer une foule de raisons pour justifier l\u2019adoption d\u2019une loi particuli\u00e8re, mais seules quelques\u2011unes d\u2019entre elles concernent ou reconnaissent la diff\u00e9rence autochtone. Il n\u2019est pas surprenant qu\u2019un gouvernement l\u00e9gif\u00e8re d\u2019une mani\u00e8re adapt\u00e9e aux circonstances propres \u00e0 ses membres ou qu\u2019il cherche \u00e0 justifier ses actes en raison de sa vision de l\u2019histoire, des lois, des coutumes et des pratiques de la communaut\u00e9. Toutefois, les membres du groupe ne partagent pas tous l\u2019\u00e9valuation que fait le gouvernement de l\u2019histoire, des lois, des coutumes et des pratiques de la communaut\u00e9. En fait, de telles mati\u00e8res sont souvent vivement contest\u00e9es et font l\u2019objet du type m\u00eame de diff\u00e9rend qui donnerait vraisemblablement naissance \u00e0 des contestations fond\u00e9es sur les droits, que ce soit sous le r\u00e9gime de la Charte canadienne ou des propres documents constitutionnels de la nation.\n[334] \u00c0 notre avis, le crit\u00e8re de la \u00ab diff\u00e9rence autochtone \u00bb ne remplit pas une fonction utile de filtre ici. L\u2019accent doit \u00eatre mis sur le droit collectif lui\u2011m\u00eame, et sur la question de savoir s\u2019il est propre \u00e0 une communaut\u00e9 autochtone vu l\u2019autochtonit\u00e9, et non sur la justification de la raison pour laquelle une nation autochtone a exerc\u00e9 ses pouvoirs d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale d\u2019une certaine mani\u00e8re. Si tout ce dont a besoin une nation autochtone pour b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de l\u2019effet protecteur de l\u2019art. 25 consiste \u00e0 poss\u00e9der de vastes pouvoirs d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale et \u00e0 exercer ces pouvoirs d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui est express\u00e9ment li\u00e9e \u00e0 certains aspects de la diff\u00e9rence autochtone, il en r\u00e9sultera une grande immunit\u00e9 soustrayant les gouvernements \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de respecter la Charte. Par d\u00e9finition, il y aura toujours un lien \u00e0 l\u2019autochtonit\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019un gouvernement autochtone est \u00e0 l\u2019\u0153uvre, mais cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment constant ne peut pas satisfaire \u00e0 la norme d\u2019un droit ancestral, issu de trait\u00e9 ou autre au sens de l\u2019art. 25.\n[335] Nous donnons deux exemples th\u00e9oriques pour faire comprendre que ce ne sont pas tous les actes d\u2019un gouvernement autochtone qui m\u00e9riteraient d\u2019\u00eatre soustraits \u00e0 un examen fond\u00e9 sur la Charte selon l\u2019art. 25. En premier lieu, supposons qu\u2019une nation autochtone autonome s\u2019inqui\u00e8te de la consommation de quantit\u00e9s inacceptables de drogues et d\u2019alcool dans la communaut\u00e9 \u2014 qu\u2019elle a reli\u00e9e aux s\u00e9quelles du colonialisme et au mauvais traitement syst\u00e9mique aux mains de l\u2019\u00c9tat canadien. Dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat collectif, elle a autoris\u00e9 les forces de l\u2019ordre \u00e0 effectuer des fouilles al\u00e9atoires et sans mandat de citoyens et de r\u00e9sidences en guise de mesure proactive pour s\u2019assurer que la communaut\u00e9 soit \u00ab sobre \u00bb ou que l\u2019approvisionnement en substances intoxicantes soit limit\u00e9. Le recours intent\u00e9 en vertu de l\u2019art. 8 de la Charte serait\u2011il refus\u00e9 au motif que l\u2019action \u00e9tatique reconna\u00eet la diff\u00e9rence autochtone \u2014 ou, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, la position unique ou diff\u00e9rente de cette communaut\u00e9 autochtone?\n[336] Deuxi\u00e8mement, qu\u2019arriverait\u2011il si, au lieu d\u2019une restriction fond\u00e9e sur le lieu de r\u00e9sidence, comme c\u2019est le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le tribunal traitait d\u2019une r\u00e8gle \u00e9lectorale d\u2019exclusion similaire qui emp\u00eachait les personnes 2ELGBTQI+ ou les personnes ayant des d\u00e9ficiences de pouvoir si\u00e9ger au conseil? De telles dispositions seraient\u2011elles soustraites \u00e0 l\u2019examen fond\u00e9 sur la Charte sur la foi d\u2019une preuve de l\u2019histoire, des lois, des traditions et des pratiques d\u2019une communaut\u00e9? Une telle approche risque r\u00e9ellement de rendre [traduction] \u00ab sacro\u2011saint \u00bb \u2014 en ce sens que cela ne serait pas assujetti \u00e0 une norme de justification lorsqu\u2019il y a atteinte \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue \u00e0 des droits \u2014 \u00ab tout texte l\u00e9gislatif [. . .] aussi odieuse que puisse \u00eatre la disposition en cause \u00bb (Peavine M\u00e9tis Settlement c. Alberta (Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development), 2009 ABCA 239, 310 D.L.R. (4th) 519, par. 73, inf. pour d\u2019autres motifs par 2011 CSC 37, [2011] 2 R.C.S. 670). Nous soulevons ces questions pour illustrer le fait que l\u2019usage d\u2019une conception large de la \u00ab diff\u00e9rence autochtone \u00bb comme m\u00e9canisme de filtrage \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la reconnaissance des droits reviendrait \u00e0 cautionner des zones soustraites \u00e0 l\u2019application de la Charte et \u00e0 refuser aux peuples autochtones d\u2019importantes protections de la Charte qui sont cens\u00e9es s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 tout un chacun.\n[337] \u00c0 notre avis, une conception plus pr\u00e9cise de l\u2019objet de la disposition m\u00e8ne \u00e0 la conclusion que les droits vis\u00e9s par l\u2019art. 25 se limitent \u00e0 ceux qui sont v\u00e9ritablement propres aux peuples autochtones parce qu\u2019ils sont des Autochtones. Dans le contexte de l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale autochtone, les lois qui cr\u00e9ent des distinctions au sein du groupe sur la base d\u2019une caract\u00e9ristique personnelle autre que l\u2019autochtonit\u00e9 d\u00e9bordent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement du cadre de l\u2019art. 25.\nC. R\u00e9sum\u00e9 du fonctionnement et de la port\u00e9e de l\u2019art. 25\n[338] Lorsque l\u2019art. 25 est invoqu\u00e9, le tribunal doit se poser plusieurs questions pour d\u00e9cider s\u2019il s\u2019applique. En premier lieu, le demandeur doit d\u00e9montrer la violation d\u2019un droit ou d\u2019une libert\u00e9 garanti par la Charte. En deuxi\u00e8me lieu, la partie qui se fonde sur l\u2019art. 25 doit d\u00e9montrer que le droit ou la libert\u00e9 collectif en question est un droit ancestral, issu de trait\u00e9 ou autre droit ou libert\u00e9 \u00ab des peuples autochtones du Canada \u00bb, de sorte qu\u2019il est propre \u00e0 une communaut\u00e9 autochtone en raison de l\u2019autochtonit\u00e9. En troisi\u00e8me lieu, le tribunal doit tenter de concilier le droit collectif et le droit individuel qui s\u2019opposent lorsque c\u2019est possible de le faire. Dans R. c. N.S., 2012 CSC 72, [2012] 3 R.C.S. 726, par. 32, les juges majoritaires ont estim\u00e9 que dans une affaire portant sur des droits oppos\u00e9s, les tribunaux doivent s\u2019efforcer de r\u00e9soudre les revendications \u00ab de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 pr\u00e9server ces deux droits \u00bb. Id\u00e9alement, le tribunal parviendrait \u00e0 une interpr\u00e9tation qui respecte les deux droits et \u00e9vite un conflit entre eux.\n[339] En cas de v\u00e9ritable conflit, l\u2019art. 25 oblige le tribunal \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter le droit individuel garanti par la Charte de telle sorte qu\u2019il ne porte pas atteinte au droit prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par l\u2019art. 25. \u00c0 notre avis, c\u2019est \u00e0 ce stade qu\u2019une forme de mise en balance doit survenir pour concilier les int\u00e9r\u00eats oppos\u00e9s en jeu. Ce n\u2019est pas n\u2019importe quelle intrusion dans la sph\u00e8re d\u2019un droit prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par l\u2019art. 25 qui constitue une atteinte au sens o\u00f9 l\u2019entend la disposition. Nous acceptons deux limites propos\u00e9es par les intervenants, qui d\u00e9coulent naturellement de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique de l\u2019art. 25.\n[340] Premi\u00e8rement, l\u2019art. 25 n\u2019accorde pas la primaut\u00e9 au droit autochtone collectif lorsque le fait de donner effet \u00e0 un droit individuel garanti par la Charte aurait une incidence mineure ou accessoire sur le droit collectif (voir le m. interv., p.g. Alberta, par. 35).\n[341] Deuxi\u00e8mement, il est appropri\u00e9 de restreindre l\u2019application de l\u2019art. 25 aux situations dans lesquelles une partie invoquant cette disposition d\u00e9montre que l\u2019exercice contest\u00e9 du droit autochtone collectif est n\u00e9cessaire au maintien de la culture distinctive de la communaut\u00e9 autochtone (voir le m. interv., p.g. Canada, par. 48\u201153). Cette limitation est conforme \u00e0 l\u2019objet de l\u2019art. 25 de prot\u00e9ger les droits uniques que d\u00e9tiennent les peuples autochtones et qui sont intrins\u00e8quement li\u00e9s \u00e0 leurs identit\u00e9s distinctivement culturelles et collectives. En outre, comme le souligne le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, le crit\u00e8re de n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 est compatible avec la mani\u00e8re dont s\u2019y prend notre Cour pour d\u00e9terminer la port\u00e9e des autres protections susceptibles d\u2019entrer en conflit avec les droits individuels garantis par la Charte (voir Chagnon, par. 27\u201128 (privil\u00e8ge parlementaire); Canada (Chambre des communes) c. Vaid, 2005 CSC 30, [2005] 1 R.C.S. 667, par. 41 (privil\u00e8ge parlementaire); Alberta (Affaires autochtones et D\u00e9veloppement du Nord) c. Cunningham, 2011 CSC 37, [2011] 2 R.C.S. 670, par. 45 (programmes am\u00e9liorateurs); Kapp, par. 52 (programmes am\u00e9liorateurs); Adler c. Ontario, [1996] 3 R.C.S. 609, par. 49 (\u00e9coles confessionnelles)). Il est crucial qu\u2019une \u00e9valuation de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 tienne compte des points de vue autochtones (voir Corbiere, par. 54 et 67, la juge L\u2019Heureux\u2011Dub\u00e9). Au moment d\u2019effectuer cette \u00e9valuation, il pourrait \u00eatre opportun de se demander si la contestation fond\u00e9e sur la Charte est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par un membre de la communaut\u00e9 autochtone ou par une partie externe, puisque cela peut \u00e9clairer la question de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9.\n[342] Les deux limites quant \u00e0 ce qui constitue une atteinte \u00e0 un droit garanti par l\u2019art. 25 incluent une mise en balance des droits autochtones collectifs et des droits individuels garantis par la Charte. Elles servent \u00e0 \u00e9viter les situations dans lesquelles un empi\u00e8tement insignifiant sur un droit collectif vis\u00e9 par l\u2019art. 25 prime sur une violation potentiellement grave de la Charte.\n[343] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, l\u2019art. 25 prescrit une op\u00e9ration d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation afin de r\u00e9soudre les difficult\u00e9s que posent les droits autochtones collectifs et les droits individuels garantis par la Charte qui s\u2019opposent. Le tribunal doit interpr\u00e9ter les deux droits afin de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019ils peuvent tous deux \u00eatre pr\u00e9serv\u00e9s. Si cela n\u2019est pas possible, le tribunal doit examiner si le fait de donner effet \u00e0 un droit individuel garanti par la Charte aurait une incidence plus que mineure ou accessoire sur le droit collectif, et si l\u2019exercice contest\u00e9 du droit collectif est n\u00e9cessaire au maintien de la culture distinctive de la communaut\u00e9 autochtone. Ce n\u2019est qu\u2019alors que l\u2019exercice d\u2019un droit autochtone collectif justifierait une incidence sur des droits individuels garantis par la Charte. Il est donc inappropri\u00e9 de qualifier l\u2019art. 25 de bouclier qui exclut toute fonction d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation, de mise en balance ou de conciliation d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats oppos\u00e9s.\nIV. Application du par. 15(1) et de l\u2019art. 25 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce\n[344] Comme la VGFN s\u2019appuie sur l\u2019art. 25 relativement \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence, la premi\u00e8re question est de savoir s\u2019il y a atteinte au droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 que le par. 15(1) de la Charte garantit \u00e0 Mme Dickson.\nA. Y a\u2011t\u2011il violation du par. 15(1)?\n[345] Le paragraphe 15(1) de la Charte dispose que \u00ab [l]a loi ne fait acception de personne et s\u2019applique \u00e9galement \u00e0 tous, et tous ont droit \u00e0 la m\u00eame protection et au m\u00eame b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de la loi, ind\u00e9pendamment de toute discrimination, notamment des discriminations fond\u00e9es sur la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, le sexe, l\u2019\u00e2ge ou les d\u00e9ficiences mentales ou physiques. \u00bb \u00c0 l\u2019instar des autres dispositions de la Charte conf\u00e9rant des droits, il doit recevoir une interpr\u00e9tation large et t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique (Hunter, p. 155\u2011156).\n[346] Notre Cour a constamment qualifi\u00e9 de r\u00e9elle la garantie d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9. L\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle reconna\u00eet que \u00ab des d\u00e9savantages syst\u00e9miques persistants ont eu pour effet de restreindre les possibilit\u00e9s offertes aux membres de certains groupes de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et elle vise \u00e0 emp\u00eacher tout acte qui contribue \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuer ces d\u00e9savantages \u00bb (Premi\u00e8re Nation de Kahkewistahaw c. Taypotat, 2015 CSC 30, [2015] 2 R.C.S. 548, par. 17). Le crit\u00e8re actuel a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9labor\u00e9 dans Qu\u00e9bec (Procureure g\u00e9n\u00e9rale) c. Alliance du personnel professionnel et technique de la sant\u00e9 et des services sociaux, 2018 CSC 17, [2018] 1 R.C.S. 464, puis confirm\u00e9 dans Fraser et Sharma.\n[347] Pour avoir gain de cause en vertu du par. 15(1), le demandeur doit d\u00e9montrer que la loi ou l\u2019acte de l\u2019\u00c9tat : (1) cr\u00e9e, \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue ou de par son effet, une distinction fond\u00e9e sur un motif \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9 ou analogue; (2) impose un fardeau ou nie un avantage d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui a pour effet de renforcer, de perp\u00e9tuer ou d\u2019accentuer le d\u00e9savantage (Fraser, par. 27; Sharma, par. 28).\n(1) Premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape : \u00e9tablir une distinction fond\u00e9e sur un motif prot\u00e9g\u00e9\n[348] Une loi peut cr\u00e9er une distinction de deux mani\u00e8res. Lorsqu\u2019elle le fait directement, il s\u2019agit d\u2019un exemple de discrimination directe. La loi contest\u00e9e peut aussi cr\u00e9er une distinction indirectement, de par son effet. Il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019un exemple de discrimination par suite d\u2019effets pr\u00e9judiciables. Au lieu de cr\u00e9er une distinction \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, la loi cr\u00e9e la distinction en ayant un effet n\u00e9gatif disproportionn\u00e9 sur un groupe particulier (Fraser, par. 30).\n[349] La preuve requise pour \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019une distinction varie selon le contexte (Withler, par. 37). Lorsqu\u2019une loi cr\u00e9e \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue une distinction, on peut satisfaire \u00e0 ce crit\u00e8re en prenant simplement connaissance du texte applicable. \u00c0 l\u2019inverse, dans des affaires de \u00ab discrimination par suite d\u2019un effet pr\u00e9judiciable \u00bb, les demandeurs auront g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00ab une t\u00e2che plus lourde \u00bb (Sharma, par. 189, la juge Karakatsanis, dissidente, citant Withler, par. 64). Peu importe le contexte, \u00ab le tribunal doit en fin de compte se concentrer sur le crit\u00e8re \u00bb (Sharma, par. 38 (en italique dans l\u2019original)). Le crit\u00e8re indique clairement que la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape n\u2019exige qu\u2019une distinction \u00ab fond\u00e9e sur un motif prot\u00e9g\u00e9 \u00bb (Fraser, par. 50 (nous soulignons)).\n[350] Une fois que le demandeur \u00e9tablit que la loi contest\u00e9e cr\u00e9e une distinction \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue ou de par son effet, il doit \u00e9tablir que la distinction est fond\u00e9e sur un motif \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9 ou analogue. L\u2019arr\u00eat Corbiere demeure l\u2019analyse la plus compl\u00e8te des motifs analogues effectu\u00e9e par notre Cour. D\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019arr\u00eat Corbiere, l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment commun aux caract\u00e9ristiques personnelles d\u00e9crites dans les motifs \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s, et donc l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment d\u00e9terminant dont il faut se servir pour relever des motifs analogues, est l\u2019immutabilit\u00e9. Pour qu\u2019une caract\u00e9ristique personnelle soit immuable et donc reconnue en tant que motif analogue, elle doit \u00eatre soit immuable dans les faits ou modifiable uniquement \u00e0 un prix inacceptable du point de vue de l\u2019identit\u00e9 personnelle (par. 13). Dans Corbiere, la Cour a conclu que l\u2019art. 77 de la Loi sur les Indiens, L.R.C. 1985, c. I\u20115, lequel niait aux membres hors r\u00e9serve le droit de voter \u00e0 une \u00e9lection de la bande, violait le par. 15(1) de la Charte. Ce faisant, elle a affirm\u00e9 que le fait d\u2019\u00eatre membre hors r\u00e9serve d\u2019une bande est un motif analogue de discrimination.\n[351] Dans Corbiere, les juges McLachlin et Bastarache, s\u2019exprimant conjointement pour le compte des juges majoritaires, ont aussi pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019une fois qu\u2019une caract\u00e9ristique personnelle est reconnue comme un motif analogue, elle servira de motif analogue dans tous les contextes. Les motifs prot\u00e9g\u00e9s ne varient pas selon le contexte; ils constituent des \u00ab indicateurs permanents de l\u2019existence d\u2019un processus d\u00e9cisionnel suspect ou de discrimination potentielle \u00bb, et la seule variable est \u00ab la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la question de savoir s\u2019ils sont source de discrimination dans les circonstances particuli\u00e8res d\u2019une affaire donn\u00e9e \u00bb (par. 8).\na) Application\n(i) L\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence cr\u00e9e une distinction\n[352] L\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence cr\u00e9e une distinction directement bas\u00e9e, suivant ses termes m\u00eames, sur le fait qu\u2019un citoyen de la VGFN r\u00e9side sur les terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es de la VGFN ou \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cart de celles\u2011ci. La distinction est \u00ab visible et imm\u00e9diat[e] \u00bb (Taypotat, par. 33; Fraser, par. 61), et la VGFN le conc\u00e8de (m.i., par. 130).\n(ii) Le motif de l\u2019autochtonit\u00e9\u2011lieu de r\u00e9sidence s\u2019applique\n[353] La VGFN fait valoir que m\u00eame si une distinction existe, le motif analogue de l\u2019autochtonit\u00e9\u2011lieu de r\u00e9sidence ne s\u2019applique pas en dehors du contexte de la Loi sur les Indiens. Selon elle, l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence cr\u00e9e une distinction fond\u00e9e uniquement sur le lieu de r\u00e9sidence, qui n\u2019est pas un motif prot\u00e9g\u00e9 (m.i., par. 131, mentionnant R. c. Turpin, [1989] 1 R.C.S. 1296, p. 1333; Corbiere, par. 13; Siemens c. Manitoba (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2003 CSC 3, [2003] 1 R.C.S. 6, par. 47\u201148; Canadian Snowbirds Association Inc. c. Ontario (Attorney General), 2020 ONSC 5652, 152 O.R. (3d) 738 (C. div.), par. 73). Puisque d\u2019autres gouvernements au sein du Canada peuvent imposer une obligation de r\u00e9sidence pour leurs corps dirigeants (aussi appel\u00e9s \u00ab organes directeurs \u00bb dans l\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale), il n\u2019y a aucune raison pour laquelle il serait [traduction] \u00ab intrins\u00e8quement louche \u00bb que la VGFN fasse la m\u00eame chose, \u00ab compte tenu de ses propres culture et tradition \u00bb (m.i., par. 150). La VGFN n\u2019est pas une \u00ab bande \u00bb, elle n\u2019a jamais eu de r\u00e9serve, et ses citoyens sont assujettis \u00e0 sa Constitution. L\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence n\u2019est pas impos\u00e9e par la Couronne, mais par les citoyens de la VGFN [traduction] \u00ab exer[\u00e7ant] librement et d\u00e9mocratiquement leur droit inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale \u00bb (par. 143). Dire des citoyens de la VGFN qu\u2019ils sont des [traduction] \u00ab membres d\u2019une bande \u00bb et traiter leurs terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es comme une \u00ab r\u00e9serve \u00bb \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 diminuer les r\u00e9alisations uniques que sont la pr\u00e9servation et l\u2019exercice de l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale inh\u00e9rente \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur du cadre \u00ab clivant et contradictoire \u00bb de la Loi sur les Indiens (par. 144).\n[354] Madame Dickson r\u00e9pond que l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation que la VGFN donne de l\u2019arr\u00eat Corbiere est trop \u00e9troite (m.i. au pourvoi incident, par. 48). Il n\u2019importe pas pour l\u2019Autochtone victime d\u2019in\u00e9galit\u00e9 de savoir si la distinction discriminatoire en question a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, son gouvernement provincial ou territorial, ou encore son propre gouvernement autochtone \u2014 qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse d\u2019une bande au sens de la Loi sur les Indiens ou d\u2019une nation autonome (par. 46). La source de l\u2019autochtonit\u00e9\u2011lieu de r\u00e9sidence est la caract\u00e9ristique consid\u00e9r\u00e9e immuable de devoir choisir [traduction] \u00ab entre vivre avec les autres membres de la bande \u00e0 laquelle [on] appartien[t] ou vivre \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cart de ceux\u2011ci \u00bb, un choix qui \u00ab se rattache \u00e0 une communaut\u00e9 et \u00e0 un territoire qui ont une importance sociale et culturelle particuli\u00e8re pour bon nombre, voire la plupart, des membres de la bande \u00bb (par. 49, citant Corbiere, par. 62, la juge L\u2019Heureux\u2011Dub\u00e9). Retenir l\u2019argument de la VGFN selon lequel l\u2019autochtonit\u00e9\u2011lieu de r\u00e9sidence s\u2019applique uniquement dans le contexte de la Loi sur les Indiens reviendrait \u00e0 souscrire \u00e0 l\u2019opinion selon laquelle notre Cour avait l\u2019intention d\u2019accorder la protection du droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 \u00e0 certains Autochtones mais non \u00e0 d\u2019autres, m\u00eame si tous les peuples autochtones souffrent des effets pr\u00e9judiciables des politiques d\u2019assimilation et de d\u00e9placement men\u00e9es par le Canada.\n[355] Comme les circonstances factuelles de la pr\u00e9sente esp\u00e8ce sont notablement distinctes de celles de l\u2019affaire Corbiere, il ne suffit pas qu\u2019un tribunal [traduction] \u00ab suppose par r\u00e9flexe \u00bb que l\u2019autochtonit\u00e9\u2011lieu de r\u00e9sidence \u2014 \u00ab une expression qui, de prime abord, semble indiqu\u00e9e \u00bb \u2014 est effectivement pertinente ici (m.i., par. 136). La Cour doit s\u00e9rieusement se demander si les m\u00eames tendances discriminatoires \u00ab intrins\u00e8quement louche[s] \u00bb qui vont de pair avec \u00ab l\u2019autochtonit\u00e9\u2011lieu de r\u00e9sidence \u00bb interviennent dans le pr\u00e9sent contexte. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9tape des motifs analogues de l\u2019analyse, il faut se demander si la diff\u00e9rence de traitement \u00e0 laquelle sont soumises les personnes d\u00e9finies par cette caract\u00e9ristique ou combinaison de caract\u00e9ristiques est susceptible de violer la dignit\u00e9 humaine au sens qui sous\u2011tend le par. 15(1) (Egan c. Canada, [1995] 2 R.C.S. 513, par. 171, les juges Cory et Iacobucci, dissidents; Corbiere, par. 59, la juge L\u2019Heureux\u2011Dub\u00e9).\n[356] Le syst\u00e8me des r\u00e9serves a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9 par la Loi sur les Indiens, et son histoire est ancr\u00e9e dans un projet colonial particulier qui ne saurait \u00eatre assimil\u00e9 \u00e0 des nations autochtones autonomes. La cr\u00e9ation de r\u00e9serves a servi \u00e0 confiner les peuples autochtones dans des territoires pr\u00e9cis, souvent des terres \u00ab st\u00e9riles \u00bb (voir Jack c. La Reine, [1980] 1 R.C.S. 294). La Loi sur les Indiens dictait effectivement l\u2019identit\u00e9 autochtone au Canada. Sans statut d\u2019Indien, ni appartenance \u00e0 une bande, les Autochtones n\u2019\u00e9taient pas autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 vivre sur les terres de r\u00e9serve attribu\u00e9es \u00e0 leur communaut\u00e9. La Loi sur les Indiens a rompu ainsi les relations entre les membres des bandes habitant les r\u00e9serves et ceux qui vivent hors de celles\u2011ci et a \u00e9cart\u00e9 les Autochtones qui ne pouvaient pas prouver qu\u2019ils avaient un lien de parent\u00e9 patrilin\u00e9aire avec des membres de leur communaut\u00e9 (B. Lawrence, \u00ab Gender, Race, and the Regulation of Native Identity in Canada and the United States : An Overview \u00bb (2003), 18:2 Hypatia 3, p. 6 et 20).\n[357] \u00c0 l\u2019oppos\u00e9, la VGFN fonctionne pr\u00e9sentement en dehors du cadre de la Loi sur les Indiens. La VGFN a particip\u00e9 aux 20 ann\u00e9es de n\u00e9gociations ayant conduit \u00e0 l\u2019Accord\u2011cadre d\u00e9finitif conclu en 1993. Les Vuntut Gwitchin sont un sous\u2011groupe distinct de la Nation Gwich\u2019in. Les Vuntut Gwitchin se gouvernent eux\u2011m\u00eames en tant que nation depuis des temps imm\u00e9moriaux, bien avant la colonisation britannique (motifs de premi\u00e8re instance, par. 11). Leur territoire traditionnel comprend une grande partie du Nord du Yukon, et des preuves arch\u00e9ologiques r\u00e9v\u00e8lent que ce territoire est occup\u00e9 depuis pr\u00e8s de 40 000 ans.\n[358] Fait important, bien que le mode de vie des Vuntut Gwitchin ait surv\u00e9cu \u00e0 l\u2019imposition de la Loi sur les Indiens, le peuple Vuntut Gwitchin a \u00e9t\u00e9 profond\u00e9ment affect\u00e9 par les lois et politiques coloniales, y compris l\u2019imposition des pensionnats et l\u2019exploitation des ressources sur leur territoire. M\u00eame si les Vuntut Gwitchin sont parvenus \u00e0 conserver leur culture et leur mode de vie terrestre, [traduction] \u00ab les pressions de l\u2019assimilation culturelle et du d\u00e9placement se font toujours sentir sur les Vuntut Gwitchin en tant que groupe minoritaire au Canada \u00bb (motifs de premi\u00e8re instance, par. 13).\n[359] Certes, notre Cour n\u2019a jamais \u00e9tendu le motif de l\u2019autochtonit\u00e9\u2011lieu de r\u00e9sidence hors du cadre de la Loi sur les Indiens, mais la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a appliqu\u00e9 l\u2019autochtonit\u00e9\u2011lieu de r\u00e9sidence dans des affaires mettant en cause le par. 15(1) o\u00f9 les conseils sont choisis conform\u00e9ment aux coutumes des bandes (m.i. au pourvoi incident, par. 58; voir Cockerill c. Premi\u00e8re nation no 468 de Fort McMurray, 2010 CF 337, par. 28\u201129 et 33 (CanLII); Thompson c. Conseil de la Premi\u00e8re Nation Leq\u2019\u00e1:mel, 2007 CF 707, par. 8 et 13 (CanLII); Clifton c. Bande indienne de Hartley Bay, 2005 CF 1030, [2006] 2 R.C.F. 24, par. 44\u201145 et 50; Cardinal c. Nation des Cris de Bigstone, 2018 CF 822, [2019] 1 R.C.F. 3, par. 48 et 51).\n[360] L\u2019autochtonit\u00e9\u2011lieu de r\u00e9sidence diff\u00e8re des autres formes de r\u00e9sidence en raison du lien particulier qui unit les peuples autochtones \u00e0 leur assise territoriale ou territoire ancestral. Comme l\u2019a expliqu\u00e9 la Commission royale :\nDe plus, les autochtones citadins associent l\u2019identit\u00e9 culturelle \u00e0 la notion d\u2019assise territoriale ou de territoire ancestral. Pour nombre d\u2019entre eux, ces deux concepts sont indissociables . . .\n. . .\nIl est important pour les autochtones citadins de pouvoir s\u2019identifier \u00e0 un lieu ancestral, en raison des rituels, des c\u00e9r\u00e9monies et des traditions qui y sont associ\u00e9s, des gens qui y vivent, du sentiment d\u2019appartenance, du lien avec une communaut\u00e9 ancestrale et de la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019acc\u00e9der \u00e0 la famille, \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9 et aux anciens.\n(Rapport de la Commission royale sur les peuples autochtones, vol. 4, Perspectives et r\u00e9alit\u00e9s, p. 589\u2011590; voir aussi le vol. 1, ch. 6.)\n[361] Dans Archibald c. Canada, [2000] 4 C.F. 479, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale s\u2019est demand\u00e9 si la disposition relative \u00e0 la mise en commun obligatoire de la Loi sur la Commission canadienne du bl\u00e9, L.R.C. 1985, c. C\u201124, laquelle oblige les producteurs de bl\u00e9 vivant dans certaines r\u00e9gions du Canada \u00e0 vendre tout leur bl\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission canadienne du bl\u00e9 et leur interdit de le vendre dans une autre province ou \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger, viole les droits garantis aux appelants par la Charte. Le juge Rothstein n\u2019\u00e9tait pas convaincu que le lieu de r\u00e9sidence \u00e9tait un motif analogue. En appliquant l\u2019arr\u00eat Corbiere \u00e0 l\u2019affaire dont il \u00e9tait saisi, il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit au par. 23 :\nIl ressort de l\u2019arr\u00eat Corbiere que la r\u00e9sidence doit \u00eatre associ\u00e9e \u00e0 autre chose qui est fondamentale \u00e0 l\u2019identit\u00e9 de quelqu\u2019un, qui est immuable ou \u00e0 tout le moins consid\u00e9r\u00e9e immuable. Ainsi, il ne suffit pas pour les fins de l\u2019identification du motif analogue que le lieu de la r\u00e9sidence et de l\u2019exploitation agricole d\u2019un individu soit \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur de la r\u00e9gion d\u00e9sign\u00e9e ou m\u00eame \u00e0 tout endroit au Canada. Il faut quelque chose de plus. [Nous soulignons.]\n[362] Contrairement aux circonstances de l\u2019affaire Archibald, le lieu de r\u00e9sidence des citoyens de la VGFN touche \u00e0 l\u2019essence m\u00eame de leur identit\u00e9 (Premi\u00e8re nation des Chippewas de Nawash c. Canada (Ministre des P\u00eaches et des Oc\u00e9ans), 2002 CAF 485, [2003] 3 C.F. 233, par. 40). L\u2019\u00ab autre chose \u00bb, c\u2019est le lien qui existe entre les citoyens de la VGFN et leur territoire traditionnel particulier, lien qui milite contre le fait pour tout membre du groupe de quitter sa communaut\u00e9 pour s\u2019\u00e9tablir dans un centre urbain. Par cons\u00e9quent, \u00ab cette caract\u00e9ristique n\u2019est pas moins consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme immuable que la religion ou la citoyennet\u00e9 \u00bb (Chippewas, par. 40).\n[363] En raison de l\u2019h\u00e9ritage de la Loi sur les Indiens, certains citoyens de la VGFN sont contraints de faire le choix d\u00e9chirant de vivre \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 d\u2019autres membres de leur communaut\u00e9 ou de courir le risque de manquer certaines occasions, y compris l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 un logement, \u00e0 des services sociaux, \u00e0 une \u00e9ducation et \u00e0 un emploi ad\u00e9quats. Le \u00ab choix \u00bb de vivre \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de leur territoire traditionnel les expose au risque de voir leurs int\u00e9r\u00eats n\u00e9glig\u00e9s ou de voir leurs opinions sous\u2011repr\u00e9sent\u00e9es au sein des sph\u00e8res de pouvoir politiques (voir Corbiere, par. 62, la juge L\u2019Heureux\u2011Dub\u00e9). Bien que la situation des membres de bandes vivant hors r\u00e9serve ne soit pas identique \u00e0 celle des citoyens Vuntut Gwitchin qui vivent \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de leur territoire traditionnel, le legs qu\u2019a laiss\u00e9 le colonialisme par le truchement de la Loi sur les Indiens est un d\u00e9nominateur commun aux deux groupes, si bien que le motif analogue de \u00ab l\u2019autochtonit\u00e9\u2011lieu de r\u00e9sidence \u00bb demeure applicable en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. M\u00eame si la VGFN n\u2019est plus assujettie \u00e0 la Loi sur les Indiens, la discrimination subie par les Autochtones qui vivent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cart de leur communaut\u00e9, telle qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crite dans l\u2019affaire Corbiere, est toujours v\u00e9cue par les citoyens de la VGFN, et elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9radiqu\u00e9e lorsque la VGFN a conclu une entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale (par. 62). Nous sommes donc d\u2019accord avec Mme Dickson pour dire que le motif analogue de \u00ab l\u2019autochtonit\u00e9\u2011lieu de r\u00e9sidence \u00bb s\u2019applique en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n(2) Deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape : \u00e9tablir la discrimination\n[364] \u00c0 la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse relative au par. 15(1), le demandeur doit \u00e9tablir que la distinction impose un fardeau ou refuse un avantage de mani\u00e8re discriminatoire.\n[365] L\u2019exigence que la loi contest\u00e9e cr\u00e9e une distinction imposant un fardeau ou refusant un avantage a pour effet d\u2019\u00e9carter les contestations fond\u00e9es sur le par. 15(1) qui mettent en cause des distinctions qui n\u2019ont pas d\u2019effet n\u00e9gatif sur le demandeur. Si la distinction cr\u00e9\u00e9e par la loi a un effet \u00ab b\u00e9n\u00e9fique ou b\u00e9nin \u00bb sur le demandeur, la demande fond\u00e9e sur le par. 15(1) sera rejet\u00e9e (Qu\u00e9bec (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. A, 2013 CSC 5, [2013] 1 R.C.S. 61, par. 151, le juge LeBel, citant Gosselin c. Qu\u00e9bec (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2002 CSC 84, [2002] 4 R.C.S. 429, par. 243, le juge Bastarache, dissident; voir aussi Withler, par. 37).\n[366] De plus, la distinction n\u2019est discriminatoire que si elle renforce, perp\u00e9tue ou accentue le d\u00e9savantage. Cela suppose la recherche d\u2019un d\u00e9savantage qui existe ind\u00e9pendamment de \u2014 et qui est renforc\u00e9, perp\u00e9tu\u00e9 ou accentu\u00e9 par \u2014 la distinction contest\u00e9e. Elle n\u00e9cessite un examen des d\u00e9savantages syst\u00e9miques ou historiques dont a fait l\u2019objet le groupe demandeur (Sharma, par. 52; Fraser, par. 76). Les d\u00e9savantages ne s\u2019entendent pas seulement du d\u00e9savantage \u00e9conomique, mais comprennent d\u2019autres formes de d\u00e9savantage comme l\u2019exclusion sociale, le pr\u00e9judice physique et psychologique et l\u2019exclusion politique (Sharma, par. 52; Fraser, par. 76, citant C. Sheppard, Inclusive Equality : The Relational Dimensions of Systemic Discrimination in Canada (2010), p. 62\u201163). M\u00eame si le d\u00e9savantage est le point de mire de l\u2019exigence de discrimination, les pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s et les st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes peuvent satisfaire \u00e0 cette exigence (Sharma, par. 53; Fraser, par. 78).\na) Le r\u00f4le du contexte l\u00e9gislatif\n[367] Les demandes fond\u00e9es sur la Charte doivent \u00eatre examin\u00e9es dans leur contexte. Toutefois, il ne convient de tenir compte \u00e0 ce stade que du contexte pertinent et n\u00e9cessaire pour l\u2019analyse relative au par. 15(1), o\u00f9 le fardeau de preuve incombe au demandeur : \u00ab Le clivage entre le par. 15(1) et l\u2019article premier r\u00e9side dans la justification de la mesure, une d\u00e9monstration qui incombe \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tat \u00bb (Sharma, par. 202, la juge Karakatsanis, dissidente). Le test du par. 15(1) oblige seulement les demandeurs \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que la loi ou mesure de l\u2019\u00c9tat attaqu\u00e9e a un effet discriminatoire sur eux (Miron c. Trudel, [1995] 2 R.C.S. 418, par. 139; Fraser, par. 79).\n[368] Le contexte l\u00e9gislatif s\u2019av\u00e8re parfois pertinent et n\u00e9cessaire pour que le demandeur s\u2019acquitte de son fardeau. \u00ab [L]\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments contextuels de la situation du groupe de demandeurs et de l\u2019effet r\u00e9el de la mesure l\u00e9gislative sur leur situation \u00bb s\u2019impose au regard du par. 15(1) (Sharma, par. 57, citant Withler, par. 43; voir aussi Withler, par. 40; Turpin, p. 1334; Law c. Canada (Ministre de l\u2019Emploi et de l\u2019Immigration), [1999] 1 R.C.S. 497, par. 30; Qu\u00e9bec c. A, par. 51; Taypotat, par. 18; Ontario (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. G, 2020 CSC 38, [2020] 3 R.C.S. 629, par. 43). Dans Corbiere, il incombait au demandeur d\u2019\u00e9tablir que \u00ab les pouvoirs des \u00e9lecteurs ou ceux du chef et du conseil qu\u2019ils \u00e9lisent \u00bb ne touchaient pas uniquement \u00e0 des questions de nature \u00ab purement locale \u00bb (par. 74, la juge L\u2019Heureux\u2011Dub\u00e9). La Cour a jug\u00e9 que, m\u00eame si certaines des mati\u00e8res dont traitait le conseil de bande, comme l\u2019application de la loi et le contr\u00f4le de la circulation, ne touchaient que les r\u00e9sidents de la r\u00e9serve, bien d\u2019autres mati\u00e8res touchaient tous les membres de la bande. Les politiques et d\u00e9penses relatives \u00e0 \u00ab l\u2019\u00e9ducation, la construction de nouvelles habitations, l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019installations dans les r\u00e9serves, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 d\u2019autres fins susceptibles d\u2019avoir une incidence sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e9conomique qu\u2019ont les membres hors r\u00e9serve \u00bb concern\u00e9s, peu importe o\u00f9 ils vivaient (par. 77). Les restrictions au droit de vote portaient atteinte \u00e0 des int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e9trangers au lieu de r\u00e9sidence, et elles ont donc \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9es discriminatoires (par. 73\u201178 et 92). Il revenait \u00e0 bon droit aux demandeurs de d\u00e9montrer en quoi les politiques de la bande leur nuisaient de mani\u00e8re discriminatoire.\n[369] Dans Sharma, une majorit\u00e9 de la Cour a expliqu\u00e9 en d\u00e9tail les facteurs pertinents pour appr\u00e9cier le contexte l\u00e9gislatif : \u00ab . . . les objets du r\u00e9gime, la question de savoir si la politique est con\u00e7ue dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de divers groupes, l\u2019affectation des ressources, les objectifs d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public particuliers vis\u00e9s par le l\u00e9gislateur et la question de savoir si les limites pr\u00e9vues par le r\u00e9gime tiennent compte de ces facteurs . . . \u00bb (par. 59, mentionnant Withler, par. 67). \u00ab Il ne faut toutefois pas confondre le contexte et la justification \u00bb que requiert l\u2019article premier (R. c. C.P., 2021 CSC 19, [2021] 1 R.C.S. 679, par. 57, la juge Abella). Bien qu\u2019une partie ou l\u2019ensemble de ces facteurs soient pertinents pour l\u2019application du par. 15(1), \u00ab le tribunal doit en fin de compte se concentrer sur le crit\u00e8re \u00bb (Sharma, par. 38 (en italique dans l\u2019original)). Le fardeau incombant au demandeur consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que \u00ab la loi ou la mesure \u00e9tatique contest\u00e9e a un effet discriminatoire sur un groupe d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 \u00bb (par. 202, la juge Karakatsanis, dissidente, citant Miron, par. 139; voir aussi Fraser, par. 79). \u00c0 moins que ces consid\u00e9rations n\u2019aient trait \u00e0 \u00ab l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments contextuels de la situation du groupe de demandeurs \u00bb ou \u00e0 \u00ab l\u2019effet r\u00e9el de la mesure l\u00e9gislative sur leur situation \u00bb (Withler, par. 43), il vaut mieux se pencher sur le contexte l\u00e9gislatif \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la justification. Seul le corps dirigeant a une connaissance approfondie de ses choix de politique et objectifs l\u00e9gislatifs, et il devrait lui appartenir \u00e0 juste titre de les expliquer au regard de l\u2019article premier. Analyser s\u00e9par\u00e9ment les droits de leurs restrictions favorise la clart\u00e9 et la protection t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique de la Charte.\nb) Application\n(i) La distinction refuse un avantage\n[370] Tout d\u2019abord, le demandeur doit \u00e9tablir que la distinction refuse un avantage ou impose un fardeau. L\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence refuse \u00e0 Mme Dickson l\u2019avantage de servir au sein du gouvernement. C\u2019est une forme d\u2019exclusion politique (Sharma, par. 52; Fraser, par. 76, citant Sheppard, p. 62\u201163), qui \u00e9carte Mme Dickson d\u2019un aspect essentiel de la participation d\u00e9mocratique et l\u2019emp\u00eache d\u2019influer sur les processus d\u00e9cisionnels qui la touchent.\n[371] Nous convenons avec Mme Dickson que [traduction] \u00ab [l]e droit de se porter candidat et de si\u00e9ger est une caract\u00e9ristique d\u00e9terminante de la d\u00e9mocratie \u00bb et \u00ab un pilier des gouvernements d\u00e9mocratiques prot\u00e9g\u00e9 tant \u00e0 l\u2019art. 3 de la Charte qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019article 25 du Pacte international relatif aux droits civils et politiques. Il s\u2019agit non pas d\u2019un droit \u201c\u00e9troit\u201d, mais d\u2019un droit politique fondamental, et sa n\u00e9gation est grave \u00bb (m.i. au pourvoi incident, par. 68, citant Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la s\u00e9cession du Qu\u00e9bec, [1998] 2 R.C.S. 217, par. 65; Frank c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2019 CSC 1, [2019] 1 R.C.S. 3, par. 82; Sauv\u00e9 c. Canada (Directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des \u00e9lections), 2002 CSC 68, [2002] 3 R.C.S. 519, par. 59; Harvey c. Nouveau\u2011Brunswick (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), [1996] 2 R.C.S. 876, par. 23\u201130). L\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence satisfait \u00e0 l\u2019exigence que la distinction refuse un avantage.\n(ii) L\u2019avantage est refus\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re discriminatoire\n[372] Ensuite, le demandeur doit \u00e9tablir que la distinction imposant le fardeau ou refusant l\u2019avantage est discriminatoire. Un avantage discriminatoire en est un qui renforce, perp\u00e9tue ou accentue le d\u00e9savantage. Cette \u00e9tape implique l\u2019examen du d\u00e9savantage historique ou syst\u00e9mique que subit le groupe de demandeurs. Des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve sur la \u00ab situation du groupe de demandeurs \u00bb et les \u00ab obstacles, notamment physiques, sociaux ou culturels \u00bb auxquels ses membres sont confront\u00e9s, ainsi que des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00ab sur les cons\u00e9quences pratiques de la loi ou politique contest\u00e9e \u00bb sont particuli\u00e8rement utiles (Fraser, par. 55\u201159; Sharma, par. 192, la juge Karakatsanis, dissidente).\n[373] Bien qu\u2019une loi contest\u00e9e puisse franchir cette \u00e9tape en \u00e9largissant le d\u00e9savantage relatif d\u2019un groupe, le mot \u00ab perp\u00e9tuer \u00bb indique qu\u2019une loi peut \u00eatre discriminatoire m\u00eame si elle n\u2019accentue pas ce d\u00e9savantage. \u00ab Il faut bien veiller \u00e0 ne pas n\u00e9gliger la possibilit\u00e9 que la discrimination d\u00e9coule [traduction] \u201cdu fait d\u2019agir \u2018comme nous l\u2019avons toujours fait\u2019\u201d \u00bb (Sharma, par. 193, la juge Karakatsanis, dissidente, citant F. Faraday, \u00ab One Step Forward, Two Steps Back? Substantive Equality, Systemic Discrimination and Pay Equity at the Supreme Court of Canada \u00bb (2020), 94 S.C.L.R. (2d) 301, p. 310; voir aussi J. Koshan, \u00ab Intersections and Roads Untravelled : Sex and Family Status in Fraser v Canada \u00bb (2021), 30:2 Forum const. 29, p. 31\u201132).\n[374] Madame Dickson plaide que la distinction cr\u00e9\u00e9e par l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence [traduction] \u00ab perp\u00e9tue et renforce le st\u00e9r\u00e9otype, observ\u00e9 dans Corbiere et les arr\u00eats qui ont suivi, selon lequel les citoyens autochtones qui vivent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cart de leur communaut\u00e9 ne souhaitent pas maintenir un lien significatif avec leur nation et sont moins d\u00e9sireux de pr\u00e9server leur territoire, ce qui laisse entendre qu\u2019ils sont des membres moins m\u00e9ritants de la nation \u00bb (m.i. au pourvoi incident, par. 65). En outre, elle soutient que l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence exacerbe son inaptitude \u00e0 conserver un lien avec sa communaut\u00e9 et \u00e0 pr\u00e9server son identit\u00e9 \u00e0 titre de citoyenne de la VGFN.\n[375] Nous sommes du m\u00eame avis. Durant plus d\u2019un si\u00e8cle, les gouvernements ont cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 encourager l\u2019\u00ab \u00e9mancipation \u00bb ou l\u2019assimilation des Autochtones dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. L\u2019augmentation du nombre d\u2019Autochtones vivant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cart de leurs territoires ancestraux est intrins\u00e8quement li\u00e9e aux s\u00e9quelles de la discrimination. On encourageait les Autochtones \u00e0 renoncer \u00e0 leur identit\u00e9, et [traduction] \u00ab [c]et historique explique pourquoi un grand nombre d\u2019Indiens inscrits vivant hors r\u00e9serve qui sont nominalement membres des Premi\u00e8res Nations n\u2019ont que peu ou pas de lien avec les r\u00e9serves ou leurs communaut\u00e9s \u201cd\u2019origine\u201d \u00bb (m. interv., Congr\u00e8s des peuples autochtones, par. 12). L\u2019in\u00e9galit\u00e9 des droits conf\u00e9r\u00e9s aux personnes qui vivent dans la r\u00e9serve et \u00e0 celles qui vivent hors r\u00e9serve sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi sur les Indiens, comme l\u2019interdiction pour les membres hors r\u00e9serve de la bande de voter sur la gouvernance de celle\u2011ci, a fait \u00e9clater les relations entre ces groupes et, dans bien des cas, elle a coup\u00e9 pour toujours les membres hors r\u00e9serve de leurs communaut\u00e9s. Historiquement, le Canada a aussi adopt\u00e9 des lois qui enlevaient aux femmes leur statut d\u2019Indienne si elles \u00e9pousaient des hommes non inscrits. En 1985, le projet de loi C\u201131, qui est devenu la Loi modifiant la Loi sur les Indiens, S.C. 1985, c. 27, a annul\u00e9 cette politique discriminatoire et r\u00e9tabli le statut d\u2019Indien de nombreuses femmes et de certains de leurs descendants. Cela a toutefois donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 une augmentation soudaine du nombre de femmes autochtones inscrites vivant hors r\u00e9serve (Corbiere, par. 30 et 85\u201186, la juge L\u2019Heureux\u2011Dub\u00e9).\n[376] Les Autochtones vivant en milieu urbain [traduction] \u00ab ont souffert du racisme, du choc des cultures, en plus d\u2019\u00e9prouver de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 conserver certains aspects importants de leur identit\u00e9 \u00bb (m.i. au pourvoi incident, par. 57, citant Corbiere, par. 72, la juge L\u2019Heureux\u2011Dub\u00e9; voir aussi la Commission royale, vol. 4, p. 583\u2011591). En 2019, le rapport publi\u00e9 par l\u2019Enqu\u00eate nationale sur les femmes et les filles autochtones disparues et assassin\u00e9es a conclu qu\u2019en raison d\u2019actes ant\u00e9rieurs du gouvernement, les femmes autochtones en milieu urbain sont \u00ab exclues de leur communaut\u00e9 d\u2019appartenance, se retrouvant parfois m\u00e8res monoparentales devant subvenir seules aux besoins de leurs enfants \u00bb, et elles se trouvent \u00ab souvent \u00e0 des centaines de kilom\u00e8tres de leur domicile et de leurs syst\u00e8mes de soutien social et doivent subir une discrimination raciale qui [est] profond\u00e9ment ancr\u00e9e dans les services urbains et les exp\u00e9riences offertes en milieu urbain \u00bb (R\u00e9clamer notre pouvoir et notre place : le rapport final de l\u2019enqu\u00eate nationale sur les femmes et les filles autochtones disparues et assassin\u00e9es, vol. 1a (2019), p. 296\u2011297; voir aussi le m.i. au pourvoi incident, par. 61).\n[377] Les membres hors r\u00e9serve des bandes indiennes forment une \u00ab minorit\u00e9 discr\u00e8te et isol\u00e9e \u00bb (Corbiere, par. 71, la juge L\u2019Heureux\u2011Dub\u00e9). Les r\u00e9percussions des politiques coloniales et assimilatrices se font toujours sentir. Tout comme les membres hors r\u00e9serve des bandes, d\u2019autres Autochtones qui vivent \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de leur communaut\u00e9 d\u2019appartenance risquent d\u2019\u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant [traduction] \u00ab moins autochtones \u00bb que leurs homologues vivant sur les territoires traditionnels (m. interv., Congr\u00e8s des peuples autochtones, par. 9, citant Lovelace c. Ontario, 2000 CSC 37, [2000] 1 R.C.S. 950, par. 71\u201172; Corbiere, par. 18, les juges McLachlin et Bastarache, et par. 71 et 92, la juge L\u2019Heureux\u2011Dub\u00e9).\n[378] L\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence renforce le st\u00e9r\u00e9otype selon lequel les citoyens non r\u00e9sidents de la VGFN ont moins de valeur et de dignit\u00e9 parce qu\u2019ils vivent \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de leur territoire traditionnel. Les \u00ab pouvoirs [. . .] du conseil de bande ont une incidence sur les droits et besoins des [citoyens vivant sur les terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es et de ceux vivant \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de celles\u2011ci] \u00bb (Corbiere, par. 74, la juge L\u2019Heureux\u2011Dub\u00e9). En emp\u00eachant Mme Dickson et d\u2019autres citoyens de la VGFN qui vivent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cart des terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es de participer au processus d\u00e9cisionnel du gouvernement, l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence perp\u00e9tue \u00e0 tout le moins le d\u00e9savantage. On peut retrouver une preuve directe de ce ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne dans le dossier. Des citoyens de la VGFN qui vivent \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur d\u2019Old Crow, le seul village situ\u00e9 sur les terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es, ont dit avoir le sentiment qu\u2019ils n\u2019\u00e9taient pas des membres appr\u00e9ci\u00e9s de leur communaut\u00e9 en raison de l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 ils vivaient (d.a., vol. II, p. 22, 38 et 42). Une citoyenne a mentionn\u00e9 avoir un acc\u00e8s inad\u00e9quat \u00e0 l\u2019information ou \u00e0 la prise de d\u00e9cisions, ce qui ne l\u2019aide pas \u00e0 conserver des liens avec la communaut\u00e9 (p. 22). Une autre citoyenne a dit se sentir [traduction] \u00ab coup\u00e9e et oubli\u00e9e \u00bb en raison de l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 elle vivait, et que ses opinions n\u2019\u00e9taient pas repr\u00e9sent\u00e9es au Conseil (p. 38). Une troisi\u00e8me citoyenne a dit \u00eatre d\u2019avis qu\u2019il est plus difficile pour les citoyens de la VGFN qui vivent \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur d\u2019Old Crow de [traduction] \u00ab participer \u00e0 la gouvernance de notre nation et de maintenir un lien avec celle\u2011ci \u00bb (p. 42). En excluant les citoyens non r\u00e9sidents d\u2019une v\u00e9ritable participation d\u00e9mocratique, l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence renforce le st\u00e9r\u00e9otype que, pour \u00eatre un \u00ab vra[i] autochton[e] \u00bb, une personne doit vivre dans la r\u00e9serve ou sur les terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es (Corbiere, par. 71, la juge L\u2019Heureux\u2011Dub\u00e9; Cardinal, par. 54).\n[379] Comme il est fait observer dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Corbiere (par. 71 (nous soulignons)), la Commission royale a soulign\u00e9 que \u00ab [l]es d\u00e9cideurs ne tiennent pas toujours compte des points de vue et des besoins des autochtones qui vivent \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur des r\u00e9serves, particuli\u00e8rement en ce qui concerne leur identit\u00e9 autochtone et leur d\u00e9sir de maintenir des liens avec leur patrimoine et leurs racines culturelles \u00bb (vol. 4, p. 583). Le droit de vote, sans jamais arriver \u00e0 voter pour quelqu\u2019un qui repr\u00e9sente ou comprend le point de vue de ceux et celles qui vivent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cart des terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es, ne suffit pas. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu elle aussi dans plusieurs d\u00e9cisions que la possibilit\u00e9 de voter ne remplace pas le fait de servir en tant que membre du Conseil. Dans Esquega c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2007 CF 878, [2008] 1 R.C.F. 795, inf. pour d\u2019autres motifs par 2008 CAF 182, [2009] 1 R.C.F. 448, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a jug\u00e9 que l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence pr\u00e9vue au par. 75(1) de la Loi sur les Indiens violait le par. 15(1) de la Charte. Aux termes de cette disposition, \u00ab [s]eul un \u00e9lecteur r\u00e9sidant dans une section \u00e9lectorale peut \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au poste de conseiller pour repr\u00e9senter cette section au conseil de la bande. \u00bb S\u2019appuyant sur l\u2019arr\u00eat Corbiere, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que \u00ab les membres de bande vivant hors r\u00e9serve ont subi un d\u00e9savantage historique \u00e0 cause de lois et de politiques con\u00e7ues pour les priver du droit de participer \u00e0 l\u2019administration de leur bande \u00bb, et que \u00ab [c]es lois perp\u00e9tuent l\u2019id\u00e9e erron\u00e9e que les membres d\u2019une bande qui vivent hors r\u00e9serve n\u2019ont aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 prendre part \u00e0 l\u2019administration de leur bande et qu\u2019ils sont donc moins dignes de le faire \u00bb (par. 88). La cour a ajout\u00e9 que les membres vivant hors r\u00e9serve \u00ab d\u00e9tiennent le droit fondamental de participer au conseil de bande et de prendre des d\u00e9cisions pour le compte de leur bande \u00bb (par. 91). Selon elle, le par. 75(1) de la Loi sur les Indiens exerce une discrimination \u00ab envers les membres vivant hors r\u00e9serve en leur interdisant de participer \u00e0 l\u2019administration repr\u00e9sentative de leur bande par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire du conseil de bande, en raison de leur statut sur le plan de l\u2019\u201cautochtonit\u00e9\u2011lieu de r\u00e9sidence\u201d \u00bb (par. 92).\n[380] De m\u00eame, dans Joseph c. Conseil de bande de la Premi\u00e8re nation Dzawada\u2019enuxw (Tsawataineuk), 2013 CF 974, le code \u00e9lectoral de 2011 de la Premi\u00e8re nation Dzawada\u2019enuxw (Tsawataineuk) pr\u00e9voyait des postes au gouvernement \u00e0 la fois pour les membres de la bande r\u00e9sidents et les membres de la bande non r\u00e9sidents. Toutefois, bien que trois quarts des membres de la bande \u00e9taient non r\u00e9sidents, trois des quatre postes au Conseil leur \u00e9taient inaccessibles, y compris le poste de pr\u00e9sident. La cour a fait remarquer que, m\u00eame si les membres non r\u00e9sidents \u00e9taient repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s aux d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du Conseil par le conseiller non r\u00e9sident, \u00ab ce conseiller peut facilement \u00eatre battu par les conseillers r\u00e9sidents lorsque les choses se corsent \u00bb (par. 57 (CanLII)). La cour a jug\u00e9 que la distinction que comporte le code cr\u00e9ait \u00ab un d\u00e9savantage en perp\u00e9tuant le st\u00e9r\u00e9otype selon lequel les membres non r\u00e9sidents des bandes indiennes sont moins capables de participer \u00e0 la gouvernance de celles\u2011ci ou sont moins int\u00e9ress\u00e9s \u00e0 le faire \u00bb, et conclu que la restriction violait donc le par. 15(1) de la Charte (par. 58).\n[381] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence n\u2019est pas absolue. Les non\u2011r\u00e9sidents peuvent se porter candidats, pourvu qu\u2019ils [traduction] \u00ab d\u00e9m\u00e9nage[nt] sur les terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es dans les 14 jours qui suivent le jour de l\u2019\u00e9lection \u00bb (Constitution de la VGFN, article XI(2)). Tout fardeau qu\u2019occasionne le d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement est att\u00e9nu\u00e9 par quatre ans de salaire et un logement pour le personnel des Vuntut Gwitchin (m.i., par. 157, citant les motifs de premi\u00e8re instance, par. 156). La VGFN soutient que, vu cette obligation de d\u00e9m\u00e9nager, [traduction] \u00ab il n\u2019y a pas d\u2019exclusion g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 la participation, et pas de n\u00e9gation \u201ctotale\u201d du droit de se porter candidat; cette obligation a plut\u00f4t un effet limit\u00e9 uniquement sur ceux et celles qui sont \u00e9lus au bout du compte \u00bb (m.i., par. 157 (italique omis)).\n[382] Nous partageons l\u2019avis de Mme Dickson qu\u2019obliger un citoyen non r\u00e9sident \u00e0 d\u00e9m\u00e9nager sur les terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es pour participer \u00e0 la gouvernance de la communaut\u00e9 veut dire obliger quelqu\u2019un \u00e0 modifier une caract\u00e9ristique consid\u00e9r\u00e9e immuable (m.i. au pourvoi incident, par. 70\u201171). \u00ab La Cour a toujours conclu qu\u2019une diff\u00e9rence de traitement pouvait \u00eatre discriminatoire m\u00eame si elle est fond\u00e9e sur des choix faits par l\u2019individu ou le groupe touch\u00e9 \u00bb (Fraser, par. 86). Une fois que l\u2019on reconna\u00eet, comme nous le faisons, que l\u2019autochtonit\u00e9\u2011lieu de r\u00e9sidence est un motif de distinction analogue hors du contexte de la r\u00e9serve, le choix n\u2019a plus de pertinence en droit (Fraser, par. 91, citant Miron, par. 153; voir aussi J. Koshan et J. Watson Hamilton, Tugging at the Strands : Adverse Effects Discrimination and the Supreme Court Decision in Fraser, 9 novembre 2020 (en ligne)). Dans Cardinal, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a invalid\u00e9 l\u2019exigence que les conseillers \u00e9lus d\u00e9m\u00e9nagent dans la r\u00e9serve dans les trois mois qui suivent leur \u00e9lection, estimant qu\u2019elle perp\u00e9tue \u00ab le d\u00e9savantage pr\u00e9existant du groupe qui devait en tirer des avantages \u00bb et \u00ab le st\u00e9r\u00e9otype selon lequel seuls les membres r\u00e9sidant dans la r\u00e9serve sont habilit\u00e9s \u00e0 se prononcer sur les affaires de la bande \u00bb (par. 58 et 65). De m\u00eame, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, comme nous avons conclu qu\u2019il existe une distinction discriminatoire fond\u00e9e sur le motif analogue de l\u2019autochtonit\u00e9\u2011lieu de r\u00e9sidence, le choix illusoire de Mme Dickson de retourner habiter sur les terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es n\u2019a plus de pertinence pour les besoins de l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur le par. 15(1). Demander \u00e0 Mme Dickson de d\u00e9m\u00e9nager une fois \u00e9lue, c\u2019est lui demander de modifier une caract\u00e9ristique consid\u00e9r\u00e9e immuable \u2014 comparable au fait de changer de religion ou de citoyennet\u00e9. D\u00e9m\u00e9nager \u00e0 Old Crow ne se r\u00e9sume pas \u00e0 une simple question de co\u00fbts, et n\u2019est pas suffisamment att\u00e9nu\u00e9 par le fait que les conseillers de la VGFN touchent un salaire ou qu\u2019un logement sera offert. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu dans Corbiere, les demandeurs vivent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cart de leur communaut\u00e9 d\u2019appartenance en raison de facteurs ind\u00e9pendants de leur volont\u00e9 tels que \u00ab [l]e manque de terres, le fait qu\u2019il y ait souvent tr\u00e8s peu de possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019emploi dans les r\u00e9serves et la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de s\u2019\u00e9loigner de la communaut\u00e9 pour s\u2019instruire \u00bb (par. 84, la juge L\u2019Heureux\u2011Dub\u00e9). En ce qui concerne Mme Dickson, elle ne peut pas d\u00e9m\u00e9nager principalement en raison du probl\u00e8me de sant\u00e9 de son fils (d.a., vol. II, p. 63).\n[383] La distinction cr\u00e9\u00e9e par l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence impose un fardeau et nie un avantage aux citoyens non r\u00e9sidents comme Mme Dickson d\u2019une fa\u00e7on qui a pour effet de perp\u00e9tuer l\u2019id\u00e9e erron\u00e9e selon laquelle les citoyens qui ne vivent pas sur les terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es ne sont pas int\u00e9ress\u00e9s \u00e0 participer \u00e0 la gouvernance de la communaut\u00e9 et n\u2019ont qu\u2019une capacit\u00e9 r\u00e9duite de le faire. La distinction renforce \u00e9galement le st\u00e9r\u00e9otype suivant lequel les citoyens non r\u00e9sidents sont moins dignes de servir en raison de l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 ils vivent (Cardinal, par. 52).\n[384] Nous concluons donc que l\u2019\u00e9diction par la VGFN de l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence porte atteinte au droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 que le par. 15(1) de la Charte garantit \u00e0 Mme Dickson.\nB. L\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence rel\u00e8ve\u2011t\u2011elle du champ d\u2019application de l\u2019art. 25?\n[385] La seconde question est de savoir si l\u2019art. 25 est en jeu. La pr\u00e9sente affaire fait\u2011elle intervenir un droit autochtone collectif qui rel\u00e8ve du champ d\u2019application de l\u2019art. 25?\n[386] Comme nous l\u2019avons expliqu\u00e9, les droits vis\u00e9s par l\u2019art. 25 sont ceux qui sont propres aux peuples autochtones parce qu\u2019ils sont des Autochtones. En outre, puisque l\u2019art. 25 ne visait pas \u00e0 cr\u00e9er des zones soustraites \u00e0 l\u2019application de la Charte, nous souscrivons \u00e0 l\u2019argument du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l\u2019Alberta suivant lequel il faut consid\u00e9rer qu\u2019un droit garanti par l\u2019art. 25 li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale est un [traduction] \u00ab droit d\u2019imposer une r\u00e8gle [ou] loi en particulier \u00bb plut\u00f4t qu\u2019un droit de gouverner ou de r\u00e9glementer de mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale (m. interv., par. 73 (soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original)). Sinon, il serait possible de r\u00e9duire au minimum les protections offertes par la Charte relativement \u00e0 une vaste gamme de mesures intrins\u00e8quement gouvernementales. L\u2019article 25 a une port\u00e9e plus \u00e9troite que cela.\n[387] La VGFN a le droit de r\u00e9glementer la composition de ses corps dirigeants. Sa facult\u00e9 de le faire d\u00e9coule de plusieurs sources, notamment l\u2019al. 8(1)b) de la Loi sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale des premi\u00e8res nations du Yukon (Can.) (la constitution \u00e9tablit la \u00ab composition \u00bb des corps dirigeants de la premi\u00e8re nation), l\u2019art. 24.5.1 de l\u2019Entente d\u00e9finitive de la premi\u00e8re nation des Gwitchin Vuntut (les n\u00e9gociations concernant la constitution peuvent porter notamment sur la composition et les structures des institutions gouvernementales), et l\u2019art. 10.1.2 de l\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale de la VGFN (la constitution \u00e9tablit des organes directeurs et fixe leurs \u00ab attributions, [. . .] leur composition ainsi que leurs modalit\u00e9s de fonctionnement \u00bb).\n[388] Mais le droit d\u2019une nation autochtone autonome de r\u00e9glementer la composition de ses corps dirigeants est\u2011il un droit collectif unique qui appartient aux peuples autochtones parce qu\u2019ils sont des Autochtones? Nous ne pouvons dire que c\u2019est le cas.\n[389] On reconna\u00eet de plus en plus que les communaut\u00e9s autochtones sont des l\u00e9gislateurs, en plus d\u2019\u00eatre titulaires de droits. Les ententes sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale, tels l\u2019Accord\u2011cadre d\u00e9finitif conclu avec les premi\u00e8res nations du Yukon et l\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale de la VGFN, en sont des exemples. Il ne fait aucun doute que l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale autochtone, laquelle est une r\u00e9alit\u00e9 pour la VGFN depuis des temps imm\u00e9moriaux, constitue un moyen de reconna\u00eetre et de prot\u00e9ger la diff\u00e9rence autochtone.\n[390] Il n\u2019est cependant pas juste de dire que tout ce que fait un gouvernement autochtone est l\u2019exercice d\u2019un droit unique li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019identit\u00e9 collective de la communaut\u00e9. Bien des lois et mesures d\u2019une nation autochtone autonome sont mieux d\u00e9crites comme \u00e9tant simplement d\u2019ordre gouvernemental. Le fait que les gouvernements \u2014 qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, d\u2019un gouvernement provincial, territorial, municipal ou autochtone \u2014 adoptent des lois portant sur la composition de leurs corps dirigeants n\u2019a rien d\u2019unique. Tous les gouvernements le font. Partout au Canada, les gouvernements imposent eux aussi des obligations de r\u00e9sidence \u00e0 ceux et celles qui servent \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislature et \u00e0 d\u2019autres corps dirigeants (voir, p. ex., Loi sur l\u2019assembl\u00e9e l\u00e9gislative, L.R.Y. 2002, c. 136, art. 4 et 8, incorporant par renvoi la Loi sur les \u00e9lections; L.R.Y. 2002, c. 63, al. 3c) et art. 6; Loi sur l\u2019assembl\u00e9e l\u00e9gislative, L.R.O. 1990, c. L.10, art. 6; Local Authorities Election Act, R.S.A. 2000, c. L\u201121, art. 21). La VGFN n\u2019est pas unique \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Comme le signale Mme Dickson, l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence refl\u00e8te [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019adoption [par la VGFN] d\u2019un syst\u00e8me d\u00e9mocratique de gouvernance \u00bb (m.a., par. 84).\n[391] L\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence \u00e9tablit au sein du groupe une distinction fond\u00e9e sur le lieu de r\u00e9sidence; elle a pour effet d\u2019exclure les citoyens non r\u00e9sidents de la VGFN comme Mme Dickson d\u2019un aspect essentiel de la participation d\u00e9mocratique dans leur communaut\u00e9. Elle vise la r\u00e9gie interne de la VGFN et n\u2019a pas pour but de reconna\u00eetre le statut sp\u00e9cial de collectivit\u00e9s autochtones \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur de l\u2019\u00c9tat canadien au sens large. Nous ne sommes donc pas convaincues que l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence constitue l\u2019exercice d\u2019un droit relevant de l\u2019art. 25. Comme elle enfreint le par. 15(1) de la Charte, elle devrait faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une analyse de sa justification au regard de l\u2019article premier.\nC. Subsidiairement, l\u2019art. 25 a\u2011t\u2011il pour effet de prot\u00e9ger l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence?\n[392] Subsidiairement, m\u00eame si nous partagions l\u2019avis des juges Kasirer et Jamal selon lequel l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence constitue l\u2019exercice d\u2019un droit relevant de l\u2019art. 25, nous concluons n\u00e9anmoins que l\u2019art. 25 ne donnerait pas pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance au droit collectif en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 cette conclusion, il devrait incomber \u00e0 la VGFN de justifier au regard de l\u2019article premier l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence, qui enfreint le par. 15(1) de la Charte.\n[393] Nous ne sommes pas convaincues que l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence \u2014 l\u2019exercice contest\u00e9 du droit autochtone collectif \u2014 est n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la pr\u00e9servation de la culture distinctive de la VGFN. Madame Dickson est une demanderesse interne qui cherche \u00e0 d\u00e9fendre le droit individuel que lui garantit la Charte afin de participer \u00e0 la gouvernance collective de sa communaut\u00e9. Nous ne sommes pas en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un cas o\u00f9 des forces externes cherchent \u00e0 compromettre les droits de la VGFN \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ou, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, son droit de r\u00e9glementer la composition de ses corps dirigeants.\n[394] Dans la m\u00eame veine, donner effet aux droits \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 que la Charte garantit \u00e0 Mme Dickson ne peut avoir qu\u2019une faible incidence sur le droit de la VGFN de r\u00e9glementer la composition de ses corps dirigeants. Nous sommes d\u2019accord avec Mme Dickson pour dire que la VGFN serait bien plac\u00e9e pour instaurer une obligation de r\u00e9sidence qui tient compte de la situation unique de la communaut\u00e9, mais qui n\u2019exclut pas compl\u00e8tement les centaines de citoyens vivant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cart des terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es d\u2019un aspect essentiel de la participation d\u00e9mocratique. Le respect des droits \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 peut coexister avec une solide autonomie gouvernementale autochtone.\n[395] Par cons\u00e9quent, interpr\u00e9ter les droits oppos\u00e9s dans le respect de l\u2019objet de l\u2019art. 25 r\u00e9v\u00e8le que donner effet aux droits garantis \u00e0 Mme Dickson par la Charte ne \u00ab porte[rait] pas atteinte aux droits ou libert\u00e9s \u2014 ancestraux, issus de trait\u00e9s ou autres \u2014 des peuples autochtones du Canada \u00bb. L\u2019article 25 n\u2019a pas pour effet de donner en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce la pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence sur les droits individuels garantis par la Charte.\nV. Article premier de la Charte\n[396] Notre conclusion selon laquelle l\u2019art. 25 ne s\u2019applique pas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ne signifie pas que la diff\u00e9rence autochtone est une consid\u00e9ration non pertinente dans l\u2019\u00e9valuation de la demande fond\u00e9e sur la Charte. Au contraire \u2014 elle a un r\u00f4le important \u00e0 jouer dans l\u2019analyse de la justification au regard de l\u2019article premier. Les tribunaux doivent tenir respectueusement compte du point de vue de la communaut\u00e9 autochtone \u00e0 tous les stades de l\u2019analyse. Comme toute analyse fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019article premier, l\u2019\u00e9valuation est de nature contextuelle. Ainsi que l\u2019explique le professeur Macklem :\n[traduction] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 l\u2019importance constitutionnelle de la diff\u00e9rence autochtone, le pouvoir judiciaire devrait accorder une grande marge de man\u0153uvre aux formes autochtones d\u2019organisation sociale et politique lorsque vient le temps d\u2019\u00e9valuer la constitutionnalit\u00e9 d\u2019une restriction interne. La plupart des nations autochtones au Canada, par exemple, attachent beaucoup d\u2019importance \u00e0 l\u2019interd\u00e9pendance de la famille et du clan. Les formes dens\u00e9ment textur\u00e9es d\u2019organisation sociale et politique qui t\u00e9moignent [. . .] de l\u2019identit\u00e9 unique d\u2019une nation autochtone ne devraient pas \u00eatre d\u00e9mantel\u00e9es par le truchement de poursuites fond\u00e9es sur la Charte parce qu\u2019elles peuvent para\u00eetre \u00e9trang\u00e8res aux normes occidentales d\u2019individualisme. En cas d\u2019atteinte, une communaut\u00e9 autochtone devrait \u00eatre tenue de justifier la restriction au nom de la diff\u00e9rence autochtone en en d\u00e9montrant la pertinence pour le pass\u00e9 et l\u2019avenir de la communaut\u00e9. [Nous soulignons; note en bas de page omise; p. 226.]\n[397] L\u2019article premier de la Charte permet \u00e0 une entit\u00e9 gouvernementale de justifier une atteinte aux droits garantis \u00e0 une personne par la Charte. Pour \u00e9tablir que la contravention du par. 15(1) est justifi\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la VGFN a le fardeau de d\u00e9montrer que l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence favorise la r\u00e9alisation d\u2019un objectif urgent et r\u00e9el, et que les moyens choisis pour l\u2019atteindre lui sont proportionn\u00e9s (R. c. Oakes, [1986] 1 R.C.S. 103, p. 138\u2011139).\nA. Objectif urgent et r\u00e9el\n[398] L\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence sert \u00e0 atteindre l\u2019objectif urgent et r\u00e9el de [traduction] \u00ab la promotion et du maintien de l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale et du lien avec les territoires \u00bb (m.i., par. 162). Obliger les membres du corps dirigeant \u00e0 habiter sur les terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es favorise un lien r\u00e9el, substantiel et actuel avec la communaut\u00e9. Cela facilite la qu\u00eate d\u2019une autonomie gouvernementale v\u00e9ritable et efficace par les citoyens de la VGFN et pour leur compte, dans le contexte de l\u2019\u00e9rosion culturelle imputable \u00e0 la politique de la Couronne (voir le m.i., par. 169). Nous reconnaissons que l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence a \u00e9t\u00e9 instaur\u00e9e en vue d\u2019un objectif urgent et r\u00e9el.\nB. Proportionnalit\u00e9\n(1) Lien rationnel\n[399] La question qui se pose \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse de la proportionnalit\u00e9 est de savoir si la mesure adopt\u00e9e a un lien rationnel avec l\u2019objectif qu\u2019elle visait \u00e0 atteindre. Madame Dickson plaide que la culture de la VGFN est renforc\u00e9e par une forte participation des citoyens qui connaissent le territoire et les traditions de la VGFN et poss\u00e8dent des comp\u00e9tences en leadership, peu importe o\u00f9 ils vivent. Puisque bon nombre des citoyens de la VGFN ne vivent pas sur les terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es, faire appel \u00e0 un conseiller non r\u00e9sident repr\u00e9senterait mieux les [traduction] \u00ab besoins et enjeux \u00bb des non\u2011r\u00e9sidents (m.a., par. 117, citant le d.a., vol. VI, p. 140). En cons\u00e9quence, l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence n\u2019a pas de lien rationnel avec ses objectifs.\n[400] La VGFN soutient qu\u2019\u00e0 titre de communaut\u00e9 autochtone autonome dot\u00e9e d\u2019un ordre juridique ancr\u00e9 dans son territoire traditionnel, il est crucial et logique que les dirigeants \u00e9lus entretiennent un lien avec le territoire en \u00e9tant physiquement pr\u00e9sents sur celui\u2011ci. \u00c0 l\u2019heure actuelle, les citoyens non r\u00e9sidents peuvent participer \u00e0 la gouvernance de la bande et l\u2019influencer en votant, mais les postes d\u2019administrateurs sont r\u00e9serv\u00e9s aux citoyens r\u00e9sidents. Cette limite est n\u00e9cessaire au maintien de structures d\u00e9cisionnelles traditionnelles fond\u00e9es sur le lieu, y compris la pratique de la VGFN de tenir une assembl\u00e9e d\u00e9lib\u00e9rante (m.i., par. 170, citant le d.a., vol. VI, p. 139\u2011140; motifs de premi\u00e8re instance, par. 12). Les traditions Gwitchin comprennent des qualit\u00e9s particuli\u00e8res du leadership, notamment la capacit\u00e9 de tisser des relations durables avec leurs cong\u00e9n\u00e8res et la terre (motifs de la C.A., par. 115, citant S. M. Beairsto, Dinjii Kat Chih Ahaa : Gwich\u2019in Notions of Leadership (1999)).\n[401] Nous acceptons la d\u00e9claration de la VGFN sur la raison d\u2019\u00eatre de l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence. Qui plus est, l\u2019exigence d\u2019un lien de r\u00e9sidence entre un repr\u00e9sentant \u00e9lu et l\u2019endroit concern\u00e9 est constamment exprim\u00e9e dans des r\u00e8gles \u00e9lectorales non autochtones (Loi sur l\u2019assembl\u00e9e l\u00e9gislative (Yukon), art. 4 et 8, incorporant par renvoi la Loi sur les \u00e9lections, al. 3c) et art. 6; Loi sur les municipalit\u00e9s, L.R.Y. 2002, c. 154, al. 48(1)c), par. 50(1) et sous\u2011al. 193.04(1)a)(iii); motifs de premi\u00e8re instance, par. 209). Pareille exigence n\u2019est pas moins pertinente dans le contexte de l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale autochtone. Nous concluons donc que l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence a un lien rationnel avec ses objectifs.\n(2) Atteinte minimale\n[402] \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de l\u2019atteinte minimale, la VGFN doit d\u00e9montrer que la mesure en cause porte atteinte aussi peu que cela est raisonnablement possible au droit garanti par la Charte dans la poursuite de l\u2019objectif l\u00e9gislatif (RJR\u2011MacDonald Inc. c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), [1995] 3 R.C.S. 199, par. 160, la juge McLachlin; Oakes, p. 139). Pour porter une atteinte minimale, une mesure doit donc \u00eatre \u00ab soigneusement adapt\u00e9e \u00bb (RJR\u2011MacDonald, par. 160; Association de la police mont\u00e9e de l\u2019Ontario c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2015 CSC 1, [2015] 1 R.C.S. 3, par. 149).\n[403] Selon l\u2019article premier, il faut faire preuve d\u2019une certaine d\u00e9f\u00e9rence envers les moyens choisis par les gouvernements pour r\u00e9aliser un objectif (C.P., par. 179, le juge Kasirer, motifs concordants; Qu\u00e9bec c. A, par. 439; RJR\u2011MacDonald, par. 160; Alberta c. Hutterian Brethren of Wilson Colony, 2009 CSC 37, [2009] 2 R.C.S. 567, par. 37 et 53). Le besoin pour les cours de justice de d\u00e9f\u00e9rer aux d\u00e9cisions gouvernementales se fait encore plus pressant dans le cas d\u2019une nation autochtone autonome comme la VGFN. Il faut donner aux peuples autochtones une marge de man\u0153uvre [traduction] \u00ab pour d\u00e9velopper leurs cultures et leurs soci\u00e9t\u00e9s comme ils l\u2019entendent \u00bb (voir le m. interv., Band Members Alliance and Advocacy Association of Canada, par. 23).\n[404] L\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence vise \u00e0 concilier les valeurs sociales oppos\u00e9es l\u00e9gitimes de pr\u00e9server l\u2019identit\u00e9 collective de la VGFN et de maximiser les possibilit\u00e9s pour les citoyens de la VGFN de participer \u00e0 leur propre gouvernance (m.i., par. 172). Si nous reconnaissons qu\u2019une certaine distinction peut se justifier en vue de prot\u00e9ger les int\u00e9r\u00eats collectifs des citoyens qui vivent sur les terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es, la mesure portant une atteinte minimale doit permettre au moins quelques accommodements pour le droit des citoyens non r\u00e9sidents de participer \u00e0 la gouvernance de la communaut\u00e9 (voir Corbiere, par. 21; Esquega (CF), par. 96; Clifton, par. 17). Comme l\u2019ont signal\u00e9 les juges majoritaires dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Hutterian Brethren, par. 55 (italique omis), \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de l\u2019atteinte minimale, \u00ab le tribunal n\u2019a pas \u00e0 \u00eatre convaincu que la solution de rechange permettrait d\u2019atteindre l\u2019objectif [urgent et r\u00e9el] exactement dans la m\u00eame mesure que la mesure contest\u00e9e \u00bb. La possibilit\u00e9 de prendre des mesures de rechange qui \u00ab prot[\u00e9geraient] suffisamment l\u2019objectif du gouvernement, compte tenu de toutes les circonstances \u00bb devrait \u00eatre envisag\u00e9e (par. 55).\n[405] La Cour a conclu \u00e0 la majorit\u00e9 dans Corbiere que la restriction du droit de vote, bien qu\u2019ayant un lien rationnel avec l\u2019objectif de la loi, ne constituait pas une atteinte minimale (par. 21). La Cour ne pouvait accepter qu\u2019une privation compl\u00e8te des droits de vote des membres de la bande vivant hors r\u00e9serve \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser l\u2019objectif. Une conclusion semblable a \u00e9t\u00e9 tir\u00e9e dans Esquega ((CF), par. 96). La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a jug\u00e9 qu\u2019emp\u00eacher les membres de la bande vivant hors r\u00e9serve de remplir une fonction gouvernementale, sans faire d\u2019efforts pour trouver des solutions de rechange \u00e0 une interdiction totale, ne porte pas atteinte de mani\u00e8re minimale \u00e0 leurs droits \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 (par. 95). Bien que l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence de la VGFN ne soit pas une forme d\u2019exclusion politique totale, car les citoyens vivant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cart des terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es conservent leurs droits de vote, elle emp\u00eache bel et bien les citoyens non r\u00e9sidents de si\u00e9ger au Conseil et les exclut par le fait m\u00eame d\u2019un aspect essentiel de la participation d\u00e9mocratique.\n[406] Nous sommes sensibles \u00e0 l\u2019argument de la VGFN selon lequel le colonialisme et des d\u00e9cennies de politiques assimilatrices ont \u00e9rod\u00e9 les terres et la culture de la VGFN \u00e0 un point tel que l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence est l\u2019un des rares m\u00e9canismes dont elle dispose pour pr\u00e9server ce qui reste. Ce sont toutefois ces m\u00eames politiques qui ont contraint des personnes comme Mme Dickson \u00e0 vivre \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cart des terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es. L\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence interdit compl\u00e8tement aux citoyens non r\u00e9sidents de si\u00e9ger au Conseil de la VGFN malgr\u00e9 cette r\u00e9alit\u00e9.\n[407] Nous tenons \u00e9galement compte du fait que les candidats \u00e9lus \u00e0 un poste au Conseil de la VGFN peuvent obtenir un logement r\u00e9serv\u00e9 au personnel \u00e0 Old Crow (motifs de premi\u00e8re instance, par. 44). De plus, les conseillers re\u00e7oivent un salaire \u00e0 temps plein au cours de leur mandat (par. 44 et 156). Nous convenons avec la VGFN que ces facteurs att\u00e9nuent dans une certaine mesure le fardeau impos\u00e9 au non\u2011r\u00e9sident qui doit d\u00e9m\u00e9nager sur les terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es s\u2019il est \u00e9lu (voir le m.i., par. 172).\n[408] Or, bien qu\u2019il soit important d\u2019accorder une marge de man\u0153uvre \u00e0 la VGFN, aucune preuve n\u2019indique qu\u2019elle a cherch\u00e9 de v\u00e9ritables solutions de rechange \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence elle\u2011m\u00eame. Comme nous l\u2019avons expliqu\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, il est tout simplement trop attentatoire d\u2019obliger Mme Dickson \u00e0 modifier une caract\u00e9ristique consid\u00e9r\u00e9e immuable afin d\u2019occuper un poste au Conseil. Par cons\u00e9quent, nous concluons que l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence ne constitue pas une atteinte minimale.\n[409] Dans le pass\u00e9, Mme Dickson a propos\u00e9 lors d\u2019une r\u00e9union de l\u2019assembl\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la VGFN qu\u2019une r\u00e8gle minimalement restrictive r\u00e9serve un si\u00e8ge au Conseil aux citoyens non r\u00e9sidents (voir le m.a., par. 119). Bien que nous laissions \u00e0 la VGFN le soin de modifier son obligation de r\u00e9sidence comme elle le juge indiqu\u00e9, certains ajustements doivent \u00eatre apport\u00e9s pour que l\u2019on \u00e9vite de porter atteinte plus qu\u2019il n\u2019est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire de le faire aux droits des citoyens non r\u00e9sidents.\n(3) Effets b\u00e9n\u00e9fiques et effets pr\u00e9judiciables\n[410] Notre conclusion selon laquelle l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence ne porte pas une atteinte minimale au droit que le par. 15(1) de la Charte garantit \u00e0 Mme Dickson suffit pour conclure qu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas justifi\u00e9e au regard de l\u2019article premier. Toutefois, par souci d\u2019exhaustivit\u00e9, nous passons \u00e0 la derni\u00e8re \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse d\u00e9crite dans Oakes.\n[411] \u00c0 cette \u00e9tape\u2011l\u00e0, le tribunal se demande s\u2019il y a proportionnalit\u00e9 entre les effets globaux de la mesure attentatoire et l\u2019objectif l\u00e9gislatif (Oakes, p. 139; Hutterian Brethren, par. 72\u201173). Comme nous l\u2019avons mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, nous acceptons la th\u00e8se de la VGFN que l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence favorise l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale en conservant le lien qui unit les dirigeants \u00e9lus de la VGFN au territoire traditionnel. La r\u00e8gle att\u00e9nue les effets de la dislocation coloniale du contr\u00f4le exerc\u00e9 par les Vuntut Gwitchin sur ce territoire (m.i., par. 173).\n[412] L\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence commande cependant l\u2019exclusion politique des citoyens non r\u00e9sidents en les privant de la possibilit\u00e9 de servir en tant que repr\u00e9sentant \u00e9lu du gouvernement. La capacit\u00e9 de revenir habiter sur les terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es en cas d\u2019\u00e9lection n\u2019est pas une option valable pour des personnes telle Mme Dickson, qui sont d\u00e9plac\u00e9es sans qu\u2019elles n\u2019aient vraiment eu le choix, et elle ne saurait donc \u00eatre un facteur att\u00e9nuant dans ces circonstances. Tout comme dans Frank, ce genre de justification \u00ab repose sur une interpr\u00e9tation erron\u00e9e de la nature du choix qui s\u2019offre aux citoyens non r\u00e9sidents; plus fondamentalement, elle d\u00e9forme l\u2019approche appropri\u00e9e pour justifier une atteinte \u00e0 la Charte \u00bb (par. 81). L\u2019atteinte aux droits que la Charte garantit \u00e0 Mme Dickson ne prendrait pas fin si elle retournait vivre \u00e0 Old Crow apr\u00e8s son \u00e9lection, et \u00ab n\u2019efface[rait] en rien le pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 par l\u2019interdiction absolue \u00bb \u00e0 sa capacit\u00e9 en tant que non-r\u00e9sidente d\u2019occuper un poste au Conseil si elle \u00e9tait \u00e9lue (par. 81). Bien que l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence n\u2019exclue pas totalement la participation d\u00e9mocratique vu que les non\u2011r\u00e9sidents conservent le droit de vote, elle repr\u00e9sente n\u00e9anmoins un empi\u00e8tement important (par. 81).\n[413] \u00c0 notre avis, la VGFN n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les avantages de l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence l\u2019emportent sur les effets n\u00e9gatifs de la violation du par. 15(1) en cause.\nVI. Conclusion\n[414] Nous sommes d\u2019avis d\u2019accueillir le pourvoi et de rejeter le pourvoi incident. La VGFN est un gouvernement de par sa nature m\u00eame, et son \u00e9diction de l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence fait donc l\u2019objet d\u2019un examen fond\u00e9 sur la Charte selon le par. 32(1). Apr\u00e8s nous \u00eatre livr\u00e9es \u00e0 cet exercice, nous concluons que l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence porte atteinte au droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 que garantit \u00e0 Mme Dickson le par. 15(1) de la Charte.\n[415] L\u2019article 25 n\u2019a pas pour effet de donner la pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance au droit autochtone collectif en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. L\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence ne vise pas \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre le statut sp\u00e9cial de groupes autochtones au sein de l\u2019\u00c9tat canadien au sens large, et \u00e9chappe par cons\u00e9quent \u00e0 la protection de l\u2019art. 25. De plus, quoi qu\u2019il en soit, donner effet aux droits garantis \u00e0 Mme Dickson par la Charte ne porterait pas atteinte au droit de la VGFN de r\u00e9glementer la composition de ses corps dirigeants au sens envisag\u00e9 par l\u2019art. 25.\n[416] La justification de l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence ne peut se d\u00e9montrer dans le cadre d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 libre et d\u00e9mocratique conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article premier. Cette obligation repr\u00e9sente une exclusion totale des citoyens de la VGFN habitant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cart des terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es d\u2019un aspect essentiel de la participation \u00e0 l\u2019autoadministration de la communaut\u00e9. Elle ne porte pas une atteinte minimale au droit garanti \u00e0 Mme Dickson par le par. 15(1) de la Charte, ni ne constitue un juste \u00e9quilibre entre ses effets b\u00e9n\u00e9fiques et effets pr\u00e9judiciables. Nous sommes donc d\u2019avis de la d\u00e9clarer inop\u00e9rante.\nVersion fran\u00e7aise des motifs rendus par\nLe juge Rowe \u2014\nTABLE DES MATI\u00c8RES\nParagraphe\nI. Aper\u00e7u\n417\nII.

Conclusion\n522\nI. Aper\u00e7u\n[417] L\u2019aspect central des motifs qui suivent est la pr\u00e9misse fondamentale voulant qu\u2019il appartienne aux peuples autochtones \u00ab de se d\u00e9finir et de choisir par quels moyens prendre leurs d\u00e9cisions, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 leurs propres lois, coutumes et pratiques \u00bb (R. c. Desautel, 2021 CSC 17, [2021] 1 R.C.S. 533, par. 86).\n[418] Le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi porte sur la question de savoir si la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s s\u2019applique aux choix de gouvernance interne de la Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation (\u00ab VGFN \u00bb), notamment en ce qui concerne des mati\u00e8res aussi fondamentales que la r\u00e9sidence de leurs dirigeants \u00e9lus. La VGFN est une Premi\u00e8re Nation du nord du Yukon qui gouverne les affaires des Vuntut Gwitchin en vertu de sa propre Constitution, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e \u00e0 la suite d\u2019ententes conclues avec le Canada et le Yukon en 1993 portant sur des revendications territoriales et l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale des Vuntut Gwitchin. Cette Constitution \u00e9tablit les corps dirigeants des citoyens de la VGFN, y compris un conseil \u00e9lu. Aux termes de l\u2019article XI(2) de la Constitution de la VGFN, tout candidat qui est \u00e9lu au Conseil de la VGFN et qui ne r\u00e9side pas sur les \u00ab terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es \u00bb (aussi appel\u00e9es \u00ab terres vis\u00e9es par le r\u00e8glement \u00bb) de la VGFN doit se r\u00e9installer sur ces terres dans les 14 jours qui suivent le jour de l\u2019\u00e9lection (\u00ab obligation de r\u00e9sidence \u00bb). Cindy Dickson est une citoyenne de la VGFN qui r\u00e9side \u00e0 Whitehorse et qui souhaite se porter candidate \u00e0 un poste au Conseil de la VGFN, mais qui est incapable de se r\u00e9installer sur les terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es en raison d\u2019obligations \u00e0 titre de proche aidante. Elle conteste l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence au motif que celle\u2011ci viole les droits \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 que lui garantit le par. 15(1) de la Charte.\n[419] \u00c0 mon avis, l\u2019adoption par la VGFN de l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence dans sa Constitution n\u2019est pas assujettie \u00e0 la Charte. \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de cette conclusion, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019examiner les arguments portant sur le par. 15(1) ou l\u2019art. 25 de la Charte. Mes motifs traitent de plusieurs arguments relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019application de la Charte et les rejettent.\n[420] Premi\u00e8rement, l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 de la Charte est d\u00e9termin\u00e9e en vertu du par. 32(1) de la Charte. Les arguments pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 la Cour qui visent \u00e0 contourner le par. 32(1) en invoquant d\u2019autres fondements d\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 de la Charte sont incompatibles avec la jurisprudence de notre Cour.\n[421] Deuxi\u00e8mement, les arguments qui visent \u00e0 faire relever la VGFN ou ses activit\u00e9s du par. 32(1) au motif que la VGFN est un gouvernement sont contraires au texte du par. 32(1), \u00e0 son historique et \u00e0 sa place dans la structure de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 la jurisprudence de notre Cour sur l\u2019objet et la port\u00e9e de la disposition. Cette jurisprudence confirme que la Charte s\u2019applique aux gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux. Le sens du mot \u00ab gouvernement \u00bb au par. 32(1) a \u00e9t\u00e9 interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 t\u00e9l\u00e9ologiquement de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 englober les nombreuses manifestations des gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux, mais les autres entit\u00e9s ou leurs activit\u00e9s doivent pr\u00e9senter un lien important avec l\u2019un de ces gouvernements pour \u00eatre vis\u00e9es par le par. 32(1). Fait important, les droits des peuples autochtones, notamment ceux qui se rapportent \u00e0 la gouvernance autochtone, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9s s\u00e9par\u00e9ment dans la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982, et leur gouvernance interne ne rel\u00e8ve pas du champ d\u2019application de la Charte, sauf s\u2019il existe un lien important avec le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou un gouvernement provincial. Bien que ce lien puisse exister en ce qui concerne les structures des conseils de bande impos\u00e9es par la Loi sur les Indiens, L.R.C. 1985, c. I\u20115, on ne peut pas en dire autant pour ce qui est des structures de gouvernance choisies par les Vuntut Gwitchin eux\u2011m\u00eames, en l\u2019absence d\u2019arrangements particuliers avec le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou un gouvernement provincial\/territorial.\n[422] Troisi\u00e8mement, les divers arrangements entre la VGFN et les gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et\/ou du Yukon ne satisfont pas au crit\u00e8re du lien important n\u00e9cessaire pour que la VGFN ou son adoption de l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence rel\u00e8ve du champ d\u2019application du par. 32(1). Les structures de gouvernance et les d\u00e9cisions internes de la VGFN prennent leur source dans les traditions juridiques et les choix qui sont propres aux Vuntut Gwitchin et ne donnent pas lieu \u00e0 un examen fond\u00e9 sur la Charte en application du par. 32(1).\n[423] Quatri\u00e8mement, le fait d\u2019imposer la Charte \u00e0 la VGFN n\u2019est pas compatible avec l\u2019objectif de r\u00e9conciliation et la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de respecter la capacit\u00e9 et le droit des Vuntut Gwitchin de prendre des d\u00e9cisions conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 leurs propres lois, coutumes et pratiques. Cela comprend les d\u00e9cisions concernant l\u2019adoption et la modification de mesures de protection des droits et libert\u00e9s des citoyens de la VGFN.\n[424] Enfin, contrairement \u00e0 ce que pr\u00e9tend Mme Dickson, la VGFN n\u2019a jamais consenti \u00e0 adopter les protections \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans la Charte. La VGFN a plut\u00f4t adopt\u00e9 ses propres mesures de protection des droits de ses citoyens, dont bon nombre correspondent \u00e0 celles \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans la Charte mais sont adapt\u00e9es aux lois, coutumes et pratiques de son peuple. Les protections \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans la Constitution de la VGFN comprennent des protections des droits \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9. La contestation par Mme Dickson d\u2019une disposition de la Constitution de la VGFN doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9e conform\u00e9ment aux structures et processus internes propres \u00e0 la VGFN.\n[425] En fin de compte, la pr\u00e9sente affaire porte sur la question de savoir si, en \u00e9laborant leur propre Constitution, les Vuntut Gwitchin peuvent faire leurs propres choix en ce qui a trait \u00e0 leurs affaires \u2014 notamment quant \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re dont ils souhaitent prot\u00e9ger des droits et libert\u00e9s fondamentaux \u2014 ou si leurs choix sont assujettis \u00e0 un examen judiciaire fond\u00e9 sur la Charte. Je conclus que le choix leur appartient. Je suis donc d\u2019avis de rejeter le pourvoi de Mme Dickson et d\u2019accueillir le pourvoi incident de la VGFN, au motif que la Charte ne s\u2019applique pas \u00e0 l\u2019adoption par la VGFN de l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence.\nII. L\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 de la Charte est d\u00e9termin\u00e9e au regard du par. 32(1)\n[426] La \u00ab port\u00e9e de la Charte est d\u00e9limit\u00e9e par son par. 32(1) \u00bb (Blencoe c. Colombie\u2011Britannique (Human Rights Commission), 2000 CSC 44, [2000] 2 R.C.S. 307, par. 32; voir aussi SDGMR c. Dolphin Delivery Ltd., [1986] 2 R.C.S. 573, p. 598\u2011599). Le paragraphe 32(1) r\u00e9git la question de savoir [traduction] \u00ab sur qui p\u00e8se le fardeau des droits garantis par la Charte, ou, autrement dit, qui est li\u00e9 par la Charte \u00bb (P. W. Hogg et W. K. Wright, Constitutional Law of Canada (5e \u00e9d. suppl.), \u00a7 37:6 (en italique dans l\u2019original)).\n[427] Madame Dickson, le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l\u2019Alberta et le gouvernement du Yukon soutiennent qu\u2019ind\u00e9pendamment du par. 32(1), la Charte s\u2019applique parce que l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence pr\u00e9vue dans la Constitution de la VGFN est une \u00ab r\u00e8gle de droit \u00bb au sens du par. 52(1) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982, qui pr\u00e9voit que \u00ab [l]a Constitution [. . .] rend inop\u00e9rantes les dispositions incompatibles de toute autre r\u00e8gle de droit \u00bb. Leur position suppose implicitement que le par. 32(1) n\u2019est pas la seule voie permettant \u00e0 la Charte de s\u2019appliquer et qu\u2019il suffit de qualifier l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence de \u00ab r\u00e8gle de droit \u00bb. Cet argument est incompatible avec la jurisprudence de notre Cour.\n[428] Ce n\u2019est que lorsqu\u2019il est \u00e9tabli qu\u2019une entit\u00e9 ou son activit\u00e9 est li\u00e9e par la Charte en application du par. 32(1), et qu\u2019elle a viol\u00e9 la Charte, que l\u2019analyse passe \u00e0 l\u2019art. 24 et au par. 52(1), qui r\u00e9gissent les r\u00e9parations possibles (Greater Vancouver Transportation Authority c. F\u00e9d\u00e9ration canadienne des \u00e9tudiantes et \u00e9tudiants \u2014 Section Colombie\u2011Britannique, 2009 CSC 31, [2009] 2 R.C.S. 295 (\u00ab GVTA \u00bb), par. 13 et 87). Fait \u00e0 noter, le par. 52(1) \u00ab offre une r\u00e9paration lorsque des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives violent des droits garantis par la Charte, que ce soit par leur objet ou par leur effet \u00bb (R. c. Ferguson, 2008 CSC 6, [2008] 1 R.C.S. 96, par. 61 (en italique dans l\u2019original)), du fait qu\u2019il conf\u00e8re aux tribunaux le pouvoir de d\u00e9clarer inop\u00e9rantes les \u00ab dispositions [. . .] d[\u2019une] r\u00e8gle de droit \u00bb qui violent la Charte (voir aussi Ontario (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. G, 2020 CSC 38, [2020] 3 R.C.S. 629, par. 84\u201188). Cela ne permet pas d\u2019\u00e9viter la question de savoir si la Charte peut en fait \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e (N. Dupl\u00e9, Droit constitutionnel : principes fondamentaux (5e \u00e9d. 2011), p. 462\u2011463).\n[429] Par exemple, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Godbout c. Longueuil (Ville), [1997] 3 R.C.S. 844, il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 tenu pour acquis que des r\u00e8glements municipaux \u00e9taient assujettis \u00e0 la Charte du fait qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait de \u00ab r\u00e8gles de droit \u00bb. La Cour devait plut\u00f4t examiner le par. 32(1), suivant l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation que lui en avait donn\u00e9e sa jurisprudence, pour d\u00e9cider si la Charte s\u2019appliquait. De m\u00eame, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat GVTA, elle a d\u2019abord tranch\u00e9 la question de savoir si les entit\u00e9s en question \u00e9taient vis\u00e9es par le par. 32(1). Ce n\u2019est qu\u2019apr\u00e8s avoir r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 cette question par l\u2019affirmative et conclu qu\u2019il y avait eu violation de la Charte que la Cour s\u2019est demand\u00e9 si les politiques contest\u00e9es \u00e9taient des \u00ab r\u00e8gle[s] de droit \u00bb pour l\u2019application de la r\u00e9paration pr\u00e9vue au par. 52(1).\n[430] Autrement dit, il n\u2019est pas \u00ab incompatibl[e] \u00bb avec la Constitution, au sens du par. 52(1), de respecter les limites de l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 de la Charte \u00e9nonc\u00e9es au par. 32(1). Par cons\u00e9quent, le par. 32(1) doit \u00eatre au c\u0153ur de l\u2019analyse visant \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si la Charte s\u2019applique \u00e0 la VGFN et \u00e0 l\u2019adoption par cette derni\u00e8re de l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence.\nIII. La Charte s\u2019applique aux gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux et aux entit\u00e9s ou activit\u00e9s qui ont un lien important avec ces gouvernements\n[431] Nul ne conteste que la VGFN est un \u00ab gouvernement \u00bb au sens o\u00f9 elle repr\u00e9sente un ensemble de personnes qui gouvernent la communaut\u00e9 des Vuntut Gwitchin (Multidictionnaire de la langue fran\u00e7aise (7e \u00e9d. 2021)). Cependant, bon nombre des arguments \u00e0 l\u2019appui de l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 de la Charte entretiennent une id\u00e9e fondamentalement erron\u00e9e : que la Charte s\u2019applique \u00e0 toute entit\u00e9 qui est un gouvernement ou \u00e0 toute activit\u00e9 qui semble \u00eatre \u00ab gouvernementale \u00bb, qu\u2019elle ait ou non un lien avec le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou un gouvernement provincial. Par exemple, le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada affirme que la Charte s\u2019applique chaque fois qu\u2019une entit\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab exerce des fonctions purement gouvernementales \u00bb (m. interv., par. 18) et \u00ab qu\u2019un lien avec le Parlement ou une l\u00e9gislature ou un degr\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le exerc\u00e9 par l\u2019un de ceux\u2011ci \u00bb n\u2019est donc pas n\u00e9cessaire (par. 22). De m\u00eame, le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l\u2019Alberta dit que [traduction] \u00ab toutes les entit\u00e9s (qu\u2019elles soient autochtones ou non autochtones) qui assument un r\u00f4le gouvernemental en exer\u00e7ant un pouvoir l\u00e9gislatif ont l\u2019obligation de se conformer \u00e0 la Charte \u00bb (m. interv., par. 6). Les juridictions inf\u00e9rieures ont apparemment adopt\u00e9 ce point de vue, concluant que [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019art. 32 ne dresse pas une liste exhaustive des gouvernements assujettis \u00e0 la Charte \u00bb (2020 YKSC 22, 461 C.R.R. (2d) 230, par. 123; voir aussi 2021 YKCA 5, 495 C.R.R. (2d) 98, par. 84\u201185) et que la Charte s\u2019applique \u00e0 la VGFN parce qu\u2019elle est \u00ab un gouvernement \u00bb et qu\u2019elle exerce des \u00ab activit\u00e9s gouvernementales \u00bb (motifs de premi\u00e8re instance, par. 131).\n[432] Ces arguments doivent \u00eatre rejet\u00e9s. Comme je vais l\u2019expliquer, ils sont contraires au texte du par. 32(1), \u00e0 son historique et \u00e0 sa place dans la structure de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 la jurisprudence sur son objet et sa port\u00e9e. Cette jurisprudence confirme que la Charte ne s\u2019applique qu\u2019aux gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des domaines relevant de ceux\u2011ci. La port\u00e9e du par. 32(1) de la Charte s\u2019interpr\u00e8te t\u00e9l\u00e9ologiquement d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui englobe les gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux dans toutes leurs formes modernes, afin d\u2019emp\u00eacher que ces gouvernements se soustraient \u00e0 un examen fond\u00e9 sur la Charte au moyen de la stratification des pouvoirs dans l\u2019\u00c9tat administratif moderne. Toutefois, les entit\u00e9s ou activit\u00e9s qui ne font pas partie des institutions du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou de celui d\u2019une province doivent pr\u00e9senter un lien important avec l\u2019un de ces gouvernements pour \u00eatre vis\u00e9es par le par. 32(1).\n[433] Avant de poursuivre, je signale que, dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs, je d\u00e9signe collectivement les institutions \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es au par. 32(1) comme les gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux. La jurisprudence emploie le terme \u00ab gouvernement \u00bb pour d\u00e9signer \u00e0 la fois la branche ex\u00e9cutive des gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux (Dolphin Delivery, p. 598\u2011599) et, plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, les ordres de gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provincial. J\u2019utilise le terme dans ce dernier sens. De plus, toute mention des provinces, gouvernements provinciaux ou lois provinciales dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs devrait \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 englober les territoires, selon ce qu\u2019exige le contexte.\nA. Texte du par. 32(1)\n[434] Le point de d\u00e9part d\u2019une m\u00e9thode d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique de la Charte demeure le texte de la disposition en cause (Toronto (Cit\u00e9) c. Ontario (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2021 CSC 34, par. 65; Qu\u00e9bec (Procureure g\u00e9n\u00e9rale) c. 9147\u20110732 Qu\u00e9bec inc., 2020 CSC 32, [2020] 3 R.C.S. 426, par. 8; voir aussi R. c. McGregor, 2023 CSC 4, par. 18). En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la disposition en cause est le par. 32(1) de la Charte. Cette disposition est ainsi libell\u00e9e :\n32 (1) La pr\u00e9sente charte s\u2019applique :\na) au Parlement et au gouvernement du Canada, pour tous les domaines relevant du Parlement, y compris ceux qui concernent le territoire du Yukon et les territoires du Nord\u2011Ouest;\nb) \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislature et au gouvernement de chaque province, pour tous les domaines relevant de cette l\u00e9gislature.\n[435] Le texte du par. 32(1) ne renvoie pas \u00e0 la notion de \u00ab gouvernement \u00bb g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement. Il \u00e9num\u00e8re plut\u00f4t des institutions distinctes dans deux alin\u00e9as : \u00ab [le] Parlement et [le] gouvernement du Canada \u00bb (al. 32(1)a)) et \u00ab la l\u00e9gislature et [le] gouvernement de chaque province \u00bb (al. 32(1)b)). Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Dolphin Delivery, le juge McIntyre a affirm\u00e9 clairement que \u00ab l\u2019art. 32 de la Charte mentionne de fa\u00e7on pr\u00e9cise les acteurs auxquels s\u2019applique la Charte \u00bb (p. 598; voir aussi GVTA, par. 13). Le paragraphe 32(1) pr\u00e9voit aussi clairement que la Charte s\u2019applique aux gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux \u00ab en ce qui concerne tous les domaines qui rel\u00e8vent de leurs comp\u00e9tences respectives \u00bb (Dolphin Delivery, p. 598).\n[436] Le libell\u00e9 clair utilis\u00e9 pour \u00e9noncer \u00e0 qui et \u00e0 quoi s\u2019applique la Charte refl\u00e8te l\u2019objet du par. 32(1). On ne peut adopter une interpr\u00e9tation qui r\u00e9\u00e9crit en fait le par. 32(1) de la Charte (R. c. Terry, [1996] 2 R.C.S. 207, par. 23). Par cons\u00e9quent, aucune approche sur l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 de la Charte en vertu du par. 32(1) ne saurait faire abstraction des limites claires \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans la disposition elle\u2011m\u00eame.\nB. Historique du par. 32(1) et sa place dans la structure de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982\n[437] L\u2019historique du par. 32(1) et sa place dans la structure de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 confirment que la Charte a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9labor\u00e9e par les gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux, pour ces gouvernements. En revanche, la relation entre ces gouvernements et les peuples autochtones, et la place accord\u00e9e \u00e0 la gouvernance autochtone au sein du Canada contemporain, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9es au moyen de m\u00e9canismes distincts tels que les trait\u00e9s modernes prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par l\u2019art. 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982.\n(1) La Charte a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9labor\u00e9e par les gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux, pour ces gouvernements\n[438] La Charte \u00e9tait, essentiellement, une entente contraignante conclue, d\u2019un c\u00f4t\u00e9, par le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et, de l\u2019autre, par les gouvernements provinciaux (\u00e0 l\u2019exception du Qu\u00e9bec). Il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une mani\u00e8re de reconna\u00eetre constitutionnellement les protections accord\u00e9es aux personnes contre les gouvernements \u00e9tablis par l\u2019Acte de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique du Nord britannique, 1867 (maintenant la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867). Parall\u00e8lement au rapatriement, les gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux, en tant que successeurs de la Couronne imp\u00e9riale, ont convenu d\u2019un document relatif aux droits visant \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger ceux qui relevaient de leur comp\u00e9tence. La Charte sert donc d\u2019interm\u00e9diaire dans la relation \u00ab entre l\u2019\u00c9tat et les personnes au sujet des droits et libert\u00e9s fondamentaux de ces derni\u00e8res \u00bb (Beckman c. Premi\u00e8re nation de Little Salmon\/Carmacks, 2010 CSC 53, [2010] 3 R.C.S. 103, par. 97 (je souligne), la juge Deschamps, motifs concordants).\n[439] Les n\u00e9gociations ayant men\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019adoption de la Charte se sont d\u00e9roul\u00e9es au fil d\u2019une s\u00e9rie de conf\u00e9rences f\u00e9d\u00e9rales\u2011provinciales tenues principalement entre les premiers ministres. M\u00eame lorsque les discussions avaient lieu entre d\u2019autres ministres ou repr\u00e9sentants gouvernementaux, la principale m\u00e9thode de n\u00e9gociation et de r\u00e9solution de conflits \u00e9tait la pratique consistant \u00e0 tenir une conf\u00e9rence entre les ordres de gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provincial (J. R. Mallory, \u00ab The Politics of Constitutional Change \u00bb, dans P. Davenport et R. H. Leach, dir., Reshaping Confederation : The 1982 Reform of the Canadian Constitution (1984), 53, p. 60 et 66). Lors de l\u2019examen des projets, des consultations avaient lieu avec divers intervenants afin qu\u2019ils fassent valoir leurs points de vue (voir S\u00e9nat et Chambre des communes, Proc\u00e8s\u2011verbaux et t\u00e9moignages du Comit\u00e9 mixte sp\u00e9cial du S\u00e9nat et de la Chambre des communes sur la Constitution du Canada, no 57, 1re sess., 32e l\u00e9g., 13 f\u00e9vrier 1981); toutefois, ces groupes \u00e9taient des requ\u00e9rants, et non pas des participants (D. Sanders, \u00ab An Uncertain Path : The Aboriginal Constitutional Conferences \u00bb, dans J. M. Weiler et R. M. Elliot, dir., Litigating the Values of a Nation : The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (1986), 63, p. 63). Les n\u00e9gociations d\u00e9finitives sont demeur\u00e9es entre les repr\u00e9sentants des gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux (D. Gibson, The Law of the Charter : General Principles (1986), p. 38\u201139).\n[440] La Charte \u2014 y compris le par. 32(1) \u2014 a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9labor\u00e9e en tenant compte de ces acteurs. Comme l\u2019explique la professeure K. Swinton, il est n\u00e9cessaire de \u00ab tenir compte des pr\u00e9occupations des gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux lorsqu\u2019ils ont r\u00e9dig\u00e9 et accept\u00e9 la Charte. Ils se pr\u00e9occupaient surtout de ses effets sur leur propre fonctionnement \u00bb (\u00ab Application de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s (Articles 30, 31, 32) \u00bb, dans W. S. Tarnopolsky et G.\u2011A. Beaudoin, dir., Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s (1982), 49, p. 59 (je souligne)). Cela explique pourquoi les protections consacr\u00e9es par la Charte regorgent de r\u00e9f\u00e9rences aux ordres de gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provincial (voir, p. ex., les art. 3 \u00e0 6, 16 \u00e0 20 et 23).\n[441] Ce contexte de n\u00e9gociation explique aussi pourquoi, bien qu\u2019un grand nombre de dispositions de la Charte aient entra\u00een\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats houleux, ce ne fut pas le cas du pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseur du par. 32(1). La question de l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 de la Charte a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9voqu\u00e9e lors du d\u00e9p\u00f4t des projets ant\u00e9rieurs \u00e9manant du f\u00e9d\u00e9ral (Gibson, p. 36; voir aussi Federal\u2011Provincial Meeting of the Continuing Committee of Ministers on the Constitution, Rights and Freedoms within the Canadian Federation \u2014 Discussion Draft, no 830\u201181\/027, 4 juillet 1980); toutefois, une disposition expresse concernant l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 de la Charte a fait son apparition pour la premi\u00e8re fois dans un projet \u00e9manant du f\u00e9d\u00e9ral d\u00e9pos\u00e9 au Parlement en octobre 1980 (La Constitution canadienne 1980 : Projet de r\u00e9solution concernant la Constitution du Canada (1980)). Elle n\u2019a pas entra\u00een\u00e9 d\u2019importantes discussions au Parlement ni au comit\u00e9 mixte sp\u00e9cial subs\u00e9quent. Tout au long d\u2019intenses n\u00e9gociations en vue d\u2019arriver \u00e0 une entente sur la substance de la Charte entre les gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux, la disposition sur l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 de la Charte n\u2019a pas fait l\u2019objet de contestation; la seule modification dans son libell\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9e par un comit\u00e9 de r\u00e9daction apr\u00e8s la conclusion d\u2019une entente sur les droits et libert\u00e9s substantiels (Gibson, p. 115). Il convient de souligner que cette modification a eu pour effet d\u2019insister sur le lien entre la Charte et les ordres de gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provincial en pr\u00e9cisant que ce texte s\u2019appliquait \u00ab pour \u00bb les domaines relevant de ceux\u2011ci, plut\u00f4t que de s\u2019appliquer aux gouvernements susmentionn\u00e9s \u00ab et \u00bb aux domaines relevant de ceux\u2011ci (p. 115).\n(2) Les peuples autochtones ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9s s\u00e9par\u00e9ment dans la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982\n[442] La Charte a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9labor\u00e9e pour consacrer des normes de comportement constitutionnel qui \u00e9taient adapt\u00e9es aux structures et aux fondements philosophiques de la gouvernance f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et provinciale (voir en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Davenport et Leach, dir.; B. L. Strayer, Canada\u2019s Constitutional Revolution (2013)). N\u00e9anmoins, certains intervenants avancent que, comme les peuples autochtones font partie du tissu constitutionnel du Canada, leurs gouvernements devraient [traduction] \u00ab \u00eatre tenu[s] de respecter les contraintes constitutionnelles, y compris les droits et libert\u00e9s garantis par la Charte \u00bb (m. interv., Band Members Alliance and Advocacy Association of Canada, par. 4). Ils signalent aussi la pr\u00e9sence de l\u2019art. 25 de la Charte comme preuve que cela fait partie des desseins de la Charte. \u00c0 mon avis, ces observations sont incompatibles avec une analyse structurelle de l\u2019architecture constitutionnelle du Canada.\n[443] L\u2019historique et la structure de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 indiquent clairement que la relation entre les gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux et les peuples autochtones \u2014 et, corollairement, la place qu\u2019occupe la gouvernance autochtone au sein du Canada contemporain \u2014 a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e au moyen de m\u00e9canismes distincts de la Charte. Mais surtout, les droits collectifs des peuples autochtones se sont vu accorder la protection constitutionnelle par l\u2019art. 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982. Fait \u00e0 noter, l\u2019art. 35 a \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9 en dehors de la Charte, dans une \u00ab partie \u00bb distincte de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982. La pr\u00e9sence de l\u2019art. 35 fournit plusieurs indications aff\u00e9rentes \u00e0 la port\u00e9e du par. 32(1).\n[444] Premi\u00e8rement, le degr\u00e9 de la participation autochtone fait ressortir les diff\u00e9rences entre les compromis qui se trouvent dans la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982. La Charte concernait principalement les acteurs f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux : les peuples autochtones n\u2019\u00e9taient pas \u00e0 la table de n\u00e9gociation, ils n\u2019ont pas consenti \u00e0 ce que la Charte s\u2019applique \u00e0 eux, et ils n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 inclus dans la formule de modification constitutionnelle qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e parall\u00e8lement \u00e0 la Charte. En revanche, l\u2019inclusion ultime de l\u2019art. 35 \u00ab repr\u00e9sente l\u2019aboutissement d\u2019une bataille longue et difficile \u00e0 la fois dans l\u2019ar\u00e8ne politique et devant les tribunaux pour la reconnaissance de droits ancestraux \u00bb (R. c. Sparrow, [1990] 1 R.C.S. 1075, p. 1105). Des questions pendantes ont aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9battues lors de conf\u00e9rences constitutionnelles distinctes, bien qu\u2019elles se soient r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9es infructueuses, lesquelles comprenaient une participation directe de groupes autochtones (Gibson, p. 39; Loi constitutionnelle de 1982, al. 35.1b) et par. 37.1(3) (abrog\u00e9 le 18 avril 1987, par l\u2019art. 54.1)).\n[445] Deuxi\u00e8mement, la constitutionnalisation des trait\u00e9s modernes, en vertu du par. 35(1), rev\u00eat une importance particuli\u00e8re permettant de comprendre pourquoi la Charte ne traite pas de la port\u00e9e et des limites de la gouvernance autochtone. Les ann\u00e9es 70 ont inaugur\u00e9 une nouvelle \u00e8re de conclusion de trait\u00e9s entre les groupes autochtones et les gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux, et un sujet important de ces discussions \u00e9tait la mise en \u0153uvre et la port\u00e9e de l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale autochtone (S. Imai, \u00ab Indigenous Self\u2011Determination and the State \u00bb, dans B. J. Richardson, S. Imai et K. McNeil, dir., Indigenous Peoples and the Law : Comparative and Critical Perspectives (2009), 285, p. 295; S. Grammond, Am\u00e9nager la coexistence : Les peuples autochtones et le droit canadien (2003), p. 108\u2011111). Ces discussions incluaient les n\u00e9gociations qui avaient commenc\u00e9 en 1973 et qui ont abouti deux d\u00e9cennies plus tard aux ententes concernant l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Yukon, y compris la VGFN (J. T. S. McCabe, The Law of Treaties Between the Crown and Aboriginal Peoples (2010), p. 52\u201159). Eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 cet effort continu, le par. 35(3) indique clairement que \u00ab sont compris parmi les droits issus de trait\u00e9s [. . .] les droits existants issus d\u2019accords sur des revendications territoriales ou ceux susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre ainsi acquis \u00bb. Par cons\u00e9quent, les gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux ont compris que la port\u00e9e et les limites de la gouvernance autochtone seraient examin\u00e9es sous le r\u00e9gime de l\u2019art. 35, en particulier gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la constitutionnalisation des trait\u00e9s modernes, plut\u00f4t qu\u2019au moyen de la Charte.\n[446] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019art. 25, il sert de lien entre la partie I et la partie II de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982. Il faut voir l\u2019art. 25 comme une protection contre les contestations fond\u00e9es sur la Charte visant des mesures f\u00e9d\u00e9rales et provinciales qui prot\u00e8gent les droits garantis par l\u2019art. 35, ainsi que les \u00ab droits ou libert\u00e9s [. . .] autres \u00bb (H. S. LaForme, assist\u00e9 de C. Truesdale, \u00ab Section 25 of the Charter; Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 : Aboriginal and Treaty Rights \u2014 30 Years of Recognition and Affirmation \u00bb, dans E. Mendes et S. Beaulac, dir., Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s (5e \u00e9d. 2013), 1337, p. 1377). Les pr\u00e9occupations qui ont men\u00e9 \u00e0 son inclusion sont compr\u00e9hensibles : les n\u00e9gociations relatives \u00e0 la Charte ont eu lieu seulement une d\u00e9cennie apr\u00e8s la publication du Livre blanc f\u00e9d\u00e9ral de 1969 (La politique indienne du gouvernement du Canada, 1969), qui proposait d\u2019abolir le statut sp\u00e9cial des peuples autochtones afin de promouvoir [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des droits \u00bb (D. Sanders, \u00ab The Rights of the Aboriginal Peoples of Canada \u00bb (1983), 61 R. du B. can. 314, p. 319; T. J. Courchene, Indigenous Nationals, Canadian Citizens : From First Contact to Canada 150 and Beyond (2018), p. 66). Les pr\u00e9occupations des Autochtones d\u00e9coulaient \u00e9galement de la jurisprudence portant sur les contestations ant\u00e9rieures de la Loi sur les Indiens fond\u00e9es sur la D\u00e9claration canadienne des droits, S.C. 1960, c. 44 (voir, p. ex., La Reine c. Drybones, [1970] R.C.S. 282; Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada c. Lavell, [1974] R.C.S. 1349; R. M. M\u2019Gonigle, \u00ab The Bill of Rights and The Indian Act : Either? Or? \u00bb (1977), 15 Alta. L. Rev. 292).\n[447] En ce sens, l\u2019art. 25 renforce les relations distinctes en cause dans la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 \u2014 l\u2019une concernant l\u2019interaction entre les personnes et la Couronne, et l\u2019autre concernant la protection des peuples autochtones contre certaines formes d\u2019intervention de la Couronne (voir, p. ex., Beckman, par. 97, la juge Deschamps, motifs concordants). L\u2019article 25 est donc de nature semblable aux autres \u00ab Dispositions g\u00e9n\u00e9rales \u00bb de la Charte qui [traduction] \u00ab forment un ensemble coh\u00e9rent de dispositions interpr\u00e9tatives qui n\u2019octroient pas en soi de droits, mais qui peuvent, dans certaines circonstances, avoir une incidence sur la port\u00e9e de l\u2019examen fond\u00e9 sur la Charte, g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement en la restreignant \u00bb (G. J. Kennedy, \u00ab They\u2019re All Interpretative : Towards a Consistent Approach to ss 25\u201131 of the Charter \u00bb (U.B.C. L. Rev., \u00e0 para\u00eetre), p. 2). Cet article veille \u00e0 ce que la premi\u00e8re relation n\u2019ait aucune incidence sur la seconde (Ontario (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Bear Island Foundation, [1991] 2 R.C.S. 570) en exigeant que la Charte ne soit pas interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e de sorte que les deux relations \u00ab entrent en conflit \u00bb (Beckman, par. 98, la juge Deschamps, motifs concordants). Ce faisant, il renforce l\u2019id\u00e9e que la Charte a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9labor\u00e9e pour restreindre l\u2019action des gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux, sans pour autant nuire \u00e0 leur capacit\u00e9 de donner effet aux droits collectifs des peuples autochtones.\n[448] Globalement, il est clair que l\u2019accent mis par le par. 32(1) sur les gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux est compatible avec l\u2019historique de la Charte et les relations distinctes sur lesquelles repose la structure de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982.\n[449] Je ne peux pas clore la discussion portant sur l\u2019art. 25 sans examiner le sens que mes coll\u00e8gues lui ont donn\u00e9 dans leurs motifs majoritaires et dans leurs motifs dissidents, un sens fondamentalement diff\u00e9rent de celui que je viens d\u2019\u00e9noncer et qui aura des cons\u00e9quences d\u2019une port\u00e9e consid\u00e9rable \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la relation entre les tribunaux et un gouvernement autochtone autonome.\n[450] Par leur interpr\u00e9tation respective de l\u2019art. 25 et du par. 32(1), mes coll\u00e8gues appliquent le contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la conformit\u00e9 \u00e0 la Charte \u00e0 un gouvernement autochtone autonome. Les deux groupes form\u00e9s par mes coll\u00e8gues d\u00e9crivent longuement un processus de contr\u00f4le judiciaire en application de l\u2019art. 25; tout en divergeant sur la question de savoir si l\u2019art. 25 est un \u00ab bouclier \u00bb ou un \u00ab prisme interpr\u00e9tatif \u00bb, les deux descriptions sont complexes. Quelles qu\u2019en soient les nuances, leurs approches repr\u00e9sentent un moyen pour les tribunaux d\u2019appliquer les droits (ou \u00ab valeurs \u00bb) consacr\u00e9s par la Charte au fonctionnement d\u2019un gouvernement autochtone autonome.\n[451] Il en r\u00e9sultera essentiellement une analyse qui s\u2019apparente \u00e0 celle de l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Oakes, [1986] 1 R.C.S. 103, pour l\u2019action l\u00e9gislative et \u00e0 celle de l\u2019arr\u00eat Dor\u00e9 c. Barreau du Qu\u00e9bec, 2012 CSC 12, [2012] 1 R.C.S. 395, pour l\u2019action administrative. Bien que les termes des arr\u00eats Oakes et Dor\u00e9 ne soient pas utilis\u00e9s, apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9termin\u00e9 qu\u2019un droit garanti par la Charte a \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9, les tribunaux m\u00e8neront de fait, au regard de l\u2019art. 25, une forme d\u2019op\u00e9ration de \u00ab justification \u00bb semblable \u00e0 celle de l\u2019arr\u00eat Oakes ou une op\u00e9ration de \u00ab mise en balance \u00bb semblable \u00e0 celle de l\u2019arr\u00eat Dor\u00e9, compte tenu d\u2019une part des droits\/valeurs garantis par la Charte qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9s et d\u2019autre part des droits autochtones (motifs des juges Kasirer et Jamal, par. 177\u2011182; motifs des juges Martin et O\u2019Bonsawin, par. 338\u2011339). De plus, comme dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Oakes, le fardeau de la justification incombera \u00e0 la partie dont les actions ont caus\u00e9 la violation de la Charte, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce le gouvernement autochtone, ce qui n\u2019a aucun fondement dans le texte de l\u2019art. 25.\n[452] Il faut se demander si une telle surveillance continue d\u2019un gouvernement autochtone autonome par les tribunaux constitue l\u2019objet de l\u2019art. 25. Rien dans cette disposition n\u2019indique qu\u2019il en est ainsi. Le libell\u00e9 est plut\u00f4t conforme \u00e0 mon interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019art. 25, interpr\u00e9tation selon laquelle les tribunaux doivent \u00e9viter de porter atteinte aux droits autochtones lorsqu\u2019ils statuent sur la constitutionnalit\u00e9 d\u2019actions du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou d\u2019un gouvernement provincial. Selon l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation pr\u00e9conis\u00e9e par mes coll\u00e8gues, les tribunaux doivent aussi faire quelque chose de fort diff\u00e9rent, soit de contr\u00f4ler les actions des gouvernements autochtones pour en v\u00e9rifier la conformit\u00e9 \u00e0 la Charte. Cela am\u00e8nera les tribunaux \u00e0 assumer un r\u00f4le de surveillance permanente d\u2019un gouvernement autochtone autonome.\n[453] Dans un sens, les deux groupes que forment mes coll\u00e8gues n\u2019ont pas le choix quant \u00e0 leur interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019art. 25. Une fois qu\u2019ils d\u00e9cident que la Charte s\u2019applique \u00e0 un gouvernement autochtone autonome, ils ont besoin d\u2019un m\u00e9canisme pour que les tribunaux puissent \u00ab mettre en balance \u00bb les droits\/valeurs garantis par la Charte avec les droits autochtones. Ils se servent de l\u2019art. 25 pour accomplir cette t\u00e2che, m\u00eame si tel n\u2019\u00e9tait pas l\u2019objet de cette disposition.\nC. Jurisprudence sur l\u2019objet et la port\u00e9e du par. 32(1)\n[454] Il ressort clairement de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de que seuls les gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux devaient relever du champ d\u2019application du par. 32(1). Par cons\u00e9quent, la Charte ne s\u2019applique pas, notamment, aux litiges purement priv\u00e9s (Dolphin Delivery, p. 597\u2011598; Hill c. \u00c9glise de scientologie de Toronto, [1995] 2 R.C.S. 1130, par. 95) ni aux gouvernements \u00e9trangers (\u00c9tats\u2011Unis c. Allard, [1987] 1 R.C.S. 564), car de telles entit\u00e9s n\u2019ont pas de lien avec le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou un gouvernement provincial.\n[455] Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 une m\u00e9thode d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique de la Charte, notre Cour a reconnu que la port\u00e9e du par. 32(1) doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui refl\u00e8te la fa\u00e7on dont les gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux prennent forme dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne moderne. Cela est n\u00e9cessaire pour faire en sorte que ces gouvernements ne puissent se soustraire \u00e0 un examen fond\u00e9 sur la Charte, notamment en agissant par l\u2019entremise d\u2019entit\u00e9s qui sont en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 leurs prolongements (McKinney c. Universit\u00e9 de Guelph, [1990] 3 R.C.S. 229, p. 265; Godbout, par. 51; GVTA, par. 22), ou en d\u00e9l\u00e9guant la mise en \u0153uvre de politiques ou programmes particuliers \u00e0 des entit\u00e9s non gouvernementales (Eldridge c. Colombie\u2011Britannique (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), [1997] 3 R.C.S. 624, par. 42). Cette pr\u00e9occupation a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9sum\u00e9e avec justesse par le juge La Forest dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Godbout :\nSi la Charte devait en effet ne s\u2019appliquer qu\u2019aux organismes faisant institutionnellement partie du gouvernement et non \u00e0 ceux qui sont de nature gouvernementale (ou qui accomplissent des actes gouvernementaux) dans les faits, le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et les provinces pourraient facilement se soustraire aux obligations que la Charte leur impose en octroyant certains de leurs pouvoirs \u00e0 d\u2019autres entit\u00e9s et en leur faisant ex\u00e9cuter des fonctions ou appliquer des politiques qui sont, en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, gouvernementales. Autrement dit, le Parlement, les l\u00e9gislatures provinciales et la branche ex\u00e9cutive des gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou provinciaux n\u2019auraient qu\u2019\u00e0 cr\u00e9er des organismes distincts d\u2019eux et \u00e0 leur conf\u00e9rer le pouvoir d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter des fonctions gouvernementales pour \u00e9chapper aux contraintes que la Charte impose \u00e0 leurs activit\u00e9s. De toute \u00e9vidence, cette fa\u00e7on de faire r\u00e9duirait indirectement la port\u00e9e de la protection pr\u00e9vue par la Charte d\u2019une mani\u00e8re que le l\u00e9gislateur pourrait difficilement avoir voulue et entra\u00eenerait des cons\u00e9quences pour le moins ind\u00e9sirables. En effet, compte tenu de leur importance fondamentale, les droits garantis par la Charte doivent \u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9s contre toute tentative visant \u00e0 en r\u00e9duire ind\u00fbment la port\u00e9e ou \u00e0 \u00e9chapper compl\u00e8tement aux obligations qui en d\u00e9coulent. [Je souligne; par. 48.]\nIl est important, toutefois, de noter que ces commentaires demeurent des commentaires portant sur les institutions particuli\u00e8res \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es au par. 32(1) \u2014 \u00ab le Parlement, les l\u00e9gislatures provinciales et la branche ex\u00e9cutive des gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou provinciaux \u00bb \u2014 et non pas sur une conception abstraite des \u00ab gouvernements \u00bb de fa\u00e7on plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n[456] Notre Cour a voulu donner effet \u00e0 ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de en interpr\u00e9tant les limites du \u00ab gouvernement \u00bb d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui refl\u00e8te la fa\u00e7on dont le gouvernement prend forme dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne moderne. Une telle approche est \u00e9tay\u00e9e par la mention au par. 32(1) des \u00ab domaines relevant \u00bb des gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux (GVTA, par. 14) : les entit\u00e9s ne faisant pas partie des institutions des gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux, mais \u00ab faisant l\u2019objet d\u2019un contr\u00f4le gouvernemental ou ex\u00e9cutant des fonctions v\u00e9ritablement gouvernementales ressortissent elles\u2011m\u00eames aux \u201cdomaines relevant\u201d de l\u2019assembl\u00e9e l\u00e9gislative qui les a cr\u00e9\u00e9es \u00bb (Godbout, par. 48 (je souligne)). La Cour a donc conclu que le \u00ab gouvernement \u00bb au sens du par. 32(1) englobe des entit\u00e9s qui peuvent ne pas, \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, appartenir aux institutions des gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux, mais qui pr\u00e9sentent un lien suffisant avec celles\u2011ci pour que l\u2019ensemble ou une partie de leurs activit\u00e9s rel\u00e8ve de ces gouvernements (GVTA, par. 16).\n[457] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Eldridge, le juge La Forest a pass\u00e9 en revue la jurisprudence de notre Cour et \u00e9tabli un cadre d\u2019analyse \u00e0 deux volets afin de donner effet au par. 32(1). Dans le premier volet, un tribunal peut conclure que \u00ab l\u2019entit\u00e9 elle\u2011m\u00eame fait partie du \u201cgouvernement\u201d au sens de l\u2019art. 32 [. . .] soit de par sa nature m\u00eame, soit \u00e0 cause du degr\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le exerc\u00e9 par le gouvernement sur elle \u00bb (par. 44). S\u2019il est conclu que l\u2019entit\u00e9 elle\u2011m\u00eame fait partie du \u00ab gouvernement \u00bb au sens du par. 32(1), toutes ses activit\u00e9s sont assujetties \u00e0 la Charte (GVTA, par. 16). Dans le second volet, un tribunal peut statuer que, bien que l\u2019entit\u00e9 elle\u2011m\u00eame ne puisse \u00eatre assimil\u00e9e au gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou \u00e0 celui d\u2019une province, certaines de ses activit\u00e9s particuli\u00e8res peuvent \u00eatre \u00ab attribu\u00e9e[s] au gouvernement \u00bb, nomm\u00e9ment lorsque l\u2019activit\u00e9 vise \u00ab la mise en \u0153uvre d\u2019un r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gal ou d\u2019un programme gouvernemental donn\u00e9 \u00bb (Eldridge, par. 44). Dans un tel cas, seules ces activit\u00e9s donnent lieu \u00e0 un examen fond\u00e9 sur la Charte parce qu\u2019elles sont effectivement les activit\u00e9s du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou du gouvernement d\u2019une province en application du par. 32(1).\n[458] Madame Dickson, divers intervenants et les juridictions inf\u00e9rieures se fondent sur des parties de la jurisprudence de notre Cour \u00e0 l\u2019appui de l\u2019id\u00e9e selon laquelle le par. 32(1) englobe toute entit\u00e9 ou activit\u00e9 qui peut \u00eatre appel\u00e9e un gouvernement ou \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9e de gouvernementale, m\u00eame en l\u2019absence de lien avec le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou un gouvernement provincial. Cette proposition est ind\u00e9fendable. Comme je vais l\u2019expliquer, la Cour a toujours exig\u00e9 \u2014 en application des deux volets de l\u2019arr\u00eat Eldridge \u2014 que l\u2019entit\u00e9 ou l\u2019activit\u00e9 pr\u00e9sente un lien important avec le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou le gouvernement d\u2019une province pour relever du champ d\u2019application de \u00ab gouvernement \u00bb au sens du par. 32(1). Dans la jurisprudence de notre Cour relative au par. 32(1), les mots \u00ab gouvernement \u00bb ou \u00ab gouvernemental \u00bb ont toujours fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux gouvernements particuliers \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s au par. 32(1). L\u2019arr\u00eat Eldridge et ceux rendus dans sa foul\u00e9e ne constituent pas un \u00e9largissement du par. 32(1) cr\u00e9\u00e9 par voie judiciaire. La Cour a plut\u00f4t cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter le par. 32(1) de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 faire en sorte que les gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux ne se soustraient pas \u00e0 leurs responsabilit\u00e9s constitutionnelles pr\u00e9vues par la Charte. Certaines parties de cette jurisprudence ne peuvent pas \u00eatre prises hors contexte pour \u00e9tayer une application du par. 32(1) qui est dissoci\u00e9e de cet objectif sous\u2011jacent ainsi que du texte de la disposition, de son historique et de sa place dans la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982.\n(1) La nature de l\u2019entit\u00e9\n[459] Un lien important avec la Couronne a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire en application du premier volet de l\u2019arr\u00eat Eldridge, selon lequel il peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 qu\u2019une entit\u00e9 \u00ab elle\u2011m\u00eame fait partie du \u201cgouvernement\u201d \u00bb et qu\u2019elle est donc assujettie \u00e0 la Charte dans toutes ses activit\u00e9s. \u00c0 titre d\u2019exemple, de telles entit\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crites, entre autres, comme faisant partie de l\u2019\u00ab appareil \u00bb ou de la \u00ab structure \u00bb du gouvernement (McKinney, p. 275; Eldridge, par. 37 et 40), comme \u00e9tant des \u00ab organismes subordonn\u00e9s \u00bb (Stoffman c. Vancouver General Hospital, [1990] 3 R.C.S. 483, p. 507), des \u00ab organes \u00bb (McKinney, p. 272) ou une \u00ab \u00e9manation \u00bb (Eldridge, par. 39; Godbout, par. 47) du gouvernement, ou encore ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00ab assimil[\u00e9es] \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tat \u00bb (R. c. Buhay, 2003 CSC 30, [2003] 1 R.C.S. 631, par. 28). Dans chacune de ces causes, le terme \u00ab gouvernement \u00bb renvoyait soit au gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, soit au gouvernement provincial, et il ressort de ces descriptions qu\u2019un lien important avec l\u2019un de ces gouvernements est n\u00e9cessaire. Il en est ainsi parce qu\u2019un tel lien prend en compte la pr\u00e9occupation sous\u2011jacente selon laquelle les gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux seraient autrement en mesure de se soustraire \u00e0 un examen fond\u00e9 sur la Charte par l\u2019entremise d\u2019entit\u00e9s qui sont des prolongements de ces gouvernements.\n[460] Notre Cour a reconnu que les entit\u00e9s au sein de l\u2019\u00c9tat administratif moderne prennent diff\u00e9rentes formes et ont divers degr\u00e9s d\u2019autonomie \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux dans leurs activit\u00e9s. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019arr\u00eat Eldridge reconna\u00eet deux mani\u00e8res g\u00e9n\u00e9rales de consid\u00e9rer que l\u2019entit\u00e9 \u00ab elle\u2011m\u00eame fait partie du \u201cgouvernement\u201d \u00bb. Dans les deux cas, un lien important avec le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou le gouvernement provincial est n\u00e9cessaire.\n[461] Premi\u00e8rement, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que certaines entit\u00e9s \u2014 comme un arbitre du travail (Slaight Communications Inc. c. Davidson, [1989] 1 R.C.S. 1038), une commission des droits de la personne (Blencoe) et des municipalit\u00e9s (Godbout) \u2014\u00e9taient des entit\u00e9s gouvernementales \u00ab de par leur nature m\u00eame \u00bb (voir Eldridge, par. 44), m\u00eame si elles exer\u00e7aient leurs activit\u00e9s de mani\u00e8re ind\u00e9pendante des gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provincial. Ces termes semblent \u00eatre le fondement des arguments reposant sur le fait que la VGFN est un gouvernement. Cependant, l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de la nature de l\u2019entit\u00e9 suivant l\u2019arr\u00eat Eldridge ne se fait pas par renvoi \u00e0 une conception abstraite de la notion de \u00ab gouvernement \u00bb. Il s\u2019agit plut\u00f4t d\u2019une analyse du lien de l\u2019entit\u00e9 avec les gouvernements particuliers \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s au par. 32(1), comme en t\u00e9moignent la cr\u00e9ation de l\u2019entit\u00e9, sa structure et ses pouvoirs. Par exemple, dans chacune des causes susmentionn\u00e9es, l\u2019entit\u00e9 devait \u00e0 la fois son existence et ses pouvoirs au gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou \u00e0 un gouvernement provincial. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019arbitre du travail dans Slaight et la commission des droits de la personne dans Blencoe ont \u00ab exerc[\u00e9] tous les deux des pouvoirs gouvernementaux conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par un corps l\u00e9gislatif \u00bb et, \u00ab [d]ans chaque cas, l\u2019origine du pouvoir accord\u00e9 [\u00e9tait] en fin de compte le gouvernement \u00bb (Blencoe, par. 39). De plus, l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment d\u00e9terminant dans la d\u00e9cision portant que la Charte s\u2019applique aux municipalit\u00e9s dans Godbout \u00e9tait le fait non pas qu\u2019elles sont un gouvernement (elles le sont clairement), mais plut\u00f4t qu\u2019elles \u00ab sont des cr\u00e9atures des provinces dont elles tirent leur pouvoir de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer \u00bb (par. 51).\n[462] Mes coll\u00e8gues les juges Kasirer et Jamal affirment que la VGFN pr\u00e9sente les indices repr\u00e9sentatifs d\u2019un \u00ab gouvernement par nature \u00bb (par. 78) parce que,\nbien que (comme l\u2019a conclu le juge de premi\u00e8re instance) les Vuntut Gwitchin se gouvernent eux\u2011m\u00eames depuis des temps imm\u00e9moriaux, et m\u00eame si la VGFN a le pouvoir de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer en vertu de son droit inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale, elle se voit \u00e9galement reconna\u00eetre le statut d\u2019entit\u00e9 juridique en vertu de la loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de mise en \u0153uvre. Dans cette mesure, elle tient au moins une partie de son pouvoir de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer d\u2019un texte de loi f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. En d\u2019autres termes, le pouvoir de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer de la VGFN \u00e9mane au moins en partie du Parlement, en ce que la VGFN exerce des pouvoirs que le Parlement aurait autrement exerc\u00e9s en vertu de la comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative qu\u2019il d\u00e9tient en vertu du par. 91(24) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867. [En italique dans l\u2019original; par. 82.]\nCela implique que, comme l\u2019entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce a \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9e par une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, un gouvernement autochtone autonome pour la VGFN est en quelque sorte une \u00e9manation de la comp\u00e9tence f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Cela est fondamentalement incompatible avec la nature, le statut et l\u2019objet d\u2019un tel gouvernement. Son objet est de reconna\u00eetre et de donner un effet pratique \u00e0 une autonomie qui diff\u00e8re, de par son statut et sa nature, de celle exerc\u00e9e par les conseils de bande en vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens. L\u2019id\u00e9e relative \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale n\u2019est pas qu\u2019elle constitue un \u00ab pouvoir [qui] \u00e9mane [. . .] du Parlement \u00bb, mais plut\u00f4t que les peuples autochtones exercent une comp\u00e9tence qui est l\u00e9gitimement la leur.\n[463] Par cons\u00e9quent, le fait qu\u2019une entit\u00e9 est un gouvernement ne m\u00e8ne pas automatiquement \u00e0 la conclusion que la Charte s\u2019applique \u00e0 ses activit\u00e9s. La conclusion selon laquelle une entit\u00e9 n\u2019est pas assujettie \u00e0 la Charte ne signifie pas non plus qu\u2019elle ne peut pas \u00eatre un gouvernement. \u00c0 titre d\u2019exemple, le gouvernement du Royaume\u2011Uni n\u2019en est pas moins un gouvernement parce qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas assujetti \u00e0 la Charte. La jurisprudence reconna\u00eet simplement que la port\u00e9e du par. 32(1), bien qu\u2019elle puisse inclure des prolongements des gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux dans l\u2019\u00c9tat administratif moderne, n\u2019est pas large au point d\u2019englober des entit\u00e9s qui n\u2019ont pas de lien important avec les gouvernements particuliers \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s au par. 32(1) lui\u2011m\u00eame.\n[464] Deuxi\u00e8mement, certaines entit\u00e9s peuvent ne pas faire partie du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou de celui d\u2019une province de par leur nature m\u00eame, mais n\u00e9anmoins \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme faisant partie du \u00ab gouvernement \u00bb pour l\u2019application de la Charte lorsqu\u2019elles sont assujetties au \u00ab pouvoir substantiel \u00bb d\u2019un de ces gouvernements (GVTA, par. 16). Le contr\u00f4le gouvernemental doit \u00eatre \u00ab routinier ou r\u00e9gulier \u00bb plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00ab absolu ou extraordinaire \u00bb pour qu\u2019une entit\u00e9 qui ne fait pas partie du gouvernement de par sa nature m\u00eame entre dans la sph\u00e8re du gouvernement exer\u00e7ant le contr\u00f4le (Stoffman, p. 513\u2011514; Harrison c. Universit\u00e9 de la Colombie\u2011Britannique, [1990] 3 R.C.S. 451, p. 463). De toute \u00e9vidence, cette norme implique l\u2019existence d\u2019un lien important avec le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou un gouvernement provincial. Ainsi, le coll\u00e8ge dans Douglas\/Kwantlen Faculty Assn. c. Douglas College, [1990] 3 R.C.S. 570, faisait \u00ab partie de l\u2019appareil gouvernemental \u00bb et \u00e9tait assujetti \u00e0 la Charte parce que le gouvernement provincial contr\u00f4lait ses activit\u00e9s en tout temps (p. 584; voir aussi, p. ex., GVTA, par. 17\u201121). Cela distinguait le coll\u00e8ge des universit\u00e9s examin\u00e9es dans les affaires McKinney et Harrison, qui, bien qu\u2019\u00e9tant assujetties aux r\u00e8glements provinciaux et tributaires du financement provincial, n\u2019\u00e9taient pas assujetties \u00e0 la Charte parce qu\u2019elles \u00e9taient \u00ab essentiellement des organismes autonomes \u00bb (Douglas College, p. 584\u2011585; voir aussi Stoffman, p. 513\u2011514).\n[465] La Band Members Alliance and Advocacy Association of Canada avance que le par. 32(1) [traduction] \u00ab vise \u00e0 \u00e9tablir la ligne de d\u00e9marcation entre les relations intrins\u00e8quement priv\u00e9es et publiques \u00bb (m. interv., par. 14). Le terme \u00ab priv\u00e9 \u00bb est souvent utilis\u00e9 pour d\u00e9crire des entit\u00e9s qui ne font pas elles\u2011m\u00eames partie du \u00ab gouvernement \u00bb, tels des particuliers (Dolphin Delivery, p. 599\u2011600), des personnes morales (Eldridge, par. 35), ou encore des chemins de fer et des transporteurs a\u00e9riens (McKinney, p. 269; Stoffman, p. 511). Toutefois, notre Cour a express\u00e9ment rejet\u00e9 la distinction entre \u00ab priv\u00e9 \u00bb et \u00ab public \u00bb en tant que crit\u00e8re relatif au par. 32(1). Le fait qu\u2019une entit\u00e9 exerce des fonctions publiques \u2014 m\u00eame celles qui sont semblables \u00e0 celles dont s\u2019acquittent le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou celui d\u2019une province \u2014 ne permet pas de d\u00e9cider si l\u2019entit\u00e9 elle\u2011m\u00eame fait partie d\u2019un de ces gouvernements. La Cour a \u00e0 maintes reprises affirm\u00e9 que \u00ab [l]e crit\u00e8re de l\u2019objet public est simplement inad\u00e9quat \u00bb et qu\u2019il \u00ab n\u2019est tout simplement pas le crit\u00e8re qu\u2019impose l\u2019art. 32 \u00bb (McKinney, p. 269; Eldridge, par. 43; Godbout, par. 49; Buhay, par. 28). Inversement, d\u00e8s lors qu\u2019il est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 qu\u2019une entit\u00e9 \u00ab elle\u2011m\u00eame fait partie du \u201cgouvernement\u201d \u00bb suivant le premier volet de l\u2019arr\u00eat Eldridge, la Charte s\u2019applique \u00e0 toutes ses activit\u00e9s, \u00ab qu\u2019elles puissent ou non \u00eatre par ailleurs qualifi\u00e9es de \u201cpriv\u00e9es\u201d \u00bb (Eldridge, par. 41). L\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur le par. 32(1) est toujours ax\u00e9e sur le lien entre l\u2019entit\u00e9 et le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou celui d\u2019une province.\n(2) La nature de l\u2019activit\u00e9\n[466] Un lien important avec le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou un gouvernement provincial est aussi n\u00e9cessaire en application du second volet de l\u2019arr\u00eat Eldridge, selon lequel une \u00ab entit[\u00e9] non gouvernemental[e] \u00bb (c.\u2011\u00e0\u2011d. une entit\u00e9 qui ne fait pas \u00ab elle\u2011m\u00eame [. . .] partie du \u201cgouvernement\u201d \u00bb au sens du par. 32(1) (voir le par. 41)) peut n\u00e9anmoins \u00eatre assujettie \u00e0 la Charte dans l\u2019exercice d\u2019activit\u00e9s particuli\u00e8res qui peuvent \u00eatre \u00ab attribu\u00e9e[s] au gouvernement \u00bb (par. 44).\n[467] Comme pour le premier volet, \u00ab le fait qu\u2019une activit\u00e9 particuli\u00e8re puisse \u00eatre dite de nature \u201cpublique\u201d n\u2019est pas suffisant pour qu[\u2019elle] soit assimil\u00e9e au \u201cgouvernement\u201d pour l\u2019application de l\u2019art. 32 de la Charte \u00bb (Eldridge, par. 43; voir aussi Buhay, par. 28). Il ne suffit pas non plus de faire \u00e9tat de tout lien, aussi t\u00e9nu soit\u2011il, entre les activit\u00e9s d\u2019une entit\u00e9 non gouvernementale et le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou un gouvernement provincial. Ce qu\u2019il faut, c\u2019est un \u00ab lien [. . .] direct et [. . .] d\u00e9fini \u00bb entre le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou celui d\u2019une province et l\u2019activit\u00e9 (Eldridge, par. 51, citant Dolphin Delivery, p. 601). Autrement dit, il faut pouvoir \u00ab dire \u00e0 juste titre que la d\u00e9cision est celle du gouvernement ou que la participation gouvernementale \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision est suffisante pour en faire un acte du gouvernement \u00bb (McKinney, p. 274).\n[468] Encore une fois, la port\u00e9e du second volet de l\u2019arr\u00eat Eldridge vise \u00e0 donner effet \u00e0 une interpr\u00e9tation moderne des m\u00e9canismes gouvernementaux et du fondement expr\u00e8s du cadre d\u2019analyse d\u2019Eldridge. Si les gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux ne peuvent pas exercer une activit\u00e9 directement sans contrevenir \u00e0 la Charte, ils ne peuvent pas se soustraire \u00e0 un examen fond\u00e9 sur la Charte en d\u00e9l\u00e9guant l\u2019activit\u00e9 \u00e0 une entit\u00e9 non gouvernementale (Eldridge, par. 40). M\u00eame si une autre entit\u00e9 est charg\u00e9e de l\u2019exercer, la nature de l\u2019activit\u00e9 n\u2019a pas chang\u00e9 : elle demeure celle du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou provincial. Les entit\u00e9s non gouvernementales sont \u00ab simplement le m\u00e9canisme \u00bb (par. 50) choisi par le gouvernement pour l\u2019accomplissement de ce qui constitue, essentiellement, des activit\u00e9s qui peuvent \u00eatre attribu\u00e9es au gouvernement. En revanche, aucune question relative \u00e0 une possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9chapper \u00e0 la Charte ne se pose \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019entit\u00e9s qui agissent dans la poursuite de leurs propres politiques et objectifs, plut\u00f4t que de mettre en \u0153uvre celles du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou d\u2019un gouvernement provincial. Cette distinction explique pourquoi la jurisprudence de notre Cour s\u2019est toujours attach\u00e9e \u00e0 la question de savoir si l\u2019activit\u00e9 implique la mise en \u0153uvre d\u2019un r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gal, d\u2019une politique gouvernementale ou d\u2019un programme gouvernemental donn\u00e9s (voir, p. ex., Eldridge, par. 43\u201144; Blencoe, par. 37).\nD. R\u00e9sum\u00e9\n[469] Il est clair que la Charte s\u2019applique aux gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux, en vertu du par. 32(1). Bien que la jurisprudence reconnaisse que le \u00ab gouvernement \u00bb rev\u00eat plusieurs formes dans l\u2019\u00c9tat administratif moderne, une entit\u00e9 ou activit\u00e9 doit avoir un lien important avec le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou celui d\u2019une province pour relever du champ d\u2019application du par. 32(1) de la Charte. Par cons\u00e9quent, pour d\u00e9cider si la Charte s\u2019applique \u00e0 une entit\u00e9 telle que la VGFN ou \u00e0 ses activit\u00e9s, l\u2019accent doit \u00eatre mis sur le lien existant avec le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou le gouvernement provincial.\nIV. Les Arrangements de la VGFN n\u2019\u00e9tablissent pas de lien important avec le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou avec celui du Yukon\n[470] Ayant examin\u00e9 la port\u00e9e du par. 32(1) de la Charte, je me penche maintenant sur la question de savoir si la VGFN ou ses activit\u00e9s \u2014 \u00e0 savoir l\u2019adoption par celle\u2011ci de l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence \u2014 rel\u00e8vent de cette port\u00e9e.\n[471] Eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation erron\u00e9e que donnent les intervenants, y compris le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, \u00e0 la jurisprudence de notre Cour portant sur le par. 32(1), bon nombre de leurs arguments ne cherchent aucunement \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer l\u2019existence d\u2019un lien important avec le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou avec celui du Yukon. Cependant, certains des arguments de Mme Dickson visent le lien entre la VGFN et le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral en vertu des divers arrangements concernant l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale convenus et adopt\u00e9s vers 1993\u20111994 (\u00ab Arrangements de la VGFN \u00bb). Madame Dickson affirme que les Arrangements de la VGFN suffisent \u00e0 \u00e9tablir le lien entre la VGFN et le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral de la mani\u00e8re requise par le par. 32(1). Ces arguments sont au c\u0153ur de la pr\u00e9sente partie de mes motifs.\n[472] Les Arrangements de la VGFN comprennent de multiples instruments. Premi\u00e8rement, les signataires ont conclu l\u2019Entente d\u00e9finitive de la premi\u00e8re nation des Gwitchin Vuntut (1993). Celle\u2011ci renferme les dispositions de l\u2019Accord\u2011cadre d\u00e9finitif conclu en 1993 entre les gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et du Yukon et le Council for Yukon Indians, lequel repr\u00e9sentait plusieurs Premi\u00e8res Nations du Yukon, notamment la VGFN. L\u2019Entente d\u00e9finitive est un trait\u00e9 prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par le par. 35(1) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982. Elle met en \u0153uvre un cadre visant \u00e0 \u00ab \u00e9tabli[r] des institutions d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale et de gestion des terres et des ressources \u00bb (First Nation of Nacho Nyak Dun c. Yukon, 2017 CSC 58, [2017] 2 R.C.S. 576, par. 10). Comme suite \u00e0 ce cadre, les signataires ont souscrit \u00e0 l\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale de la premi\u00e8re nation des Gwitchin Vuntut (1993). L\u2019Entente d\u00e9finitive dispose que l\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale n\u2019est pas un trait\u00e9 en vertu de l\u2019art. 35, bien que son contenu et sa mise en \u0153uvre d\u00e9coulent directement des param\u00e8tres \u00e9tablis par l\u2019Entente d\u00e9finitive. Enfin, des lois, y compris la loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale intitul\u00e9e Loi sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale des premi\u00e8res nations du Yukon, L.C. 1994, c. 35 (\u00ab Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00bb), ont \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9es par le Parlement et la l\u00e9gislature du Yukon afin de donner effet aux ententes susmentionn\u00e9es (voir, p. ex., la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, art. 4). Je signale que l\u2019adoption de telles lois \u00e9tait express\u00e9ment envisag\u00e9e par l\u2019Accord\u2011cadre d\u00e9finitif et l\u2019Entente d\u00e9finitive, qui comprennent notamment un engagement \u00e0 n\u00e9gocier avec les Premi\u00e8res Nations du Yukon et \u00e0 consulter celles\u2011ci.\n[473] Les observations de Mme Dickson qui se fondent sur les Arrangements de la VGFN comme \u00e9tablissant un lien important avec le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral sont souvent obscures, tant en ce qui concerne leurs hypoth\u00e8ses sous\u2011jacentes qu\u2019en ce qui concerne le volet du cadre d\u2019analyse de l\u2019arr\u00eat Eldridge qui est invoqu\u00e9. Par souci de clart\u00e9, je vais examiner ses arguments selon le cadre d\u2019analyse \u00e9tabli dans Eldridge et je vais expliquer pourquoi ils doivent \u00eatre rejet\u00e9s en application des deux volets.\nA. La nature de la VGFN\n[474] La question \u00e0 laquelle il faut r\u00e9pondre en application du premier volet de l\u2019arr\u00eat Eldridge est celle de savoir s\u2019il existe un lien important entre la VGFN et le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou celui du Yukon, de sorte que la VGFN elle\u2011m\u00eame fait partie du \u00ab gouvernement \u00bb au sens du par. 32(1). Comme je l\u2019ai expliqu\u00e9, cette appr\u00e9ciation est fond\u00e9e soit sur la nature de l\u2019entit\u00e9, soit sur le degr\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le qu\u2019exerce le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou le gouvernement du Yukon sur l\u2019entit\u00e9. Personne ne pr\u00e9tend que la VGFN est contr\u00f4l\u00e9e par le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou par le gouvernement du Yukon, et personne ne soutient non plus que la VGFN fait, de par sa nature m\u00eame, partie du gouvernement du Yukon; par cons\u00e9quent, la seule question qui se pose est celle de savoir si la VGFN elle\u2011m\u00eame fait partie du \u00ab gouvernement \u00bb f\u00e9d\u00e9ral de par sa nature m\u00eame, comme en t\u00e9moignent sa cr\u00e9ation, sa structure et ses pouvoirs.\n[475] Madame Dickson avance que [traduction] \u00ab [l]a constitution de la VGFN et toutes les lois de la VGFN \u00bb (m.i. au pourvoi incident, par. 29; voir aussi le par. 30) sont mises en \u0153uvre au moyen d\u2019une d\u00e9l\u00e9gation ou d\u2019une attribution l\u00e9gislative de pouvoirs faite par le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral aux Vuntut Gwitchin, par l\u2019entremise des Arrangements de la VGFN. Par exemple, elle se fonde sur la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale pour qualifier les [traduction] \u00ab pouvoirs \u00bb de la VGFN de \u00ab cr\u00e9ations de la loi \u00bb et elle affirme que les responsabilit\u00e9s de la VGFN lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00ab transf\u00e9r\u00e9es \u00bb par le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral (par. 34). Elle soutient essentiellement que les Arrangements de la VGFN font en sorte que le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral cr\u00e9e et structure la gouvernance de la VGFN et d\u00e9l\u00e8gue des pouvoirs \u00e0 la VGFN d\u2019une mani\u00e8re suffisante pour faire entrer celle\u2011ci dans le champ d\u2019application du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral au sens du par. 32(1).\n[476] Cet argument traduit une conception fondamentalement erron\u00e9e de la relation sp\u00e9ciale qui existe entre les Vuntut Gwitchin, d\u2019une part, et le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral en tant que l\u2019un des successeurs de la Couronne imp\u00e9riale, d\u2019autre part. Il traduit \u00e9galement une conception erron\u00e9e de l\u2019effet r\u00e9parateur qu\u2019ont les Arrangements de la VGFN sur les structures de gouvernance internes des Vuntut Gwitchin.\n[477] Dans sa jurisprudence, notre Cour a toujours confirm\u00e9 la relation sp\u00e9ciale qui existe entre les peuples autochtones et la Couronne (Delgamuukw c. Colombie\u2011Britannique, [1997] 3 R.C.S. 1010; Rio Tinto Alcan Inc. c. Conseil tribal Carrier Sekani, 2010 CSC 43, [2010] 2 R.C.S. 650, par. 59\u201160; Nacho Nyak Dun, par. 33). Cette relation d\u00e9coule de la pr\u00e9sence ant\u00e9rieure des peuples autochtones et de leur occupation du territoire qui englobe maintenant le Canada : \u00ab Bien avant que les Europ\u00e9ens explorent l\u2019Am\u00e9rique du Nord et s\u2019y installent, les peuples autochtones occupaient et utilisaient la plus grande partie de ce vaste territoire en soci\u00e9t\u00e9s organis\u00e9es et distinctives poss\u00e9dant leurs propres structures sociales et politiques \u00bb (Mitchell c. M.R.N., 2001 CSC 33, [2001] 1 R.C.S. 911, par. 9; voir aussi R. c. Van der Peet, [1996] 2 R.C.S. 507, par. 30). Notre Cour a \u00e9galement reconnu \u00e0 maintes reprises la distinction entre les traditions juridiques autochtones et non autochtones (Delgamuukw, par. 144\u2011147; R. c. Marshall, 2005 CSC 43, [2005] 2 R.C.S. 220, par. 130), ce qui t\u00e9moigne du fait que chaque tradition a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9labor\u00e9e par des structures de gouvernance distinctes. Les Vuntut Gwitchin ne font pas exception : ils avaient cr\u00e9\u00e9 leur propre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 bien avant l\u2019affirmation de la souverainet\u00e9 de la Couronne (motifs de premi\u00e8re instance, par. 11). Au sein de cette soci\u00e9t\u00e9, ils ont \u00e9labor\u00e9 leurs propres lois, r\u00e8gles et coutumes, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 leurs propres structures de gouvernance (par. 43).\n[478] Au d\u00e9but des relations entre la Couronne et les Autochtones, la Couronne imp\u00e9riale n\u2019est essentiellement pas intervenue dans les affaires de gouvernance interne des peuples autochtones et a plut\u00f4t \u00e9tabli des relations avec les dirigeants et les communaut\u00e9s autochtones (voir, p. ex., la Proclamation royale, 1763 (G.\u2011B.), 3 Geo. 3 (reproduite dans L.R.C. 1985, app. II, no 1), et le Trait\u00e9 de Niagara (1764)). Toutefois, le respect de la Couronne envers la gouvernance autochtone a fini par c\u00e9der le pas \u00e0 la \u00ab surimposition des lois et coutumes europ\u00e9ennes \u00bb (Manitoba Metis Federation Inc. c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2013 CSC 14, [2013] 1 R.C.S. 623, par. 67, citant Van der Peet, par. 248), en particulier par l\u2019entremise du syst\u00e8me des conseils de bande pr\u00e9vu par la Loi sur les Indiens (motifs de premi\u00e8re instance, par. 11\u201113). \u00c0 l\u2019interne, les Vuntut Gwitchin ont continu\u00e9 \u00e0 prendre collectivement d\u2019importantes d\u00e9cisions en mati\u00e8re de gouvernance (motifs de premi\u00e8re instance, par. 12); cependant, leurs traditions juridiques ont effectivement \u00e9t\u00e9 rel\u00e9gu\u00e9es \u00ab \u00e0 un espace que fr\u00e9quentent les membres de la communaut\u00e9, mais non les tiers. Ce faisant, le droit [autochtone] est devenu invisible dans l\u2019espace public ainsi que dans les structures et institutions de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 dominante qui ne lui reconnaissent aucune validit\u00e9 \u00bb (G. Motard, \u00ab Regards crois\u00e9s entre le droit innu et le droit qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois : territorialit\u00e9s en conflit \u00bb (2020), 65 R.D. McGill 421, p. 442). Comme l\u2019a expliqu\u00e9 le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, [traduction] \u00ab [l]e d\u00e9placement des Vuntut Gwitchin de leur territoire et leur ali\u00e9nation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de celui\u2011ci au moyen de lois et de politiques coloniales impos\u00e9es, y compris les pensionnats autochtones, l\u2019application de la Loi sur les Indiens et l\u2019exploitation des ressources sans le consentement ou la participation des Vuntut Gwitchin, ont caus\u00e9 un pr\u00e9judice important \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 et \u00e0 la sant\u00e9 des Vuntut Gwitchin en tant que collectivit\u00e9 \u00bb (motifs de premi\u00e8re instance, par. 13). De telles exp\u00e9riences ne sont pas propres aux Vuntut Gwitchin.\n[479] C\u2019est eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 ce contexte historique que des trait\u00e9s modernes et ententes semblables ont cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9faire des structures de gouvernance impos\u00e9es comme la Loi sur les Indiens. Pour reprendre le terme employ\u00e9 par la professeure Motard, ces trait\u00e9s et ententes r\u00e9tablissent un \u00ab espace \u00bb permettant aux peuples autochtones de g\u00e9rer leurs propres affaires conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 leurs propres lois, coutumes et pratiques. Ces actes r\u00e9parateurs sont prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par des engagements contraignants de la Couronne \u00e0 [traduction] \u00ab renoncer au contr\u00f4le que le gouvernement canadien a historiquement exerc\u00e9 \u00bb, et \u00e0 \u00ab cr\u00e9er [ainsi] un espace physique et juridictionnel permettant \u00e0 ces communaut\u00e9s d\u2019exprimer et de favoriser la diff\u00e9rence culturelle \u00bb (K. Manley\u2011Casimir, \u00ab Toward a Bijural Interpretation of the Principle of Respect in Aboriginal Law \u00bb (2016), 61 R.D. McGill 939, p. 974). Les engagements mutuels pris dans le cadre de ces ententes sont n\u00e9cessaires pour faire en sorte que les institutions f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, provinciales ou territoriales ne fassent pas abstraction des structures et traditions de gouvernance autochtone ou que ces derni\u00e8res ne deviennent pas invisibles en pr\u00e9sence de lois conflictuelles. Il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019une pr\u00e9occupation l\u00e9gitime, puisque les structures de gouvernance autochtone \u00e9mergent d\u2019une longue p\u00e9riode pendant laquelle c\u2019est ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9.\n[480] Le lien continu qu\u2019impliquent les engagements mutuels dans un trait\u00e9 moderne ou une autre entente de la sorte ne signifie pas que les structures de gouvernance autochtone tirent leur existence ou leurs pouvoirs du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. De telles ententes ont plut\u00f4t une nature \u00ab sui generis \u00bb (Nacho Nyak Dun, par. 33); elles \u00ab tentent de contribuer \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation de [l\u2019]objectif de r\u00e9conciliation [. . .] en cr\u00e9ant le fondement juridique propre \u00e0 favoriser une relation \u00e0 long terme harmonieuse entre les collectivit\u00e9s autochtones et non autochtones \u00bb (Beckman, par. 10). Comme l\u2019a expliqu\u00e9 la juge Deschamps dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Beckman au sujet des diverses ententes conclues avec les Premi\u00e8res Nations du Yukon conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019Accord\u2011cadre d\u00e9finitif, \u00ab ce qui [y est pr\u00e9vu] lie les parties \u00bb et \u00ab [c]es ententes constituent la concr\u00e9tisation de la prise en charge par les premi\u00e8res nations concern\u00e9es de leur destin\u00e9e \u00bb (par. 91).\n[481] L\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale de la VGFN permet de r\u00e9aliser ces objectifs en abolissant la structure de conseil de bande pr\u00e9vue par la Loi sur les Indiens, structure qui \u00ab cesse d\u2019exister \u00bb (art. 9.1). Divers autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de la Loi sur les Indiens sont \u00e9galement rendus inapplicables par la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale qui a suivi, conjointement avec des modifications apport\u00e9es \u00e0 d\u2019autres lois con\u00e7ues pour donner effet aux engagements de la Couronne envers les Premi\u00e8res Nations du Yukon (Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, par. 17(1) et art. 33 \u00e0 39). Cette \u00e9volution a eu pour cons\u00e9quence de r\u00e9tablir un espace permettant aux Vuntut Gwitchin de g\u00e9rer leurs affaires conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 leurs propres structures de gouvernance, plut\u00f4t que selon les structures impos\u00e9es par la Couronne. Il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019un objectif explicite de l\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale :\n2.1 La premi\u00e8re nation des Gwitchin Vuntut est dot\u00e9e de structures traditionnelles de d\u00e9cision qu\u2019elle d\u00e9sire conserver et int\u00e9grer aux formes de gouvernement contemporaines.\nC\u2019est ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9. La VGFN a adopt\u00e9 sa propre Constitution, qui \u00e9tablit les structures de gouvernance de la VGFN, dont quatre branches de gouvernement : l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le Conseil des a\u00een\u00e9s, le Conseil et le Tribunal des Vuntut Gwitchin (Constitution de la VGFN, article V(1)). Ces structures constituent [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019expression moderne \u00bb de la gouvernance traditionnelle des Vuntut Gwitchin et elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9labor\u00e9es par les Vuntut Gwitchin au moyen de leur \u00ab pratique de gouvernance [traditionnelle] qui consiste \u00e0 prendre les d\u00e9cisions importantes collectivement par des processus de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration et de discussion communautaires \u00bb (motifs de premi\u00e8re instance, par. 12). Elles ne doivent pas leur existence ou leurs pouvoirs au gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou \u00e0 celui du Yukon.\n[482] En d\u00e9pit de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, Mme Dickson cite plusieurs dispositions de la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale pour affirmer que la Constitution de la VGFN et les lois de la VGFN se voient [traduction] \u00ab conf\u00e9rer force de loi au Canada \u00bb et qu\u2019elles tirent donc leur autorit\u00e9 \u00ab en tant qu\u2019instruments l\u00e9gislatifs auxquels le Parlement a conf\u00e9r\u00e9 force de loi \u00bb (m.i. au pourvoi incident, par. 30\u201131; voir aussi le par. 29). Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une interpr\u00e9tation erron\u00e9e de ce que fait la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et les gouvernements provinciaux ou territoriaux adoptent r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement des lois comme la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale pour ratifier et mettre en \u0153uvre des trait\u00e9s et ententes modernes avec les peuples autochtones. D\u2019ailleurs, les signataires de l\u2019Entente d\u00e9finitive et de l\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale de la VGFN ont express\u00e9ment pr\u00e9vu que le Parlement et la l\u00e9gislature du Yukon adopteraient des lois pour mettre en \u0153uvre ces ententes, et que ces lois seraient le fruit de n\u00e9gociations et de consultations avec les Premi\u00e8res Nations du Yukon. Ce n\u2019est pas le type de loi qui \u00e9tablirait un lien important entre le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et la VGFN comme le requiert l\u2019arr\u00eat Eldridge. En fait, la nature de la participation du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral aux Arrangements de la VGFN a l\u2019effet contraire de ce qui est exig\u00e9 par Eldridge, en faisant en sorte que ce gouvernement respecte l\u2019autonomie de la VGFN conform\u00e9ment aux engagements convenus.\n[483] Madame Dickson interpr\u00e8te \u00e9galement mal l\u2019effet de dispositions particuli\u00e8res de la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Par exemple, elle souligne le fait que l\u2019art. 8 de la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale oblige les Premi\u00e8res Nations \u00e0 adopter une constitution. Cependant, cette disposition ne fait que mettre en \u0153uvre ce \u00e0 quoi les Premi\u00e8res Nations du Yukon avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 souscrit dans l\u2019Accord\u2011cadre d\u00e9finitif. Une constitution \u00e9crite cadre avec l\u2019objectif r\u00e9parateur des Arrangements de la VGFN, parce qu\u2019elle constitue [traduction] \u00ab une \u00e9tape essentielle visant \u00e0 combler l\u2019\u00e9cart entre les traditions juridiques autochtones et le r\u00e9gime juridique canadien \u00bb (A. Geddes, \u00ab Indigenous Constitutionalism Beyond Section 35 and Section 91(24) : The Significance of First Nations Constitutions in Canadian Law \u00bb (2019), 3 Lakehead L.J. 1, p. 15; Entente d\u00e9finitive, art. 24.5; Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale, art. 10.1; Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, par. 8(1)). Elle facilite la transition d\u2019une gouvernance assur\u00e9e par la Couronne \u00e0 une gouvernance assur\u00e9e par les Autochtones en \u00e9tablissant, d\u2019une mani\u00e8re accessible au public, les structures de gouvernance de base choisies par les Vuntut Gwitchin.\n[484] Madame Dickson invoque aussi l\u2019art. 10 de la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une disposition administrative qui, l\u00e0 encore, ne fait que reprendre les proc\u00e9dures auxquelles ont souscrit les Premi\u00e8res Nations du Yukon dans l\u2019Accord\u2011cadre d\u00e9finitif et la VGFN dans l\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale. Par exemple, l\u2019art. 10 \u00e9tablit un recueil des textes l\u00e9gislatifs de la Premi\u00e8re nation du Yukon dans le but d\u2019en faciliter l\u2019acc\u00e8s (Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale, art. 21), une r\u00e8gle applicable par d\u00e9faut pr\u00e9cisant \u00e0 quel moment les textes l\u00e9gislatifs entrent en vigueur afin d\u2019\u00e9viter toute incertitude (Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, par. 10(4)), ainsi qu\u2019une disposition en mati\u00e8re de preuve quant \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re dont le contenu des textes l\u00e9gislatifs des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Yukon peut \u00eatre prouv\u00e9 devant les institutions judiciaires canadiennes (par. 10(5)). Rien dans cette disposition ne tend \u00e0 indiquer que les exercices sous\u2011jacents de la gouvernance de la VGFN tirent leur autorit\u00e9 du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral.\n[485] Le fait que la VGFN ait souscrit dans l\u2019Entente d\u00e9finitive \u00e0 une liste de mati\u00e8res qui feraient l\u2019objet de n\u00e9gociations futures, ou que la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et l\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale aient consacr\u00e9 la comp\u00e9tence de la VGFN l\u2019\u00e9gard de certaines mati\u00e8res pr\u00e9cises, n\u2019indique pas non plus qu\u2019il y a eu une d\u00e9l\u00e9gation de pouvoirs de la part du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. L\u2019\u00e9num\u00e9ration de mati\u00e8res pr\u00e9cises constitue plut\u00f4t un aspect important lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de contraindre le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral \u00e0 respecter les sph\u00e8res des pouvoirs de gouvernance de la VGFN. Les ententes de la VGFN ne pourraient r\u00e9tablir un espace prot\u00e9g\u00e9 permettant aux Vuntut Gwitchin d\u2019exercer leur gouvernance si les signataires n\u2019avaient pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 la port\u00e9e de cet espace. Pour \u00e9viter cela, les ententes de la VGFN cherchent \u00e0 rendre non \u00e9quivoque la port\u00e9e des engagements des gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et territorial. \u00c0 titre d\u2019exemple, les ententes de la VGFN reconnaissent le pouvoir exclusif de la VGFN de r\u00e9gir certains domaines, avec comme corollaire que la Couronne cessera de r\u00e9gir ces domaines en ce qui concerne la VGFN (voir, p. ex., l\u2019Entente d\u00e9finitive, art. 13.1; la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, al. 11(1)a)). Cet accent mis sur le fait de donner concr\u00e8tement effet au r\u00e9tablissement d\u2019un espace pour que la VGFN exerce sa gouvernance explique pourquoi des parties importantes des ententes de la VGFN sont consacr\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 (ou \u00e0 l\u2019inapplicabilit\u00e9) des lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales aux citoyens de la VGFN et \u00e0 la r\u00e9solution des conflits entre les lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales et celles de la VGFN.\n[486] Bien entendu, la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale est une loi du Parlement et elle est donc assujettie \u00e0 la Charte. Par cons\u00e9quent, Mme Dickson peut contester la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ou l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre de ses dispositions sur le fondement de la Charte. Je note que, dans Stoffman, McKinney et Harrison, il y avait un r\u00e9seau de lois provinciales concernant la structure et les r\u00e8glements des h\u00f4pitaux ou des universit\u00e9s, dont chacune pouvait \u00eatre contest\u00e9e sur le fondement de la Charte, mais il a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 que la Charte ne s\u2019appliquait pas aux activit\u00e9s propres \u00e0 ces entit\u00e9s. Comme dans ces causes, Mme Dickson ne conteste pas la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale elle\u2011m\u00eame ou l\u2019une de ses dispositions, mais plut\u00f4t une disposition de la Constitution de la VGFN qui porte sur les structures de gouvernance internes de la VGFN.\n[487] Enfin, les juridictions inf\u00e9rieures et certains intervenants cherchent \u00e0 appliquer la Charte en faisant une analogie entre la VGFN et les conseils de bandes vis\u00e9s par la Loi sur les Indiens ou les municipalit\u00e9s, qui sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9s respectivement par la jurisprudence actuelle comme des prolongements des gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux (voir, p. ex., m. interv., procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Qu\u00e9bec, par. 7; motifs de premi\u00e8re instance, par. 124\u2011125; motifs de la C.A., par. 84). Ces comparaisons ne sont pas fond\u00e9es.\n[488] Les conseils de bandes sont \u00ab cr\u00e9\u00e9[s] par la Loi sur les Indiens \u00bb et leurs pouvoirs et contraintes d\u00e9coulent des lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales (Alliance de la Fonction publique du Canada c. Francis, [1982] 2 R.C.S. 72, p. 78; voir aussi les p. 76\u201177). En revanche, comme je l\u2019ai expliqu\u00e9, les Arrangements de la VGFN abolissent la strate de gouvernance impos\u00e9e par la Couronne qu\u2019est le conseil de bande et rompent plusieurs liens avec le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, afin que les Vuntut Gwitchin r\u00e9tablissent et perp\u00e9tuent leurs propres structures de gouvernance. Je ne suis donc pas d\u2019accord avec l\u2019intervenant le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Qu\u00e9bec lorsqu\u2019il affirme qu\u2019il est \u00ab illogique que les conseils de bande vis\u00e9s par la Loi sur les Indiens soient assujettis \u00e0 la Charte, mais que les autres entit\u00e9s de gouvernance autochtones ne le soient pas \u00bb (m. interv., par. 7). Au contraire, proc\u00e9der comme si le conseil de bande impos\u00e9 par la Couronne et l\u2019actuelle VGFN sont des prolongements du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ne pouvant pas \u00eatre distingu\u00e9s l\u2019un de l\u2019autre revient \u00e0 faire abstraction de l\u2019objet m\u00eame des Arrangements de la VGFN et de la [traduction] \u00ab r\u00e9alisation incroyable que repr\u00e9sente le remplacement de la Loi sur les Indiens par la Constitution de la VGFN \u00bb (motifs de premi\u00e8re instance, par. 152; motifs de la C.A., par. 51).\n[489] De m\u00eame, comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, les municipalit\u00e9s \u00ab sont des cr\u00e9atures des provinces dont elles tirent leur pouvoir de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer; c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire qu\u2019elles exercent des pouvoirs [. . .] confi\u00e9s par les l\u00e9gislatures provinciales \u00bb (Godbout, par. 51), et elles sont assujetties au [traduction] \u00ab pouvoir juridique absolu et sans r\u00e9serve [de la province] de les traiter comme elle l\u2019entend \u00bb (Toronto (Cit\u00e9), par. 2, citant Ontario Public School Boards\u2019 Assn. c. Ontario (Attorney General) (1997), 151 D.L.R. (4th) 346 (C.J. Ont. (Div. g\u00e9n.)), p. 361). Ce n\u2019est clairement pas le cas des structures de gouvernance de la VGFN, dont le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et celui du Yukon se sont engag\u00e9s \u00e0 respecter l\u2019autonomie.\n[490] Il ressort clairement de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de que la VGFN ne fait pas, de par sa nature, partie de l\u2019appareil du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral au sens du par. 32(1). Ses structures de gouvernance internes prennent plut\u00f4t leur source dans les lois, coutumes et pratiques propres \u00e0 la VGFN. Les Arrangements de la VGFN donnent effet aux structures de gouvernance propres \u00e0 la VGFN au sein du Canada contemporain au moyen d\u2019engagements mutuellement contraignants conclus entre la VGFN et la Couronne.\nB. La nature de l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence\n[491] Le second volet du cadre d\u2019analyse de l\u2019arr\u00eat Eldridge requiert l\u2019examen de l\u2019activit\u00e9 elle\u2011m\u00eame (Eldridge, par. 44). En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la question qui se pose est celle de savoir si, de par sa nature, l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence adopt\u00e9e par la VGFN peut \u00eatre \u00ab attribu\u00e9e \u00bb au gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou \u00e0 celui du Yukon en vertu du par. 32(1). On ne sait pas avec certitude si Mme Dickson invoque le second volet d\u2019Eldridge. Bien qu\u2019elle cible parfois pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence, ses arguments portent sur l\u2019enti\u00e8ret\u00e9 de la Constitution de la VGFN et sur toutes les lois de la VGFN. Elle met l\u2019accent sur diverses dispositions de la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale pour affirmer que les lois de la VGFN se voient conf\u00e9rer une force externe par l\u2019entremise de la loi et peuvent donc \u00eatre attribu\u00e9es \u00e0 la Couronne. Toutefois, m\u00eame s\u2019il est interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme se rapportant au second volet d\u2019Eldridge, son argument selon lequel [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence a [. . .] force de loi au Canada en vertu de la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00bb (m.i. au pourvoi incident, par. 31) doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 pour les m\u00eames raisons que celles expos\u00e9es ci\u2011dessus. En outre, comme je l\u2019explique ci\u2011apr\u00e8s, il existe d\u2019autres consid\u00e9rations relatives au second volet d\u2019Eldridge qui d\u00e9montrent que la Charte ne s\u2019applique pas.\n[492] Je souligne que mon analyse en application du second volet se limite \u00e0 l\u2019activit\u00e9 particuli\u00e8re en cause en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce : l\u2019adoption par la VGFN de l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence dans sa Constitution. Je n\u2019\u00e9carte pas la possibilit\u00e9 que d\u2019autres activit\u00e9s puissent satisfaire au second volet de l\u2019arr\u00eat Eldridge en raison de l\u2019existence d\u2019un lien important avec le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou celui du Yukon. Toutefois, chaque activit\u00e9 d\u2019une \u00ab entit[\u00e9] non gouvernemental[e] \u00bb (voir Eldridge, par. 41) doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9e au cas par cas, et la seule activit\u00e9 en cause en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est l\u2019adoption de l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence.\n[493] Il est \u00e9vident que la d\u00e9cision d\u2019adopter l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence est un acte autonome de gouvernance des Vuntut Gwitchin, et non une d\u00e9cision \u00ab attribuable \u00bb au gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. L\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence est une disposition de la propre Constitution de la VGFN. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e par la VGFN, \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une assembl\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale r\u00e9unissant les citoyens de la VGFN, conform\u00e9ment aux pratiques traditionnelles, bas\u00e9es sur le consensus, de s\u00e9lection des dirigeants des Vuntut Gwitchin (motifs de premi\u00e8re instance, par. 11). Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e en vue de r\u00e9gir les \u00e9lections internes du Conseil de la VGFN, qui est l\u2019une des branches du gouvernement de la VGFN cr\u00e9\u00e9es par les Vuntut Gwitchin. Il ne s\u2019agit clairement pas de la \u00ab mise en \u0153uvre d\u2019un r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gal ou d\u2019un programme gouvernemental donn\u00e9 \u00bb (Eldridge, par. 44) du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et elle ne constitue pas ce qui est exig\u00e9 en application du second volet d\u2019Eldridge. Il n\u2019y a aucune politique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale donn\u00e9e identifiable semblable \u00e0 celle dont il \u00e9tait question dans Eldridge, o\u00f9 la Cour a conclu que les h\u00f4pitaux \u00ab sont les mandataires du gouvernement pour la fourniture des services m\u00e9dicaux sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9s dans la [Hospital Insurance Act] \u00bb (par. 51). Cette conclusion \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur la loi qui r\u00e9gissait les h\u00f4pitaux et qui avait un lien clair avec le mandat du gouvernement provincial. Comme l\u2019a expliqu\u00e9 le juge La Forest, \u00ab c\u2019est au gouvernement et non aux h\u00f4pitaux qu\u2019il incombe de d\u00e9finir la teneur des services \u00e0 fournir et de d\u00e9cider qui a droit de les recevoir \u00bb (par. 49). Les h\u00f4pitaux \u00e9taient \u00ab simplement le m\u00e9canisme choisi par la l\u00e9gislature pour l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de ce programme \u00bb (par. 50). Par son adoption de l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence, la VGFN n\u2019est pas \u00ab simplement le m\u00e9canisme \u00bb permettant d\u2019exprimer un choix de politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral.\n[494] Les arguments favorables \u00e0 l\u2019application de la Charte \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence sont encore moins convaincants que dans Stoffman, o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 que la Charte ne s\u2019appliquait pas aux r\u00e8glements d\u2019un h\u00f4pital. Bien qu\u2019ils aient \u00e9t\u00e9 express\u00e9ment soumis \u00e0 l\u2019approbation du gouvernement avant leur entr\u00e9e en vigueur, les r\u00e8glements ne mettaient pas en \u0153uvre une politique gouvernementale donn\u00e9e et n\u2019\u00e9taient donc pas assujettis \u00e0 la Charte. En fait, les r\u00e8glements adopt\u00e9s par diff\u00e9rents h\u00f4pitaux variaient consid\u00e9rablement d\u2019un h\u00f4pital \u00e0 l\u2019autre, ce qui indiquait que les politiques \u00e9taient \u00ab laiss\u00e9e[s] \u00e0 l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation des responsables de la gestion de chaque h\u00f4pital \u00bb (p. 508). Non seulement il peut y avoir une vari\u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9rable de constitutions des diverses Premi\u00e8res Nations du Yukon, mais il n\u2019y a rien qui s\u2019apparente \u00e0 la surveillance constat\u00e9e dans Stoffman. Il faut s\u2019y attendre dans le cas d\u2019arrangements portant sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale de la VGFN.\n[495] Par cons\u00e9quent, les Arrangements de la VGFN n\u2019\u00e9tablissent pas un \u00ab lien [. . .] direct et [. . .] d\u00e9fini \u00bb entre l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence et le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral (Eldridge, par. 51). Comme c\u2019est le cas pour le premier volet de l\u2019arr\u00eat Eldridge, rien dans les Arrangements de la VGFN ne transforme la d\u00e9cision interne de la VGFN d\u2019adopter l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence en une activit\u00e9 attribuable \u00e0 la Couronne. L\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence refl\u00e8te la propre d\u00e9cision de la VGFN au sujet de ses propres dirigeants \u00e9lus. Selon une interpr\u00e9tation ad\u00e9quate des Arrangements de la VGFN, l\u2019adoption de l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence n\u2019est pas un acte susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre attribu\u00e9 au gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou \u00e0 celui du Yukon au sens du par. 32(1).\nC. R\u00e9sum\u00e9\n[496] Globalement, aucun des aspects des Arrangements de la VGFN ne d\u00e9montre que l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des volets du cadre d\u2019analyse de l\u2019arr\u00eat Eldridge s\u2019applique. Au contraire, ils confirment que la VGFN est distincte de la Couronne, notamment lorsqu\u2019elle adopte l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence en conformit\u00e9 avec ses propres lois, coutumes et pratiques. Appliquer la Charte en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce reviendrait \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer que la VGFN constitue un prolongement du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou de celui du Yukon, ou que l\u2019adoption par la VGFN de l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence peut \u00eatre attribu\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre de ces gouvernements. Une telle interpr\u00e9tation est incompatible non seulement avec les Arrangements de la VGFN, mais aussi avec la relation sp\u00e9ciale qui existe entre les gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et territorial et les Vuntut Gwitchin.\nV. Une application ad\u00e9quate du par. 32(1) favorise l\u2019objectif de r\u00e9conciliation\n[497] Une application fid\u00e8le de la jurisprudence de notre Cour m\u00e8ne inexorablement \u00e0 la conclusion que la VGFN et son adoption de l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence ne rel\u00e8vent pas du champ d\u2019application du par. 32(1) de la Charte. Les arguments de Mme Dickson et des intervenants sur l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 de la Charte sont en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 des arguments de politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale selon lesquels les protections de la Charte devraient s\u2019appliquer parce que la VGFN est un gouvernement qui dispose de pouvoirs importants \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ses citoyens et que l\u2019inapplicabilit\u00e9 de la Charte en vertu du par. 32(1) \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 cr\u00e9er une [traduction] \u00ab zon[e] soustrait[e] \u00e0 la Charte \u00bb (m.i. au pourvoi incident, par. 43). De tels arguments de politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ne constituent pas un fondement juridique valable permettant d\u2019imposer la Charte \u00e0 la VGFN d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui modifie effectivement le par. 32(1). De plus, le fait pour les tribunaux d\u2019imposer la Charte \u00e0 la VGFN irait \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019objectif de r\u00e9conciliation.\n[498] Tant la Charte que les diverses traditions juridiques autochtones visent la protection de la dignit\u00e9 humaine, mais la Charte repr\u00e9sente seulement une mani\u00e8re d\u2019y arriver (L. E. Trakman, \u00ab Native Cultures in a Rights Empire Ending the Dominion \u00bb (1997), 45 Buff. L. Rev. 189; M. Boldt et J. A.

La Charte pr\u00e9sente une conception de la fa\u00e7on dont la personne interagit avec l\u2019\u00c9tat, inspir\u00e9e par la philosophie lib\u00e9rale du Si\u00e8cle des Lumi\u00e8res (Van der Peet, par. 18; T. S. Axworthy, \u00ab Colliding Visions : the Debate Over the Charter of Rights and Freedoms 1980\u201181 \u00bb, dans Weiler et Elliot, Litigating the Values of a Nation (1986), 13, p. 15; Strayer, p. 219). Par cons\u00e9quent, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 propos\u00e9 que \u00ab les droits garantis par la Charte \u00e9rigent autour de chaque individu, pour parler m\u00e9taphoriquement, une barri\u00e8re invisible que l\u2019\u00c9tat ne sera pas autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 franchir \u00bb (R. c. Morgentaler, [1988] 1 R.C.S. 30, p. 164, la juge Wilson, motifs concordants).\n[499] Ces fondements philosophiques de la Charte peuvent ne pas n\u00e9cessairement correspondre \u00e0 certaines visions autochtones du monde (A. Swiffen, \u00ab Constitutional Reconciliation and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms \u00bb (2019), 24 R. \u00e9tudes const. 85, p. 110\u2011112; K. McNeil, \u00ab Aboriginal Governments and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms \u00bb (1996), 34 Osgoode Hall L.J. 61; J. Y. Henderson, First Nations Jurisprudence and Aboriginal Rights : Defining the Just Society (2006)) et \u00e0 la structure des corps dirigeants autochtones qui cherchent \u00e0 \u00ab conserver et int\u00e9grer [les structures traditionnelles] aux formes de gouvernement contemporaines \u00bb (Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale, art. 2.1). Par exemple, il peut y avoir des tensions entre l\u2019accent g\u00e9n\u00e9ral que met la Charte sur les droits n\u00e9gatifs et la pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence de certaines communaut\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une conception plus relationnelle et plus r\u00e9ciproque des [traduction] \u00ab rapports, devoirs et responsabilit\u00e9s \u00bb (Henderson, p. 126; Boldt et Long, p. 167). Certains auteurs ont soulign\u00e9 le risque de d\u00e9calage culturel entre une conception anthropocentrique de la Charte ax\u00e9e sur les titulaires de droits de la personne et une conception davantage \u00e9cocentrique ou cosmocentrique des droits et des responsabilit\u00e9s (A. Mills, \u00ab The Lifeworlds of Law : On Revitalizing Indigenous Legal Orders Today \u00bb (2016), 61 R.D. McGill 847, p. 864\u2011865; Boldt et Long, p. 166; Manley\u2011Casimir, p. 953). Enfin, selon les syst\u00e8mes sur lesquels la cr\u00e9ation des structures de gouvernance autochtone repose, les communaut\u00e9s autochtones peuvent voir diff\u00e9remment l\u2019\u00e9quilibre entre les droits individuels et les droits collectifs, et entre les personnes et l\u2019\u00c9tat (Trakman, p. 193\u2011194).\n[500] M\u00eame lorsque les syst\u00e8mes de valeurs et les traditions juridiques de communaut\u00e9s autochtones pr\u00e9cises m\u00e8nent au m\u00eame r\u00e9sultat que celui auquel conduit la Charte, leur mode de raisonnement peut diff\u00e9rer. Par exemple, les r\u00e9cits, les coutumes, les engagements, les c\u00e9r\u00e9monies et les cercles de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration autochtones peuvent \u00eatre de solides sources du droit autochtone, y compris en ce qui concerne les limites du pouvoir gouvernemental (voir, p. ex., In re : Certified Questions II, 6 Nav. R. 105 (1989); Henderson, p. 127 et 163\u2011177). Ils peuvent constituer le fondement permettant aux communaut\u00e9s autochtones de codifier une charte des droits qui est adapt\u00e9e \u00e0 leur culture, \u00e0 leurs traditions et \u00e0 leur vision des choses. Plut\u00f4t que de recourir \u00e0 une [traduction] \u00ab forme monolithique d\u2019analyse des droits \u00bb, les communaut\u00e9s autochtones peuvent \u00e9laborer des mesures de protection des droits de la personne qui int\u00e8grent leurs formes particuli\u00e8res et distinctes de droit autochtone (H. P. Glenn, Legal Traditions of the World : Sustainable Diversity in Law (5e \u00e9d. 2014), p. 92). Ces autres sources de droits et de responsabilit\u00e9s peuvent [traduction] \u00ab servir aussi efficacement l\u2019objectif de la dignit\u00e9 humaine qu\u2019un code occidental des droits de la personne \u00bb (p. 93). En revanche, l\u2019imposition de la Charte par les tribunaux risque de permettre aux parties de [traduction] \u00ab remettre en question, sur le plan constitutionnel, la riche complexit\u00e9 des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s autochtones selon une grille d\u2019analyse rigide du droit individuel et de l\u2019obligation \u00e9tatique \u00bb (P. Macklem, Indigenous Difference and the Constitution of Canada (2001), p. 195).\n[501] Bien entendu, l\u2019analyse qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de ne signifie pas que les protections pr\u00e9vues par la Charte vont intrins\u00e8quement \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des souhaits des communaut\u00e9s autochtones, y compris la VGFN. Les syst\u00e8mes de valeurs et les traditions juridiques autochtones ne devraient pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant monolithiques, et il ne faudrait pas pr\u00e9sumer que les droits individuels sont n\u00e9cessairement en opposition avec la gouvernance autochtone collective (Metallic, p. 15). De plus, les communaut\u00e9s autochtones ne sont pas immuables : l\u2019interaction avec d\u2019autres soci\u00e9t\u00e9s au fil des si\u00e8cles et l\u2019adoption de diff\u00e9rents syst\u00e8mes de gouvernance par voie de trait\u00e9 peuvent accro\u00eetre la commensurabilit\u00e9 des protections accord\u00e9es par la Charte (G. Otis, \u00ab La gouvernance autochtone avec ou sans la Charte Canadienne? \u00bb (2005), 36 R.D. Ottawa 207). La Charte demeure une r\u00e9alisation exceptionnelle, ce qui explique pourquoi divers groupes autochtones, en particulier des groupes de femmes, adh\u00e8rent \u00e0 son contenu (voir, p. ex., Swiffen, p. 110\u2011112; Metallic, p. 6).\n[502] Il est clair cependant que la Charte ne devrait pas \u00eatre impos\u00e9e aux communaut\u00e9s autochtones. Comme l\u2019a soulign\u00e9 le professeur McNeil, [traduction] \u00ab [i]mposer aujourd\u2019hui unilat\u00e9ralement la Charte \u00e0 leurs gouvernements au moyen d\u2019une interpr\u00e9tation discutable du par. 32(1) aurait pour effet de revenir \u00e0 une \u00e9poque o\u00f9 les peuples autochtones n\u2019avaient souvent pas la possibilit\u00e9 de participer \u00e0 la prise de d\u00e9cisions importantes concernant leurs droits constitutionnels \u00bb (p. 70\u201171). Il n\u2019appartient pas \u00e0 notre Cour d\u2019examiner minutieusement la sagesse ou l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 des choix de la VGFN en transposant un instrument con\u00e7u par et pour les gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux aux Vuntut Gwitchin, lesquels n\u2019ont pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 sa cr\u00e9ation ni souscrit \u00e0 ses modalit\u00e9s. Cela reviendrait \u00e0 soumettre les Vuntut Gwitchin au genre de surveillance f\u00e9d\u00e9rale auquel ils ont cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 se soustraire au moyen des Arrangements de la VGFN.\n[503] Certains auteurs affirment que l\u2019art. 25 peut servir de moyen souple de rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 ces probl\u00e8mes sans sacrifier la protection de la Charte (voir, p. ex., P. W. Hogg et M. E. Turpel, \u00ab La mise en \u0153uvre de l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale des peuples autochtones : aspects constitutionnels et questions de comp\u00e9tence \u00bb, dans Commission royale sur les peuples autochtones, L\u2019autonomie gouvernementale des autochtones : Questions juridiques et constitutionnelles (1995), 427; Otis). Cette th\u00e8se peut pr\u00e9senter un attrait superficiel, mais elle ne r\u00e9siste pas \u00e0 un examen plus pouss\u00e9. Premi\u00e8rement, que l\u2019art. 25 soit utilis\u00e9 comme un bouclier ou comme un prisme interpr\u00e9tatif, la VGFN est toujours [traduction] \u00ab susceptible de voir son r\u00e9gime juridique examin\u00e9 \u00e0 fond au moyen de normes qui lui sont \u00e9trang\u00e8res \u00bb (Metallic, p. 8). Par exemple, selon l\u2019approche propos\u00e9e par le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, les tribunaux seraient charg\u00e9s de se demander si un droit garanti par la Charte entre en jeu \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, s\u2019il existe un [traduction] \u00ab v\u00e9ritable conflit \u00bb entre le droit prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par la Charte et le droit ancestral et, dans l\u2019affirmative, si l\u2019exercice du droit concern\u00e9 est n\u00e9cessaire \u00ab pour assurer le maintien de la culture distinctive du groupe autochtone \u00bb (m. interv., par. 27). Il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019une d\u00e9marche hautement intrusive, qui oblige la VGFN \u00e0 justifier l\u2019exercice de ses pouvoirs en se r\u00e9f\u00e9rant \u00e0 des normes qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas elle\u2011m\u00eame choisies.\n[504] Deuxi\u00e8mement, il se peut que de nombreuses demandes ne soient pas du tout prot\u00e9g\u00e9es par l\u2019art. 25. Selon l\u2019approche pr\u00e9conis\u00e9e par le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, l\u2019art. 25 serait r\u00e9serv\u00e9 aux droits ancestraux et aux droits issus de trait\u00e9s, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 d\u2019autres droits \u00ab de nature constitutionnelle \u00bb (m. interv., par. 44, citant R. c. Kapp, 2008 CSC 41, [2008] 2 R.C.S. 483, par. 63). De plus, il incomberait aux gouvernements autochtones de d\u00e9montrer l\u2019existence d\u2019un tel droit ou d\u2019une telle libert\u00e9. Des d\u00e9cennies de litiges fond\u00e9s sur le par. 35(1) ont montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un processus long et exigeant en mati\u00e8re de preuve. Comme l\u2019a soulign\u00e9 la juge en chef McLachlin dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Nation ha\u00efda c. Colombie\u2011Britannique (Ministre des For\u00eats), 2004 CSC 73, [2004] 3 R.C.S. 511, \u00ab prouver l\u2019existence de droits peut prendre du temps, parfois m\u00eame beaucoup de temps \u00bb (par. 26). En fin de compte, l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 25 obligerait les gouvernements autochtones \u00e0 consacrer des ressources consid\u00e9rables pour prot\u00e9ger leurs lois de l\u2019examen au regard d\u2019un instrument qui leur a \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9.\n[505] Quant aux arguments de politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale selon lesquels l\u2019inapplicabilit\u00e9 de la Charte au titre du par. 32(1) aurait pour effet de cr\u00e9er une \u00ab zone soustraite \u00e0 la Charte \u00bb, ils font fi des approches autochtones visant \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger leurs membres. En fait, ils reposent sur l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se erron\u00e9e selon laquelle, si la Charte n\u2019est pas impos\u00e9e, les membres des communaut\u00e9s autochtones ne jouiront d\u2019aucune protection.\n[506] Les communaut\u00e9s autochtones peuvent adopter des mesures de protection pour r\u00e9gir l\u2019interaction entre les membres et leur gouvernement, et elles l\u2019ont fait. On a donn\u00e9 effet \u00e0 un certain nombre d\u2019approches connexes partout au Canada. Une communaut\u00e9 autochtone peut choisir, de sa propre initiative, de mettre en \u0153uvre un instrument qui renferme des protections pour ses membres (comme l\u2019ont fait les gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux en adoptant la Charte). De mani\u00e8re subsidiaire, elle peut s\u2019engager par entente ou par trait\u00e9 \u2014 y compris au moyen d\u2019ententes sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale \u2014 \u00e0 adopter un tel instrument. Cependant, dans un cas comme dans l\u2019autre, la communaut\u00e9 autochtone joue un r\u00f4le actif lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9cider comment elle souhaite \u00e9laborer un tel instrument. Elle peut donc adopter \u2014 ou consentir \u00e0 adopter \u2014 ses propres mesures de protection prenant leur source dans ses traditions juridiques, elle peut adopter un instrument qui s\u2019inspire de la Charte, ou elle peut m\u00eame consentir \u00e0 l\u2019application des protections conf\u00e9r\u00e9es par la Charte. Cela peut \u00e9galement faire l\u2019objet de discussions entre les parties lors de la n\u00e9gociation d\u2019ententes sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale. Je note au passage que, depuis 1995, la politique de n\u00e9gociation du Canada a consist\u00e9 \u00e0 chercher \u00e0 ins\u00e9rer une disposition acceptant l\u2019application de la Charte dans les ententes sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale (voir, p. ex., l\u2019Accord d\u00e9finitif Nisga\u2019a (1999) et l\u2019Accord d\u00e9finitif des Tla\u2019amins (2014)). De nombreuses questions se posent quant \u00e0 l\u2019effet d\u2019une telle disposition (p. ex. : Pr\u00e9voit\u2011elle l\u2019application de la Charte elle\u2011m\u00eame, ou pr\u00e9voit\u2011elle plut\u00f4t l\u2019incorporation des protections qu\u2019elle conf\u00e8re? Comment assure\u2011t\u2011on le respect de ces droits et quels organismes juridictionnels en sont charg\u00e9s? Que se passe\u2011t\u2011il si la Charte est modifi\u00e9e conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la formule de modification convenue entre les gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux?). Il n\u2019est toutefois pas possible de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ces questions en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[507] Ce qui est crucial, et ce dont les arguments de Mme Dickson et de certains intervenants ne tiennent pas compte, c\u2019est que les solutions susmentionn\u00e9es sont le r\u00e9sultat d\u2019un choix des Autochtones. Les communaut\u00e9s autochtones peuvent choisir comment mettre en \u0153uvre des protections efficaces \u2014 que ce soit de leur propre initiative ou d\u2019un commun accord avec les autorit\u00e9s f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, provinciales et territoriales \u2014 plut\u00f4t que d\u2019\u00eatre assujetties \u00e0 la Charte au moyen d\u2019une fausse interpr\u00e9tation du par. 32(1). Comme je l\u2019ai expliqu\u00e9, prendre la r\u00e9conciliation au s\u00e9rieux signifie respecter la capacit\u00e9 des peuples autochtones \u00ab de se d\u00e9finir et de choisir par quels moyens prendre leurs d\u00e9cisions, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 leurs propres lois, coutumes et pratiques \u00bb (Desautel, par. 86).\nVI. La VGFN a accept\u00e9 d\u2019adopter ses propres mesures de protection des droits, plut\u00f4t que d\u2019appliquer les protections conf\u00e9r\u00e9es par la Charte\n[508] J\u2019en viens maintenant au dernier argument invoqu\u00e9 en faveur de l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 de la Charte \u00e0 la VGFN et \u00e0 l\u2019adoption par celle\u2011ci de l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence. Madame Dickson soutient que, m\u00eame si la Charte ne s\u2019applique pas en vertu du par. 32(1), la VGFN a express\u00e9ment consenti \u00e0 ce que les protections conf\u00e9r\u00e9es par la Charte soient applicables \u00e0 sa Constitution et \u00e0 ses lois. Cet argument est sans fondement. La VGFN n\u2019a pas souscrit \u00e0 l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 de la Charte; au contraire, elle a accept\u00e9 d\u2019adopter son propre instrument de protection des droits qui est semblable \u00e0 la Charte, mais qui est tout de m\u00eame distinct de celle\u2011ci.\nA. Les Arrangements de la VGFN ne contiennent pas un accord sur l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 de la Charte\n[509] Ni l\u2019Entente d\u00e9finitive ni l\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale ne mentionnent la Charte. Madame Dickson invoque n\u00e9anmoins un certain nombre de leurs dispositions pour affirmer que la VGFN a accept\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab clairement et sans \u00e9quivoque \u00bb d\u2019assujettir sa Constitution et ses lois \u00e0 la Charte (m.i. au pourvoi incident, intertitre pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant le par. 24).\n[510] Premi\u00e8rement, Mme Dickson invoque l\u2019art. 24.1.2 de l\u2019Entente d\u00e9finitive, qui pr\u00e9voit ce qui suit :\n24.1.2 Sous r\u00e9serve de la n\u00e9gociation d\u2019une entente vis\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019article 24.1.1 et conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la Constitution du Canada, chaque premi\u00e8re nation du Yukon a notamment les pouvoirs suivants : . . . [Je souligne.]\nMadame Dickson fait remarquer que la Charte fait \u00e9videmment partie de la Constitution du Canada \u2014 elle constitue, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, la partie I de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982. Selon elle, il s\u2019ensuit que les \u00ab pouvoirs \u00bb de \u00ab chaque premi\u00e8re nation du Yukon \u00bb exerc\u00e9s au titre de l\u2019art. 24.1.2 doivent \u00eatre conformes \u00e0 la Charte. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance et la Cour d\u2019appel se sont appuy\u00e9s sur l\u2019art. 24.1.2 pour conclure que la Charte s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence (voir, p. ex., les motifs de premi\u00e8re instance, par. 47 et 110\u2011111; motifs de la C.A., par. 97).\n[511] Cet argument fait partie de bon nombre des m\u00eames conceptions erron\u00e9es de l\u2019architecture de la Constitution que celles que nous avons examin\u00e9es ci\u2011dessus. Il est tout \u00e0 fait \u00ab conform[e] \u00e0 la Constitution du Canada \u00bb de respecter le libell\u00e9 clair du par. 32(1), son historique et la place qu\u2019il occupe dans la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982, ainsi que la jurisprudence constante de notre Cour sur l\u2019objet et la port\u00e9e de cette disposition. Comme je l\u2019ai expliqu\u00e9, il ne serait pas conforme \u00e0 la Constitution du Canada d\u2019\u00e9tendre l\u2019application de la Charte \u00e0 la VGFN. L\u2019article 24.1.2 de l\u2019Entente d\u00e9finitive ne peut vraisemblablement pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme supplantant ou modifiant une interpr\u00e9tation ad\u00e9quate du par. 32(1), qui est elle\u2011m\u00eame une disposition de la Constitution du Canada.\n[512] La Constitution du Canada ne se r\u00e9sume pas \u00e0 la Charte. Interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 ad\u00e9quatement, l\u2019art. 24.1.2 reconna\u00eet que la mise en \u0153uvre de l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale de la VGFN a \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9goci\u00e9e avec les gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et territorial dans le cadre de l\u2019architecture constitutionnelle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada. Ces structures comprennent le partage des comp\u00e9tences pr\u00e9vu par les art. 91 et 92 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867, ainsi que l\u2019art. 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982. De telles restrictions constitutionnelles sont pertinentes, par exemple, en ce qui a trait au processus de n\u00e9gociation de l\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale. En effet, l\u2019art. 24.1.2 doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de l\u2019art. 24.1.1, qu\u2019il suit imm\u00e9diatement et auquel il renvoie express\u00e9ment :\n24.1.1 Le gouvernement est tenu d\u2019entamer, avec chaque premi\u00e8re nation du Yukon qui en fait la demande, des n\u00e9gociations en vue de conclure des ententes en mati\u00e8re d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale adapt\u00e9es \u00e0 la situation de la premi\u00e8re nation du Yukon touch\u00e9e.\nSitu\u00e9 dans son contexte appropri\u00e9, l\u2019art. 24.1.2 confirme que le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral n\u2019aurait pas pu n\u00e9gocier l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale sur des mati\u00e8res relevant de la comp\u00e9tence exclusive des provinces ou des territoires en vertu de l\u2019art. 92 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867, et vice versa. Le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou le gouvernement territorial n\u2019aurait pas non plus pu n\u00e9gocier d\u2019une mani\u00e8re contraire aux droits ancestraux ou issus de trait\u00e9s reconnus et confirm\u00e9s par le par. 35(1) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982. Je souligne que la VGFN soutient que l\u2019art. 24.1.2 se limite aux restrictions constitutionnelles auquel le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et le gouvernement territorial sont assujettis dans le processus de n\u00e9gociation et n\u2019est pas une condition de l\u2019exercice des pouvoirs de gouvernance de la VGFN (m.i., par. 66\u201169). \u00c0 mon avis, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce de commenter ainsi l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019art. 24.1.2. Il suffit de mentionner que le respect de la Constitution du Canada par tout signataire impliqu\u00e9 ne supplante pas une r\u00e9ponse fid\u00e8le donn\u00e9e par la jurisprudence \u00e0 la question plus \u00e9troite de l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 de la Charte \u00e0 la VGFN.\n[513] Deuxi\u00e8mement, Mme Dickson invoque l\u2019art. 24.1.3.1 de l\u2019Entente d\u00e9finitive, qui dispose :\n24.1.3 Les ententes en mati\u00e8re d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale n\u2019ont pas pour effet de porter atteinte :\n24.1.3.1 aux droits des Indiens du Yukon en tant que citoyens canadiens;\nCette disposition est muette sur l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 de la Charte \u00e0 la VGFN. Les citoyens de la VGFN sont \u00e0 la fois membres d\u2019une communaut\u00e9 autochtone et citoyens du Canada (D. Panagos, Uncertain Accommodation : Aboriginal Identity and Group Rights in the Supreme Court of Canada (2016)). En tant que citoyens du Canada, ils jouissent des m\u00eames droits et libert\u00e9s que les autres Canadiens et Canadiennes pour ce qui est des lois et des actions des gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux. Les gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux demeurent tenus \u00e0 ces responsabilit\u00e9s envers les citoyens de la VGFN. Toutefois, rien dans l\u2019art. 24.1.3.1 ne tend \u00e0 indiquer que la VGFN a souscrit \u00e0 l\u2019application des protections de la Charte au\u2011del\u00e0 de la port\u00e9e pr\u00e9vue au par. 32(1). L\u2019article 24.1.3.1 de l\u2019Entente d\u00e9finitive n\u2019est donc d\u2019aucune utilit\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Dickson.\n[514] Enfin, Mme Dickson invoque l\u2019art. 13.5.1 de l\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale, qui dispose :\n13.5.1 Sauf disposition contraire pr\u00e9vue par la pr\u00e9sente entente, toutes les lois d\u2019application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale continuent \u00e0 s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re nation des Gwitchin Vuntut, \u00e0 ses citoyens et aux terres vis\u00e9es par le r\u00e8glement.\nL\u2019expression \u00ab lois d\u2019application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00bb a un sens bien d\u00e9fini dans le contexte de l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 de lois provinciales aux peuples autochtones en vertu de l\u2019art. 88 de la Loi sur les Indiens. Elle s\u2019entend des lois ordinaires qui ont une port\u00e9e uniforme sur tout le territoire, et dont l\u2019objet et l\u2019intention ne sont pas relatifs \u00e0 un groupe de citoyens (Kruger c. La Reine, [1978] 1 R.C.S. 104, p. 110). Cette expression, telle qu\u2019elle est employ\u00e9e dans l\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale, ne peut pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme d\u00e9signant des parties de la Constitution du Canada, qui impose elle\u2011m\u00eame des limites \u00e0 la port\u00e9e des lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales et provinciales, y compris les lois d\u2019application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n[515] Interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme il se doit, l\u2019art. 13.5.1 confirme que les lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales et territoriales ordinaires qui ont une port\u00e9e uniforme sur l\u2019ensemble du Canada ou du Yukon continuent \u00e0 s\u2019appliquer aux citoyens de la VGFN. Je fais aussi remarquer que les art. 13.5.2 et 13.5.3 de l\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale pr\u00e9voient des m\u00e9canismes permettant \u00e0 la VGFN de remplacer des lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales et territoriales d\u2019application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale par des lois de la VGFN. Si la Charte s\u2019appliquait effectivement en tant que \u00ab lo[i] d\u2019application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00bb, il serait contraire au principe de la supr\u00e9matie de la Constitution de subordonner la Charte \u00e0 une forme de primaut\u00e9 de la VGFN. Telle ne peut avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019intention des signataires lorsqu\u2019ils ont souscrit \u00e0 l\u2019art. 13.5.1. Cette disposition visait plut\u00f4t clairement \u00e0 faciliter une transition harmonieuse vers l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale de la VGFN sans laisser de lacunes dans les structures r\u00e9glementaires existantes.\n[516] En somme, aucune des dispositions de l\u2019Entente d\u00e9finitive ou de l\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale ne tend \u00e0 indiquer \u2014 et encore moins ne pr\u00e9voit \u00ab clairement et sans \u00e9quivoque \u00bb \u2014 que la VGFN a souscrit \u00e0 l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 de la Charte. Cependant, comme je l\u2019explique ci\u2011dessous, cela ne signifie pas que la VGFN ne tient pas compte des droits ou libert\u00e9s fondamentaux, ou que le Canada et le Yukon n\u2019ont pas cherch\u00e9, lors des n\u00e9gociations, \u00e0 garantir certaines mesures de protection des droits.\nB. La VGFN a adopt\u00e9 ses propres mesures de protection des droits\n[517] Les signataires de l\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale ont convenu de la disposition suivante concernant la Constitution de la VGFN :\n10.1 La Constitution de la premi\u00e8re nation des Gwitchin Vuntut :\n. . .\n10.1.4 reconna\u00eet et prot\u00e8ge les droits et libert\u00e9s des citoyens;\nDe plus, l\u2019art. 10.1.6 pr\u00e9voit que la Constitution de la VGFN \u00ab conf\u00e8re aux citoyens \u00bb \u2014 c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire les citoyens de la VGFN \u2014 \u00ab le pouvoir de modifier la Constitution \u00bb. Tout comme les gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux ont le pouvoir de modifier la Constitution du Canada depuis le rapatriement de 1982, la VGFN peut, en vertu l\u2019art. 10.1.6, modifier sa propre Constitution, y compris l\u2019instrument vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019art. 10.1.4 qui reconna\u00eet et prot\u00e8ge les droits et libert\u00e9s des citoyens.\n[518] L\u2019inclusion de l\u2019art. 10.1.4 dans l\u2019Entente sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale confirme la m\u00e9thode sur laquelle les signataires se sont entendus pour prot\u00e9ger les droits et libert\u00e9s des citoyens de la VGFN d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui soit compatible avec les lois, coutumes et pratiques des Vuntut Gwitchin. Cette disposition ne fait aucune mention de la Charte. Les signataires ont plut\u00f4t pr\u00e9vu de fa\u00e7on plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale la reconnaissance et la protection des droits et libert\u00e9s des citoyens, sans exiger l\u2019adoption des droits et libert\u00e9s pr\u00e9cis \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la Charte, et tout en permettant \u00e0 la VGFN de modifier ces protections au moyen de ses propres structures de gouvernance.\n[519] La VGFN a tenu ses engagements en adoptant l\u2019article IV de sa Constitution sur les [traduction] \u00ab Droits des citoyens \u00bb. L\u2019article IV s\u2019inspire de toute \u00e9vidence en grande partie de la Charte, et bon nombre des droits qu\u2019il \u00e9num\u00e8re ont un libell\u00e9 presque identique \u00e0 celui des droits pr\u00e9vus par la Charte. Malgr\u00e9 ces similitudes, l\u2019article IV de la Constitution de la VGFN est sp\u00e9cialement adapt\u00e9 aux traditions, valeurs et priorit\u00e9s qui sont propres \u00e0 la VGFN. Par exemple, la VGFN a choisi de reconna\u00eetre le gwich\u2019in comme langue officielle et de prot\u00e9ger son usage (articles IV(15) \u00e0 (18)). De plus, la VGFN a consacr\u00e9 un droit d\u2019acc\u00e8s aux renseignements personnels qui sont en la possession ou sous le contr\u00f4le du gouvernement de la VGFN (article IV(20)(a)) \u2014 un droit qui n\u2019a pas d\u2019\u00e9quivalent dans la Charte. Point crucial pour les besoins de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, le droit d\u2019occuper un poste au sein du gouvernement des Vuntut Gwitchin est express\u00e9ment reconnu [traduction] \u00ab[s]ous r\u00e9serve de l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence et d\u2019autres obligations pr\u00e9vues par le droit des Vuntut Gwitchin \u00bb (article IV(4)). L\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence elle\u2011m\u00eame fait partie de la Constitution de la VGFN au titre de l\u2019article XI(2) et a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9e \u00e0 la suite de modifications constitutionnelles apport\u00e9es en 2006. La VGFN a donc constitutionnalis\u00e9 sa conception de l\u2019importance du fait pour ses dirigeants de r\u00e9sider sur les terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ses propres priorit\u00e9s et \u00e0 ses propres valeurs en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la direction de la communaut\u00e9.\n[520] L\u2019article IV de la Constitution de la VGFN illustre comment une communaut\u00e9 autochtone peut adopter des mesures de protection des droits et libert\u00e9s fondamentaux qui correspondent \u00e0 ses propres lois, coutumes et pratiques. Contrairement \u00e0 ce que Mme Dickson et divers intervenants avancent, il n\u2019est pas vrai que la VGFN ne respecte pas les droits individuels ou que les citoyens de la VGFN sont priv\u00e9s de droits fondamentaux et vivent dans une zone sans droits. La VGFN a constitutionnellement consacr\u00e9 des droits et libert\u00e9s \u2014 dont bon nombre correspondent \u00e0 ceux \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la Charte \u2014 ainsi que des m\u00e9canismes permettant \u00e0 ses citoyens de contester ses lois.\n[521] D\u2019ailleurs, dans sa propre requ\u00eate, Mme Dickson a fait valoir subsidiairement que l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence \u00e9tait invalide en application de la Constitution de la VGFN. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a mentionn\u00e9 bri\u00e8vement cette pr\u00e9tention fond\u00e9e sur la Constitution de la VGFN, mais les juridictions inf\u00e9rieures n\u2019ont pas tranch\u00e9 la pr\u00e9tention sur le fond, pr\u00e9f\u00e9rant juger l\u2019affaire en application de la Charte. La VGFN soutient qu\u2019il convient de se prononcer sur la pr\u00e9tention de Mme Dickson au regard de la Constitution de la VGFN plut\u00f4t qu\u2019au regard de la Charte. Je suis d\u2019accord. Madame Dickson cherche \u00e0 contester une r\u00e8gle interne de la VGFN afin de participer \u00e0 sa gouvernance; sa demande doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9e en fonction des droits consacr\u00e9s dans la Constitution de la VGFN, conform\u00e9ment aux structures et processus de gouvernance propres \u00e0 la VGFN.\nVII. Conclusion\n[522] La VGFN r\u00e9git les affaires des Vuntut Gwitchin conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ses propres structures et processus de gouvernance. Cela r\u00e9pond \u00e0 l\u2019objectif d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale consacr\u00e9 par les Arrangements de la VGFN : redonner aux Vuntut Gwitchin une place o\u00f9 ils peuvent prendre et mettre en \u0153uvre des d\u00e9cisions conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 leurs propres lois, coutumes et pratiques. Eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 l\u2019architecture de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982, \u00e0 la relation entre les peuples autochtones et les gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux et \u00e0 la jurisprudence de notre Cour, j\u2019estime qu\u2019il appartient \u00e9galement \u00e0 la VGFN de prendre toute d\u00e9cision sur la mani\u00e8re de mettre en \u0153uvre des mesures de protection des droits et libert\u00e9s fondamentaux de ses citoyens. Cela ne diminue aucunement les droits et libert\u00e9s dont les citoyens de la VGFN jouissent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux, en vertu de la Charte, en tant que citoyens canadiens. Donner effet \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale des Vuntut Gwitchin est un \u00e9l\u00e9ment crucial de la promesse de r\u00e9conciliation. Cela implique n\u00e9cessairement le droit des Vuntut Gwitchin de d\u00e9cider eux\u2011m\u00eames de ce qui est juste et \u00e9quitable conform\u00e9ment aux droits et libert\u00e9s qu\u2019ils choisissent de consacrer dans leur propre Constitution.\n[523] Je suis d\u2019avis de rejeter le pourvoi de Mme Dickson et d\u2019accueillir le pourvoi incident de la VGFN au motif que la Charte ne s\u2019applique pas \u00e0 l\u2019adoption par la VGFN de l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence, et d\u2019annuler les ordonnances des juridictions inf\u00e9rieures.\nPourvoi et pourvoi incident rejet\u00e9s, le juge Rowe est dissident quant au pourvoi incident et les juges Martin et O\u2019Bonsawin sont dissidentes quant au pourvoi.\nProcureurs de l\u2019appelante\/intim\u00e9e au pourvoi incident : Fasken Martineau DuMoulin, Vancouver; Ruby Shiller Enenajor DiGiuseppe, Toronto.\nProcureurs de l\u2019intim\u00e9e\/appelante au pourvoi incident : Mandell Pinder, Vancouver.\nProcureur de l\u2019intervenant le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada : Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, minist\u00e8re de la Justice Canada \u2014 Secteur national du contentieux, Ottawa.\nProcureur de l\u2019intervenant le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Qu\u00e9bec : Minist\u00e8re de la Justice du Qu\u00e9bec \u2014 Direction du droit constitutionnel et autochtone, Qu\u00e9bec.\nProcureur de l\u2019intervenant le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l\u2019Alberta : Alberta Justice \u2014 Constitutional and Aboriginal Law, Edmonton.\nProcureur de l\u2019intervenant le gouvernement du Yukon : Department of Justice, Legal Services Branch, Whitehorse.\nProcureurs de l\u2019intervenante British Columbia Treaty Commission : Blake, Cassels & Graydon, Vancouver.\nProcureurs des intervenantes la Nation m\u00e9tisse de l\u2019Ontario et M\u00e9tis Nation of Alberta : Pape Salter Teillet, Toronto.\nProcureurs de l\u2019intervenante Carcross\/Tagish First Nation : Woodward & Company Lawyers, Whitehorse.\nProcureurs de l\u2019intervenant Teslin Tlingit Council : Ratcliff, North Vancouver.\nProcureurs de l\u2019intervenant le Congr\u00e8s des peuples autochtones : Paliare Roland Rosenberg Rothstein, Toronto.\nProcureurs de l\u2019intervenant Council of Yukon First Nations : Boughton Law Corporation, Vancouver.\nProcureur de l\u2019intervenant le Forum pancanadien sur les droits autochtones et la Constitution : Universit\u00e9 de Moncton, Moncton.\nProcureurs de l\u2019intervenante Canadian Constitution Foundation : McCarthy T\u00e9trault, Toronto.\nProcureurs de l\u2019intervenante Band Members Alliance and Advocacy Association of Canada : MacKenzie Fujisawa, Vancouver.\nProcureur de l\u2019intervenante Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations : Bruce J.

Au m\u00eame moment, les parties ont conclu un contrat de compensation par lequel l\u2019entreprise canadienne a convenu de sous\u2011traiter une partie des travaux li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019approvisionnement des a\u00e9ronefs \u00e0 des entreprises grecques. Le contrat de compensation pr\u00e9voyait que l\u2019entreprise canadienne serait redevable de dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats liquid\u00e9s au MDG si elle ne s\u2019acquittait pas de ses obligations en mati\u00e8re de sous\u2011traitance. Le paiement de ces dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats liquid\u00e9s \u00e9tait garanti par une lettre de cr\u00e9dit \u00e9mise par une banque grecque en faveur du MDG (\u00ab lettre de garantie grecque \u00bb). Une seconde lettre de cr\u00e9dit a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mise par une banque canadienne en faveur de la banque grecque afin de garantir le paiement des sommes que cette derni\u00e8re serait tenue de payer au MDG au titre de la lettre de garantie grecque dans le cas o\u00f9 le MDG affirmait que l\u2019entreprise canadienne ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas acquitt\u00e9e de ses obligations au titre du contrat de compensation (\u00ab lettre de contre\u2011garantie canadienne \u00bb). Tout diff\u00e9rend d\u00e9coulant du contrat de compensation serait tranch\u00e9 par un tribunal arbitral suivant les r\u00e8gles de la Chambre de commerce internationale (\u00ab CCI \u00bb).\nLorsque l\u2019entreprise canadienne a constat\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne serait pas en mesure de s\u2019acquitter des obligations en mati\u00e8re de sous\u2011traitance lui incombant en vertu du contrat de compensation, un tribunal arbitral de la CCI a \u00e9t\u00e9 constitu\u00e9 et a tenu des audiences. Le MDG s\u2019est formellement engag\u00e9 \u00e0 ne pas exiger de paiement au titre de la lettre de garantie grecque tant et aussi longtemps que la proc\u00e9dure d\u2019arbitrage serait en cours. Cependant, alors que la sentence arbitrale finale n\u2019avait pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue, le MDG a demand\u00e9 le paiement \u00e0 la banque grecque \u00e0 plusieurs reprises. L\u2019entreprise canadienne a sollicit\u00e9 et obtenu une ordonnance du tribunal arbitral de la CCI emp\u00eachant le MDG de demander le paiement en vertu de la lettre de garantie grecque jusqu\u2019au prononc\u00e9 de la sentence finale. Elle a aussi sollicit\u00e9 et obtenu des injonctions provisoires de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure du Qu\u00e9bec afin d\u2019emp\u00eacher tout paiement en vertu de la lettre de garantie grecque et de la lettre de contre-garantie canadienne. Malgr\u00e9 cela, le MDG a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une ultime demande de paiement sept jours avant le jour o\u00f9 la sentence arbitrale finale devait \u00eatre rendue, affirmant que la banque grecque s\u2019exposerait \u00e0 des poursuites civiles et criminelles si elle refusait de payer. La banque grecque a pay\u00e9 le MDG au titre de la lettre de garantie grecque, et la banque grecque a alors demand\u00e9 le paiement \u00e0 la banque canadienne au titre de la lettre de contre-garantie canadienne.\nLe tribunal arbitral de la CCI a conclu dans sa sentence finale que le contrat de compensation \u00e9tait contraire au droit de l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne, de sorte qu\u2019il \u00e9tait nul et sans effet ab initio et que la banque canadienne ne devait aucuns dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats liquid\u00e9s au MDG. En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la sentence arbitrale finale, la banque grecque a intent\u00e9 des recours devant les tribunaux grecs, o\u00f9 elle a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 recouvrer les sommes qu\u2019elle avait vers\u00e9es au MDG, sans succ\u00e8s. Les tribunaux grecs ont \u00e9tabli que la conduite du MDG en ce qui concerne la lettre de garantie grecque n\u2019\u00e9tait pas frauduleuse en droit grec. Dans des recours parall\u00e8les devant les tribunaux qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, l\u2019entreprise canadienne a sollicit\u00e9 une injonction permanente interdisant \u00e0 la banque canadienne de payer la banque grecque au titre de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie canadienne. Elle a fait valoir que l\u2019exception de fraude opposable \u00e0 l\u2019obligation quasi absolue qui incombe aux banques \u00e9mettrices d\u2019honorer les demandes de paiement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es au titre des lettres de cr\u00e9dit s\u2019applique \u00e0 la banque grecque en tant que b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie canadienne. Puisque la conduite du MDG \u00e9tait frauduleuse, la demande de paiement de la banque grecque au titre de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie canadienne \u00e9tait, par extension, \u00e9galement frauduleuse. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a conclu que la mani\u00e8re dont le MDG avait obtenu le paiement au titre de la lettre de garantie grecque \u00e9tait frauduleuse, et que la conduite de la banque grecque avait elle\u2011m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 frauduleuse puisque son paiement au MDG r\u00e9sultait d\u2019une fraude dont elle avait connaissance. Il a donc interdit \u00e0 la banque canadienne de payer toute somme \u00e0 la banque grecque au titre de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie canadienne. La banque grecque a interjet\u00e9 appel. La Cour d\u2019appel a rejet\u00e9 son appel, concluant que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance pouvait conclure que la banque canadienne n\u2019\u00e9tait pas tenue de payer la banque grecque \u00e0 titre de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie canadienne, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la banque grecque avait une connaissance suffisante de la fraude avant de proc\u00e9der au paiement au titre de la lettre de garantie grecque.\nArr\u00eat (les juges Karakatsanis et C\u00f4t\u00e9 sont dissidentes) : Le pourvoi est rejet\u00e9.\nLe juge en chef Wagner et les juges Rowe, Martin, Kasirer, Jamal, O\u2019Bonsawin et Moreau : L\u2019exception de fraude s\u2019applique \u00e0 la demande de paiement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la banque grecque au titre de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie canadienne. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que la banque grecque, en tant que b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie canadienne, \u00e9tait au courant de la fraude commise par le MDG et y a particip\u00e9, cette fraude peut lui \u00eatre imput\u00e9e comme s\u2019il s\u2019agissait de la sienne. L\u2019exigence qu\u2019il y ait une fraude de la part du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire est donc remplie. En outre, il ne fait aucun doute que la fraude de la banque grecque a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019attention de la banque canadienne en tant qu\u2019\u00e9mettrice de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie canadienne. C\u2019est donc \u00e0 juste titre que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a interdit \u00e0 la banque canadienne de verser \u00e0 la banque grecque toute somme en vertu de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie canadienne et les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel n\u2019ont pas commis d\u2019erreur en confirmant cette conclusion.\nUne lettre de cr\u00e9dit est un instrument consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant autonome par rapport au contrat sous\u2011jacent auquel il se rattache, qu\u2019une institution financi\u00e8re \u00e9met \u00e0 la demande de son client. Elle conf\u00e8re \u00e0 son b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire le droit d\u2019\u00eatre pay\u00e9 sur pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019une demande \u00e0 cet effet aupr\u00e8s de la banque \u00e9mettrice, pour autant que cette demande soit conforme aux exigences \u00e9tablies dans la lettre de cr\u00e9dit. Couramment employ\u00e9e dans des op\u00e9rations commerciales nationales et internationales, la lettre de cr\u00e9dit est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement utilis\u00e9e comme un outil de gestion du risque. Elle sert \u00e0 garantir que le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire obtiendra le paiement qu\u2019il s\u2019attend \u00e0 recevoir aux termes d\u2019un contrat sous\u2011jacent. Les demandes de paiement surviennent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00e0 la suite d\u2019all\u00e9gations suivant lesquelles il y aurait eu omission, de la part du client ou du titulaire du compte, d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter certaines obligations conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu. Le principe qui s\u2019applique est payez maintenant, et argumentez plus tard si n\u00e9cessaire. C\u2019est l\u2019institution financi\u00e8re \u00e9mettrice qui assume le risque de ne pas \u00eatre pay\u00e9e par son client.\nLe droit qui r\u00e9git les lettres de cr\u00e9dit repose sur deux principes fondamentaux : l\u2019autonomie et la stricte conformit\u00e9. L\u2019autonomie signifie que la lettre de cr\u00e9dit constitue une obligation ind\u00e9pendante de la banque \u00e9mettrice ou confirmatrice. L\u2019obligation de la banque \u00e9mettrice d\u2019honorer une demande de paiement valide est ind\u00e9pendante de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du contrat sous\u2011jacent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard duquel le cr\u00e9dit a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9. La banque s\u2019engage \u00e0 payer le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire pourvu que les conditions prescrites soient respect\u00e9es. Le client de la banque pourrait ultimement avoir une cause d\u2019action contre le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire, mais l\u2019institution financi\u00e8re ne s\u2019en pr\u00e9occupe g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas puisque la lettre de cr\u00e9dit fait en sorte que le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire est pay\u00e9 entretemps. La stricte conformit\u00e9 signifie que l\u2019obligation de la banque \u00e9mettrice doit \u00eatre \u00e9tablie uniquement en fonction de la stricte conformit\u00e9 de la pr\u00e9sentation (laquelle comprend la conformit\u00e9 des documents pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s) au regard des conditions de la lettre de cr\u00e9dit. Elle exige non seulement que les documents pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s soient conformes aux conditions de la lettre de cr\u00e9dit, mais qu\u2019ils concordent en apparence entre eux, apr\u00e8s un examen raisonnablement attentif. L\u2019examen n\u2019exige pas la perfection. Il est possible, dans les cas qui sont manifestement appropri\u00e9s, d\u2019ignorer les divergences n\u00e9gligeables.\nLa fraude est la seule exception reconnue en droit canadien opposable \u00e0 l\u2019obligation qui incombe \u00e0 l\u2019institution financi\u00e8re \u00e9mettrice de payer le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire sur r\u00e9ception d\u2019une demande \u00e0 cet effet. Lorsqu\u2019une fraude de la part du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire du cr\u00e9dit a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e suffisamment \u00e0 la connaissance de la banque avant le paiement de la traite ou d\u00e9montr\u00e9e devant un tribunal auquel le client de la banque a demand\u00e9 de d\u00e9livrer une injonction interlocutoire, la banque \u00e9mettrice n\u2019est pas tenue d\u2019honorer la traite. La port\u00e9e potentielle de l\u2019exception de fraude doit \u00eatre circonscrite ad\u00e9quatement. L\u2019exception devrait \u00eatre suffisamment large pour comprendre la plupart des conduites qui ne devraient pas \u00eatre facilit\u00e9es au moyen des lettres de cr\u00e9dit, mais, par ailleurs, si elle est trop large, les lettres de cr\u00e9dit pourraient devenir beaucoup moins fiables. La mise en balance de ces deux consid\u00e9rations requiert un crit\u00e8re exigeant en ce qui concerne la fraude. Dans ce contexte, la \u00ab fraude \u00bb doit impliquer le recours \u00e0 certains actes irr\u00e9guliers, malhonn\u00eates ou trompeurs. Une caract\u00e9ristique essentielle de la fraude civile ou commerciale est son effet sur la demande de paiement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire. Le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire qui demande le paiement tout en sachant qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas le droit d\u2019\u00eatre pay\u00e9 au titre du contrat sous\u2011jacent peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme ayant commis une fraude. La question de savoir s\u2019il y a eu fraude est une question mixte de fait et de droit qui commande la retenue en appel.\nL\u2019exception de fraude s\u2019applique tout autant lorsqu\u2019une seconde lettre de cr\u00e9dit est \u00e9mise par une institution financi\u00e8re qui s\u2019engage \u00e0 payer sur pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019une attestation qu\u2019une demande de paiement a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e au titre d\u2019une premi\u00e8re lettre de cr\u00e9dit. De fait, la conduite du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire d\u2019une contre\u2011garantie peut le rendre imputable de la fraude commise par un tiers. Dans un tel cas, l\u2019exception de fraude s\u2019applique directement \u00e0 la demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire. Par contre, l\u2019exception de fraude ne s\u2019applique pas \u00e0 la fraude commise par un tiers \u00e0 une lettre de cr\u00e9dit lorsque le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de la lettre est innocent de cette fraude. Accepter le contraire \u00e9largirait ind\u00fbment l\u2019exception de fraude au d\u00e9triment de la fiabilit\u00e9 des lettres de cr\u00e9dit.\nUn b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire cesse d\u2019\u00eatre innocent lorsqu\u2019il a connaissance de la fraude d\u2019un tiers et qu\u2019il y participe. Lorsqu\u2019il y a \u00e0 la fois connaissance et participation, la fraude du tiers peut \u00eatre \u00e0 juste titre imput\u00e9e au b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire comme si c\u2019\u00e9tait la sienne. Il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une responsabilit\u00e9 indirecte ou du fait d\u2019autrui; c\u2019est simplement une application de l\u2019exception de fraude au b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de la lettre de cr\u00e9dit en question.\nDans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, la conclusion du juge de premi\u00e8re instance selon laquelle le MDG a commis une fraude commande la d\u00e9f\u00e9rence. Sa d\u00e9cision selon laquelle le MDG a commis certaines irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s qui pouvaient constituer une fraude est amplement \u00e9tay\u00e9e par la preuve. La preuve appuie la conclusion selon laquelle le MDG s\u2019est livr\u00e9 \u00e0 une tentative frauduleuse de se soustraire \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance provisoire et \u00e0 la sentence finale du tribunal arbitral de la CCI en r\u00e9it\u00e9rant sa demande de paiement environ une semaine avant le prononc\u00e9 de la sentence arbitrale finale et, apr\u00e8s que celle\u2011ci a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue et qu\u2019il est devenu \u00e9vident que le contrat de compensation ne conf\u00e9rait aucun droit au MDG sur l\u2019argent qu\u2019il avait re\u00e7u, en ne rendant pas l\u2019argent. De plus, il n\u2019y a aucune raison de modifier la conclusion du juge de premi\u00e8re instance selon laquelle la banque grecque avait clairement une connaissance de la fraude commise par le MDG et qu\u2019elle a particip\u00e9 activement \u00e0 la fraude du MDG en payant celui\u2011ci dans des circonstances irr\u00e9guli\u00e8res. Les employ\u00e9s de la banque grecque qui ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de payer le MDG savaient qu\u2019il \u00e9tait interdit \u00e0 celui\u2011ci de demander le paiement au titre de la lettre de garantie grecque et que le prononc\u00e9 de la sentence arbitrale finale \u00e9tait imminent. La banque grecque ne faisait pas que soup\u00e7onner le MDG d\u2019avoir demand\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre pay\u00e9 en violation de l\u2019ordonnance provisoire; elle savait clairement que cela se produisait. \u00c0 tout le moins, cela indique que la banque grecque savait que la demande de paiement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite en violation d\u2019au moins une ordonnance, ce qui, dans les circonstances, repr\u00e9sente une connaissance claire de la conduite frauduleuse du MDG. Puisque la banque grecque \u00e9tait au courant de la fraude du MDG et y a particip\u00e9, elle est devenue coauteure de cette fraude et doit, aux fins de l\u2019exception de fraude, en assumer la responsabilit\u00e9. C\u2019est la fraude de la banque grecque, \u00e0 titre de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie canadienne, qui est susceptible de faire l\u2019objet de poursuites devant les tribunaux qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois.\nEn ce qui concerne les jugements des tribunaux grecs, ils n\u2019ont pas de pertinence d\u00e9terminante pour appr\u00e9cier la conduite du MDG et de la banque grecque. \u00c0 d\u00e9faut d\u2019une demande de reconnaissance et d\u2019ex\u00e9cution accueillie, les jugements \u00e9trangers constituent de simples \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, et le poids qui leur est accord\u00e9 est une question de fait commandant la retenue en appel. La d\u00e9cision de n\u2019accorder que peu ou pas de poids \u00e0 un jugement \u00e9tranger inex\u00e9cutoire peut \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e si la d\u00e9cision en question ne tient pas d\u00fbment compte de la jurisprudence canadienne pertinente ou si elle soul\u00e8ve d\u2019autres pr\u00e9occupations relatives \u00e0 l\u2019ordre public. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les tribunaux \u00e9trangers ont conclu qu\u2019une partie peut passer outre \u00e0 une ordonnance d\u2019un tribunal arbitral auquel elle avait accept\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre assujettie. Vu les circonstances, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance et la Cour d\u2019appel ont express\u00e9ment d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de n\u2019accorder aucun poids aux d\u00e9cisions des tribunaux grecs. Aucune erreur r\u00e9visable n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9e.\nLes juges Karakatsanis et C\u00f4t\u00e9 (dissidentes) : Le pourvoi devrait \u00eatre accueilli et l\u2019action intent\u00e9e par l\u2019entreprise canadienne contre la banque grecque et la banque canadienne devrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e. Conclure autrement \u00e9carterait les d\u00e9cisions des tribunaux grecs au motif qu\u2019elles ne sont pas pertinentes, alors qu\u2019on ne peut en faire fi. La courtoisie internationale est un principe directeur essentiel lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de donner un effet \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision \u00e9trang\u00e8re ou de l\u2019ex\u00e9cuter. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il n\u2019y a aucune raison d\u2019ordre public qui justifierait de n\u2019accorder aucun poids aux jugements rendus par les tribunaux grecs. Lorsque ceux\u2011ci sont pris en consid\u00e9ration, il faut conclure que la demande de paiement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le MDG en vertu de la lettre de garantie grecque n\u2019\u00e9tait ni frauduleuse ni assimilable \u00e0 une fraude; et, m\u00eame si c\u2019\u00e9tait le cas, la banque grecque serait innocente de cette fraude. Il y a une contradiction inh\u00e9rente entre l\u2019exigence qu\u2019une cour de r\u00e9vision se place dans la position de la banque \u00e9mettrice au moment du paiement pour d\u00e9terminer si celle\u2011ci avait une connaissance suffisante de la fraude, tout en \u00e9cartant du m\u00eame coup les d\u00e9cisions des tribunaux comp\u00e9tents qui liaient cette banque. La conclusion du juge de premi\u00e8re instance selon laquelle l\u2019exception de fraude s\u2019applique ne peut donc \u00eatre maintenue.\nIl convient de d\u00e9signer la lettre de garantie grecque et la lettre de contre\u2011garantie canadienne en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce comme des garanties sur demande. Les garanties sur demande, comme les lettres de cr\u00e9dit, sont des contrats \u00e9tablis \u00e0 la demande d\u2019un donneur d\u2019ordre par lequel le garant, g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement une banque, s\u2019engage irr\u00e9vocablement \u00e0 payer le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire sur demande, ind\u00e9pendamment de tout litige pouvant opposer le donneur d\u2019ordre et le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire. Bien que les conditions relatives au paiement d\u2019une garantie sur demande refl\u00e8tent le contrat sous\u2011jacent, le garant s\u2019engage \u00e0 payer ind\u00e9pendamment de faits ou d\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nements ext\u00e9rieurs. En ce sens, la garantie sur demande est ind\u00e9pendante du contrat sous\u2011jacent; elle est de nature autonome. Lorsque les parties \u00e0 une transaction commerciale s\u2019entendent pour utiliser des garanties sur demande afin de garantir l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de leurs obligations, elles expriment leur intention d\u2019\u00eatre li\u00e9es par une structure de type \u00ab payez maintenant, argumentez plus tard \u00bb. L\u2019obligation de payer du garant peut \u00eatre d\u00e9clench\u00e9e seulement selon les conditions pr\u00e9cis\u00e9es par le donneur d\u2019ordre. Une fois les conditions \u00e9tablies, le seul contr\u00f4le que la banque peut exercer est celui de la r\u00e9gularit\u00e9 des documents soumis par le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire. La r\u00e8gle fondamentale porte que, apr\u00e8s un examen raisonnablement attentif, les documents doivent pr\u00e9senter une apparence de conformit\u00e9 avec les conditions de la lettre de cr\u00e9dit. Le r\u00f4le de la banque en tant que garant est donc simple. Elle doit payer lorsqu\u2019elle re\u00e7oit une demande conforme et ne peut pas s\u2019enqu\u00e9rir des circonstances entourant le contrat sous\u2011jacent pour savoir si l\u2019obligation vis\u00e9e par la garantie sur demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e. La banque ne dispose pas des comp\u00e9tences et de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es n\u00e9cessaires pour arbitrer les questions qui divisent les parties au contrat sous-jacent, et elle ne devrait pas et n\u2019est pas cens\u00e9e s\u2019immiscer dans des controverses entre les parties au contrat sous\u2011jacent.\nL\u2019obligation de payer du garant lorsqu\u2019on lui pr\u00e9sente une demande conforme souffre d\u2019une exception : la fraude. Le donneur d\u2019ordre dispose de deux avenues pour emp\u00eacher le paiement au titre de la garantie sur demande : il peut saisir le tribunal comp\u00e9tent d\u2019une demande d\u2019injonction interlocutoire pour emp\u00eacher la banque d\u2019honorer la demande en pr\u00e9sentant une solide preuve prima facie de fraude, ou il peut pr\u00e9senter au garant des preuves suffisantes de fraude avant que le paiement soit effectu\u00e9. Le garant ne doit refuser d\u2019effectuer le paiement que dans les rares cas o\u00f9 il a une connaissance claire ou \u00e9vidente de la fraude. La \u00ab connaissance claire ou \u00e9vidente \u00bb est une norme on\u00e9reuse en ce sens qu\u2019il doit s\u2019agir d\u2019une fraude qui cr\u00e8ve les yeux. Une fraude \u00ab claire ou \u00e9vidente \u00bb au sens juridique n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessairement \u00ab claire ou \u00e9vidente \u00bb au sens commercial. C\u2019est pourquoi, lorsqu\u2019un tribunal est appel\u00e9 \u00e0 contr\u00f4ler la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision d\u2019une banque d\u2019honorer son obligation de paiement au titre d\u2019une garantie sur demande, il doit se placer exactement dans la m\u00eame situation que celle dans laquelle se trouvait la banque \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, sans recourir \u00e0 un raisonnement ex post facto. L\u2019exception doit demeurer limit\u00e9e : la port\u00e9e potentielle de l\u2019exception de fraude ne doit pas constituer un moyen pour cr\u00e9er une incertitude et un manque de confiance graves dans le fonctionnement des garanties sur demande; en m\u00eame temps, l\u2019application du principe de l\u2019autonomie ne doit pas servir \u00e0 encourager ou \u00e0 faciliter la fraude dans ces op\u00e9rations.\nLes tribunaux peuvent examiner les documents pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s ou le contrat sous\u2011jacent pour d\u00e9tecter une fraude. Toutefois, une all\u00e9gation de fraude n\u2019est pas une invitation lanc\u00e9e aux tribunaux de laisser des parties commerciales avis\u00e9es remodeler leur entente en adoptant une structure de type \u00ab argumentez maintenant, payez plus tard \u00bb lorsque la norme n\u2019est pas satisfaite. La norme \u00e0 satisfaire pour \u00e9tablir la fraude est on\u00e9reuse, et l\u2019exception ne s\u2019applique pas lorsque le donneur d\u2019ordre peut seulement prouver un comportement repr\u00e9sentant un agissement moins grave qu\u2019une fraude. Dans ce contexte, la fraude touche certains aspects de l\u2019ordre public \u2014 la mauvaise foi \u00e0 elle seule ne suffit pas \u2014 et elle doit \u00eatre propre au contexte pr\u00e9cis des garanties sur demande. Il doit s\u2019agir d\u2019une affaire o\u00f9 la demande de paiement au titre de la garantie est totalement injustifi\u00e9e ou encore o\u00f9 il est \u00e9vident qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucun droit au paiement.\nLa fraude commise par un tiers ne devrait pas emp\u00eacher un b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire innocent de demander le paiement au titre d\u2019une garantie sur demande. Dans le contexte d\u2019une lettre de garantie s\u00e9curis\u00e9e par une contre\u2011garantie, la fraude commise par le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de la garantie constitue toujours une fraude commise par un tiers pour l\u2019application de la contre\u2011garantie. Lorsque le garant a une connaissance claire ou \u00e9vidente de la fraude commise par le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de la lettre de garantie, mais qu\u2019il d\u00e9cide n\u00e9anmoins de payer, cette fraude peut lui \u00eatre imput\u00e9e. C\u2019est le paiement effectu\u00e9 au titre de la garantie qui d\u00e9clenche l\u2019application de la demande de paiement au titre d\u2019une contre\u2011garantie. Pour d\u00e9terminer si la demande de paiement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire au titre de la contre\u2011garantie \u00e9tait frauduleuse, le tribunal doit aller au\u2011del\u00e0 de la ligne de d\u00e9marcation claire qui existe entre la garantie et la contre\u2011garantie. Cette analyse ne doit toutefois pas se transformer en un litige quant au contrat sous\u2011jacent.\nEn l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance et les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel ont commis une erreur en n\u2019accordant aucun poids aux jugements des tribunaux grecs. Si ces jugements avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme des faits devant guider la conduite du MDG et de la banque grecque pour d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019exception de fraude s\u2019applique \u00e0 la lettre de contre\u2011garantie canadienne, la seule conclusion possible aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 que la demande du MDG en vertu de la lettre de garantie grecque et la d\u00e9cision de la banque grecque de proc\u00e9der au paiement \u00e9taient valables. Le fait que les jugements grecs n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 formellement reconnus et qu\u2019ils n\u2019ont donc pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9s ex\u00e9cutoires au Qu\u00e9bec n\u2019est pas pertinent, puisque la lettre de garantie grecque \u00e9tait r\u00e9gie par le droit grec et que les parties \u00e0 cette lettre n\u2019\u00e9taient pas domicili\u00e9es au Qu\u00e9bec. Il n\u2019y aurait eu aucune raison de demander la reconnaissance et l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des jugements grecs parce que rien dans ces d\u00e9cisions n\u2019\u00e9tait susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 au Qu\u00e9bec.\nEn outre, bien que les jugements grecs ne lient pas les tribunaux qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, le principe de courtoisie doit guider toute d\u00e9cision concernant le poids devant leur \u00eatre accord\u00e9. Lorsque des jugements \u00e9trangers sont admis en preuve sans \u00eatre formellement reconnus au Qu\u00e9bec, ils constituent n\u00e9anmoins une preuve prima facie des faits qui y sont rapport\u00e9s, de l\u2019application correcte du droit \u00e9tranger et de la juridiction du tribunal \u00e9tranger en la mati\u00e8re aux termes de l\u2019art. 2822 C.c.Q. Les tribunaux qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois ne peuvent simplement ignorer ces d\u00e9cisions; ils doivent leur reconna\u00eetre un effet de fait. Une d\u00e9cision \u00e9trang\u00e8re introduite en preuve est une contrainte factuelle pour les tribunaux qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois et doit \u00eatre trait\u00e9e en cons\u00e9quence. Bien que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance soit libre de d\u00e9terminer le poids qu\u2019il convient d\u2019accorder \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision \u00e9trang\u00e8re \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de l\u2019ensemble de la preuve, il ne peut pas remettre en question les faits rapport\u00e9s ni l\u2019application correcte du droit \u00e9tranger par le tribunal \u00e9tranger. C\u2019est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment ce que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a omis de faire. De plus, l\u2019exception relative \u00e0 l\u2019ordre public pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019art. 3081 et au par. 3155(5) C.c.Q. ne peut servir de fondement pour \u00e9carter l\u2019effet de fait des jugements grecs. Donner un effet de fait \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision \u00e9trang\u00e8re est tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rent d\u2019appliquer le droit \u00e9tranger, de reconna\u00eetre cette d\u00e9cision ou d\u2019incorporer la solution fournie par cette d\u00e9cision \u00e0 l\u2019ordre juridique du Qu\u00e9bec.\nCompte tenu de l\u2019ensemble de la preuve, qui comprend les jugements grecs, la conclusion ultime du juge de premi\u00e8re instance selon laquelle les exigences relatives \u00e0 l\u2019exception de fraude \u00e9taient remplies ne peut \u00eatre maintenue. Le juge a omis d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019engagement du MDG dans son ensemble de ne pas exiger le paiement en vertu de la lettre de garantie grecque tant et aussi longtemps que la proc\u00e9dure d\u2019arbitrage serait en cours et jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que la sentence finale soit rendue. Le MDG pouvait valablement retirer son engagement, et il n\u2019\u00e9tait plus effectif lorsque le MDG a demand\u00e9 le paiement. Le fait d\u2019avoir recours \u00e0 la lettre de garantie grecque dans ces circonstances ne peut donc servir de fondement pour conclure \u00e0 la fraude. Il \u00e9tait par ailleurs erron\u00e9 pour le juge de premi\u00e8re instance de conclure que la conduite du MDG \u00e9tait frauduleuse sur la base de l\u2019ordonnance provisoire du tribunal arbitral de la CCI ou d\u2019une des injonctions provisoires de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure, lesquelles n\u2019\u00e9taient pas ex\u00e9cutoires en Gr\u00e8ce. En ce qui concerne le moment choisi par le MDG pour pr\u00e9senter sa demande de paiement, bien qu\u2019il puisse \u00eatre tentant d\u2019examiner la conduite du MDG apr\u00e8s le fait, cela constituerait un raisonnement inadmissible. \u00c0 la face m\u00eame de la lettre de garantie grecque, le MDG pouvait valablement demander le paiement lorsqu\u2019il l\u2019a fait.\nEnfin, m\u00eame si la conduite du MDG \u00e9tait frauduleuse ou assimilable \u00e0 une fraude pour les fins de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie canadienne, compte tenu de l\u2019ensemble de la preuve, la banque grecque (la b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire) doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme innocente de la fraude all\u00e9gu\u00e9e du MDG (le tiers) aux fins de cette lettre. Pour d\u00e9terminer si la banque grecque avait une connaissance claire ou \u00e9vidente de la fraude all\u00e9gu\u00e9e, la Cour doit se placer exactement dans la m\u00eame situation que celle dans laquelle se trouvait la banque grecque en se mettant \u00e0 sa place, et donc se limiter aux faits connus de la banque grecque \u00e0 la date o\u00f9 le paiement au MDG a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9. La banque grecque s\u2019est retrouv\u00e9e devant un jugement d\u2019un tribunal comp\u00e9tent \u2014 qui \u00e9tait le seul tribunal comp\u00e9tent pour l\u2019application de la lettre de garantie grecque \u2014 lequel a conclu que le MDG pouvait valablement se pr\u00e9valoir de la lettre de garantie grecque. Cette d\u00e9cision, en tant que contrainte factuelle, est un \u00e9l\u00e9ment d\u00e9terminant dans l\u2019analyse de la connaissance claire ou \u00e9vidente de la banque grecque. En r\u00e9alit\u00e9, une seule d\u00e9cision pouvait \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la banque grecque \u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0, et cette d\u00e9cision ne lui ordonnait pas de ne pas payer le MDG. En raison du caract\u00e8re autonome de la garantie et du fait qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait aucune injonction en vigueur, la banque grecque n\u2019avait d\u2019autre choix que de payer. La conduite de la banque grecque \u00e9tait celle d\u2019un b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire innocent pour les fins de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie canadienne. Elle n\u2019a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 aucune fraude et elle n\u2019avait pas non plus une connaissance claire ou \u00e9vidente de la fraude all\u00e9gu\u00e9e au moment du paiement. Les conditions relatives \u00e0 l\u2019exception de fraude n\u2019\u00e9taient pas remplies et, en cons\u00e9quence, l\u2019autonomie de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie canadienne devait l\u2019emporter.\nJurisprudence\nCit\u00e9e par le juge Kasirer\nArr\u00eat appliqu\u00e9 : Banque de Nouvelle\u2011\u00c9cosse c.

Aper\u00e7u\n[1] Le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi offre \u00e0 la Cour l\u2019occasion de d\u00e9terminer quand, en raison de l\u2019exception de fraude reconnue en droit canadien, une banque \u00e9mettrice doit refuser d\u2019honorer une demande de paiement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e aux termes d\u2019une lettre de cr\u00e9dit. Le d\u00e9bat en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce concerne des all\u00e9gations de fraude port\u00e9es contre un tiers relativement \u00e0 la lettre de cr\u00e9dit en litige. Dans quelles circonstances la conduite frauduleuse d\u2019un tiers \u00e0 une lettre de cr\u00e9dit peut\u2011elle \u00eatre attribuable au b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de cette lettre, comme s\u2019il s\u2019agissait de sa propre fraude, obligeant de ce fait la banque \u00e9mettrice \u00e0 refuser une demande de paiement en application de l\u2019exception de fraude?\n[2] L\u2019un des \u00e9l\u00e9ments au c\u0153ur du pr\u00e9sent litige est une lettre de contre\u2011garantie r\u00e9gie par le droit qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. Cette lettre de cr\u00e9dit a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9livr\u00e9e par la Banque Nationale du Canada \u00e0 la demande de sa cliente, Bombardier inc., en faveur d\u2019Eurobank Ergasias S.A., une banque grecque. En demandant l\u2019\u00e9mission de cette lettre de cr\u00e9dit, Bombardier cherchait \u00e0 faciliter une op\u00e9ration complexe de fourniture d\u2019a\u00e9ronefs au minist\u00e8re de la D\u00e9fense de la Gr\u00e8ce, ou \u00ab MDG \u00bb. Eurobank a d\u00e9livr\u00e9 une lettre de garantie distincte en faveur du MDG, \u00e9galement \u00e0 la demande de Bombardier, laquelle est assujettie au droit grec. L\u2019objectif de ces lettres de cr\u00e9dit interd\u00e9pendantes \u00e9tait clair : si le MDG en venait \u00e0 demander \u00e0 Eurobank d\u2019honorer la lettre de garantie grecque, Eurobank aurait alors le droit d\u2019exiger un remboursement de la Banque Nationale au titre de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise.\n[3] Lorsque le MDG a demand\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre pay\u00e9 en vertu de la lettre de cr\u00e9dit grecque, Bombardier a sollicit\u00e9 une injonction en Cour sup\u00e9rieure du Qu\u00e9bec afin d\u2019emp\u00eacher la Banque Nationale d\u2019honorer une \u00e9ventuelle demande de paiement faite par Eurobank \u00e0 titre de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise. Bombardier a fait valoir que le MDG \u2014 un tiers \u00e0 la lettre qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise \u2014 avait commis une fraude au moyen de cet instrument et que, en raison de la connaissance et de la participation d\u2019Eurobank \u00e0 cette fraude, la Banque Nationale devrait \u00eatre emp\u00each\u00e9e, sur le fondement de l\u2019exception de fraude, d\u2019honorer la demande de paiement d\u2019Eurobank. Si la Banque Nationale honore le cr\u00e9dit, Bombardier sera \u00e9videmment redevable de ce montant \u00e0 sa banque. C\u2019est injuste, selon Bombardier, car le tribunal arbitral auquel les parties ont soumis leur diff\u00e9rend a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que Bombardier ne devait pas les fonds en cause au MDG.\n[4] La question pr\u00e9cise en appel devant notre Cour est de savoir si la fraude commise par le MDG au moyen de la lettre de cr\u00e9dit grecque peut \u00eatre imput\u00e9e \u00e0 Eurobank \u00e0 titre de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de la lettre de cr\u00e9dit qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise, comme s\u2019il s\u2019agissait de sa propre fraude. Le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, selon Bombardier, l\u2019exception de fraude niant le caract\u00e8re autonome des lettres de cr\u00e9dit devrait s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 Eurobank. Cela signifierait que la Banque Nationale doit refuser la demande de paiement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de la lettre qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise au motif qu\u2019elle est frauduleuse. Subsidiairement, Bombardier fait valoir qu\u2019\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le contrat sous\u2011jacent est frapp\u00e9 de nullit\u00e9, il en va de m\u00eame pour les lettres de cr\u00e9dit qui s\u2019y rattachent, malgr\u00e9 le principe d\u2019autonomie qui r\u00e9git ces lettres.\n[5] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Banque de Nouvelle\u2011\u00c9cosse c. Angelica\u2011Whitewear Ltd., [1987] 1 R.C.S. 59, la Cour a reconnu l\u2019exception de fraude opposable \u00e0 l\u2019obligation quasi absolue qui incombe aux banques \u00e9mettrices d\u2019honorer les demandes de paiement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es au titre des lettres de cr\u00e9dit. \u00c9crivant au nom de la Cour, le juge Le Dain a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9tablir un juste \u00e9quilibre entre deux consid\u00e9rations de principe concurrentes qui, selon lui, cr\u00e9aient une \u00ab tension \u00bb dans le droit : l\u2019importance, pour le commerce international, que les banques respectent le caract\u00e8re autonome des lettres de cr\u00e9dit et l\u2019importance de proscrire la fraude dans les op\u00e9rations commerciales (p. 72). D\u2019une part, \u00e9largir la port\u00e9e de l\u2019exception de fraude pourrait miner la fiabilit\u00e9 des lettres de cr\u00e9dit; d\u2019autre part, fermer les yeux sur la fraude pourrait encourager la conduite r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible dans les op\u00e9rations impliquant des lettres de cr\u00e9dit. Le juge Le Dain a conclu que l\u2019exception de fraude doit se limiter aux cas o\u00f9 la fraude manifeste du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire est si \u00e9norme que la lettre de cr\u00e9dit qui sous\u2011tend l\u2019op\u00e9ration perd toute l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9. Le crit\u00e8re permettant l\u2019application de l\u2019exception de fraude est exigeant. Tenant compte de cet \u00e9quilibre d\u00e9licat et de ce crit\u00e8re exigeant, il a \u00e9crit que l\u2019exception ne devrait pas viser la fraude d\u2019un tiers dont le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire est \u00ab innocent \u00bb (p. 84).\n[6] Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, nous sommes appel\u00e9s \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si l\u2019exception de fraude peut s\u2019\u00e9tendre \u00e0 la fraude commise par un tiers, puis \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer dans quelles circonstances la conduite du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire \u2014 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, celle d\u2019Eurobank \u2014 ne sera pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme \u00ab innocente \u00bb. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, la Cour doit d\u00e9cider si Eurobank, en raison de son lien avec les m\u00e9faits reproch\u00e9s \u00e0 un tiers (le MDG), doit r\u00e9pondre de cette fraude comme s\u2019il s\u2019agissait de la sienne.\n[7] Le contexte factuel et juridique est complexe en raison du fait que ces lettres de cr\u00e9dit interd\u00e9pendantes sont r\u00e9gies par des lois diff\u00e9rentes. Il est encore plus compliqu\u00e9 en raison du fait que les tribunaux grecs ont \u00e9tabli que la conduite du MDG en ce qui concerne la lettre de garantie n\u2019\u00e9tait pas frauduleuse en droit grec.\n[8] Cela dit, dans les proc\u00e9dures pertinentes au pr\u00e9sent pourvoi, Bombardier a sollicit\u00e9 une injonction devant la Cour sup\u00e9rieure du Qu\u00e9bec. Ces proc\u00e9dures nous am\u00e8nent \u00e0 nous concentrer uniquement sur le droit qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois et uniquement sur la lettre de contre\u2011garantie. Et bien que les jugements rendus par les tribunaux grecs aient trait\u00e9 de la responsabilit\u00e9 du MDG au titre de la lettre de garantie grecque, nul n\u2019a demand\u00e9 aux tribunaux qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois de les reconna\u00eetre et de les faire ex\u00e9cuter en application des dispositions pertinentes du Code civil du Qu\u00e9bec (\u00ab C.c.Q. \u00bb).\n[9] Pour savoir si la Banque Nationale doit refuser de faire le paiement \u00e0 Eurobank en raison de l\u2019exception de fraude, nous n\u2019avons pas besoin de nous prononcer sur la validit\u00e9 de la lettre de garantie en droit grec ni d\u2019appr\u00e9cier la conduite du MDG au regard du droit grec. De telles questions sont du ressort des tribunaux grecs et ne permettent pas de trancher l\u2019affaire dont notre Cour est saisie, laquelle porte sur la question de savoir si l\u2019exception de fraude s\u2019applique \u00e0 la lettre de contre\u2011garantie, qui est r\u00e9gie par le droit qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois.\n[10] Dans son argumentation \u00e9crite et sa plaidoirie, Eurobank a exhort\u00e9 la Cour \u2014 \u00e0 tort, \u00e0 mon humble avis \u2014 \u00e0 effectuer une analyse de l\u2019exception de fraude dans le contexte de la lettre de garantie. Eurobank pensait sans doute que les jugements des tribunaux grecs sauraient nous convaincre qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas eu de fraude de la part du MDG relativement \u00e0 la lettre de cr\u00e9dit grecque. Or, ce n\u2019est pas la question en appel devant notre Cour et, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la reconnaissance et l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de ces d\u00e9cisions \u00e9trang\u00e8res n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenues devant les tribunaux qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, ces jugements ne permettent pas de trancher la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Nous devons plut\u00f4t nous demander d\u2019abord si la conduite du MDG constituait une fraude commise par un tiers \u00e0 la lettre de contre\u2011garantie, telle que r\u00e9gie par le droit qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. Dans l\u2019affirmative, nous devons ensuite d\u00e9cider si l\u2019exception de fraude s\u2019applique \u00e0 Eurobank \u00e0 titre de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de la lettre qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise, en raison de sa propre conduite, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la norme canadienne \u00e9tablie dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Angelica\u2011Whitewear.\n[11] \u00c0 mon sens, lorsqu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli qu\u2019un tiers a commis une fraude et que le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire d\u2019une lettre de cr\u00e9dit r\u00e9gie par le droit qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois a connaissance de cette fraude et y participe, la fraude devient celle du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire. D\u00e8s lors, l\u2019exception de fraude s\u2019applique et l\u2019\u00e9metteur doit \u00eatre emp\u00each\u00e9 de payer le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire.\n[12] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion factuelle que le MDG avait agi frauduleusement. Il a \u00e9galement conclu qu\u2019Eurobank avait connaissance de la fraude du MDG et qu\u2019elle avait n\u00e9anmoins demand\u00e9 le paiement au titre de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise. En un mot, Eurobank n\u2019\u00e9tait pas \u00ab innocente \u00bb parce qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait au courant de la fraude commise par un tiers et y avait particip\u00e9. \u00c0 l\u2019instar des juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel, je ne vois aucune erreur susceptible de r\u00e9vision dans ces conclusions ni dans la conclusion ultime du juge de premi\u00e8re instance : la fraude du MDG est imputable \u00e0 Eurobank comme s\u2019il s\u2019agissait de sa propre fraude et Eurobank ne peut, \u00e0 titre de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de la lettre qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise, demander d\u2019\u00eatre pay\u00e9e.\n[13] Pour ces motifs, je suis d\u2019avis de rejeter l\u2019appel et de confirmer la conclusion selon laquelle, en vertu de l\u2019exception de fraude reconnue dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Angelica\u2011Whitewear, il y a lieu d\u2019interdire \u00e0 la Banque Nationale d\u2019honorer la demande de paiement d\u2019Eurobank. Dans les circonstances, j\u2019estime qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9cider si les lettres de cr\u00e9dit sont frapp\u00e9es de nullit\u00e9.\nII. Contexte\n[14] Afin de bien se situer dans le cadre du pr\u00e9sent pourvoi, il y a lieu de pr\u00e9senter de mani\u00e8re sommaire les quatre principaux acteurs, les deux contrats sous\u2011jacents et les deux lettres de cr\u00e9dit interd\u00e9pendantes.\nA. Les acteurs en cause\n[15] Bombardier inc., intim\u00e9e dans le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi et plaignante dans les proc\u00e9dures initiales, est une entreprise d\u2019a\u00e9ronautique canadienne. Son si\u00e8ge social est situ\u00e9 \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, au Qu\u00e9bec.\n[16] Eurobank Ergasias S.A. (de pair avec ses pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseures, \u00ab Eurobank \u00bb), appelante en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et d\u00e9fenderesse devant la Cour sup\u00e9rieure, est une banque grecque. L\u2019une de ses pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseures \u00e9tait l\u2019\u00e9mettrice de la lettre de garantie. Eurobank est la b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie.\n[17] La Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l\u2019armement et des investissements militaires du minist\u00e8re de la D\u00e9fense de la Gr\u00e8ce (le \u00ab MDG \u00bb) est d\u00e9sign\u00e9e appelante dans le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi et d\u00e9fenderesse en premi\u00e8re instance. Le MDG est charg\u00e9 de l\u2019approvisionnement militaire pour la R\u00e9publique hell\u00e9nique. Comme il l\u2019indique dans son argumentation \u00e9crite, le MDG n\u2019a pas interjet\u00e9 appel du jugement de premi\u00e8re instance ou de l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour d\u2019appel parce qu\u2019il ne reconna\u00eet pas la comp\u00e9tence des tribunaux qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois \u00e0 son \u00e9gard, mais il affirme qu\u2019il avait [traduction] \u00ab le devoir \u00bb de soumettre \u00e0 notre Cour les points qu\u2019il a soulev\u00e9s devant les juridictions inf\u00e9rieures (m.a., MDG, par. 96).\n[18] La Banque Nationale du Canada, deuxi\u00e8me intim\u00e9e dans le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi, est une banque canadienne dont le si\u00e8ge social est situ\u00e9 \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. La Banque Nationale est l\u2019\u00e9mettrice de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9e d\u00e9fenderesse dans la demande introductive d\u2019instance d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par Bombardier, sa cliente, qui cherchait \u00e0 emp\u00eacher la banque d\u2019effectuer un paiement qui, ultimement, serait fait au d\u00e9triment de Bombardier. La Banque Nationale adopte un point de vue qui s\u2019aligne sur celui de Bombardier en ce qui concerne la responsabilit\u00e9 des banques \u00e9mettrices au titre des lettres de cr\u00e9dit. En particulier, la Banque Nationale se rallie \u00e0 Bombardier pour demander qu\u2019Eurobank ne soit pas pay\u00e9e au titre de la lettre qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise et que le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi soit rejet\u00e9.\nB. Les contrats sous\u2011jacents\n[19] En 1998, le MDG a conclu un contrat d\u2019approvisionnement avec Bombardier visant l\u2019achat de 10 a\u00e9ronefs amphibies de lutte contre les incendies pour la somme de 252 151 899 $ US. Le contrat est r\u00e9gi par le droit grec.\n[20] Au m\u00eame moment, Bombardier et le MDG ont conclu un \u00ab contrat de compensation \u00bb par lequel Bombardier a convenu de sous\u2011traiter une partie des travaux li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019approvisionnement des a\u00e9ronefs \u00e0 des entreprises grecques. Le contrat de compensation, lui aussi r\u00e9gi par le droit grec, pr\u00e9voit que, \u00e0 l\u2019expiration d\u2019un terme de 10 ans, Bombardier serait redevable au MDG de dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats liquid\u00e9s si elle ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas acquitt\u00e9e de ses obligations en mati\u00e8re de sous\u2011traitance. Les parties ont convenu que le paiement de ces dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats liquid\u00e9s serait garanti par une lettre de cr\u00e9dit \u00e9mise par une banque grecque en faveur du MDG. Le contrat de compensation pr\u00e9voit \u00e9galement que tout diff\u00e9rend sera tranch\u00e9 par un tribunal arbitral si\u00e9geant \u00e0 Paris et appliquant les r\u00e8gles de la Chambre de commerce internationale (\u00ab CCI \u00bb).\nC. Les lettres de cr\u00e9dit\n[21] L\u2019une des pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseures d\u2019Eurobank, ANZ Grindlays Bank Limited, elle aussi une banque grecque, a \u00e9mis la lettre de garantie en faveur du MDG le 5 f\u00e9vrier 1999 pour une somme de 27 736 709 $ US visant \u00e0 garantir le paiement des dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats liquid\u00e9s que Bombardier serait tenue de payer conform\u00e9ment au contrat de compensation. Cette lettre de garantie est r\u00e9gie par le droit grec. Selon le contrat de compensation, le MDG devait r\u00e9duire le montant de la lettre de garantie au fur et \u00e0 mesure que Bombardier s\u2019acquittait de ses obligations de sous\u2011traitance. En juin 2010, la lettre de garantie \u00e9tait r\u00e9duite \u00e0 13 868 354,60 $ US.\n[22] Le 29 janvier 1999, la Banque Nationale a \u00e9mis la lettre de contre\u2011garantie en faveur d\u2019Eurobank afin de garantir le paiement des sommes que cette derni\u00e8re serait tenue de payer au MDG au titre de la lettre de garantie, dans le cas o\u00f9 le MDG affirmait que Bombardier ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas acquitt\u00e9e de ses obligations au titre du contrat de compensation. Le MDG n\u2019est pas partie \u00e0 la lettre de contre\u2011garantie, qui est r\u00e9gie par le droit qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. La lettre de contre\u2011garantie pr\u00e9voit que la [traduction] \u00ab Banque Nationale du Canada [s\u2019]engag[e] irr\u00e9vocablement [. . .] \u00e0 [. . .] rembourser [\u00e0 Eurobank] toutes les sommes r\u00e9clam\u00e9es par le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de [sa lettre de] garantie \u00bb (d.a., vol. IV, p. 118). De plus, elle \u00e9nonce que le paiement au titre de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie par la Banque Nationale \u00e9mettrice sera fait [traduction] \u00ab apr\u00e8s r\u00e9ception [du] t\u00e9lex valide\/SWIFT authentifi\u00e9 [d\u2019Eurobank] indiquant qu\u2019[elle a] re\u00e7u de la part du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de [sa] garantie [(c.\u2011\u00e0\u2011d. le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de la lettre de garantie, le MDG)] une demande de paiement conforme aux conditions de [sa] garantie [(c.\u2011\u00e0\u2011d. la lettre de garantie)] \u00bb (p. 118).\n[23] Bien que les deux lettres de cr\u00e9dit soient distinctes \u2014 et r\u00e9gies par des lois diff\u00e9rentes \u2014, elles sont li\u00e9es. Les premiers paragraphes de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie, qui reproduisent mot pour mot l\u2019int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 de la lettre de garantie, l\u2019indiquent clairement.\nD. Le litige initial\n[24] Apr\u00e8s un certain temps, Bombardier a constat\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne serait pas en mesure de s\u2019acquitter des obligations en mati\u00e8re de sous\u2011traitance lui incombant en vertu du contrat de compensation en raison de ce qu\u2019elle consid\u00e9rait \u00eatre un nombre insuffisant d\u2019entreprises grecques disponibles et qualifi\u00e9es. Elle a soutenu qu\u2019elle ne devait pas \u00eatre tenue de payer les dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats liquid\u00e9s. Le MDG n\u2019\u00e9tait pas de cet avis. Pour r\u00e9soudre ce diff\u00e9rend, un tribunal arbitral de la CCI a \u00e9t\u00e9 constitu\u00e9 comme le pr\u00e9voit le contrat de compensation. Les proc\u00e9dures d\u2019arbitrage se sont \u00e9tal\u00e9es sur plusieurs ann\u00e9es, des audiences ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 tenues en 2012 et en 2013. En 2012, Bombardier a obtenu la permission d\u2019ajouter un second \u00e9l\u00e9ment \u00e0 sa demande, soit que le contrat de compensation \u00e9tait nul parce que contraire au droit de l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne relatif \u00e0 la libre circulation des biens.\n[25] En avril 2012, le MDG s\u2019est formellement engag\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de Bombardier et du tribunal arbitral de la CCI \u00e0 ne pas exiger de paiement au titre de la lettre de garantie [traduction] \u00ab tant et aussi longtemps que la proc\u00e9dure [d\u2019arbitrage] est en cours \u00bb (d.a., vol. IV, p. 199).\n[26] En juillet 2013, Bombardier et le MDG ont \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9s que le tribunal arbitral de la CCI rendrait sa sentence arbitrale finale au plus tard le 31 d\u00e9cembre de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e.\n[27] Le 5 ao\u00fbt 2013, malgr\u00e9 l\u2019engagement qu\u2019il avait pris, le MDG a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Eurobank de lui payer la somme de 13 868 354,60 $ US au titre de la lettre de garantie, alors que la sentence arbitrale finale n\u2019avait pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue. Le MDG a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d\u2019autres demandes de paiement par la suite, la derni\u00e8re ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 faite le 23 d\u00e9cembre 2013.\nE. Demandes de mesures provisoires\n[28] Apprenant que le MDG avait demand\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre pay\u00e9 en vertu de la lettre de garantie, Bombardier a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande urgente de mesures provisoires aupr\u00e8s du tribunal arbitral de la CCI. Elle a sollicit\u00e9 une ordonnance d\u00e9clarant que la demande de paiement du MDG \u00e9tait invalide et exigeant que ce dernier respecte son engagement. Le 13 ao\u00fbt 2013, le tribunal arbitral de la CCI a rendu l\u2019ordonnance proc\u00e9durale no 11, dans laquelle il [traduction] \u00ab ordonn[ait] [au MDG] de s\u2019abstenir de demander d\u2019\u00eatre pay\u00e9 en vertu de la lettre de garantie \u00e9mise conform\u00e9ment au contrat de compensation 27\/98 et ce, jusqu\u2019au prononc\u00e9 de la sentence arbitrale finale en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce \u00bb (d.a., vol. V, p. 39). Bombardier a demand\u00e9 des garanties que le MDG se conformerait \u00e0 cette ordonnance, mais de telles garanties ne lui ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9es.\n[29] Ne sachant pas si le MDG se conformerait \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance proc\u00e9durale no 11, Bombardier a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate \u00e0 la Cour sup\u00e9rieure du Qu\u00e9bec afin d\u2019obtenir une injonction provisoire, interlocutoire et permanente ainsi qu\u2019une ordonnance de sauvegarde. Elle a sollicit\u00e9 des ordonnances afin d\u2019emp\u00eacher tout paiement au titre de la lettre de garantie et de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie. En ao\u00fbt 2013, le juge Pr\u00e9vost a prononc\u00e9 une injonction provisoire d\u2019une dur\u00e9e de 10 jours, qui interdisait \u00e0 Eurobank et \u00e0 la Banque Nationale d\u2019honorer les lettres de cr\u00e9dit. Par la suite, le juge Davis a prononc\u00e9 une nouvelle injonction provisoire d\u2019une dur\u00e9e de 10 jours, qui interdisait \u00e9galement les paiements.\n[30] En ao\u00fbt 2013, Eurobank a intent\u00e9 un recours parall\u00e8le en Gr\u00e8ce en vue d\u2019obtenir une ordonnance interdisant le paiement au titre de la lettre de garantie jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la fin de la proc\u00e9dure d\u2019arbitrage. La juge Chrysoula Pana de la Cour de premi\u00e8re instance \u00e0 juge unique d\u2019Ath\u00e8nes a prononc\u00e9 une injonction provisoire qui autorisait Eurobank \u00e0 ne pas effectuer de paiement au titre de la lettre de garantie. Le 16 d\u00e9cembre 2013, le juge Panayiotis Kostis de cette m\u00eame cour a rejet\u00e9 sur le fond la demande d\u2019injonction pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Eurobank.\nF. La derni\u00e8re demande de paiement du MDG\n[31] Le 5 d\u00e9cembre 2013, le tribunal arbitral de la CCI a inform\u00e9 les parties que sa sentence arbitrale finale avait \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise \u00e0 la Cour de la CCI pour approbation, sentence qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e par la Cour de la CCI le 19 d\u00e9cembre 2013. Le 23 d\u00e9cembre 2013, le tribunal arbitral de la CCI a inform\u00e9 les parties que la sentence arbitrale finale serait rendue le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2013.\n[32] Le 23 d\u00e9cembre 2013, le MDG a signifi\u00e9 \u00e0 Eurobank un [traduction] \u00ab prot\u00eat\u2011invitation extrajudiciaire \u00bb enjoignant \u00e0 Eurobank, en tant qu\u2019\u00e9mettrice de la lettre de garantie, de payer le MDG \u00e0 titre de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de cette lettre de cr\u00e9dit. Le prot\u00eat-invitation extrajudiciaire indiquait qu\u2019Eurobank avait l\u2019obligation de payer le MDG conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 sa demande, sans \u00e9gard aux ordonnances prononc\u00e9es par les tribunaux qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. Aucune r\u00e9f\u00e9rence n\u2019\u00e9tait faite au sujet du prononc\u00e9 imminent de la sentence arbitrale finale ou \u00e0 l\u2019engagement du MDG \u00e0 ne pas demander de paiement au titre de l\u2019ordonnance proc\u00e9durale no 11. Le prot\u00eat\u2011invitation extrajudiciaire indiquait aussi que, [traduction] \u00ab [e]n cas de non\u2011paiement de la lettre de garantie d\u2019ici demain, le mardi 24 d\u00e9cembre 2013, la R\u00e9publique hell\u00e9nique prendra non seulement des moyens l\u00e9gaux civils, mais \u00e9galement p\u00e9naux \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des dirigeants et employ\u00e9s responsables comp\u00e9tents [d\u2019Eurobank] pour appropriation frauduleuse de la somme que repr\u00e9sente la lettre de garantie ainsi que pour toute autre infraction \u00bb (d.a., vol. VI, p. 151 (soulignement et italique omis)).\n[33] Sur la foi de t\u00e9moignages d\u2019experts, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a d\u00e9crit en d\u00e9tail les mesures auxquelles il est fait allusion dans le prot\u00eat-invitation extrajudiciaire. Il a conclu qu\u2019Eurobank croyait que si elle ne se conformait pas au prot\u00eat-invitation extrajudiciaire, ses employ\u00e9s et elle s\u2019exposaient \u00e0 un gel partiel de leurs avoirs de m\u00eame qu\u2019\u00e0 des sanctions p\u00e9nales, pouvant aller jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019emprisonnement, dans le cas des repr\u00e9sentants de la banque.\n[34] Le jour suivant la signification du prot\u00eat\u2011invitation extrajudiciaire, Eurobank a pay\u00e9 le MDG au titre de la lettre de garantie grecque.\n[35] Le 27 d\u00e9cembre 2013, faisant suite \u00e0 des communications ant\u00e9rieures, Eurobank a demand\u00e9 le paiement \u00e0 la Banque Nationale au titre de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise. L\u2019avis \u00e0 la Banque Nationale rappelait que le MDG avait demand\u00e9 le paiement de 13 868 354,40 $ US au titre de la lettre de garantie et indiquait que, [traduction] \u00ab [p]ar cons\u00e9quent, [la Banque Nationale est] en d\u00e9faut de paiement aux termes de la contre\u2011garantie susmentionn\u00e9e \u00bb pour la m\u00eame somme, \u00e0 laquelle s\u2019ajoutent frais et int\u00e9r\u00eats (d.a., vol. VI, p. 148).\nG. La sentence arbitrale finale de la CCI et les proc\u00e9dures ult\u00e9rieures\n[36] Dans sa sentence arbitrale finale, le tribunal arbitral de la CCI a conclu que le contrat de compensation \u00e9tait contraire au droit de l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne. Il \u00e9tait donc nul et sans effet ab initio, et de ce fait, aucuns dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats liquid\u00e9s n\u2019\u00e9taient dus. Cette sentence a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e par la Cour d\u2019appel de Paris.\n[37] Dans les semaines qui ont suivi, le juge Schrager, qui si\u00e9geait alors \u00e0 la Cour sup\u00e9rieure du Qu\u00e9bec, a prononc\u00e9 une ordonnance de sauvegarde \u00e0 la demande de Bombardier. Le juge Schrager a conclu que la conduite du MDG \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab manifestement abusive et frauduleuse \u00bb et que la pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseure d\u2019Eurobank avait agi \u00ab en toute connaissance des faits \u00bb (2014 QCCS 181, par. 43 et 46 (CanLII)). Il s\u2019agissait selon lui [traduction] \u00ab d\u2019une fraude ou \u00e0 tout le moins de la participation [. . .] \u00e0 une fraude \u00bb, de la part de la banque grecque, qui \u00ab viciait suffisamment \u00bb les demandes de paiement au titre de la lettre qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise (par. 46\u201147). S\u2019appuyant sur l\u2019arr\u00eat Angelica\u2011Whitewear, le juge Schrager a interdit \u00e0 la Banque Nationale de payer Eurobank au titre de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie. L\u2019ordonnance de sauvegarde a par la suite \u00e9t\u00e9 prorog\u00e9e jusqu\u2019au prononc\u00e9 du jugement sur le fond.\n[38] L\u2019action sur le fond de Bombardier visant l\u2019obtention d\u2019une injonction \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la demande de paiement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Eurobank au titre de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie s\u2019est rendue \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape du proc\u00e8s devant la Cour sup\u00e9rieure. Cette instance est \u00e0 l\u2019origine du pr\u00e9sent pourvoi.\n[39] Dans sa requ\u00eate introductive d\u2019instance modifi\u00e9e, Bombardier sollicitait l\u2019homologation de la sentence rendue par le tribunal arbitral de la CCI ainsi qu\u2019une injonction permanente interdisant \u00e0 la Banque Nationale de payer Eurobank au titre de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie. Les arguments de Bombardier reposaient sur deux fondements, lesquels demeurent en litige devant notre Cour.\n[40] Premi\u00e8rement, le lien entre Eurobank et la conduite frauduleuse du MDG en tant que b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie rend la fraude imputable \u00e0 Eurobank comme s\u2019il s\u2019agissait de la sienne, de sorte que la Banque Nationale ne devrait pas honorer la demande de paiement d\u2019Eurobank. Bombardier soutient que l\u2019exception de fraude s\u2019applique \u00e0 Eurobank en tant que b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de la lettre qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise. \u00c0 son avis, puisque la conduite du MDG \u00e9tait frauduleuse, la demande de paiement d\u2019Eurobank au titre de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie est, par extension, \u00e9galement frauduleuse. Plus particuli\u00e8rement, Eurobank \u00e9tait au courant de la fraude du MDG relativement \u00e0 la lettre de garantie et a tout de m\u00eame exig\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre pay\u00e9e en vertu de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie. Pour Bombardier, \u00e0 laquelle se joint la Banque Nationale, cela signifie que la fraude devrait \u00eatre imput\u00e9e, par extension, \u00e0 Eurobank, de sorte que cette derni\u00e8re ne peut exiger que la Banque Nationale honore son engagement \u00e0 payer au titre de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie.\n[41] Deuxi\u00e8mement, et de fa\u00e7on subsidiaire, Bombardier soutient que les lettres de cr\u00e9dit sont nulles. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que le contrat de compensation est nul parce qu\u2019il viole le droit de l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne, il en va de m\u00eame pour les lettres de cr\u00e9dit qui s\u2019y rattachent, y compris la lettre de contre\u2011garantie.\n[42] Dans le cadre des recours intent\u00e9s devant les tribunaux grecs en parall\u00e8le \u00e0 ceux intent\u00e9s devant les tribunaux qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, Eurobank a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 recouvrer les sommes qu\u2019elle avait vers\u00e9es au MDG. Le 29 novembre 2019, la cour grecque de premi\u00e8re instance a ordonn\u00e9 au MDG de rembourser \u00e0 Eurobank le montant qu\u2019elle avait vers\u00e9 au titre de la lettre de garantie, plus les int\u00e9r\u00eats. La Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ath\u00e8nes a accueilli l\u2019appel de cette ordonnance apr\u00e8s le prononc\u00e9 du jugement de premi\u00e8re instance de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure du Qu\u00e9bec. Eurobank a demand\u00e9 que le jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ath\u00e8nes soit admis en tant que nouvel \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve devant la Cour d\u2019appel du Qu\u00e9bec. Cette requ\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 accueillie. Au moment de l\u2019audience devant notre Cour, un autre appel \u00e9tait pendant devant la Cour supr\u00eame de la Gr\u00e8ce.\n[43] \u00c0 la suite de l\u2019audience, la Cour supr\u00eame de la Gr\u00e8ce a rendu son jugement, qui confirmait en substance la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ath\u00e8nes. Pendant que le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi \u00e9tait en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9, Eurobank a demand\u00e9 et obtenu l\u2019autorisation de pr\u00e9senter le jugement de la Cour supr\u00eame de la Gr\u00e8ce en tant que nouvel \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve dans le cadre du pr\u00e9sent pourvoi. Bombardier et la Banque Nationale ont contest\u00e9 la requ\u00eate, soutenant en particulier que le jugement de la Cour supr\u00eame de la Gr\u00e8ce n\u2019avait qu\u2019une \u00ab faible pertinence \u00bb pour les questions en appel et que, par cons\u00e9quent, le crit\u00e8re permettant la pr\u00e9sentation de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve en appel n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 rempli. Je ne suis pas de cet avis. Il suffit que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve additionnels propos\u00e9s portent sur une question \u00ab potentiellement \u00bb d\u00e9cisive \u2014 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la nature de la conduite du MDG \u2014 pour que le crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Palmer c. La Reine, [1980] 1 R.C.S. 759 (voir aussi Barendregt c. Grebliunas, 2022 CSC 22, par. 29) soit respect\u00e9. La requ\u00eate ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 accueillie, je compte examiner la valeur probante de ces nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve en appel.\nIII. Historique judiciaire\nA. Cour sup\u00e9rieure du Qu\u00e9bec, 2018 QCCS 2127 (le juge Wery)\n[44] Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a conclu que les tribunaux qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois avaient comp\u00e9tence pour trancher le diff\u00e9rend relatif \u00e0 la lettre de contre\u2011garantie ainsi que pour homologuer, \u00e0 titre accessoire \u00e0 cette lettre, la sentence arbitrale finale. Il a homologu\u00e9 la sentence arbitrale et ordonn\u00e9 au MDG de s\u2019y conformer.\n[45] Quant \u00e0 la question de savoir s\u2019il fallait interdire \u00e0 la Banque Nationale, en tant qu\u2019\u00e9mettrice de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie, de payer Eurobank, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a examin\u00e9 l\u2019argument de Bombardier selon lequel l\u2019exception de fraude s\u2019appliquait. Pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette question, il s\u2019est demand\u00e9 si Eurobank, en tant que banque \u00e9mettrice de la lettre de garantie, avait effectu\u00e9 le paiement au MDG en raison de la fraude commise par celui\u2011ci.\n[46] Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a conclu que la mani\u00e8re dont le MDG avait obtenu paiement au titre de la lettre de garantie \u00e9tait frauduleuse. Il a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019argument d\u2019Eurobank selon lequel elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 forc\u00e9e d\u2019effectuer le paiement en raison de menaces du MDG. La conduite d\u2019Eurobank avait \u00e9t\u00e9 elle-m\u00eame frauduleuse puisque son paiement au MDG r\u00e9sultait d\u2019une fraude dont elle avait connaissance. Ultimement, selon lui, [traduction] \u00ab Eurobank n\u2019a peut\u2011\u00eatre pas con\u00e7u le complot frauduleux et n\u2019a peut\u2011\u00eatre pas fourni les armes, mais elle a certainement aid\u00e9 \u00e0 appuyer sur la d\u00e9tente \u00bb (par. 205 (CanLII)). Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a affirm\u00e9 que la conduite d\u2019Eurobank \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab assimilable \u00e0 de la \u201cfraude\u201d \u00bb, faisant remarquer qu\u2019\u00ab [a]pr\u00e8s avoir donn\u00e9 suite \u00e0 la fraude du MDG, Eurobank ne peut se disculper ni demander paiement aupr\u00e8s de [la Banque Nationale]. Fraus omnia corrumpit \u00bb (par. 214).\n[47] Enfin, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a conclu qu\u2019il [traduction] \u00ab est difficile d\u2019accepter, en droit, que l\u2019invalidit\u00e9 ab initio du contrat de compensation [. . .] n\u2019emporte pas l\u2019invalidit\u00e9 des instruments qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mis afin de garantir les obligations d\u00e9coulant dudit contrat \u00bb (par. 237). \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que la lettre de garantie a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9e nulle par le tribunal arbitral de la CCI, il [traduction] \u00ab doit en \u00eatre de m\u00eame \u00bb pour la contre\u2011garantie et il \u00ab doit \u00eatre ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 la [Banque Nationale] de ne pas payer Eurobank \u00bb (par. 240).\n[48] Au bout du compte, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 la lettre de contre\u2011garantie nulle, et a interdit \u00e0 la Banque Nationale de payer toute somme au b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de la contre\u2011garantie. Il a homologu\u00e9 la sentence arbitrale finale du tribunal arbitral de la CCI et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le paiement effectu\u00e9 au MDG en vertu de la lettre de garantie n\u2019\u00e9tait pas exigible et ne pouvait justifier le paiement au titre de la contre\u2011garantie ni produire de cons\u00e9quences juridiques \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de Bombardier. Finalement, il a ordonn\u00e9 au MDG de se conformer \u00e0 la sentence arbitrale finale.\nB. Cour d\u2019appel du Qu\u00e9bec, 2022 QCCA 802 (les juges Mainville, Hamilton et Baudouin)\n(1) Le juge Mainville, avec l\u2019accord de la juge Baudouin\n[49] Dans un arr\u00eat majoritaire, la Cour d\u2019appel a accueilli l\u2019appel dans le seul but de biffer le paragraphe du jugement de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure ordonnant au MDG de se conformer \u00e0 la sentence arbitrale finale du tribunal arbitral de la CCI. \u00c9crivant au nom des juges majoritaires, le juge Mainville a confirm\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de premi\u00e8re instance \u00e0 tous les autres \u00e9gards. En particulier, la cour a interdit \u00e0 la Banque Nationale de payer Eurobank au titre de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie, qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9e nulle.\n[50] Tout d\u2019abord, les juges majoritaires ont convenu avec le juge de premi\u00e8re instance que les tribunaux qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois ont comp\u00e9tence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie. Toutefois, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance n\u2019aurait pas d\u00fb ordonner au MDG de se conformer \u00e0 la sentence arbitrale finale, puisque ce dernier n\u2019est pas domicili\u00e9 au Qu\u00e9bec. Les tribunaux qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois peuvent homologuer la sentence arbitrale de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle soit juridiquement contraignante au Qu\u00e9bec, mais ils ne peuvent ordonner qu\u2019elle ait un effet extraterritorial contraignant en Gr\u00e8ce.\n[51] Ensuite, les juges majoritaires n\u2019ont relev\u00e9 aucun motif permettant de modifier la conclusion du juge de premi\u00e8re instance selon laquelle la Banque Nationale devrait \u00eatre interdite de payer Eurobank \u00e0 titre de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie.\n[52] Devant la Cour d\u2019appel, Eurobank n\u2019a pas directement contest\u00e9 la conclusion qu\u2019il y avait eu fraude de la part du MDG. La contestation en ce sens provenait du MDG lui\u2011m\u00eame. Toutefois, comme ce dernier ne reconnaissait pas la comp\u00e9tence des tribunaux qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, il n\u2019avait pas interjet\u00e9 appel du jugement de premi\u00e8re instance. La Cour d\u2019appel n\u2019avait donc pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement saisie de sa contestation, laquelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e pour cette seule raison. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, aucune erreur r\u00e9visable n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9e dans la conclusion du juge de premi\u00e8re instance selon laquelle le MDG avait agi [traduction] \u00ab de mauvaise foi et de fa\u00e7on frauduleuse dans le but de contourner l\u2019ordonnance provisoire et la sentence arbitrale finale du tribunal arbitral de la CCI par tous les moyens \u00bb (par. 60 (CanLII)).\n[53] Par ailleurs, le fait qu\u2019un tribunal grec ait conclu que la conduite du MDG \u00e9tait conforme au droit grec ne mine pas la conclusion du juge de premi\u00e8re instance selon laquelle le MDG a agi frauduleusement. Les jugements \u00e9trangers n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 officiellement reconnus et n\u2019ont donc pas pour effet de [traduction] \u00ab lie[r] les tribunaux qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois \u00bb (par. 64). Le juge Mainville de la Cour d\u2019appel a reconnu que le jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ath\u00e8nes pouvait [traduction] \u00ab faire partie du dossier en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce \u00bb (par. 62). Toutefois, citant le principe \u00e9nonc\u00e9 au par. 3155(5) C.c.Q., il a soulign\u00e9 que les tribunaux qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois peuvent ne pas tenir compte d\u2019un jugement \u00e9tranger lorsque son r\u00e9sultat est manifestement incompatible avec l\u2019ordre public tel qu\u2019il est entendu dans les relations internationales. La conclusion du jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ath\u00e8nes \u00e9tait, \u00e0 son avis, manifestement incompatible avec l\u2019ordre public. Selon le juge Mainville, [traduction] \u00ab [i]l serait en fait curieux que la Cour ex\u00e9cute une d\u00e9cision \u00e9trang\u00e8re qui est totalement contraire aux jugements contraignants de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure et qui en fait fi et les \u00e9carte \u00bb (par. 68). En outre, l\u2019arr\u00eat rendu par la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ath\u00e8nes \u00ab appuie essentiellement la th\u00e8se selon laquelle l\u2019\u00c9tat grec peut faire fi en toute impunit\u00e9 de l\u2019ordonnance provisoire et de la sentence finale du tribunal arbitral de la CCI \u00bb (par. 69).\n[54] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par les repr\u00e9sentants d\u2019Eurobank au proc\u00e8s, le juge Mainville a conclu que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance pouvait conclure que la Banque Nationale n\u2019\u00e9tait pas tenue de payer Eurobank \u00e0 titre de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie. [traduction] \u00ab Il ne fait aucun doute en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce \u00bb, selon lui, \u00ab qu\u2019Eurobank avait une connaissance suffisante de la fraude avant de proc\u00e9der au paiement \u00bb (par. 71). Bien qu\u2019Eurobank ait pay\u00e9 le MDG \u00e0 la suite des menaces qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance avait conclu \u00e0 juste titre que cela ne la d\u00e9gageait pas de toute responsabilit\u00e9. La d\u00e9cision d\u2019Eurobank de payer \u00e9tait contraire aux ordonnances rendues par les tribunaux qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois et par le tribunal arbitral de la CCI. Des consid\u00e9rations judiciaires et d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public exigent que ces ordonnances soient confirm\u00e9es. Ordonner \u00e0 la Banque Nationale de payer au titre de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie reviendrait \u00e0 [traduction] \u00ab tol\u00e9rer que des parties \u00e9vitent un processus d\u2019arbitrage contraignant au moyen de la fraude et de menaces \u00bb et ferait perdre tout leur sens \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance provisoire et aux sentences finales du tribunal arbitral de la CCI (par. 76).\n(2) Le juge Hamilton, dissident\n[55] Le juge dissident aurait accueilli l\u2019appel, annul\u00e9 partiellement le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance et rejet\u00e9 l\u2019action.\n[56] Le juge Hamilton a rejet\u00e9 les arguments d\u2019Eurobank fond\u00e9s sur l\u2019absence de comp\u00e9tence des tribunaux qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie et a choisi de ne pas formuler de commentaires sur leur pouvoir d\u2019ordonner au MDG de se conformer \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance du tribunal arbitral de la CCI.\n[57] Au sujet de la demande de paiement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le MDG au titre de la lettre de garantie, il a \u00e9crit que la conduite du MDG \u00e9tait, [traduction] \u00ab en un mot, d\u00e9plorable \u00bb (par. 164).\n[58] Le juge dissident a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019examen de chacun des six points dont le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a tenu compte pour conclure que la conduite du MDG constituait une fraude. \u00c0 son avis, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a commis des erreurs dans chaque conclusion sauf une. Plus particuli\u00e8rement, le juge dissident a affirm\u00e9 que le MDG avait le droit de retirer son engagement de ne pas demander de paiement au titre de la lettre de garantie \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que cet engagement n\u2019avait pas de [traduction] \u00ab dur\u00e9e pr\u00e9cise \u00bb (par. 177). Il a conclu que les ordonnances provisoires du tribunal arbitral, y compris l\u2019ordonnance proc\u00e9durale no 11, ne liaient pas le MDG parce qu\u2019aucun tribunal ne les avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ex\u00e9cutoires. Ces ordonnances \u00e9taient contractuellement contraignantes pour le MDG, mais [traduction] \u00ab [l]a violation de l\u2019ordonnance par le MDG constitue [. . .] une violation de contrat, [. . .] pas une violation de la loi \u00bb (par. 184). Quant \u00e0 la qualification de la conduite du MDG d\u2019\u00ab intimidation juridique \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019endroit d\u2019Eurobank, le juge dissident a \u00e9crit qu\u2019il n\u2019y a [traduction] \u00ab rien de frauduleux \u00bb dans le fait de menacer d\u2019imposer des sanctions conformes au droit grec en cas de d\u00e9faut de paiement (par. 192).\n[59] De l\u2019avis du juge dissident, cependant, le fait que le MDG, apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u la sentence arbitrale finale, ait continu\u00e9 de refuser de rembourser la somme qu\u2019il avait obtenue au titre de la lettre de garantie \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab r\u00e9v\u00e9lateur d\u2019une fraude \u00bb (par. 200). Il a ensuite \u00e9crit : [traduction] \u00ab . . . les demandes de paiement urgentes effectu\u00e9es dans les jours pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant la sentence arbitrale finale, par laquelle le MDG s\u2019attendait \u00e0 \u00eatre d\u00e9bout\u00e9, et l\u2019intention de ce dernier de conserver l\u2019argent quelle que soit la sentence arbitrale finale, suffisent pour conclure que la demande de paiement du MDG pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e le 18 d\u00e9cembre 2013 \u00e9tait frauduleuse \u00bb (par. 201).\n[60] Le juge dissident a n\u00e9anmoins d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas tenir Eurobank responsable de la fraude. M\u00eame si Eurobank savait que la demande du MDG avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite juste avant le prononc\u00e9 de la sentence arbitrale finale, elle ne savait pas que le MDG s\u2019attendait \u00e0 \u00eatre d\u00e9bout\u00e9 ou qu\u2019il avait l\u2019intention de conserver les fonds m\u00eame s\u2019il \u00e9tait d\u00e9bout\u00e9. Bien qu\u2019Eurobank ait pu soup\u00e7onner l\u2019existence d\u2019une fraude, [traduction] \u00ab de tels soup\u00e7ons [. . .] ne devraient pas \u00eatre assimil\u00e9s \u00e0 la connaissance de l\u2019existence d\u2019une fraude \u00bb (par. 218).\n[61] En d\u00e9finitive, il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas, sur la base de simples soup\u00e7ons, [traduction] \u00ab clair et \u00e9vident \u00bb pour Eurobank que la demande de paiement du MDG \u00e9tait frauduleuse (par. 223). Eurobank n\u2019a donc pas pay\u00e9 en ayant connaissance de la fraude, ce qui fait qu\u2019elle a droit d\u2019\u00eatre pay\u00e9e par la Banque Nationale en vertu de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie.\nIV. Questions en litige et moyens d\u2019appel\n[62] La question dont notre Cour est saisie consiste \u00e0 savoir si la Banque Nationale est tenue de refuser la demande de paiement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Eurobank aux termes de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise. La Cour doit d\u00e9terminer si les juridictions inf\u00e9rieures ont commis une erreur en d\u00e9cidant que l\u2019exception de fraude s\u2019applique \u00e0 Eurobank, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la conduite r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible du MDG, de sorte que la Banque Nationale doit \u00eatre interdite d\u2019honorer la demande de paiement. Subsidiairement, une deuxi\u00e8me question est soulev\u00e9e : Les juridictions inf\u00e9rieures ont\u2011elles commis une erreur en d\u00e9cidant que le paiement n\u2019est pas exigible parce que la lettre de contre\u2011garantie est nulle au motif que le contrat sous-jacent de compensation a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 nul par le tribunal arbitral de la CCI?\n[63] Devant notre Cour, Eurobank soutient que la conduite du MDG ne constitue pas de la fraude parce que les tribunaux grecs ont confirm\u00e9 son droit de demander d\u2019\u00eatre pay\u00e9 en vertu de la lettre de garantie. Malgr\u00e9 les ordonnances du tribunal arbitral de la CCI, la demande de paiement du MDG n\u2019\u00e9tait pas r\u00e9v\u00e9latrice d\u2019une fraude, car les ordonnances provisoires ne peuvent pas \u00eatre homologu\u00e9es. La conduite du MDG constituait peut-\u00eatre une violation de contrat, mais pas un acte ill\u00e9gal (m.a., par. 74\u201175).\n[64] M\u00eame si on conclut que le MDG a agi frauduleusement, Eurobank affirme qu\u2019elle ne pouvait pas le savoir \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que [traduction] \u00ab la juridiction comp\u00e9tente \u2014 la Cour grecque \u2014 avait confirm\u00e9 le contraire \u00bb (m.a., par. 88). Enfin, sa d\u00e9cision d\u2019honorer les demandes du MDG avait \u00e9t\u00e9 prise sous la menace et, par cons\u00e9quent, ne pouvait pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme frauduleuse.\n[65] \u00c0 la vue des moyens des parties, il semble que celles-ci aient, par moments, perdu de vue les questions dont la Cour a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment saisie. Une grande partie du d\u00e9bat en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce s\u2019articulait autour de la question de savoir si la conduite du MDG relativement \u00e0 la lettre de garantie constituait de la fraude en droit qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. Or, la lettre de garantie n\u2019est pas assujettie au droit qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. Et bien que les deux lettres soient interd\u00e9pendantes, le MDG est en th\u00e9orie un \u00e9tranger \u2014 un tiers \u2014 \u00e0 la lettre de contre\u2011garantie, qui se trouve \u00e0 \u00eatre la lettre de cr\u00e9dit en litige devant notre Cour.\n[66] La v\u00e9ritable question consiste \u00e0 savoir si, en droit qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, la conduite du MDG relative \u00e0 la lettre de contre\u2011garantie qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 ce que le juge Le Dain a appel\u00e9 la \u00ab fraude d\u2019un tiers \u00bb dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Angelica\u2011Whitewear. Dans l\u2019affirmative, la question qui se pose ensuite est de savoir si cette fraude d\u2019un tiers peut \u00eatre imput\u00e9e \u00e0 Eurobank, en tant que partie \u00e0 cette lettre de cr\u00e9dit et b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de celle\u2011ci, de sorte que l\u2019exception de fraude s\u2019applique. Si c\u2019est le cas, il faut interdire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9metteur, la Banque Nationale, d\u2019effectuer le paiement.\nV. Analyse\nA. Le droit relatif aux lettres de cr\u00e9dit au Canada\n[67] Une lettre de cr\u00e9dit est un instrument consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant autonome par rapport au contrat sous\u2011jacent auquel il se rattache, qu\u2019une institution financi\u00e8re \u00e9met \u00e0 la demande de son client. Elle conf\u00e8re \u00e0 son b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire le droit d\u2019\u00eatre pay\u00e9 sur pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019une demande \u00e0 cet effet aupr\u00e8s de la banque \u00e9mettrice, pour autant que cette demande soit conforme aux exigences \u00e9tablies dans la lettre de cr\u00e9dit. En r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le client conclut avec l\u2019institution financi\u00e8re un contrat visant l\u2019\u00e9mission d\u2019une lettre de cr\u00e9dit afin de donner au b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire l\u2019assurance que le contrat sous-jacent sera ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 promis. Sur pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019une demande valide, l\u2019institution financi\u00e8re a l\u2019obligation quasi absolue de payer. Il n\u2019y a qu\u2019une seule exception reconnue en droit canadien : lorsqu\u2019une fraude de la part du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire est port\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019attention de l\u2019institution financi\u00e8re avant le paiement, comme il est expliqu\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Angelica\u2011Whitewear.\n[68] Certaines lettres de cr\u00e9dit sont utilis\u00e9es pour faciliter le paiement associ\u00e9 \u00e0 une transaction, agissant alors [traduction] \u00ab comme moyen de transf\u00e9rer des fonds d\u2019une juridiction \u00e0 une autre \u00bb (K. McGuinness, The Law of Guarantee (3e \u00e9d. 2013), \u00a716.20; voir aussi Crawford and Falconbridge, Banking and Bills of Exchange (8e \u00e9d. 1986), par B. Crawford, p. 838; N. L\u2019Heureux et M. Lacoursi\u00e8re, Droit bancaire (5e \u00e9d. 2017), p. 399\u2011400). Ces lettres de cr\u00e9dit, souvent appel\u00e9es \u00ab lettres de cr\u00e9dit documentaires \u00bb, sont habituellement le principal mode de paiement dans la transaction. Cependant, on voit de plus en plus une autre sorte de lettre de cr\u00e9dit, qui [traduction] \u00ab a [fait son apparition] il y a \u00e0 peine quelques d\u00e9cennies \u00bb et qu\u2019on appelle \u00ab lettre de cr\u00e9dit standby \u00bb, \u00eatre employ\u00e9e comme \u00ab moyen pour garantir l\u2019ex\u00e9cution d\u2019une obligation \u00bb plut\u00f4t que comme principal mode de paiement (McGuinness, \u00a716.43). Les auteurs L\u2019Heureux et Lacoursi\u00e8re expliquent que \u00ab [l]a lettre de cr\u00e9dit stand-by est une lettre de cr\u00e9dit dont la fonction habituelle est de servir de garantie. Son but est donc diff\u00e9rent de la lettre de cr\u00e9dit documentaire traditionnelle qui constitue un instrument de paiement \u00bb (p. 434).\n[69] Je note que les parties et les juridictions inf\u00e9rieures ont surtout parl\u00e9 de la lettre de garantie et de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie simplement comme des \u00ab lettres de cr\u00e9dit \u00bb, bien qu\u2019ils aient utilis\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019occasion d\u2019autres termes, comme \u00ab guarantee \u00bb et \u00ab counter\u2011standby \u00bb (\u00ab garantie \u00bb et \u00ab lettre de contre\u2011garantie standby \u00bb (voir, p. ex., d.a., vol. VI, p. 83)). Lorsqu\u2019une lettre de cr\u00e9dit est utilis\u00e9e comme moyen de garantir l\u2019ex\u00e9cution d\u2019une obligation contractuelle, elle peut \u00eatre appel\u00e9e \u00ab lettre de cr\u00e9dit standby \u00bb (voir G. B. Graham et B. Geva, \u00ab Standby Credits in Canada \u00bb (1984), 9 Rev. can. dr. comm. 180, p. 183). Le terme \u00ab garantie sur demande \u00bb est utilis\u00e9 \u00e0 des fins semblables, particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique du Nord (voir McGuinness, \u00a73.87\u20113.88 et 16.51\u201116.52; voir aussi R. Goode, \u00ab Abstract Payment Undertakings in International Transactions \u00bb (1996), 22 Brook. J. Int\u2019l L. 1, p. 15). La diff\u00e9rence entre les garanties sur demande et les lettres de cr\u00e9dit standby a \u00e9t\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9e de [traduction] \u00ab largement illusoire ou, peut\u2011\u00eatre, d\u2019une nature s\u00e9mantique \u00bb (E. P. Ellinger, \u00ab Standby Letters of Credit \u00bb (1978), 6 I.B.L. 604, p. 622). Comme l\u2019a observ\u00e9 le professeur Roy Goode, [traduction] \u00ab d\u2019un point de vue juridique, il est impossible de diff\u00e9rencier les garanties sur demande des lettres de cr\u00e9dit standby, et ces derni\u00e8res rel\u00e8vent clairement de la d\u00e9finition de garantie sur demande pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019art. 2 [des R\u00e8gles uniformes relatives aux garanties sur demande] \u00bb (p. 16). Dans ce contexte, il n\u2019est pas inhabituel que les lettres de cr\u00e9dit standby soient assujetties aux R\u00e8gles uniformes relatives aux garanties sur demande, comme c\u2019est le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce (d.a., vol. IV, p. 118). La question de savoir laquelle des expressions \u00ab garanties sur demande \u00bb, \u00ab lettres de cr\u00e9dit \u00bb ou \u00ab lettres de cr\u00e9dit standby \u00bb d\u00e9crit le mieux la lettre de garantie et la lettre de contre-garantie n\u2019a aucune incidence sur l\u2019issue du pr\u00e9sent pourvoi.\n[70] Couramment employ\u00e9e dans des op\u00e9rations commerciales nationales et internationales, la lettre de cr\u00e9dit est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement utilis\u00e9e comme un outil de gestion du risque. En particulier, la lettre de cr\u00e9dit standby sert \u00e0 garantir que le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire obtiendra le paiement qu\u2019il s\u2019attend \u00e0 recevoir aux termes d\u2019un contrat sous\u2011jacent. La lettre de cr\u00e9dit ne remplace pas l\u2019obligation du client de payer le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire conform\u00e9ment au contrat sous-jacent; elle se superpose plut\u00f4t \u00e0 la transaction (L\u2019Heureux et Lacoursi\u00e8re, p. 399\u2011400). Les demandes de paiement surviennent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00e0 la suite d\u2019all\u00e9gations suivant lesquelles il y aurait eu [traduction] \u00ab omission, de la part du client ou du titulaire du compte, d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter certaines obligations conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu \u00bb (Crawford and Falconbridge, p. 838). Le principe qui s\u2019applique est [traduction] \u00ab payez maintenant, et argumentez plus tard si n\u00e9cessaire \u00bb (McGuinness, \u00a716.47).\n[71] Le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire peut trouver rassurant de savoir qu\u2019il sera pay\u00e9, \u00e0 moins de commettre une fraude, et que tout diff\u00e9rend \u00e9ventuel li\u00e9 au contrat sous\u2011jacent sera r\u00e9gl\u00e9 seulement une fois qu\u2019il aura re\u00e7u le paiement. Le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire n\u2019assume plus le risque de non\u2011paiement de la part du cocontractant. En revanche, l\u2019institution financi\u00e8re \u00e9mettrice assume le risque de ne pas \u00eatre pay\u00e9e par son client. Si le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire pr\u00e9sente une demande de paiement valide parce que le client de l\u2019institution \u00e9mettrice a manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 ses obligations pr\u00e9vues dans le contrat sous\u2011jacent, le client demeure tout de m\u00eame responsable de la violation du contrat et doit rembourser cette derni\u00e8re.\n[72] Bien que les lettres de cr\u00e9dit [traduction] \u00ab ne valent que ce que valent les institutions qui les \u00e9mettent \u00bb (McGuinness, \u00a716.53), le milieu des affaires en est venu \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer les lettres de cr\u00e9dit autonomes \u00e9mises par les banques r\u00e9put\u00e9es comme un moyen fiable de garantir le paiement au b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire. C\u2019est pourquoi les tribunaux [traduction] \u00ab h\u00e9sitent \u00e0 intervenir \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des lettres de cr\u00e9dit, \u00ab puisque des interventions judiciaires trop h\u00e2tives ou trop fr\u00e9quentes risqueraient de miner consid\u00e9rablement la fiabilit\u00e9 dont [ces lettres] jouissent dans les affaires commerciales internationales \u00bb (I. F. G. Baxter, The Law of Banking (4e \u00e9d. 1992), p. 172).\n(1) L\u2019autonomie et la stricte conformit\u00e9\n[73] Le droit qui r\u00e9git les lettres de cr\u00e9dit repose sur deux principes fondamentaux : l\u2019autonomie et la stricte conformit\u00e9 (L\u2019Heureux et Lacoursi\u00e8re, p. 403; voir aussi M. Deschamps, \u00ab Letters of Credit : The Autonomy Principle and the Fraud Exception \u00bb (2022), 38 B.F.L.R. 245, p. 249).\na) L\u2019autonomie de la lettre de cr\u00e9dit\n[74] L\u2019autonomie signifie que [traduction] \u00ab la lettre de cr\u00e9dit constitue une obligation ind\u00e9pendante de la banque \u00e9mettrice ou confirmatrice \u00bb (Crawford and Falconbridge, p. 853; voir aussi Angelica\u2011Whitewear, p. 70; L\u2019Heureux et Lacoursi\u00e8re, p. 403; Deschamps, p. 248). Comme l\u2019a fait remarquer la Cour d\u2019appel du Qu\u00e9bec, \u00ab [i]l est bien \u00e9tabli qu\u2019une lettre de cr\u00e9dit constitue un contrat autonome entre la banque \u00e9mettrice et le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire, et est d\u00e9finie par ses propres conditions, ind\u00e9pendamment du contrat entre le donneur d\u2019ordre et la banque \u00e9mettrice ou entre le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire et le donneur d\u2019ordre \u00bb (Groupe SM (International) Construction inc. c. Banque Nationale du Canada, 2013 QCCA 1118, par. 8 (CanLII)). L\u2019obligation de la banque \u00e9mettrice d\u2019honorer une demande de paiement valide est \u00ab ind\u00e9pendante de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du contrat sous\u2011jacent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard duquel le cr\u00e9dit a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 \u00bb (Angelica\u2011Whitewear, p. 70).\n[75] Dans une opinion qui mentionne l\u2019arr\u00eat Angelica\u2011Whitewear, la Cour d\u2019appel des \u00c9tats\u2011Unis pour le deuxi\u00e8me circuit a fait observer qu\u2019en raison du principe d\u2019autonomie, [traduction] \u00ab [l]a lettre de cr\u00e9dit impose ses propres r\u00e8gles \u00bb, ce qui \u00ab impr\u00e8gne l\u2019op\u00e9ration de cr\u00e9dit de simplicit\u00e9 et de certitude, principes qui la caract\u00e9risent \u00bb (Alaska Textile Co. c. Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A., 982 F.2d 813 (1992), p. 815). Le principe d\u2019autonomie conf\u00e8re aux lettres de cr\u00e9dit leur caract\u00e8re fiable; en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, l\u2019existence d\u2019un diff\u00e9rend li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du contrat de base ne justifie pas un refus de la banque d\u2019honorer le cr\u00e9dit. Dans un arr\u00eat de principe am\u00e9ricain qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9 par le juge Le Dain dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Angelica\u2011Whitewear, le tribunal a pris soin de rappeler que le principe de l\u2019autonomie ne devrait pas \u00eatre \u00e9cart\u00e9 \u00e0 la l\u00e9g\u00e8re : [traduction] \u00ab Ce serait une ing\u00e9rence malheureuse dans les op\u00e9rations commerciales si une banque, avant d\u2019honorer des traites tir\u00e9es sur elle, \u00e9tait oblig\u00e9e de v\u00e9rifier au\u2011del\u00e0 de l\u2019apparence les documents [. . .] ou m\u00eame \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 le faire et de s\u2019immiscer dans des controverses entre l\u2019acheteur et le vendeur . . . \u00bb (Sztejn c. J. Henry Schroder Banking Corp., 31 N.Y.S.2d 631 (Sup. Ct. 1941), p. 633).\n[76] Il s\u2019ensuit que [traduction] \u00ab le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire peut avoir l\u2019enti\u00e8re certitude que, quels que soient les diff\u00e9rends susceptibles de survenir par la suite entre lui et le client de la banque en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du contrat de base, voire \u00e0 son existence m\u00eame, la banque s\u2019engage \u00e0 le payer elle\u2011m\u00eame, pourvu que les conditions prescrites soient respect\u00e9es \u00bb (Bolivinter Oil S.A. c. Chase Manhattan Bank, [1984] 1 Lloyd\u2019s Rep. 251 (C.A. Angl.), p. 257). Bien entendu, le client de la banque pourrait ultimement avoir une cause d\u2019action contre le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire, mais l\u2019institution financi\u00e8re ne s\u2019en pr\u00e9occupe g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas puisque la lettre de cr\u00e9dit fait en sorte que le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire est pay\u00e9 entretemps. L\u2019institution financi\u00e8re \u00ab n\u2019a pas [. . .] \u00e0 se renseigner sur l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du contrat de base \u00bb puisque son obligation consiste simplement \u00e0 payer le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire sur pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019une demande valide (L\u2019Heureux et Lacoursi\u00e8re, p. 403).\nb) La stricte conformit\u00e9\n[77] La stricte conformit\u00e9 signifie que [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019obligation de la banque \u00e9mettrice doit \u00eatre \u00e9tablie uniquement en fonction de la stricte conformit\u00e9 de la pr\u00e9sentation (laquelle comprend la conformit\u00e9 des documents pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s) au regard des conditions de la lettre de cr\u00e9dit \u00bb (Deschamps, p. 248). Par cons\u00e9quent, lorsque le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire demande le paiement, l\u2019institution financi\u00e8re doit s\u2019assurer que ce dernier pr\u00e9sente des documents qui correspondent aux exigences \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans la lettre de cr\u00e9dit. La lettre de cr\u00e9dit [traduction] \u00ab est r\u00e9dig\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 d\u00e9finir la port\u00e9e et les conditions de l\u2019engagement de la banque \u00e9mettrice afin que celle\u2011ci n\u2019ait qu\u2019\u00e0 examiner les conditions de la lettre de cr\u00e9dit et les documents pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire \u00bb (OMERS Realty Corp. c. 7636156 Canada Inc. (Trustee in Bankruptcy of), 2020 ONCA 681, 153 O.R. (3d) 271, par. 42). Comme l\u2019a expliqu\u00e9 le juge Le Dain, la stricte conformit\u00e9 \u00ab exige non seulement que les documents pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s soient conformes aux conditions de la lettre de cr\u00e9dit, mais qu\u2019ils concordent en apparence entre eux \u00bb (Angelica\u2011Whitewear, p. 98).\n[78] Le crit\u00e8re \u00e0 appliquer n\u2019est pas celui de la \u00ab conformit\u00e9 en substance \u00bb. Seuls les documents qui sont strictement conformes aux conditions de la lettre de cr\u00e9dit font na\u00eetre une obligation de payer (Crawford and Falconbridge, p. 856; voir aussi Angelica\u2011Whitewear, p. 96). Cela dit, il est possible de nuancer l\u00e9g\u00e8rement cette r\u00e8gle afin de rendre possible, dans les cas qui sont manifestement appropri\u00e9s, d\u2019ignorer les divergences n\u00e9gligeables (Angelica\u2011Whitewear, p. 97\u201198; voir aussi Universal Stainless Steel & Alloys Inc. c. JP Morgan Chase Bank, 2009 ONCA 801, 256 O.A.C. 109).\n[79] Le juge Le Dain a \u00e9crit que \u00ab [l]a r\u00e8gle fondamentale porte que, apr\u00e8s un examen raisonnablement attentif, les documents doivent pr\u00e9senter une apparence de conformit\u00e9 avec les conditions de la lettre de cr\u00e9dit \u00bb (Angelica\u2011Whitewear, p. 94 (en italique dans l\u2019original)). Un \u00ab examen raisonnablement attentif \u00bb n\u2019exige pas la perfection. La Cour d\u2019appel de Singapour, faisant r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la m\u00eame id\u00e9e, a affirm\u00e9 que cette r\u00e8gle vise [traduction] \u00ab \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger la banque et \u00e0 assurer le bon fonctionnement du commerce international tout en \u00e9vitant les retards \u00bb (Beam Technology (Mfg) Pte Ltd c. Standard Chartered Bank, [2002] SGCA 53, [2003] 1 S.L.R. 597, par. 32). Cela dit, si l\u2019institution financi\u00e8re paye le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire sans examiner les documents pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s afin de s\u2019assurer qu\u2019ils sont strictement conformes aux exigences \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans la lettre de cr\u00e9dit, elle court le risque de ne pas \u00eatre rembours\u00e9e par son client (L\u2019Heureux et Lacoursi\u00e8re, p. 404).\n(2) L\u2019exception de fraude opposable \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie des lettres de cr\u00e9dit\n[80] Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9, l\u2019obligation qui incombe \u00e0 l\u2019institution financi\u00e8re \u00e9mettrice de payer le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire sur r\u00e9ception d\u2019une demande \u00e0 cet effet est quasi absolue. Il n\u2019y a qu\u2019une seule exception reconnue : lorsqu\u2019une \u00ab fraude de la part du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire du cr\u00e9dit a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e suffisamment \u00e0 la connaissance de la banque avant le paiement de la traite ou d\u00e9montr\u00e9e devant un tribunal auquel le client de la banque a demand\u00e9 de d\u00e9livrer une injonction interlocutoire pour emp\u00eacher la banque d\u2019honorer la traite \u00bb (Angelica\u2011Whitewear, p. 71).\n[81] Le juge Le Dain a pris soin de noter que \u00ab [l]a port\u00e9e potentielle de l\u2019exception de fraude ne doit pas constituer un moyen pour cr\u00e9er une incertitude et un manque de confiance graves dans le fonctionnement d\u2019op\u00e9rations par lettres de cr\u00e9dit et, en m\u00eame temps, l\u2019application du principe de l\u2019autonomie ne doit pas servir \u00e0 encourager ou \u00e0 faciliter la fraude dans ces op\u00e9rations \u00bb (p. 72). Pour atteindre cet \u00e9quilibre, la norme en mati\u00e8re de fraude \u00e9tablie dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Angelica\u2011Whitewear est exigeante, ce qui permet, comme l\u2019a affirm\u00e9 l\u2019intervenante en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, d\u2019en arriver \u00e0 une [traduction] \u00ab r\u00e9partition ad\u00e9quate du risque entre les \u00e9metteurs de lettres de garantie [. . .] et les entreprises participantes qui sont parties \u00e0 l\u2019op\u00e9ration sous\u2011jacente \u00bb (m. interv., par. 31).\n[82] L\u2019exception de fraude s\u2019applique tout autant lorsqu\u2019une seconde lettre de cr\u00e9dit est \u00e9mise par une institution financi\u00e8re qui s\u2019engage \u00e0 payer sur pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019une attestation qu\u2019une demande de paiement a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e au titre de la premi\u00e8re lettre de cr\u00e9dit. Comme le font observer les professeurs L\u2019Heureux et Lacoursi\u00e8re, la banque \u00e9mettrice de la contre\u2011garantie doit faire le paiement au b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire lorsque celui\u2011ci atteste avoir re\u00e7u une demande de paiement au titre de la premi\u00e8re lettre de garantie. Ils expliquent que l\u2019obligation de la banque \u00e9mettrice d\u2019une contre\u2011garantie peut cependant faire l\u2019objet de l\u2019exception de fraude de la part du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire : \u00ab Seuls la fraude \u00e9vidente ou un abus manifeste constituent un obstacle au paiement de la garantie par la banque qui doit prendre la d\u00e9cision de payer ou de ne pas payer \u00bb (p. 433).\n[83] L\u2019intervenante affirme que, dans les op\u00e9rations impliquant des contre\u2011garanties, les tiers adoptent parfois une conduite frauduleuse. La fraude de la part d\u2019un tiers \u00e0 une contre\u2011garantie n\u2019emp\u00eache pas l\u2019application de l\u2019exception de fraude \u00e0 la contre\u2011garantie elle\u2011m\u00eame [traduction] \u00ab lorsque le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire d\u2019une lettre de contre\u2011garantie serait l\u2019auteur d\u2019une fraude claire et \u00e9vidente \u00bb (m. interv., par. 26, note 32). Je suis d\u2019accord pour dire que la conduite du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire d\u2019une contre\u2011garantie peut le rendre imputable de la fraude commise par un tiers. Dans un tel cas, l\u2019exception de fraude s\u2019applique directement \u00e0 la demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire.\n[84] Bien que l\u2019arr\u00eat Angelica\u2011Whitewear portait d\u2019abord sur le droit qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, le juge Le Dain a soulign\u00e9 que l\u2019exception de fraude opposable \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie des lettres de cr\u00e9dit est la m\u00eame dans les syst\u00e8mes de common law et de droit civil au Canada. Elle repose sur l\u2019id\u00e9e commune \u00ab exprim\u00e9[e] en droit civil par la maxime fraus omnia corrumpit et en common law par la maxime ex turpi causa non oritur actio \u00bb (p. 82). Selon le juge Le Dain, ce fondement commun \u00e0 l\u2019exception de fraude met en \u00e9vidence le fait qu\u2019il est \u00ab souhaitable d\u2019en arriver \u00e0 la plus grande uniformit\u00e9 possible du droit relativement \u00e0 ces effets vitaux pour le commerce international \u00bb (p. 83). De fait, les tribunaux partout au Canada ont appliqu\u00e9 le crit\u00e8re \u00e9labor\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Angelica\u2011Whitewear (Deschamps, p. 256; voir aussi OMERS Realty, par. 43) et des tribunaux de common law \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur du pays ont vu dans cet arr\u00eat une ressource utile (voir, p. ex., Alaska Textile (\u00c9tats\u2011Unis); Xing Fa (Hong Kong) Imp. & Exp. Ltd. c. Sungsan International Co., [2018] HKCFI 2743 (Hong Kong); Westpac New Zealand Ltd. c. MAP and Associates Ltd., [2011] NZSC 89, [2011] 3 N.Z.L.R. 751 (Nouvelle\u2011Z\u00e9lande)).\n[85] Je partage le point de vue du juge Le Dain quant \u00e0 l\u2019importance d\u2019un juste \u00e9quilibre entre le besoin de prot\u00e9ger l\u2019autonomie des lettres de cr\u00e9dit et celui de d\u00e9courager la fraude. L\u2019exception devrait \u00eatre suffisamment large pour comprendre la plupart des conduites frauduleuses qui ne devraient pas \u00eatre facilit\u00e9es au moyen des lettres de cr\u00e9dit. Par ailleurs, si l\u2019exception de fraude est trop large, les lettres de cr\u00e9dit pourraient devenir beaucoup moins fiables. La mise en balance de ces deux consid\u00e9rations requiert que la Cour retienne un crit\u00e8re exigeant en ce qui concerne la fraude, qui devrait \u00eatre \u00e9vidente pour qu\u2019une banque \u00e9mettrice refuse de payer en ex\u00e9cution d\u2019une lettre de cr\u00e9dit.\n[86] Le juge Le Dain a eu raison d\u2019affirmer que, de mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, l\u2019exception de fraude ne s\u2019applique pas \u00e0 la fraude commise par un tiers \u00e0 une lettre de cr\u00e9dit lorsque le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de la lettre est innocent de cette fraude. Accepter que la fraude d\u2019un tiers oblige la banque \u00e9mettrice \u00e0 refuser d\u2019honorer une demande de paiement en toutes circonstances \u00e9largirait l\u2019exception de fraude au d\u00e9triment de la fiabilit\u00e9 des lettres de cr\u00e9dit. Toutefois, le juge Le Dain a aussi pris soin de laisser place \u00e0 la possibilit\u00e9 que le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire ne soit pas \u00ab innocent \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la conduite r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible du tiers. \u00c0 tout le moins, le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire sera vraisemblablement innocent de la fraude commise par le tiers s\u2019il demande le paiement dans des circonstances o\u00f9 il n\u2019a pas connaissance de la fraude (voir L. Sarna, Letters of Credit : The Law and Current Practice (3e \u00e9d. (feuilles mobiles)), p. 5\u201156 et 5\u201157). Par contre, lorsque le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire est au courant de la fraude et qu\u2019il demande d\u2019\u00eatre pay\u00e9 tout en sachant que les conditions de paiement ne sont pas respect\u00e9es, on peut dire qu\u2019il a fait sienne cette fraude. Cela peut se produire dans les situations o\u00f9, comme c\u2019est le cas dans le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi, le tiers est lui\u2011m\u00eame partie \u00e0 une lettre de garantie interd\u00e9pendante d\u2019une lettre de contre\u2011garantie. Comme l\u2019affirme l\u2019intervenante, [traduction] \u00ab dans les cas o\u00f9 il est d\u00e9montr\u00e9 \u00e0 la connaissance de la banque \u00e9mettrice de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie que le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de celle\u2011ci avait une connaissance claire et \u00e9vidente de la fraude (commise par le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de la lettre de garantie principale), la banque \u00e9mettrice peut refuser de faire le paiement au titre de la contre\u2011garantie \u00bb (m. interv., par. 26).\n[87] Selon le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, c\u2019est ce dernier sc\u00e9nario qui s\u2019est produit en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Il a conclu que le MDG, un tiers \u00e0 la lettre de contre\u2011garantie, a commis une fraude \u00e0 titre de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de la lettre de garantie principale. Eurobank, la b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie, avait une connaissance claire et \u00e9vidente de cette fraude et a tout de m\u00eame demand\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre pay\u00e9e. Eurobank n\u2019est donc pas innocente de la fraude commise par le MDG. En tant qu\u2019\u00e9mettrice de la contre\u2011garantie, la Banque Nationale \u00e9tait au fait de cette situation avant d\u2019effectuer le paiement et ne devait donc pas honorer la demande de paiement au titre de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie. Je passe maintenant \u00e0 la contestation d\u2019Eurobank \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du sc\u00e9nario d\u00e9crit par le juge de premi\u00e8re instance et confirm\u00e9 en appel.\nB. Application\n[88] Devant notre Cour, Eurobank fait valoir que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, ainsi que les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel, ont commis une erreur en appliquant l\u2019exception de fraude.\n[89] En premier lieu, Eurobank affirme que les tribunaux grecs, qui avaient comp\u00e9tence pour trancher le litige concernant la lettre de garantie, ont conclu que le MDG n\u2019avait pas agi frauduleusement en demandant d\u2019\u00eatre pay\u00e9 en vertu de cette lettre de cr\u00e9dit. De plus, la conduite du MDG, bien que [traduction] \u00ab douteuse \u00bb, n\u2019\u00e9tait pas frauduleuse car il n\u2019y avait rien d\u2019\u00ab ill\u00e9gal \u00bb ou de \u00ab trompeur \u00bb dans sa demande de paiement (m.a., Eurobank, par. 64, 67 et 79). Le MDG appuie ce point de vue, faisant valoir que les tribunaux grecs ont jug\u00e9 que sa conduite relativement \u00e0 la lettre de garantie n\u2019\u00e9tait ni abusive ni frauduleuse, et que les jugements qu\u2019ils ont rendus ont \u00e9t\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab mal interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s, critiqu\u00e9s \u00e0 tort et compl\u00e8tement \u00e9cart\u00e9s \u00bb par les juridictions inf\u00e9rieures (m.a., MDG, par. 5).\n[90] En second lieu, Eurobank soutient que m\u00eame si l\u2019on concluait que le MDG a agi frauduleusement, la conduite de celui\u2011ci n\u2019a aucune incidence sur son droit, \u00e0 titre de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie, de demander d\u2019\u00eatre pay\u00e9 (m.a., par. 109). Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a commis une erreur en concluant qu\u2019Eurobank savait que la conduite du MDG constituait une fraude, car il n\u2019y avait pas un \u00ab iota \u00bb de preuve devant lui (par. 111). En outre, le principe d\u2019autonomie fait en sorte que la lettre de contre\u2011garantie est [traduction] \u00ab distincte \u00bb, et l\u2019exception de fraude doit \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de ce principe (par. 115).\n[91] Pour les motifs qui suivent, je ne suis pas d\u2019accord avec Eurobank et le MDG. Il est important de souligner qu\u2019Eurobank doit relever une erreur de droit ou une erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante de fait ou mixte de fait et de droit pour qu\u2019une intervention en appel soit justifi\u00e9e. En particulier, les cours d\u2019appel doivent garder \u00e0 l\u2019esprit qu\u2019il \u00ab n\u2019y a qu\u2019une seule et unique norme de contr\u00f4le applicable \u00e0 toutes les conclusions factuelles tir\u00e9es par le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, soit celle de l\u2019erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante \u00bb (voir Housen c. Nikolaisen, 2002 CSC 33, [2002] 2 R.C.S. 235, par. 25) et que, en l\u2019absence d\u2019une erreur de droit isolable, les questions mixtes de fait et de droit m\u00e9ritent le m\u00eame degr\u00e9 de d\u00e9f\u00e9rence. Comme je vais l\u2019expliquer, j\u2019estime qu\u2019Eurobank n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 relever une erreur r\u00e9visable.\n[92] Il est vrai que la lettre de garantie est r\u00e9gie par le droit grec et que les tribunaux grecs ont comp\u00e9tence pour d\u00e9cider si Eurobank \u00e9tait tenue de se conformer \u00e0 la demande de paiement du MDG. Par contre, les jugements grecs n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 officiellement reconnus par les tribunaux qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois suivant les r\u00e8gles relatives \u00e0 la reconnaissance et \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de d\u00e9cisions \u00e9trang\u00e8res qui sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9es au titre quatri\u00e8me du Livre dixi\u00e8me du Code civil du Qu\u00e9bec, portant sur le droit international priv\u00e9; ils sont donc inex\u00e9cutoires dans la province. En ce qui concerne la lettre de contre\u2011garantie r\u00e9gie par le droit qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, la demande de paiement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le MDG au titre de la lettre de cr\u00e9dit grecque est utile pour d\u00e9terminer si la conduite d\u2019Eurobank, en tant que b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie, fait intervenir l\u2019exception de fraude. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a conclu que le MDG avait demand\u00e9 un paiement auquel il n\u2019avait pas droit. \u00c0 mon avis, cela \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 une fraude commise par un tiers qui est pertinente en ce qui concerne la lettre de contre\u2011garantie. De plus, les conclusions du juge de premi\u00e8re instance selon lesquelles Eurobank \u00e9tait au courant de la fraude commise par le MDG et y a particip\u00e9 commandent la retenue. Je conclus, comme les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel, qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas lieu de modifier la d\u00e9cision du juge de premi\u00e8re instance portant que l\u2019exception de fraude s\u2019applique \u00e0 la lettre de contre\u2011garantie.\n[93] Le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie est Eurobank. L\u2019analyse visant \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si l\u2019exception de fraude trouve application doit porter sur la question de savoir si Eurobank, en tant que b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire, a commis une fraude qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019attention de la Banque Nationale.\n[94] Bien que la lettre de cr\u00e9dit soit autonome par rapport aux autres contrats en cause dans une transaction, l\u2019arr\u00eat Angelica\u2011Whitewear indique clairement que l\u2019exception de fraude peut s\u2019appliquer lorsqu\u2019il y a fraude dans la transaction, m\u00eame si celle\u2011ci a seulement des effets indirects sur la lettre de cr\u00e9dit (p. 72 et 84). Ceci peut inclure une fraude commise par un tiers. Le tiers peut par exemple \u00eatre une personne, autre que l\u2019\u00e9metteur ou le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire, qui a contrefait des documents qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 remis au b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire (voir, de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, United City Merchants (Investments) Ltd. c. Royal Bank of Canada, [1983] 1 A.C. 168 (H.L.)).\n[95] Dans le cas qui nous occupe, la port\u00e9e de la transaction est claire. Bien que la lettre de contre\u2011garantie soit une lettre de cr\u00e9dit autonome et de ce fait distincte de tout autre contrat, son texte m\u00eame indique qu\u2019elle fait partie d\u2019une transaction plus large. La lettre de contre\u2011garantie et la lettre de garantie sont, au vu de la lettre de cr\u00e9dit en litige en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, interd\u00e9pendantes. En effet, les quatre premiers paragraphes de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie reproduisent mot pour mot le texte de la lettre de garantie (d.a., vol. IV, p. 114\u2011115). Cette reproduction int\u00e9grale rappelle aux parties que la lettre de contre\u2011garantie s\u2019applique lorsqu\u2019une demande de paiement du MDG d\u00e9clenche l\u2019application de la lettre de garantie. Bien que le MDG soit en th\u00e9orie un tiers \u00e0 la lettre de contre\u2011garantie \u2014 n\u2019\u00e9tant ni l\u2019\u00e9metteur ni le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire \u2014, sa conduite est un fait sur la base duquel Eurobank peut pr\u00e9senter une demande de paiement. Comme l\u2019indique clairement le texte de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie, lorsque le MDG demande le paiement au titre de la lettre grecque, Eurobank acquiert le droit correspondant de demander le paiement en vertu de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie interd\u00e9pendante.\n[96] La lettre en litige \u00e9tablit de mani\u00e8re explicite le lien entre les deux lettres :\n[traduction] EN CONSID\u00c9RATION DE LA GARANTIE SUSMENTIONN\u00c9E QUE VOUS [c.\u2011\u00e0\u2011d.

Eurobank] AVEZ RE\u00c7U DE LA PART DU B\u00c9N\u00c9FICIAIRE DE VOTRE GARANTIE UNE DEMANDE DE PAIEMENT CONFORME AUX CONDITIONS DE VOTRE GARANTIE. [Je souligne.]\n(d.a., vol. IV, p. 118)\n[97] Dans l\u2019ensemble, le texte de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie indique clairement que la conduite du MDG en ce qui concerne la lettre de garantie s\u2019inscrit dans le contexte de la transaction, m\u00eame s\u2019il se trouve \u00e0 \u00eatre un tiers \u00e0 la lettre de contre\u2011garantie. En fait, la lettre de garantie est le contrat sous\u2011jacent \u00e0 la lettre de contre\u2011garantie, ce qui signifie que toute fraude concernant la lettre de garantie concerne directement la lettre de contre\u2011garantie. Si la fraude en question a \u00e9t\u00e9 commise par le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de la lettre de garantie \u2014 qui est un tiers \u00e0 la lettre de contre\u2011garantie \u2014, l\u2019exception de fraude peut s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 la lettre de contre\u2011garantie dans la mesure o\u00f9 son b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire n\u2019est pas \u00ab innocent \u00bb de la conduite frauduleuse (Angelica\u2011Whitewear, p. 84). Par cons\u00e9quent, le fait de demander d\u2019\u00eatre pay\u00e9 en ex\u00e9cution de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie par suite d\u2019une demande de paiement au titre de la lettre de garantie, que l\u2019on sait frauduleuse, constitue une fraude qui concerne la lettre de contre\u2011garantie.\n[98] Devant notre Cour, Eurobank maintient qu\u2019\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les tribunaux grecs ont conclu que le MDG n\u2019avait pas commis de fraude, les tribunaux qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois ne peuvent pas affirmer le contraire. La Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ath\u00e8nes et la Cour supr\u00eame de la Gr\u00e8ce ont statu\u00e9 que le MDG n\u2019\u00e9tait pas li\u00e9 par son engagement de s\u2019abstenir de demander le paiement au titre de la lettre de garantie ou par l\u2019ordonnance proc\u00e9durale no 11. L\u2019avocat d\u2019Eurobank est all\u00e9 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 soutenir que [traduction] \u00ab le d\u00e9bat [dans le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi] a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu th\u00e9orique par la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ath\u00e8nes \u00bb (transcription, p. 2). Bien qu\u2019Eurobank ait initialement reconnu devant la Cour d\u2019appel du Qu\u00e9bec que le MDG avait commis une fraude, elle affirme maintenant qu\u2019elle peut valablement se r\u00e9tracter \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que cette position est incompatible avec les jugements des tribunaux grecs.\n[99] Avec \u00e9gards, Eurobank a tort de dire que les jugements des tribunaux grecs ont quelque pertinence d\u00e9terminante en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[100] M\u00eame si les \u00ab jugements \u00e9trangers n\u2019ont pas force ex\u00e9cutoire par eux\u2011m\u00eames \u00bb (Kuwait Airways Corp. c. Irak, 2010 CSC 40, [2010] 2 R.C.S. 571, par. 20), ils peuvent \u00eatre reconnus et d\u00e9clar\u00e9s ex\u00e9cutoires en application des art. 3155 et suiv. C.c.Q. Un jugement \u00e9tranger qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu et ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 peut tout de m\u00eame \u00eatre re\u00e7u en preuve au Qu\u00e9bec. Dans un tel cas, comme l\u2019a d\u00fbment not\u00e9 le juge Mainville de la Cour d\u2019appel dans l\u2019arr\u00eat contest\u00e9, le jugement \u00e9tranger fournit une preuve prima facie des faits qu\u2019il rapporte et de la bonne application du droit \u00e9tranger, mais ne lie pas les tribunaux qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (voir, de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, C. Pich\u00e9, La preuve civile (6e \u00e9d. 2020), p. 259; G. Goldstein et E. Groffier, Droit international priv\u00e9, t. I, Th\u00e9orie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale (1998), no 155).\n[101] Lorsqu\u2019une partie demande la reconnaissance et l\u2019ex\u00e9cution d\u2019un jugement \u00e9tranger en application des art. 3155 et suiv. C.c.Q., il incombe \u00e0 la partie adverse de d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019une exception \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale voulant que les jugements \u00e9trangers devraient \u00eatre reconnus et ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s au Qu\u00e9bec s\u2019applique (Barer c. Knight Brothers LLC, 2019 CSC 13, [2019] 1 R.C.S. 573, par. 24).\n[102] Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, aucune partie n\u2019a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 obtenir la reconnaissance et l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des jugements grecs au Qu\u00e9bec. Il est possible que cela ait \u00e9t\u00e9 un choix d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 de la part d\u2019Eurobank compte tenu des difficult\u00e9s auxquelles elle aurait pu \u00eatre confront\u00e9e en raison de l\u2019exception relative \u00e0 l\u2019ordre public pr\u00e9vue au par. 3155(5) C.c.Q. et de la probabilit\u00e9 que les parties adverses la soul\u00e8vent. Cette exception s\u2019applique lorsque \u00ab la solution donn\u00e9e par le jugement \u00e9tranger \u00bb ne peut \u00ab s\u2019int\u00e9grer de mani\u00e8re harmonieuse dans l\u2019ordre juridique du for qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois \u00bb (R.S. c. P.R., 2019 CSC 49, [2019] 3 R.C.S. 643, par. 52). Comme l\u2019ont observ\u00e9 les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel du Qu\u00e9bec, dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, les jugements grecs, particuli\u00e8rement celui du juge Kostis de la Cour de premi\u00e8re instance \u00e0 juge unique d\u2019Ath\u00e8nes et celui de la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ath\u00e8nes, auraient pu soulever des pr\u00e9occupations relatives \u00e0 l\u2019ordre public en raison de leur incompatibilit\u00e9 avec les ordonnances pertinentes du tribunal arbitral de la CCI. Le juge Mainville a \u00e9crit que la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ath\u00e8nes [traduction] \u00ab appuie essentiellement la th\u00e8se selon laquelle l\u2019\u00c9tat grec peut faire fi en toute impunit\u00e9 de l\u2019ordonnance provisoire et de la sentence finale du tribunal arbitral de la CCI, m\u00eame s\u2019il s\u2019est officiellement engag\u00e9 \u00e0 se soumettre au processus d\u2019arbitrage \u00bb et a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une pr\u00e9occupation relative \u00e0 l\u2019ordre public (par. 69).\n[103] Le juge Mainville de la Cour d\u2019appel a expliqu\u00e9, en se fondant sur le par. 3155(5) et l\u2019art. 3081 C.c.Q., que les tribunaux qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois ne sont pas tenus d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter ou de reconna\u00eetre les jugements \u00e9trangers lorsque cela donne lieu \u00e0 un r\u00e9sultat manifestement incompatible avec l\u2019ordre public tel qu\u2019il est entendu dans les relations internationales. Je prends d\u00fbment acte de l\u2019analyse du juge Mainville sur ce point, qui est amplement \u00e9tay\u00e9e par la jurisprudence de notre Cour et la doctrine pertinente (R.S., par. 52\u201153; Beals c. Saldanha, 2003 CSC 72, [2003] 3 R.C.S. 416, par. 71\u201172; Goldstein et Groffier, no 166; S. Guillemard et V. A. Ly, \u00c9l\u00e9ments de droit international priv\u00e9 qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (2019), p. 64\u201166). En gardant \u00e0 l\u2019esprit que l\u2019exception relative \u00e0 l\u2019ordre public est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant plus limit\u00e9e aux termes de l\u2019art. 3155 C.c.Q., je tiens \u00e0 rappeler que cette question n\u2019a pas \u00e0 \u00eatre tranch\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce parce qu\u2019aucune demande de reconnaissance ou d\u2019ex\u00e9cution n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e.\n[104] \u00c0 d\u00e9faut d\u2019une demande de reconnaissance et d\u2019ex\u00e9cution accueillie, les jugements grecs constituent de simples \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui ne lient pas les tribunaux qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, et le poids qui leur est accord\u00e9 est une question de fait commandant la retenue en appel. Bien qu\u2019aucune des parties n\u2019ait express\u00e9ment fait valoir ce point, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019art. 2822 C.c.Q., un jugement \u00e9tranger peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9, en droit de la preuve, comme un acte semi\u2011authentique qui est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 faire preuve de son contenu et qui peut \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve au Qu\u00e9bec (voir Pich\u00e9, nos 341 et 345; Goldstein et Groffier, no 155). Comme l\u2019a not\u00e9 \u00e0 juste titre le juge Mainville, [traduction] \u00ab lorsque les jugements \u00e9trangers sont re\u00e7us en preuve sans avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 officiellement reconnus au Qu\u00e9bec, ils repr\u00e9sentent une preuve prima facie des faits qu\u2019ils rapportent, de la bonne application du droit \u00e9tranger et de la comp\u00e9tence du tribunal \u00e9tranger en la mati\u00e8re \u00bb (par. 64).\n[105] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Canadian Forest Navigation Co. c. Canada, 2017 CAF 39, une d\u00e9cision qu\u2019a invoqu\u00e9e le juge Mainville, le juge Boivin a expliqu\u00e9 que \u00ab [l]es conclusions de fait contenues dans [l]es jugements [\u00e9trangers] sont donc des faits auxquels un tribunal ne peut passer outre \u00bb, mais a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019id\u00e9e portant que \u00ab selon l\u2019article 2822 du C.c.Q., ces ordonnances \u00e9trang\u00e8res sont d\u00e9terminantes \u00bb (par. 15 et 19 (CanLII)). Le poids accord\u00e9 aux \u00ab ordonnances \u00e9trang\u00e8res en tant que faits \u00bb, ainsi que l\u2019a rappel\u00e9 le juge Boivin de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, est une question que doit trancher le juge des faits \u00ab en s\u2019appuyant sur la totalit\u00e9 de la preuve \u00e0 sa disposition \u00bb (par. 20; voir aussi Digiulian c. Succession de Digiulian, 2022 QCCA 531).\n[106] Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance et les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel avaient clairement conscience de cela et ont conclu que Bombardier s\u2019\u00e9tait acquitt\u00e9e de son fardeau. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance et la Cour d\u2019appel ont tous les deux express\u00e9ment consid\u00e9r\u00e9 le poids \u00e0 accorder \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision du juge Kostis en tant que faits. Le juge Mainville de la Cour d\u2019appel s\u2019est pench\u00e9 sur l\u2019importance de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ath\u00e8nes, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue apr\u00e8s le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance du juge Wery. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance s\u2019est express\u00e9ment demand\u00e9 quel poids devait \u00eatre accord\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision du juge Kostis, et a choisi de lui en donner aucun. Renvoyant express\u00e9ment \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision du juge Kostis, le juge Mainville a confirm\u00e9 cette conclusion et a lui aussi d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de n\u2019accorder [traduction] \u00ab aucun poids \u00bb \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ath\u00e8nes (par. 65). Je souligne qu\u2019il \u00ab n\u2019appartient pas aux cours d\u2019appel de remettre en question le poids attribu\u00e9 aux diff\u00e9rents \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00bb en l\u2019absence d\u2019une erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante (Housen, par. 23). Eurobank n\u2019a relev\u00e9 aucun fondement justifiant d\u2019intervenir \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des d\u00e9cisions des juridictions inf\u00e9rieures qui n\u2019accordent aucun poids aux jugements grecs en tant que preuve.\n[107] Par ailleurs, comme l\u2019a fait remarquer le juge Mainville, la d\u00e9cision de n\u2019accorder que peu ou pas de poids \u00e0 un jugement \u00e9tranger inex\u00e9cutoire peut \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e si la d\u00e9cision en question ne tient pas d\u00fbment compte de la jurisprudence canadienne pertinente ou si elle soul\u00e8ve d\u2019autres pr\u00e9occupations relatives \u00e0 l\u2019ordre public (voir par. 65 et 67\u201169; voir aussi Beals, par. 29). Bien que la courtoisie soit \u00ab un principe directeur utile \u00bb (Spar Aerospace Lt\u00e9e c. American Mobile Satellite Corp., 2002 CSC 78, [2002] 4 R.C.S. 205, par. 17), il importe de rappeler qu\u2019il s\u2019agit aussi d\u2019un \u00ab exercice de pond\u00e9ration \u00bb (Pro Swing Inc. c. Elta Golf Inc., 2006 CSC 52, [2006] 2 R.C.S. 612, par. 27). En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la conclusion des tribunaux \u00e9trangers selon laquelle une partie peut passer outre \u00e0 une ordonnance d\u2019un tribunal arbitral auquel elle avait accept\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre assujettie a \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur d\u00e9terminant (voir les motifs de la C.S., par. 176; motifs de la C.A., par. 69). Dans les circonstances, il \u00e9tait loisible aux juridictions inf\u00e9rieures de n\u2019accorder aucun poids aux d\u00e9cisions grecques, en les consid\u00e9rant comme de simples faits plut\u00f4t que comme des jugements ex\u00e9cutoires, lors de l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de la conduite du MDG et d\u2019Eurobank relative \u00e0 la lettre de contre\u2011garantie.\n[108] Pour les m\u00eames raisons que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance et les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel du Qu\u00e9bec concernant les d\u00e9cisions \u00e9trang\u00e8res qu\u2019ils ont examin\u00e9es, je suis d\u2019avis de ne pas accorder de force probante au jugement de la Cour supr\u00eame de la Gr\u00e8ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par Eurobank en tant qu\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve suppl\u00e9mentaire devant notre Cour. Je rappelle que le juge Mainville de la Cour d\u2019appel a not\u00e9 \u00e0 juste titre que la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ath\u00e8nes [traduction] \u00ab appuie essentiellement la th\u00e8se selon laquelle l\u2019\u00c9tat grec peut faire fi en toute impunit\u00e9 de l\u2019ordonnance provisoire et de la sentence finale du tribunal arbitral de la CCI, m\u00eame s\u2019il s\u2019est officiellement engag\u00e9 \u00e0 se soumettre au processus d\u2019arbitrage \u00bb (par. 69). La Cour supr\u00eame de la Gr\u00e8ce a apparemment confirm\u00e9 cette m\u00eame conclusion. Dans la traduction anglaise certifi\u00e9e conforme, o\u00f9 la Cour supr\u00eame de la Gr\u00e8ce cite le jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ath\u00e8nes en l\u2019approuvant, il est \u00e9crit que [traduction] \u00ab [d]ans la mesure o\u00f9 les prononc\u00e9s des ordonnances provisoires par la Cour internationale d\u2019arbitrage et la Cour sup\u00e9rieure du Qu\u00e9bec sont respectivement vis\u00e9s, lesquelles interdisent le paiement des lettres de garantie de fa\u00e7on provisoire, il convient de souligner que les d\u00e9cisions provisoires de la Cour internationale d\u2019arbitrage et du tribunal \u00e9tranger ne liaient pas l\u2019\u00c9tat grec \u00bb (requ\u00eate en production de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, p. 67).\n[109] Le jugement de la Cour supr\u00eame de la Gr\u00e8ce soul\u00e8ve donc exactement la m\u00eame pr\u00e9occupation concernant l\u2019ordre public que le jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ath\u00e8nes qui a men\u00e9 aux conclusions, tir\u00e9es respectivement par la Cour sup\u00e9rieure du Qu\u00e9bec et la Cour d\u2019appel du Qu\u00e9bec, selon lesquelles il y avait lieu de n\u2019accorder aucun poids aux d\u00e9cisions des tribunaux grecs. M\u00eame en tenant compte des nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, Eurobank n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer l\u2019existence d\u2019une erreur commise par les juridictions inf\u00e9rieures justifiant une intervention en appel. De plus, le jugement de la Cour supr\u00eame de la Gr\u00e8ce, qui traite de la conduite du MDG concernant la lettre de garantie au regard du droit grec, ne permet pas de d\u00e9terminer si la conduite de celui\u2011ci, en tant que tiers \u00e0 la lettre de contre\u2011garantie, \u00e9tait une fraude commise par un tiers selon les normes canadiennes \u00e9tablies dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Angelica\u2011Whitewear. Ce jugement n\u2019aide pas non plus \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si Eurobank \u00e9tait au courant de la fraude ou y a particip\u00e9 d\u2019une fa\u00e7on qui concerne sa demande de paiement au titre de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie. Le jugement de la Cour supr\u00eame de la Gr\u00e8ce soumis en preuve, comme les d\u00e9cisions grecques ant\u00e9rieures prises en compte par les juridictions inf\u00e9rieures, n\u2019a aucune force probante quant aux questions dont la Cour est maintenant saisie.\n[110] Bien que ces jugements puissent \u00eatre ex\u00e9cutoires en Gr\u00e8ce, comme je l\u2019ai indiqu\u00e9, la conduite du MDG au regard du droit grec n\u2019est pas en cause. En revanche, c\u2019est sa conduite au regard du droit qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois en ce qui concerne la lettre de contre\u2011garantie qui est directement vis\u00e9e par la demande d\u2019injonction que Bombardier a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la Cour sup\u00e9rieure afin d\u2019emp\u00eacher la Banque Nationale de faire le paiement. En l\u2019absence d\u2019un jugement \u00e9tranger ex\u00e9cutoire \u00e0 ce sujet, les tribunaux qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois \u00e9taient tenus de tirer leurs propres conclusions, en appliquant le droit qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, relativement \u00e0 la question de savoir si le MDG avait commis une fraude dans la transaction en tant que tiers \u00e0 la lettre de contre\u2011garantie.\n[111] Pour les motifs qui suivent, je suis d\u2019avis qu\u2019aucune erreur r\u00e9visable n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 relev\u00e9e dans la conclusion g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du juge de premi\u00e8re instance selon laquelle le MDG a commis une fraude, en tant que tiers \u00e0 la lettre de contre\u2011garantie. L\u2019appelante n\u2019a pas non plus relev\u00e9 de fondement justifiant la modification de la conclusion du juge de premi\u00e8re instance selon laquelle la fraude du MDG peut \u00eatre imput\u00e9e \u00e0 Eurobank \u00e0 titre de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire. Eurobank \u00e9tait au fait de la fraude du MDG et a agi en connaissance de cause; elle n\u2019est donc pas innocente de cette fraude. L\u2019exception de fraude s\u2019applique \u00e0 la lettre de contre\u2011garantie.\n(1) Le MDG a commis une fraude en tant que tiers \u00e0 la lettre de contre\u2011garantie\n[112] Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, le MDG aurait commis une fraude dans la transaction plut\u00f4t qu\u2019une fraude dans les documents pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s. Le juge Le Dain a soulign\u00e9 que \u00ab la fraude dans les op\u00e9rations sous\u2011jacentes de nature \u00e0 rendre frauduleuse la demande de paiement en vertu d\u2019un cr\u00e9dit \u00bb pouvait inclure \u00ab tout acte du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire d\u2019un cr\u00e9dit qui aurait pour effet de lui permettre d\u2019obtenir le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice du cr\u00e9dit par suite d\u2019un acte frauduleux \u00bb (Angelica\u2011Whitewear, p. 83; voir aussi L\u2019Heureux et Lacoursi\u00e8re, p. 409\u2011410; M. Lemieux, \u00ab Les d\u00e9cisions Bombardier Inc. c. Hermes Aero LLC et l\u2019autonomie des cr\u00e9dits standby \u00bb (2003), 63 R. du B. 427, p. 428).\n[113] Depuis que l\u2019arr\u00eat Angelica\u2011Whitewear a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu, les tribunaux canadiens ont insist\u00e9, dans le contexte des lettres de cr\u00e9dit, sur le fait que [traduction] \u00ab [l]a fraude n\u2019est pas simplement un diff\u00e9rend ou un d\u00e9saccord l\u00e9gitime sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation d\u2019un contrat, aussi in\u00e9gal que puisse para\u00eetre ce diff\u00e9rend \u00bb (Cineplex Odeon Corp. c. 100 Bloor West General Partner Inc., [1993] O.J. No. 112 (Lexis), 1993 CarswellOnt 2358 (WL) (C.J. (Div. g\u00e9n.)), par. 31 (WL); voir aussi Fiberex Technologies Inc. c. Bank of Montreal, 2015 ABQB 496, [2016] 4 W.W.R. 547, par. 23; Standard Trust Co. (Liquidation) c. Bank of Nova Scotia, 2001 NFCA 27, 201 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 8, par. 59). Comme l\u2019a \u00e9galement not\u00e9 un tribunal de Hong Kong, il est bien \u00e9tabli que [traduction] \u00ab [e]n raison du principe de l\u2019autonomie du cr\u00e9dit, l\u2019application de l\u2019exception de fraude est strictement encadr\u00e9e, de sorte qu\u2019elle [. . .] ne s\u2019applique pas aux litiges sur le contrat sous\u2011jacent \u00bb (DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Ltd. c. New Harvest International Development Ltd., [2017] HKCFI 30, par. 62 (HKLII)). Les tribunaux qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois ont \u00e9galement reconnu qu\u2019un diff\u00e9rend concernant le contrat sous\u2011jacent n\u2019indique pas n\u00e9cessairement qu\u2019il y a eu fraude (SNC\u2011Lavalin Polska SP. ZOO c. BNP Paris Canada, 2017 QCCS 3694, par. 40 (CanLII); Bombardier Inc. c. Hermes Aero, 2004 CanLII 7014 (C.S.), par. 35; SNC\u2011Lavalin Constructeurs international inc. c. Shariket Kahraba Skikda.spa, 2010 QCCS 3236, par. 27 (CanLII); Banque Nationale du Canada c. CGU Cie d\u2019assurance du Canada, 2004 CanLII 49434 (C.S.), par. 49).\n[114] Dans ce contexte, le terme \u00ab fraude \u00bb ne s\u2019entend pas au sens du droit criminel; il a une connotation diff\u00e9rente. En g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, la fraude civile ou commerciale a une port\u00e9e plus large que son \u00e9quivalent criminel (McGuinness, \u00a717.342). Une caract\u00e9ristique essentielle de la fraude dans ce contexte est son effet sur la demande de paiement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire. Comme le font observer les auteurs L\u2019Heureux et Lacoursi\u00e8re, \u00ab la fraude peut avoir pour objet tant les documents que les op\u00e9rations sous-jacentes (c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire le contrat commercial) de nature \u00e0 rendre frauduleuse la demande de paiement en vertu de la lettre de cr\u00e9dit \u00bb (p. 410). Le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire qui demande le paiement tout en sachant qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas le droit d\u2019\u00eatre pay\u00e9 au titre du contrat sous\u2011jacent peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme ayant commis une fraude (McGuinness, \u00a7 17.338). La question de savoir s\u2019il y a eu fraude est une question mixte de fait et de droit qui commande la retenue en appel. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la conduite frauduleuse du MDG consiste essentiellement \u00e0 avoir demand\u00e9 le paiement au titre de la lettre de garantie alors qu\u2019il savait qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas le droit de le faire.\n[115] Le crit\u00e8re n\u2019en demeure pas moins exigeant. Comme l\u2019explique l\u2019auteur Marc Lemieux, l\u2019exception de fraude se limite aux cas de fraude \u00e9vidente \u00ab pour \u00e9viter de porter atteinte ind\u00fbment \u00e0 l\u2019utilit\u00e9 et \u00e0 l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 commerciales des lettres de cr\u00e9dit \u00bb (p. 433; voir aussi L\u2019Heureux et Lacoursi\u00e8re, p. 409\u2011410). Une simple absence de bonne foi peut \u00eatre insuffisante, m\u00eame si elle peut engager la responsabilit\u00e9 civile dans d\u2019autres contextes. Dans ce contexte, la fraude va plus loin; elle doit [traduction] \u00ab impliquer le recours \u00e0 certains actes irr\u00e9guliers, malhonn\u00eates ou trompeurs \u00bb (Cineplex, par. 31, cit\u00e9 et approuv\u00e9 par divers tribunaux qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois et des provinces de common law, y compris Royal Bank c. Gentra Canada Investments Inc. (2001), 15 B.L.R. (3d) 25 (C.A. Ont.), par. 8; OMERS Realty, par. 45; SNC\u2011Lavalin Polska, par. 40; Alessandra Yarns, l.l.c. c. Tongxiang Baoding Textile Co., 2015 QCCS 346, par. 34 (CanLII)). Comme l\u2019a fait remarquer un tribunal de l\u2019Ontario, [traduction] \u00ab une demande de paiement n\u2019est frauduleuse que si la r\u00e9clamation de fonds ne pr\u00e9sente m\u00eame pas l\u2019apparence de validit\u00e9 ou qu\u2019elle n\u2019a absolument aucun fondement factuel \u00bb (Royal Bank c. Gentra Canada Investments Inc. (2000), 1 B.L.R. (3d) 170 (C.S.J.), par. 56, conf. par (2001), 15 B.L.R. (3d) 25).\n[116] Je suis conscient que c\u2019est une affaire s\u00e9rieuse de d\u00e9crire la conduite d\u2019une branche d\u2019un \u00c9tat \u00e9tranger \u2014 qui est membre de l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne et acteur important du commerce international \u2014 comme \u00e9tant \u00ab frauduleuse \u00bb. Il est important, lorsque l\u2019on qualifie la conduite d\u2019un \u00c9tat \u00e9tranger, de veiller \u00e0 ne pas porter atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 d\u2019un acteur respect\u00e9 de la communaut\u00e9 internationale des affaires. Mais j\u2019insiste sur le fait que ce terme est employ\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce dans le contexte pr\u00e9cis des lettres de cr\u00e9dit o\u00f9, selon l\u2019arr\u00eat Angelica\u2011Whitewear, la fraude comprend la demande de paiement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par un b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire qui sait qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas droit. Aucune autre inf\u00e9rence ne devrait \u00eatre tir\u00e9e de l\u2019utilisation de ce terme en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et, en toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, je n\u2019aurais pas utilis\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9pith\u00e8tes comme [traduction] \u00ab intimidation juridique \u00bb ou \u00ab chantage juridique \u00bb dans le cas qui nous occupe (par. 175 et 182). Pour des raisons de courtoisie, les tribunaux canadiens devraient se montrer r\u00e9ticents \u00e0 critiquer les lois d\u2019un \u00c9tat \u00e9tranger, m\u00eame si force est de reconna\u00eetre que le droit canadien et le droit international les y obligent parfois (voir, de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Nevsun Resources Ltd. c. Araya, 2020 CSC 5, [2020] 1 R.C.S. 166, par. 50).\n[117] Cela dit, je suis d\u2019avis que la conclusion du juge de premi\u00e8re instance selon laquelle le MDG a commis une fraude \u2014 une conclusion mixte de fait et de droit \u2014 commande la d\u00e9f\u00e9rence. Eurobank n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que la conclusion g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du juge sur ce point \u00e9tait le r\u00e9sultat d\u2019erreurs manifestes et d\u00e9terminantes. La d\u00e9cision selon laquelle le MDG a commis [traduction] \u00ab certaines irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s \u00bb qui pouvaient constituer une fraude \u2014 qui ont m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnues par le juge dissident de la Cour d\u2019appel comme constituant de la fraude \u2014 est amplement \u00e9tay\u00e9e par la preuve (voir par. 175\u2011176). Cela dit, je ne crois pas qu\u2019il soit n\u00e9cessaire de souscrire \u00e0 toutes ses conclusions sur ce point.\n[118] Comme l\u2019a not\u00e9 le juge Mainville, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a tenu compte des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve relatifs au comportement du MDG, y compris ceux qui \u00e9taient susceptibles de militer contre une conclusion de fraude. Je suis d\u2019accord avec le juge Mainville pour dire que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance n\u2019a pas commis d\u2019erreur r\u00e9visable, en particulier en ce qui concerne le moment o\u00f9 la demande de paiement a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, qui doit \u00eatre appr\u00e9ci\u00e9e au regard de l\u2019ordonnance du tribunal arbitral de la CCI interdisant au MDG de demander le paiement. La preuve appuie la conclusion selon laquelle le MDG s\u2019est livr\u00e9 \u00e0 une [traduction] \u00ab tentative frauduleuse de se soustraire \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance provisoire et \u00e0 la sentence finale du tribunal arbitral de la CCI par tous les moyens, aussi r\u00e9pugnants soient\u2011ils \u00bb (motifs de la C.A., par. 60).\n[119] Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, la preuve indique que le MDG, qui \u00e9tait partie \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure arbitrale, a viol\u00e9 l\u2019ordonnance proc\u00e9durale no 11 du tribunal arbitral de la CCI, qui lui interdisait de demander le paiement au titre de la lettre de garantie. En violation de cette ordonnance et de son propre engagement, le MDG a, environ une semaine avant le prononc\u00e9 de la sentence arbitrale finale, r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 sa demande de paiement. Apr\u00e8s que la sentence arbitrale finale eut \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue et confirm\u00e9e par la Cour d\u2019appel de Paris, il est devenu \u00e9vident que le contrat de compensation ne conf\u00e9rait aucun droit au MDG sur l\u2019argent qu\u2019il avait re\u00e7u. N\u00e9anmoins, le MDG n\u2019a pas rendu l\u2019argent qu\u2019il avait re\u00e7u d\u2019Eurobank au titre de la lettre de garantie. En fait, le MDG a soutenu devant notre Cour qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas tenu de remettre l\u2019argent parce que Bombardier ne lui avait pas demand\u00e9 le remboursement directement (m.a., par. 94). Ce fait, \u00e0 lui seul, permet de conclure que le MDG a commis une fraude.\n[120] Il suffit de noter, comme l\u2019ont fait le juge de premi\u00e8re instance et les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel, que les demandes de paiement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par le MDG en violation de l\u2019ordonnance proc\u00e9durale no 11 et de son propre engagement, y compris la demande qu\u2019il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e imm\u00e9diatement avant le prononc\u00e9 de la sentence arbitrale finale, permettent de conclure qu\u2019il a commis une fraude. Pour cette raison, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9cider si d\u2019autres aspects de la conduite du MDG relev\u00e9s par le juge de premi\u00e8re instance constituent de la fraude.\n[121] Je ne commenterai pas la fa\u00e7on dont le MDG a demand\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre pay\u00e9 au moyen du prot\u00eat-invitation extrajudiciaire. Bien qu\u2019on trouve au dossier certaines preuves d\u2019experts sur le droit grec, notre Cour ne devrait pas tirer de conclusions originales sur la question de savoir si le prot\u00eat-invitation extrajudiciaire du MDG \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9 ou requis en droit grec. Compte tenu du fait que le MDG est un acteur \u00e9tranger, ce que les tribunaux qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois peuvent l\u00e9gitimement lui reprocher en ce qui concerne une lettre de cr\u00e9dit qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise, c\u2019est d\u2019avoir demand\u00e9 le paiement d\u2019une lettre de cr\u00e9dit connexe en violation d\u2019une ordonnance d\u2019un tribunal arbitral et de son propre engagement, cela \u00e0 la veille du prononc\u00e9 d\u2019une sentence arbitrale qui allait statuer sur son droit au paiement.\n[122] J\u2019ajoute que le juge dissident de la Cour d\u2019appel a reconnu que le MDG avait commis une fraude, particuli\u00e8rement en raison du fait que ce dernier n\u2019a jamais eu l\u2019intention de rembourser les fonds que le tribunal arbitral avait \u00e9tabli qu\u2019il devait (motifs de la C.A., par. 200). Il est all\u00e9 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 dire que [traduction] \u00ab [l]a conduite du MDG dans cette affaire \u00e9tait, en un mot, d\u00e9plorable \u00bb (par. 164). Cela dit, il n\u2019aurait pas conclu que la violation par le MDG de l\u2019ordonnance proc\u00e9durale no 11 repr\u00e9sentait une fraude parce que cette ordonnance n\u2019\u00e9tait pas susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre homologu\u00e9e, ce qui signifie que la violation de cette ordonnance par le MDG est [traduction] \u00ab un manquement au contrat, mais pas \u00e0 la loi \u00bb (par. 184). Je ne partage pas cet avis pour deux raisons.\n[123] D\u2019abord, en l\u2019absence d\u2019une erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante, il n\u2019y a pas lieu de modifier la conclusion mixte de fait et de droit du juge de premi\u00e8re instance selon laquelle le MDG a commis une fraude. Il est bien \u00e9tabli en droit que les tribunaux d\u2019appel doivent se garder de tirer des conclusions de fait originales ou des conclusions mixtes de fait et de droit originales \u00e0 moins de pouvoir identifier, avec la pr\u00e9cision requise, une erreur \u00e9vidente qui a une incidence sur le r\u00e9sultat (voir, de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Housen).\n[124] Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a eu l\u2019avantage d\u2019entendre les t\u00e9moignages de premi\u00e8re main, dont les explications de certains des principaux acteurs. Les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel se sont, \u00e0 bon droit, gard\u00e9s d\u2019imposer leur propre interpr\u00e9tation de la preuve. Soit dit en tout respect, j\u2019estime que le juge dissident n\u2019a pas suivi cette r\u00e8gle. Pour pouvoir infirmer le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance, il fallait d\u00e9montrer l\u2019existence d\u2019erreurs manifestes et d\u00e9terminantes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de chacune des conclusions du juge quant aux sources de la fraude du MDG. M\u00eame si j\u2019estime que la conclusion relative \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance proc\u00e9durale no 11 est suffisante pour rejeter le pourvoi, d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments posent de s\u00e9rieux probl\u00e8mes \u00e0 l\u2019appelante Eurobank. Par exemple, celle\u2011ci n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi, \u00e0 mes yeux, \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019une erreur r\u00e9visable dans la conclusion du juge de premi\u00e8re instance selon laquelle le retrait par le MDG de son engagement de ne pas demander de paiement constituait une conduite frauduleuse. Cela dit avec le plus grand respect, l\u2019explication donn\u00e9e par le juge dissident pour modifier la conclusion du juge de premi\u00e8re instance sur ce point ne me convainc pas. La conclusion selon laquelle [traduction] \u00ab [l]\u2019engagement n\u2019avait pas de dur\u00e9e pr\u00e9cise \u00bb (par. 177) me semble \u00eatre une interpr\u00e9tation inexacte de la promesse faite par le MDG. En fait, le MDG s\u2019\u00e9tait engag\u00e9 \u00e0 ne pas demander de paiement [traduction] \u00ab tant et aussi longtemps que la proc\u00e9dure [d\u2019arbitrage] est en cours \u00bb (d.a., vol. IV, p. 199). L\u2019engagement avait une dur\u00e9e pr\u00e9cise \u2014 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que la sentence soit rendue \u2014 m\u00eame si cette date n\u2019\u00e9tait pas certaine. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, la conclusion de fraude \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019ordonnance proc\u00e9durale no 11 suffit en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[125] Ensuite, s\u2019il est vrai qu\u2019une ordonnance provisoire d\u2019un tribunal arbitral n\u2019est pas susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre homologu\u00e9e, il ne s\u2019ensuit pas pour autant que le MDG n\u2019aurait pas pu commettre une fraude en violant l\u2019ordonnance proc\u00e9durale no 11. Je suis d\u2019accord pour dire que, sans plus, un manquement contractuel ne constitue pas une fraude. Cela dit, un manquement contractuel, comme tout autre comportement intervenant dans le cadre d\u2019une transaction qui \u00ab impliqu[e] le recours \u00e0 certains actes irr\u00e9guliers, malhonn\u00eates ou trompeurs \u00bb (Cineplex, par. 31), peut constituer une fraude. La question de savoir si une violation de contrat repr\u00e9sente une fraude est une question mixte de fait et de droit qui commande la d\u00e9f\u00e9rence en appel. J\u2019ajoute que nous nous int\u00e9ressons \u00e0 la question de savoir si la conduite du MDG constitue une fraude de la part d\u2019un tiers au regard de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie, et non \u00e0 la question de savoir si l\u2019ordonnance provisoire d\u2019un tribunal arbitral peut \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e par un tribunal judiciaire. Je suis d\u2019accord avec les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel pour dire que la conduite du MDG constituait, comme l\u2019a conclu le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, un cas de fraude sur lequel ce dernier pouvait se fonder (motifs de la C.A., par. 58\u201160).\n[126] Dans l\u2019ensemble, il n\u2019y a aucune raison de modifier la conclusion du juge de premi\u00e8re instance selon laquelle le MDG a eu une conduite r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible suffisante pour d\u00e9clencher, \u00e0 titre de fraude commise par un tiers, l\u2019application de l\u2019exception de fraude en droit canadien. Je r\u00e9it\u00e8re toutefois que je m\u2019abstiens de tout commentaire sur la question de savoir si le MDG a pu commettre une fraude en droit grec ou si sa conduite pourrait entra\u00eener des cons\u00e9quences en ce qui concerne la lettre de garantie devant les tribunaux grecs. Je rappelle \u00e9galement que les jugements pertinents de ces tribunaux n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnus comme \u00e9tant ex\u00e9cutoires en droit qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. Pour ce qui est de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie, compte tenu de ses propres dispositions, il suffit de conclure que la conduite du MDG repr\u00e9sente une fraude commise par un tiers. Il nous reste \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si Eurobank, en tant que b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire, est \u00ab innocente \u00bb de cette fraude.\n(2) La fraude du MDG est devenue celle d\u2019Eurobank\n[127] Comme l\u2019a \u00e9crit le juge Le Dain, l\u2019exception de fraude est \u00ab restreinte \u00e0 la fraude du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire d\u2019un cr\u00e9dit et ne devrait pas viser la fraude d\u2019un tiers dont le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire est innocent \u00bb (Angelica\u2011Whitewear, p. 84). Un tribunal de l\u2019Ontario a fait remarquer, avec raison, qu\u2019il [traduction] \u00ab est implicite dans les propos pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents que l\u2019exception de fraude dans les cas de lettres de cr\u00e9dit pourrait s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 la fraude commise par un tiers dont le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de la lettre de cr\u00e9dit ne peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme innocent \u00bb (Royal Bank c. Darlington, 1995 CarswellOnt 2661 (WL), [1995] O.J. No. 1044 (Lexis) (C.J. (Div. g\u00e9n.)), par. 231; voir aussi Global Steel Ltd. c. Bank of Montreal, 1999 ABCA 311, 244 A.R. 341, par. 21).\n[128] Il est n\u00e9cessaire, afin de ne pas compromettre le caract\u00e8re autonome des lettres de cr\u00e9dit, m\u00eame lorsqu\u2019elles sont interd\u00e9pendantes comme en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, de bien d\u00e9finir ce qu\u2019il faut entendre par la conduite d\u2019un b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire qui n\u2019est pas \u00ab innocent \u00bb. Je suis conscient que, m\u00eame si un b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire innocent est en droit de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce que la fraude d\u2019un tiers ne lui soit pas imput\u00e9e, cela parce qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas \u00e0 surveiller l\u2019op\u00e9ration sous\u2011jacente, la banque \u00e9mettrice et son client sont tout autant en droit de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce que l\u2019exception de fraude puisse s\u2019appliquer si le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire assume la responsabilit\u00e9 de cette fraude comme s\u2019il s\u2019agissait de la sienne. Il s\u2019agit donc de savoir si la fraude du tiers peut \u00e0 juste titre \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme celle du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire.\n[129] Un b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire cesse d\u2019\u00eatre \u00ab innocent \u00bb lorsqu\u2019il a connaissance de la fraude du tiers et qu\u2019il y participe. Lorsqu\u2019il y a \u00e0 la fois connaissance et participation, la fraude du tiers \u2014 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le MDG \u2014 peut \u00eatre \u00e0 juste titre imput\u00e9e au b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire \u2014 en l\u2019occurrence, Eurobank, au regard de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie. En clair, lorsque la fraude commise par un tiers est imput\u00e9e au b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire, cette fraude devient la sienne; il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une responsabilit\u00e9 indirecte ou du fait d\u2019autrui. L\u2019imputation de la fraude d\u2019un tiers au b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire est simplement une application de l\u2019exception de fraude au b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de la lettre de cr\u00e9dit en question.\n[130] Comme c\u2019est toujours le cas, une connaissance claire d\u2019une fraude \u00e9vidente avant le paiement par l\u2019institution financi\u00e8re est requise (voir L\u2019Heureux et Lacoursi\u00e8re, p. 411; B. Crawford et autres, The Law of Banking and Payment in Canada (feuilles mobiles), \u00a7 13:171). Un b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire ne peut \u00eatre responsable, au sens commercial ou civil, d\u2019une fraude dont il n\u2019avait pas connaissance (Sarna, p. 5\u201156 et 5\u201157; voir aussi R. P. Buckley, \u00ab The 1993 Revision of the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits \u00bb (1995), 28 Geo. Wash. J. Int\u2019l L. & Econ. 265, p. 308; E. A. Caprioli, Le cr\u00e9dit documentaire : \u00e9volution et perspectives (1992), no 373). C\u2019est tout \u00e0 fait logique, car, malheureusement, il arrive que des parties participent \u00e0 des fraudes commerciales sans le savoir. L\u2019auteur Lazar Sarna donne l\u2019exemple d\u2019un [traduction] \u00ab acte frauduleux cach\u00e9 \u00bb comme \u00ab la falsification par un transporteur de la date de chargement de la marchandise \u00e0 l\u2019insu du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire \u00bb (p. 5\u201156 et 5\u201157).\n[131] Toutefois, il ne suffit pas d\u2019\u00eatre simplement au courant de la fraude commise par le tiers. Le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire ne commet pas de fraude \u00e0 moins d\u2019y participer. Comme le soulignent les auteurs L\u2019Heureux et Lacoursi\u00e8re, \u00ab [i]l est [. . .] clair en droit canadien et qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois que seule la fraude commise par le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire est admise, y compris celle d\u2019un tiers lorsque celui\u2011ci y a particip\u00e9 \u00bb (p. 411; voir aussi Crawford et autres, \u00a7 13:171; Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais Canada c. First Mercantile Investment Corp., 1996 CarswellOnt 4711 (WL), [1996] O.J. No. 4309 (Lexis) (C.J. (Div. g\u00e9n.)), par. 44). La participation peut, comme en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, prendre la forme d\u2019un acquiescement \u00e0 une demande de paiement dans des circonstances irr\u00e9guli\u00e8res. Elle peut aussi consister \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter sciemment des documents frauduleux \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9metteur. Tout ce qu\u2019il faut, c\u2019est une action du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire qui l\u2019implique dans la fraude du tiers. Lorsque, par exemple, le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire demande le paiement, \u00e0 son propre avantage, en \u00e9tant au courant de la fraude du tiers, il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019une fraude dont le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire n\u2019est pas innocent.\n[132] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que la connaissance et la participation sont toutes deux requises, la port\u00e9e de l\u2019exception de fraude sera suffisamment restreinte. Les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires peuvent \u00eatre rassur\u00e9s de savoir que la fraude commise par un tiers ne leur sera pas imput\u00e9e \u00e0 moins qu\u2019ils en aient activement assum\u00e9 la responsabilit\u00e9. Le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire bien intentionn\u00e9 qui facilite involontairement la fraude d\u2019un tiers ou qui choisit de ne pas y participer n\u2019a pas \u00e0 craindre que la fraude lui soit imput\u00e9e. De m\u00eame, le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire qui demande d\u2019\u00eatre pay\u00e9 alors qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas connaissance de la fraude du tiers restera innocent. En limitant ainsi la port\u00e9e de l\u2019exception de fraude, on prot\u00e8ge la fiabilit\u00e9 des lettres de cr\u00e9dit canadiennes. Toutefois, le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire devient coauteur de la fraude commise par un tiers lorsqu\u2019il participe sciemment \u00e0 la conduite r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible et il se verra donc imputer cette fraude; dans un tel cas, l\u2019exception de fraude peut \u00e0 juste titre s\u2019appliquer de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 emp\u00eacher que la lettre de cr\u00e9dit serve \u00e0 faciliter un cas \u00e9vident de fraude.\n[133] Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a conclu qu\u2019Eurobank savait [traduction] \u00ab que la conduite du MDG constituait une fraude \u00e9vidente \u00bb (par. 196) parce que la demande du MDG contrevenait aux ordonnances du tribunal arbitral de la CCI et de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure (par. 197). Le juge Mainville de la Cour d\u2019appel a reconnu qu\u2019Eurobank [traduction] \u00ab \u00e9tait manifestement \u00bb au courant de la fraude commise par le MDG (par. 72) et, se r\u00e9f\u00e9rant \u00e0 la preuve relative \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance proc\u00e9durale no 11, il a observ\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00ab [i]l est \u00e9vident en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce qu\u2019Eurobank avait une connaissance suffisante de la fraude avant de payer \u00bb (par. 71). Le juge Hamilton de la Cour d\u2019appel a reconnu qu\u2019Eurobank avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00ab avis\u00e9e \u00bb de l\u2019ordonnance proc\u00e9durale no 11 (par. 212). Malgr\u00e9 cela, il a conclu qu\u2019il [traduction] \u00ab n\u2019\u00e9tait pas clair et \u00e9vident que la demande [du MDG] \u00e9tait frauduleuse \u00bb (par. 223).\n[134] Soit dit en tout respect, le juge dissident n\u2019a pas relev\u00e9 d\u2019erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante dans la conclusion mixte de fait et de droit du juge de premi\u00e8re instance selon laquelle Eurobank \u00e9tait au courant de la fraude du MDG et y a particip\u00e9. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a conclu qu\u2019Eurobank [traduction] \u00ab avait en fait volontairement effectu\u00e9 le paiement sachant que la conduite du MDG constituait une fraude claire \u00bb (par. 196 (italique omis)). Il a \u00e9crit qu\u2019Eurobank avait pay\u00e9 le MDG [traduction] \u00ab en violation de non pas une, mais deux ordonnances. Une du tribunal arbitral de la CCI et l\u2019autre du juge Davis de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure du Qu\u00e9bec \u00bb (par. 197), ce qui \u00e9taye sa conclusion qu\u2019Eurobank \u00e9tait au courant de la fraude du MDG. Qui plus est, il existe des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, notamment les t\u00e9moignages d\u2019employ\u00e9s d\u2019Eurobank qui ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de payer le MDG, qui permettent de conclure qu\u2019Eurobank savait que la demande du MDG d\u2019\u00eatre pay\u00e9 en vertu de la lettre de garantie avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en violation de l\u2019ordonnance proc\u00e9durale no 11 du tribunal arbitral de la CCI.\n[135] Au proc\u00e8s, Dimitri Konstantopoulos, directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des services bancaires aux entreprises chez Eurobank, a admis qu\u2019Eurobank \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab au courant qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision de la CCI rendue contre le minist\u00e8re de la d\u00e9fense indiquait \u201cne pas demander le paiement au titre de la lettre de garantie\u201d \u00bb (d.a., vol. VIII, p. 50). Athanasios Danis, directeur des services juridiques d\u2019Eurobank \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 le paiement a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait au MDG, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il savait que Bombardier avait demand\u00e9 et obtenu une ordonnance provisoire du tribunal arbitral de la CCI qui interdisait au MDG de demander d\u2019\u00eatre pay\u00e9 en vertu de la lettre de garantie. Il a aussi affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait des r\u00e9serves [traduction] \u00ab quant \u00e0 la bonne foi du MDG \u00bb (p. 64). Bien qu\u2019une simple absence de bonne foi ne soit pas suffisante pour d\u00e9clencher l\u2019application de l\u2019exception de fraude, les t\u00e9moignages de MM. Konstantopoulos et Danis indiquent qu\u2019Eurobank \u00e9tait au courant de la conduite du MDG qui, selon les normes canadiennes, constituait une fraude. Dans ce contexte, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance pouvait conclure qu\u2019Eurobank \u00e9tait au courant de la fraude commise par le MDG.\n[136] Le juge dissident a convenu que [traduction] \u00ab Eurobank savait de toute \u00e9vidence que la demande [de paiement en vertu de la lettre de garantie] \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la veille de la sentence arbitrale finale \u00bb (motifs de la C.A., par. 217). Il a toutefois conclu qu\u2019Eurobank [traduction] \u00ab ne savait pas que le MDG s\u2019attendait \u00e0 \u00eatre d\u00e9bout\u00e9 ou qu\u2019il avait l\u2019intention de conserver les fonds, quel que soit le r\u00e9sultat \u00bb (par. 217). \u00c0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0, [traduction] \u00ab Eurobank n\u2019avait que des soup\u00e7ons \u00bb (par. 217). Bien que je reconnaisse que de simples soup\u00e7ons [traduction] \u00ab ne sauraient \u00eatre assimil\u00e9s \u00e0 une connaissance de la fraude \u00bb (par. 218), je ne partage pas l\u2019opinion selon laquelle la connaissance par Eurobank de la fraude du MDG n\u2019\u00e9tait qu\u2019un simple soup\u00e7on. Les employ\u00e9s d\u2019Eurobank qui ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de payer le MDG ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au proc\u00e8s qu\u2019ils savaient qu\u2019il \u00e9tait interdit au MDG de demander le paiement au titre de la lettre de garantie et que le prononc\u00e9 de la sentence arbitrale finale \u00e9tait imminent. Eurobank ne faisait pas que soup\u00e7onner le MDG d\u2019avoir demand\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre pay\u00e9 en contravention de l\u2019ordonnance proc\u00e9durale no 11; elle savait clairement que cela se produisait. \u00c0 tout le moins, cela indique qu\u2019Eurobank savait que la demande de paiement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite en violation d\u2019au moins une ordonnance, ce qui, dans les circonstances, repr\u00e9sente une connaissance claire de la conduite frauduleuse du MDG.\n[137] Je ne vois donc aucune raison de modifier la conclusion du juge de premi\u00e8re instance selon laquelle Eurobank avait clairement connaissance de la fraude commise par le MDG.\n[138] En outre, on ne m\u2019a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 aucune erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante dans la conclusion du juge de premi\u00e8re instance selon laquelle \u00ab Eurobank n\u2019a peut\u2011\u00eatre pas con\u00e7u le complot frauduleux et n\u2019a peut\u2011\u00eatre pas fourni les armes, mais elle a certainement aid\u00e9 \u00e0 appuyer sur la d\u00e9tente \u00bb et selon laquelle Eurobank [traduction] \u00ab a sciemment permis \u00e0 la fraude de produire ses fruits \u00bb (par. 205). Eurobank a particip\u00e9 activement \u00e0 la fraude du MDG en payant celui\u2011ci dans des circonstances irr\u00e9guli\u00e8res.\n[139] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, puisqu\u2019Eurobank \u00e9tait au courant de la fraude du MDG et y a particip\u00e9, elle est devenue coauteure de cette fraude et doit, aux fins de l\u2019exception de fraude, en assumer la responsabilit\u00e9. La fraude du MDG est devenue la sienne. C\u2019est la fraude d\u2019Eurobank, \u00e0 titre de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie, qui est susceptible de faire l\u2019objet de poursuites devant les tribunaux qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois.\n[140] J\u2019ajoute que, bien que la lettre de contre\u2011garantie ait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mise pour assurer qu\u2019Eurobank soit pay\u00e9e si elle devait payer le MDG en vertu de la lettre de garantie, toutes les lettres de cr\u00e9dit canadiennes sont \u00e9mises sous r\u00e9serve de l\u2019exception de fraude. Tout comme Eurobank \u00e9tait en droit de compter sur la quasi\u2011certitude d\u2019\u00eatre pay\u00e9e dans des circonstances normales, Bombardier, en tant que cliente de la banque \u00e9mettrice, \u00e9tait en droit de compter sur la possibilit\u00e9 que l\u2019exception de fraude soit invoqu\u00e9e si elle venait \u00e0 s\u2019appliquer. D\u2019ailleurs, certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve donnent \u00e0 penser que la d\u00e9cision de recourir \u00e0 une lettre de cr\u00e9dit assujettie au droit qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois visait \u00e0 faire en sorte que Bombardier puisse b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de la protection de l\u2019exception de fraude. La structure comportant deux lettres de cr\u00e9dit \u00e9tait con\u00e7ue, comme l\u2019a expliqu\u00e9 au proc\u00e8s M. Fran\u00e7ois Ouellette, vice\u2011pr\u00e9sident des services juridiques et des contrats pour la division avions d\u2019affaires chez Bombardier, pour \u00ab \u00e9viter un risque de fraude \u00bb (d.a., vol. IX, p. 9). Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, dans le cadre de cette transaction comportant une dimension internationale et faisant intervenir des r\u00e8gles de droit d\u2019un \u00c9tat \u00e9tranger, qui s\u2019accompagnent d\u2019une certaine incertitude, Bombardier a trouv\u00e9 du r\u00e9confort \u00e0 traiter avec une banque canadienne et \u00e0 savoir que l\u2019exception de fraude en droit canadien pouvait s\u2019appliquer. Eurobank, en tant que partie \u00e0 la lettre de contre\u2011garantie, a pris les risques que cela impliquait pour elle en tant que b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de la lettre en question. Au proc\u00e8s, M. Ouellette a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 :\n. . . nous, chez Bombardier [. . .] on conna\u00eet le droit qui g\u00e8re l\u2019\u00e9mission et l\u2019encaissement des lettres de cr\u00e9dit en droit qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, d\u2019o\u00f9 l\u2019exigence que lorsqu\u2019il y a une lettre de cr\u00e9dit \u00e9mise par une banque \u00e9trang\u00e8re, qu\u2019elle soit soumise \u00e0 une contre\u2011garantie par une banque locale.\n. . .\n. . . [L]a raison derri\u00e8re laquelle on avait exig\u00e9 qu\u2019il y ait une lettre de contre\u2011garantie, c\u2019\u00e9tait justement pour ne pas devoir aller se battre devant les tribunaux grecs. [. . .] [L]a lettre de contre\u2011garantie faisait en sorte aussi qu\u2019on n\u2019\u00e9tait pas sujet \u00e0 un encaissement frauduleux, puisqu\u2019en vertu des r\u00e8gles canadiennes [. . .] l\u2019exception \u00e0 l\u2019encaissement de la lettre de cr\u00e9dit est la fraude, donc la lettre de contre\u2011garantie de la Banque Nationale nous pr\u00e9munissait contre toute tentative de fraude du gouvernement grec.\n(d.a., vol. IX, p. 66 et 99\u2011100)\n[141] Dans ce contexte, l\u2019exception de fraude s\u2019applique de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 assurer que Bombardier et la Banque Nationale n\u2019aient pas \u00e0 assumer les pertes associ\u00e9es \u00e0 la fraude qui est imput\u00e9e \u00e0 Eurobank comme s\u2019il s\u2019agissait de la sienne.\n[142] Enfin, l\u2019argument subsidiaire d\u2019Eurobank selon lequel elle a agi sous la contrainte est sans fondement. Rien ne justifie de modifier la conclusion du juge de premi\u00e8re instance selon laquelle la conduite d\u2019Eurobank en tant que b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire \u00e9tait volontaire. Eurobank \u00e9tait au courant de la fraude du MDG et a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Banque Nationale de la payer en \u00e9tant parfaitement consciente de cette situation. Je reconnais qu\u2019Eurobank se trouvait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9vidence dans une position difficile : elle faisait sans doute l\u2019objet de pressions de la part du MDG et elle \u00e9tait sans doute consciente de la possibilit\u00e9 que, au Canada, elle perde sa cause portant sur la lettre de contre\u2011garantie. Mais comme l\u2019a conclu le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, Eurobank n\u2019a pas r\u00e9sist\u00e9 aux pressions exerc\u00e9es par le MDG [traduction] \u00ab apr\u00e8s avoir consid\u00e9r\u00e9 les risques auxquels sa r\u00e9sistance l\u2019aurait expos\u00e9e \u00bb (par. 203). Entre deux possibilit\u00e9s, Eurobank a fait le choix de demander \u00e0 la Banque Nationale de la payer plut\u00f4t que de faire face aux cons\u00e9quences du refus de payer le MDG. Elle n\u2019a pas agi de fa\u00e7on involontaire. Sous l\u2019effet de pressions concurrentes, elle a sciemment d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de participer \u00e0 une fraude. D\u2019une part, elle aurait pu refuser de participer \u00e0 la fraude du MDG, ce qui aurait \u00e9vit\u00e9 qu\u2019elle en devienne coauteure en droit canadien. D\u2019autre part, elle aurait pu s\u2019exposer \u00e0 des all\u00e9gations bien fond\u00e9es de fraude en droit canadien afin d\u2019\u00e9viter ce qui semblait \u00eatre une responsabilit\u00e9 plus grande en droit grec. Elle a opt\u00e9 pour cette derni\u00e8re solution. Eurobank, en tant que banque grecque, a peut\u2011\u00eatre pris une bonne d\u00e9cision d\u2019affaires dans ces circonstances difficiles, mais, \u00e0 nos fins, il suffit de noter que sa d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait volontaire et non pas impos\u00e9e. Puisqu\u2019Eurobank a agi volontairement, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9cider si la contrainte constitue une excuse \u00e0 l\u2019exception de fraude de fa\u00e7on plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Je tiens toutefois \u00e0 signaler que, lorsqu\u2019on lui a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience d\u2019indiquer un quelconque pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa pr\u00e9tention selon laquelle il y a une exception relative \u00e0 la contrainte \u00e0 l\u2019exception de fraude, Eurobank a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de le faire (transcription, p. 21).\n(3) Conclusion sur l\u2019exception de fraude\n[143] Je conclus que l\u2019exception de fraude s\u2019applique \u00e0 la demande de paiement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Eurobank au titre de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019Eurobank, en tant que b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie, \u00e9tait au courant de la fraude commise par le MDG et y a particip\u00e9, cette fraude peut lui \u00eatre imput\u00e9e comme s\u2019il s\u2019agissait de sa propre fraude. L\u2019exigence qu\u2019il y ait une fraude commise par le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire est donc remplie. En outre, il ne fait aucun doute que la fraude d\u2019Eurobank a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019attention de la Banque Nationale, qui a \u00e9mis la lettre de contre\u2011garantie. C\u2019est donc \u00e0 juste titre que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a interdit \u00e0 la Banque Nationale de verser \u00e0 Eurobank tout montant en vertu de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie et les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel n\u2019ont pas commis d\u2019erreur en confirmant cette conclusion.\nVI. Effet de la nullit\u00e9 du contrat de compensation sur la lettre de contre\u2011garantie\n[144] Bien que la majeure partie de son analyse ait port\u00e9 sur l\u2019exception de fraude, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a \u00e9crit que [traduction] \u00ab [i]l est difficile d\u2019accepter, en droit, que l\u2019invalidit\u00e9 ab initio du contrat de compensation [. . .] n\u2019emporte pas l\u2019invalidit\u00e9 des instruments qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mis pour garantir les obligations d\u00e9coulant dudit contrat \u00bb (par. 237). Il a ajout\u00e9 : [traduction] \u00ab Il est \u00e9vident que, comme la lettre de garantie a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9e nulle ab initio par le tribunal arbitral de la CCI dans sa sentence finale, laquelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 homologu\u00e9e par notre Cour, il doit en \u00eatre de m\u00eame pour la contre\u2011garantie et il doit \u00eatre ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 [la Banque Nationale] de ne pas payer Eurobank \u00bb (par. 240). Pour ce motif, le juge a conclu que la lettre de contre\u2011garantie est nulle. Les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel ont confirm\u00e9 cette conclusion.\n[145] En toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, je tiens \u00e0 signaler que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a eu tort de dire que le tribunal arbitral de la CCI avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 nulle la lettre de garantie parce que le contrat de compensation \u00e9tait nul. Dans sa sentence arbitrale finale, le tribunal arbitral de la CCI a conclu que [traduction] \u00ab [l]e contrat de compensation est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 nul ab initio, ainsi que sa clause 20 concernant les dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats liquid\u00e9s et sa clause 21 relative \u00e0 la lettre de garantie \u00bb (d.a., vol. VI, p. 143).\n[146] Eurobank a interjet\u00e9 appel \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appel de la conclusion du juge de premi\u00e8re instance selon laquelle la lettre de contre\u2011garantie \u00e9tait nulle. Les juges majoritaires ont confirm\u00e9 cette conclusion. Le juge Hamilton aurait accueilli l\u2019appel parce qu\u2019il estimait que l\u2019exception de fraude ne s\u2019appliquait pas. Lorsqu\u2019il a propos\u00e9 de rejeter l\u2019action intent\u00e9e par Bombardier contre Eurobank, il n\u2019a pas clairement indiqu\u00e9 si la lettre de contre\u2011garantie \u00e9tait valide et pour quelle raison.\n[147] Devant notre Cour, Bombardier soutient que la lettre de contre\u2011garantie est nulle parce que le contrat de compensation est nul. Compte tenu de la fa\u00e7on dont les questions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 jointes au proc\u00e8s et en appel et du fait que cet argument a \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9 comme un fondement subsidiaire pour d\u00e9cider s\u2019il y avait lieu d\u2019interdire \u00e0 la Banque Nationale de payer Eurobank en vertu de la lettre de contre\u2011garantie, je m\u2019abstiendrai de trancher cette question. Cela dit, l\u2019argument de Bombardier se rapporte \u00e0 un point de droit non r\u00e9gl\u00e9 qui, \u00e0 mon avis, m\u00e9rite trois commentaires.\n[148] Premi\u00e8rement, si un b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire demande d\u2019\u00eatre pay\u00e9 en vertu d\u2019une lettre de cr\u00e9dit alors qu\u2019il sait que le contrat de base est nul, sa conduite peut d\u00e9clencher l\u2019application de l\u2019exception de fraude (voir Angelica\u2011Whitewear, p. 83; McGuinness, \u00a717.338; OMERS Realty, par. 45). Cette situation ne doit pas \u00eatre confondue avec un litige concernant le contrat sous-jacent (Angelica\u2011Whitewear, p. 70). Le fait de demander un paiement conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 un droit contest\u00e9 ne constitue pas une fraude. En revanche, demander un paiement en sachant qu\u2019on n\u2019y a pas droit au titre du contrat sous-jacent peut \u00eatre frauduleux, selon les circonstances.\n[149] Deuxi\u00e8mement, il existe en droit qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois une \u00ab exigence, reprise \u00e0 l\u2019art. 1371 C.c.Q., selon laquelle il est de l\u2019essence d\u2019une obligation d\u00e9coulant d\u2019un acte juridique qu\u2019il y ait une cause qui en justifie l\u2019existence \u00bb (6362222 Canada inc. c. Prelco inc., 2021 CSC 39, par. 72). On pourrait fort bien soutenir que la cause objective de l\u2019obligation impos\u00e9e \u00e0 la banque \u00e9mettrice dans une lettre de cr\u00e9dit de faire un paiement peut \u00eatre dissoci\u00e9e du contrat sous\u2011jacent et ne pas \u00eatre d\u00e9pendante en soi de celui\u2011ci.\n[150] Troisi\u00e8mement, on pourrait soutenir que, si le contrat sous\u2011jacent est contraire \u00e0 l\u2019ordre public, il en va de m\u00eame pour les lettres de cr\u00e9dit qui en d\u00e9coulent (voir A. Peters, \u00ab Standby Letters of Credit in Financing Transactions \u00bb (1994), 13 Nat. B.L. Rev. 40, p. 53). Toutefois, l\u2019ouvrage de Crawford et autres signale le peu d\u2019attention qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 \u00e0 la question de savoir si l\u2019\u00e9metteur serait justifi\u00e9, en raison de l\u2019ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 manifeste de la transaction sous\u2011jacente, de refuser d\u2019effectuer un paiement sur pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019une demande par ailleurs conforme au titre d\u2019une lettre de cr\u00e9dit (\u00a713:176). Cela me porte \u00e0 croire qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de trancher la question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, et qu\u2019elle ne devrait probablement pas l\u2019\u00eatre. Puisque le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi peut \u00eatre tranch\u00e9 en statuant sur une question qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pleinement trait\u00e9e et d\u00e9battue \u2014 l\u2019exception de fraude \u2014, je suis d\u2019avis de reporter l\u2019examen de ces questions \u00e0 une autre occasion.\nVII. Dispositif\n[151] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que l\u2019exception de fraude s\u2019applique \u00e0 la lettre de contre\u2011garantie de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 emp\u00eacher la Banque Nationale de payer Eurobank en vertu de cette lettre, je suis d\u2019avis de rejeter le pourvoi avec d\u00e9pens payables par l\u2019appelante Eurobank.\nVersion fran\u00e7aise des motifs des juges Karakatsanis et C\u00f4t\u00e9 rendus par\nLa juge C\u00f4t\u00e9 \u2014\nTABLE DES MATI\u00c8RES\nParagraphe\nI.

Aper\u00e7u\n[152] Le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi exige que notre Cour se penche sur les limites appropri\u00e9es de l\u2019exception de fraude opposable \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie des garanties sur demande dans le cadre de transactions commerciales internationales complexes. La pr\u00e9sente affaire rev\u00eat une grande importance pour le secteur bancaire, car la clart\u00e9 et la pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 sont essentielles \u00e0 l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 de ces instruments financiers.\n[153] L\u2019appelante Eurobank Ergasias S.A. est une banque grecque dont la pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseure avait \u00e9mis en faveur de l\u2019appelant le minist\u00e8re de la D\u00e9fense de la Gr\u00e8ce (\u00ab MDG \u00bb) une garantie sur demande qui \u00e9tait r\u00e9gie par le droit grec (\u00ab Lettre de garantie \u00bb). \u00c0 la demande de l\u2019intim\u00e9e Bombardier inc., la Lettre de garantie a \u00e9t\u00e9 s\u00e9curis\u00e9e par une contre\u2011garantie \u00e9mise par l\u2019intim\u00e9e Banque Nationale du Canada (\u00ab Banque Nationale \u00bb) et r\u00e9gie par le droit qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (\u00ab Lettre de contre\u2011garantie \u00bb).\n[154] Il est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que le MDG a agi frauduleusement en demandant le paiement en vertu de la Lettre de garantie, \u00e0 la connaissance d\u2019Eurobank, de sorte que la d\u00e9cision d\u2019Eurobank de payer \u00e9tait frauduleuse aux fins de l\u2019application de la Lettre de contre\u2011garantie. Invoquant l\u2019exception de fraude, Bombardier a demand\u00e9, notamment, aux tribunaux qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois d\u2019interdire \u00e0 Banque Nationale de rembourser Eurobank en vertu de la Lettre de contre\u2011garantie. Une injonction provisoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mise. Bombardier a sollicit\u00e9 une injonction permanente au m\u00eame effet, laquelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mise par la Cour sup\u00e9rieure du Qu\u00e9bec et confirm\u00e9e, dans un arr\u00eat partag\u00e9, par la Cour d\u2019appel du Qu\u00e9bec.\n[155] Je suis d\u2019avis, \u00e0 l\u2019instar du juge Hamilton de la Cour d\u2019appel du Qu\u00e9bec, que l\u2019action intent\u00e9e par Bombardier contre Eurobank et Banque Nationale devrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e. Conclure autrement dans ce cas\u2011ci exige d\u2019\u00e9carter les d\u00e9cisions des tribunaux grecs au motif qu\u2019elles ne sont pas pertinentes, alors qu\u2019on ne peut, \u00e0 mon avis, en faire fi pour trancher la pr\u00e9sente affaire. La courtoisie internationale est un principe directeur essentiel lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de donner un effet de fait \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision \u00e9trang\u00e8re ou de l\u2019ex\u00e9cuter et, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il n\u2019y a aucune raison d\u2019ordre public qui justifierait de n\u2019accorder aucun poids aux jugements rendus par les tribunaux grecs.\n[156] Lorsque les jugements des tribunaux grecs sont pris en consid\u00e9ration, il faut \u00e0 mon avis conclure que la demande de paiement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le MDG en vertu de la Lettre de garantie n\u2019\u00e9tait ni frauduleuse ni assimilable \u00e0 une fraude. M\u00eame si j\u2019avais reconnu que la conduite du MDG \u00e9tait frauduleuse ou assimilable \u00e0 une fraude, Eurobank serait, \u00e0 mon avis, innocente de cette fraude. Il y a une contradiction inh\u00e9rente entre l\u2019exigence qu\u2019une cour de r\u00e9vision se place dans la position de la banque \u00e9mettrice au moment du paiement pour d\u00e9terminer si celle\u2011ci avait une connaissance suffisante de la fraude, tout en \u00e9cartant du m\u00eame coup les d\u00e9cisions des tribunaux comp\u00e9tents qui liaient cette banque et qui servaient de base \u00e0 cette connaissance. La conclusion du juge de premi\u00e8re instance selon laquelle l\u2019exception de fraude s\u2019applique en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, conform\u00e9ment aux conditions \u00e9tablies dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Banque de Nouvelle\u2011\u00c9cosse c. Angelica\u2011Whitewear Ltd., [1987] 1 R.C.S. 59, ne peut \u00eatre maintenue. Contrairement aux juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel, j\u2019estime que les conclusions du juge de premi\u00e8re instance et sa d\u00e9cision ultime sont entach\u00e9es d\u2019erreurs r\u00e9visables.\n[157] Pour les motifs qui suivent, je suis d\u2019avis d\u2019accueillir le pourvoi.\nII. Contexte factuel et juridique\nA. Les ententes contractuelles pertinentes\n[158] Le 20 novembre 1998, Bombardier conclut avec le MDG un contrat d\u2019approvisionnement (\u00ab Contrat d\u2019approvisionnement \u00bb) pour la fabrication de 10 a\u00e9ronefs amphibies de lutte contre les incendies CL\u2011415, ainsi que pour d\u2019autres services et \u00e9quipements, pour une valeur totale de 252 151 899 $ US. Comme condition du Contrat d\u2019approvisionnement, Bombardier devait conclure un deuxi\u00e8me contrat avec le MDG (\u00ab Contrat de compensation \u00bb). En vertu du Contrat de compensation, Bombardier s\u2019est engag\u00e9e \u00e0 confier une partie des travaux de fabrication des a\u00e9ronefs \u00e0 des fournisseurs grecs.\n[159] En concluant le Contrat de compensation, Bombardier a consenti \u00e0 une clause de dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats liquid\u00e9s, dont le montant devait \u00eatre garanti par une garantie sur demande \u00e9mise par une banque grecque (art. 20 et 21, reproduits au d.a., vol. IV, p. 95). Les parties ont convenu que tout diff\u00e9rend concernant le Contrat de compensation serait soumis \u00e0 un tribunal arbitral, si\u00e9geant \u00e0 Paris, conform\u00e9ment aux r\u00e8gles de la Chambre de commerce internationale (\u00ab Tribunal arbitral de la CCI \u00bb) (art. 25). Comme le Contrat d\u2019approvisionnement, le Contrat de compensation \u00e9tait r\u00e9gi par le droit grec (art. 28).\n[160] Le 5 f\u00e9vrier 1999, la Lettre de garantie a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mise par la pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseure d\u2019Eurobank, ANZ Grindlays Bank Limited, en faveur du MDG en vue de garantir le paiement d\u2019\u00e9ventuels dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats liquid\u00e9s[1]. La Lettre de garantie \u00e9tait s\u00e9curis\u00e9e par la Lettre de contre-garantie pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment \u00e9mise par Banque Nationale le 29 janvier 1999, \u00e0 la demande de Bombardier. Il est important de noter que la Lettre de garantie est r\u00e9gie par le droit grec, alors que la Lettre de contre\u2011garantie est r\u00e9gie par le droit qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois.\nB. Chronologie des faits\n[161] Le 30 d\u00e9cembre 2008, Bombardier d\u00e9pose une demande d\u2019arbitrage devant le Tribunal arbitral de la CCI, all\u00e9guant qu\u2019il lui est impossible de s\u2019acquitter de certaines de ses obligations pr\u00e9vues par le Contrat de compensation. Le MDG conteste la demande. Ni Eurobank ni Banque Nationale ne sont parties \u00e0 cette instance.\n[162] Le 17 juin 2010, le MDG accepte de r\u00e9duire de moiti\u00e9 le montant de la Lettre de garantie, compte tenu de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution partielle du Contrat de compensation par Bombardier (art. 21.3). La somme en litige s\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve d\u00e9sormais \u00e0 13 868 354,60 $ US.\n[163] Le 2 avril 2012, le MDG \u00e9crit \u00e0 Bombardier pour l\u2019informer que, comme cette derni\u00e8re ne s\u2019est pas acquitt\u00e9e de toutes ses obligations pr\u00e9vues dans le Contrat de compensation, le MDG entend exiger le paiement en vertu de la Lettre de garantie.\n[164] Le 10 avril 2012, Bombardier informe le MDG et le Tribunal arbitral de la CCI qu\u2019elle entend solliciter une injonction provisoire pour emp\u00eacher le MDG de se pr\u00e9valoir de la Lettre de garantie tant que la sentence arbitrale ne sera pas rendue.\n[165] Le 20 avril 2012, le MDG s\u2019engage express\u00e9ment par \u00e9crit aupr\u00e8s de Bombardier et du Tribunal arbitral de la CCI \u00e0 ne pas exiger le paiement en vertu de la Lettre de garantie [traduction] \u00ab tant et aussi longtemps que la proc\u00e9dure [d\u2019arbitrage] est en cours \u00bb et jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que la sentence finale soit rendue (\u00ab Engagement \u00e9crit \u00bb) (d.a., vol. IV, p. 199). Le MDG prend cet Engagement \u00e9crit en tenant pour acquis que l\u2019issue de l\u2019arbitrage est imminente.\n[166] Le 15 ao\u00fbt 2012, Bombardier demande la permission de modifier sa demande d\u2019arbitrage pour soulever une nouvelle question \u2014 celle de savoir si le Contrat de compensation est nul au motif qu\u2019il viole le droit de la concurrence de l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne. La permission de modifier est accord\u00e9e et Bombardier d\u00e9pose un m\u00e9moire suppl\u00e9mentaire le 3 d\u00e9cembre 2012. En raison de cette modification, une seconde audience doit \u00eatre tenue, ce qui retarde consid\u00e9rablement le d\u00e9roulement de la proc\u00e9dure d\u2019arbitrage.\n[167] Le 17 juillet 2013, plus de 15 mois apr\u00e8s la prise de l\u2019Engagement \u00e9crit, le MDG rend sa d\u00e9cision officielle approuvant le recours \u00e0 la Lettre de garantie. Il prend cette d\u00e9cision conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ses droits souverains, selon les proc\u00e9dures administratives applicables.\n[168] Le 29 juillet 2013, Bombardier et le MDG sont avis\u00e9s que le Tribunal arbitral de la CCI rendra sa sentence finale au plus tard le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2013.\n[169] Le 31 juillet 2013, le MDG adresse \u00e0 Bombardier une lettre l\u2019informant qu\u2019elle a manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 ses obligations pr\u00e9vues dans le Contrat de compensation et qu\u2019elle doit payer la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 (13 868 354,60 $ US).\n[170] Le 5 ao\u00fbt 2013, le MDG demande une premi\u00e8re fois \u00e0 Eurobank de lui payer sans d\u00e9lai la somme exigible en vertu de la Lettre de garantie.\n[171] Le 13 ao\u00fbt 2013, \u00e0 la demande de Bombardier, le Tribunal arbitral de la CCI \u00e9met une ordonnance provisoire interdisant au MDG de demander un paiement en vertu de la Lettre de garantie tant que sa sentence finale ne sera pas rendue (\u00ab Ordonnance provisoire \u00bb). Encore une fois, ni Eurobank ni Banque Nationale ne sont parties \u00e0 l\u2019instance dans le cadre de laquelle l\u2019Ordonnance provisoire est demand\u00e9e.\n[172] Le m\u00eame jour, Banque Nationale re\u00e7oit un affidavit d\u2019Eurobank l\u2019informant que, m\u00eame si elle n\u2019a pas re\u00e7u de nouvelle demande de paiement du MDG, elle s\u2019attend \u00e0 en recevoir une. Bombardier \u00e9crit alors au MDG pour obtenir l\u2019assurance qu\u2019il se conformera \u00e0 l\u2019Ordonnance provisoire.\n[173] Le 14 ao\u00fbt 2013, l\u2019avocat du MDG r\u00e9pond que son client n\u2019est pas en mesure de s\u2019engager par \u00e9crit \u00e0 se conformer \u00e0 l\u2019Ordonnance provisoire. Devant ce refus du MDG de lui donner l\u2019assurance qu\u2019elle r\u00e9clame, Bombardier pr\u00e9sente une demande d\u2019injonction devant le juge Pr\u00e9vost de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure du Qu\u00e9bec.\n[174] Au cours de l\u2019audience sur la demande d\u2019injonction, Bombardier apprend que, le 12 ao\u00fbt 2013, Eurobank a re\u00e7u une deuxi\u00e8me demande de paiement du MDG en vertu de la Lettre de garantie. Cette demande \u00e9tait conforme aux conditions de la Lettre de garantie.\n[175] Le 16 ao\u00fbt 2013, Eurobank pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 Banque Nationale une demande de paiement en vertu de la Lettre de contre\u2011garantie, lui pr\u00e9cisant que le MDG insiste pour qu\u2019Eurobank paye en vertu de la Lettre de garantie.\n[176] Le m\u00eame jour, le juge Pr\u00e9vost de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure du Qu\u00e9bec accueille la requ\u00eate en injonction provisoire de Bombardier, en vigueur jusqu\u2019au 26 ao\u00fbt 2013, et ordonne au MDG de retirer sa demande de paiement. Le juge Pr\u00e9vost ordonne \u00e9galement \u00e0 Eurobank de n\u2019effectuer aucun paiement en vertu de la Lettre de garantie et \u00e0 Banque Nationale de n\u2019effectuer aucun paiement en vertu de la Lettre de contre\u2011garantie (2013 QCCS 6892 (\u00ab Injonction du juge Pr\u00e9vost \u00bb)). Cette injonction est \u00e9mise en application de l\u2019art. 3138 du Code civil du Qu\u00e9bec (\u00ab C.c.Q. \u00bb) et de l\u2019art. 940.4 de l\u2019ancien Code de proc\u00e9dure civile, RLRQ, c. C\u201125 (\u00ab C.p.c. \u00bb) (qui correspond essentiellement \u00e0 l\u2019art. 623 du Code de proc\u00e9dure civile, RLRQ, c. C\u201125.01), lequel permet aux tribunaux qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois d\u2019\u00ab accorder avant ou pendant la proc\u00e9dure d\u2019arbitrage, des mesures provisionnelles \u00bb. Encore une fois, seulement Bombardier et le MDG sont parties \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure d\u2019arbitrage.\n[177] Le 20 ao\u00fbt 2013, Eurobank saisit la Cour de premi\u00e8re instance \u00e0 juge unique d\u2019Ath\u00e8nes d\u2019une demande d\u2019injonction enjoignant au MDG de retirer sa demande de paiement en vertu de la Lettre de garantie et lui interdisant de pr\u00e9senter de nouvelles demandes tant que la sentence finale du Tribunal arbitral de la CCI n\u2019aura pas \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue.\n[178] Le 22 ao\u00fbt 2013, la juge Pana de la Cour de premi\u00e8re instance \u00e0 juge unique d\u2019Ath\u00e8nes permet [traduction] \u00ab \u00e0 la demanderesse (temporairement) de ne pas liquider la lettre de garantie sans avoir \u00e0 subir de cons\u00e9quences juridiques ou devoir payer des p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019instruction de la requ\u00eate en mesures provisoires \u00e0 la date d\u2019audience indiqu\u00e9e ci\u2011apr\u00e8s \u00bb (\u00ab Injonction de la juge Pana \u00bb; d.a., vol. VI, p. 29).\n[179] L\u2019injonction du juge Pr\u00e9vost, qui ne devait rester en vigueur que pour 10 jours, expire le 26 ao\u00fbt 2013. Bombardier n\u2019en demande le renouvellement que quatre mois plus tard.\n[180] Le 22 novembre 2013, la demande d\u2019injonction d\u2019Eurobank est examin\u00e9e au m\u00e9rite par le juge Kostis de la Cour de premi\u00e8re instance \u00e0 juge unique d\u2019Ath\u00e8nes. L\u2019Injonction de la juge Pana est prolong\u00e9e jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que le juge Kostis rende sa d\u00e9cision finale.\n[181] Le 5 d\u00e9cembre 2013, le Tribunal arbitral de la CCI informe Bombardier et le MDG qu\u2019il a transmis sa sentence finale \u00e0 la Cour de la CCI pour approbation.\n[182] Le 16 d\u00e9cembre 2013, le juge Kostis rend sa d\u00e9cision et rejette la demande d\u2019injonction d\u2019Eurobank (\u00ab D\u00e9cision du juge Kostis \u00bb). Il n\u2019y a pas d\u2019appel possible de cette d\u00e9cision.\n[183] Le 18 d\u00e9cembre 2013, agissant sur la foi de la D\u00e9cision du juge Kostis, le MDG adresse \u00e0 Eurobank sa troisi\u00e8me et derni\u00e8re demande de paiement en vertu de la Lettre de garantie.\n[184] Le 19 d\u00e9cembre 2013, Eurobank informe Banque Nationale que sa demande d\u2019injonction a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e par le juge Kostis. Elle lui explique \u00e9galement que l\u2019Injonction de la juge Pana n\u2019a donc plus d\u2019effet et que, comme il n\u2019existe plus d\u2019injonction en vigueur, elle doit payer le MDG. En cons\u00e9quence, Eurobank demande le paiement en vertu de la Lettre de contre\u2011garantie.\n[185] Le m\u00eame jour, Bombardier d\u00e9pose une demande visant l\u2019obtention d\u2019injonctions provisoires, interlocutoires et permanentes.\n[186] Le 20 d\u00e9cembre 2013, le juge Davis renouvelle l\u2019Injonction du juge Pr\u00e9vost pour une p\u00e9riode de 10 jours (\u00ab Injonction du juge Davis \u00bb). Cette injonction est rendue elle aussi en application de l\u2019art. 3138 C.c.Q. et de l\u2019art. 940.4 de l\u2019ancien C.p.c.\n[187] Le 23 d\u00e9cembre 2013, le Tribunal arbitral de la CCI informe les parties que sa sentence finale a \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9e et qu\u2019elle leur sera transmise le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2013.\n[188] Le m\u00eame jour, Eurobank communique avec le MDG et lui demande de reconsid\u00e9rer sa demande de paiement \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de l\u2019Injonction du juge Davis. En r\u00e9ponse, le MDG signifie \u00e0 Eurobank une mise en demeure par laquelle il lui ordonne de proc\u00e9der sans d\u00e9lai au paiement conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la Lettre de garantie, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de quoi le MDG prendrait [traduction] \u00ab non seulement des moyens l\u00e9gaux civils, mais \u00e9galement p\u00e9naux \u00bb contre Eurobank (\u00ab Prot\u00eat extrajudiciaire \u00bb) (d.a., vol. VI, p. 151 (soulignement et italique omis)).\n[189] Le 24 d\u00e9cembre 2013, Eurobank paie au MDG la somme de 13 868 354,60 $ US en vertu de la Lettre de garantie.\n[190] Le 27 d\u00e9cembre 2013, Eurobank r\u00e9it\u00e8re sa demande de paiement en vertu de la Lettre de contre-garantie.\n[191] Le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2013, le Tribunal arbitral de la CCI rend sa sentence finale (\u00ab Sentence arbitrale \u00bb), o\u00f9 il est statu\u00e9 que [traduction] \u00ab [l]e Contrat de compensation est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 nul ab initio, ainsi que sa clause 20 concernant les dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats liquid\u00e9s et sa clause 21 relative \u00e0 la Lettre de garantie \u00bb (d.a., vol. VI, p. 143).\n[192] Le 8 janvier 2014, le juge Schrager (alors juge \u00e0 la Cour sup\u00e9rieure du Qu\u00e9bec) \u00e9met une ordonnance de sauvegarde interdisant \u00e0 Banque Nationale d\u2019effectuer un paiement en vertu de la Lettre de contre\u2011garantie jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que l\u2019affaire soit tranch\u00e9e d\u00e9finitivement par un tribunal qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois.\n[193] Le 14 avril 2015, la Cour d\u2019appel de Paris confirme la Sentence arbitrale \u00e0 tous \u00e9gards.\n[194] Le 24 d\u00e9cembre 2018, Eurobank introduit une instance devant la Cour de premi\u00e8re instance \u00e0 juge unique d\u2019Ath\u00e8nes contre le MDG pour enrichissement sans cause afin de recouvrer la somme qu\u2019elle a pay\u00e9e en vertu de la Lettre de garantie.\n[195] Le 29 novembre 2019, la Cour de premi\u00e8re instance \u00e0 juge unique d\u2019Ath\u00e8nes rend sa d\u00e9cision en faveur d\u2019Eurobank et ordonne au MDG de lui rembourser les fonds.\n[196] Le 8 d\u00e9cembre 2020, cette d\u00e9cision est infirm\u00e9e par la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ath\u00e8nes, qui conclut que le MDG n\u2019est pas li\u00e9 par (1) l\u2019Engagement \u00e9crit ou (2) l\u2019Ordonnance provisoire. Eurobank interjette ensuite appel de cette d\u00e9cision devant la Cour supr\u00eame de Gr\u00e8ce.\n[197] Le 9 janvier 2024, la Cour supr\u00eame de Gr\u00e8ce rend sa d\u00e9cision, confirmant les conclusions de la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ath\u00e8nes dans leur int\u00e9gralit\u00e9. La d\u00e9cision de la Cour supr\u00eame de Gr\u00e8ce est rendue apr\u00e8s l\u2019audience devant notre Cour, alors que l\u2019appel est en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9. Cette d\u00e9cision est finale et sans appel. Eurobank a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 avec succ\u00e8s une requ\u00eate visant la production de cette d\u00e9cision comme \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve suppl\u00e9mentaire devant notre Cour. Comme la d\u00e9cision porte sur une \u00ab question d\u00e9cisive ou potentiellement d\u00e9cisive \u00bb, la requ\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 accueillie \u00e0 bon droit (Palmer c. La Reine, [1980] 1 R.C.S. 759, p. 775).\nIII. Historique des proc\u00e9dures\nA. Cour sup\u00e9rieure du Qu\u00e9bec, 2018 QCCS 2127 (le juge Wery)\n[198] Bombardier a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour sup\u00e9rieure du Qu\u00e9bec une injonction interdisant \u00e0 Banque Nationale de payer toute somme en vertu de la Lettre de contre\u2011garantie; elle a aussi demand\u00e9 l\u2019homologation de la Sentence arbitrale.\n[199] En ce qui concerne la demande d\u2019injonction pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Bombardier, le juge Wery a reconnu l\u2019important principe de l\u2019autonomie des lettres de cr\u00e9dit, et l\u2019exception de fraude qui peut lui \u00eatre oppos\u00e9e. Il a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que la conduite du MDG constituait une fraude pour les raisons suivantes : le MDG a menac\u00e9 Eurobank de graves cons\u00e9quences si elle n\u2019obtemp\u00e9rait pas \u00e0 sa demande de paiement, la demande de paiement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite quelques jours seulement avant le prononc\u00e9 de la Sentence arbitrale, et la demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite au m\u00e9pris tant de l\u2019Ordonnance provisoire que de l\u2019Injonction du juge Davis.\n[200] Eurobank a fait valoir que, malgr\u00e9 la conduite r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible du MDG, elle n\u2019avait pas agi frauduleusement parce qu\u2019elle avait fait tout en son pouvoir pour \u00e9viter d\u2019acc\u00e9der \u00e0 la demande du MDG et qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait effectu\u00e9 le paiement que sous la menace de graves r\u00e9percussions sur le plan juridique. En rejetant cet argument, le juge Wery a reconnu qu\u2019Eurobank \u00e9tait plac\u00e9e devant un choix difficile, mais, selon lui, la d\u00e9cision d\u2019Eurobank de payer \u00e9tait injustifi\u00e9e compte tenu de la fraude du MDG. Par cons\u00e9quent, Banque Nationale s\u2019est vu ordonner de ne verser aucune somme en vertu de la Lettre de contre\u2011garantie.\n[201] Le juge Wery a homologu\u00e9 la Sentence arbitrale et a enjoint au MDG de s\u2019y conformer. Comme le Tribunal arbitral de la CCI avait conclu que le Contrat de compensation \u00e9tait nul ab initio, il s\u2019ensuivait, selon le juge Wery, que les instruments \u00e9mis pour en garantir l\u2019ex\u00e9cution \u00e9taient eux aussi nuls.\nB. Cour d\u2019appel du Qu\u00e9bec, 2022 QCCA 802\n(1) Le juge Mainville, avec l\u2019accord de la juge Baudouin\n[202] Le juge Mainville, au nom des juges majoritaires, a accueilli l\u2019appel en partie seulement afin de retirer de la d\u00e9cision du juge Wery l\u2019ordonnance enjoignant au MDG de se conformer \u00e0 la Sentence arbitrale. Il a statu\u00e9 que la Cour sup\u00e9rieure du Qu\u00e9bec n\u2019avait pas juridiction pour ordonner au MDG de se conformer \u00e0 la Sentence arbitrale, puisqu\u2019il n\u2019est ni domicili\u00e9 ni r\u00e9sident au Qu\u00e9bec. Il a par ailleurs conclu que le juge Wery n\u2019avait commis aucune autre erreur r\u00e9visable, y compris en concluant que la Lettre de contre\u2011garantie n\u2019\u00e9tait pas ex\u00e9cutoire dans les circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[203] Le juge Mainville a conclu que la conduite du MDG constituait une fraude. Il a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019argument du MDG qui affirmait qu\u2019il ne pouvait avoir agi frauduleusement \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait conform\u00e9 aux jugements des tribunaux grecs et au droit grec. Le juge Mainville a estim\u00e9 que des consid\u00e9rations d\u2019ordre public l\u2019obligeaient \u00e0 ne pas tenir compte de la D\u00e9cision du juge Kostis et de l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ath\u00e8nes. Le juge Wery avait donc eu raison de n\u2019accorder aucun poids \u00e0 la D\u00e9cision du juge Kostis. Par cons\u00e9quent, le juge Mainville a estim\u00e9 qu\u2019Eurobank avait une connaissance suffisante de la fraude du MDG avant le paiement.\n(2) Le juge Hamilton, dissident\n[204] Le juge Hamilton \u00e9tait dissident. Il aurait accueilli l\u2019appel et annul\u00e9 en partie le jugement du juge Wery. Il aurait rejet\u00e9 l\u2019action intent\u00e9e par Bombardier contre Eurobank et Banque Nationale.\n[205] Le juge Hamilton a estim\u00e9 que le juge Wery avait impos\u00e9 un fardeau trop lourd \u00e0 Eurobank. M\u00eame si le dossier pouvait laisser entendre que la conduite du MDG \u00e9tait frauduleuse, il ne s\u2019ensuivait pas n\u00e9cessairement qu\u2019Eurobank avait connaissance de cette fraude ou qu\u2019elle y avait particip\u00e9, de sorte qu\u2019elle ne pouvait lui \u00eatre imput\u00e9e comme la sienne.\n[206] Le texte de la Lettre de garantie \u00e9tablissait clairement (1) que le MDG n\u2019\u00e9tait pas tenu d\u2019obtenir un jugement confirmant que de l\u2019argent lui \u00e9tait d\u00fb avant de pouvoir avoir recours \u00e0 la lettre de garantie et (2) qu\u2019Eurobank ne pouvait refuser de payer m\u00eame si Bombardier avait intent\u00e9 une action en justice, et ce, devant quelque tribunal de quelque pays que ce soit.\n[207] M\u00eame si une injonction pouvait \u00eatre sollicit\u00e9e pour emp\u00eacher la pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019une demande en vertu de la Lettre de garantie, cette injonction devait \u00eatre \u00e9mise par la bonne cour et pour la bonne raison. Bombardier n\u2019a pas tent\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir une ordonnance d\u2019injonction aupr\u00e8s des tribunaux grecs, qui \u00e9taient les tribunaux comp\u00e9tents. Le juge Kostis a refus\u00e9 d\u2019accorder l\u2019injonction sollicit\u00e9e par Eurobank. Aucun appel de cette d\u00e9cision n\u2019\u00e9tait possible. Le juge Hamilton a conclu que, dans ces circonstances, on pouvait difficilement reprocher \u00e0 Eurobank de ne pas s\u2019\u00eatre conform\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019Ordonnance provisoire et \u00e0 l\u2019Injonction du juge Davis.\n[208] Eurobank savait que la demande frauduleuse du MDG avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e juste \u00e0 la veille du prononc\u00e9 de la sentence arbitrale finale, mais elle ne savait pas que le MDG s\u2019attendait \u00e0 \u00eatre d\u00e9bout\u00e9 et qu\u2019il avait l\u2019intention de conserver les fonds, peu importe l\u2019issue de l\u2019arbitrage. \u00c0 ce stade, Eurobank n\u2019avait que des soup\u00e7ons; elle a fait preuve de diligence, a entrepris certaines v\u00e9rifications et a sollicit\u00e9 une ordonnance d\u2019injonction, qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e. Il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas clair ou \u00e9vident, \u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0, qu\u2019une fraude avait \u00e9t\u00e9 commise.\n[209] Le juge Hamilton a fait observer que la transaction \u00e9tait cens\u00e9e \u00eatre sans risque pour Eurobank, et que celle-ci ne devrait pas avoir \u00e0 assumer le risque de la conduite frauduleuse du MDG. Bombardier savait, ou aurait d\u00fb savoir, qu\u2019il y avait des risques \u00e0 faire affaire avec un organe du gouvernement grec et elle a assum\u00e9 ces risques en raison du profit qu\u2019elle esp\u00e9rait r\u00e9aliser dans le cadre du contrat d\u2019approvisionnement.\nIV. Questions en litige\n[210] Eurobank soul\u00e8ve les trois questions suivantes dans son m\u00e9moire :\n(1) Quelles sont les limites appropri\u00e9es de l\u2019exception de fraude \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie des garanties sur demande?\n(2) Les tribunaux qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois peuvent\u2011ils d\u00e9cider que la conduite d\u2019Eurobank en \u00e9tait une de mauvaise foi lorsqu\u2019elle s\u2019est conform\u00e9e aux jugements rendus par les tribunaux grecs?\n(3) Comment doit \u00eatre r\u00e9parti le risque entre les parties \u00e0 un ensemble complexe de transactions commerciales qui implique des garanties sur demande?\nV. Analyse\n[211] Je crois qu\u2019une pr\u00e9cision s\u2019impose en d\u00e9but d\u2019analyse. Bien que les parties et les juridictions inf\u00e9rieures qualifient les instruments en litige de lettres de cr\u00e9dit, il convient de les appeler garanties sur demande.\n[212] L\u2019utilisation des lettres de cr\u00e9dit et des garanties sur demande est largement r\u00e9pandue dans les transactions commerciales internationales. Ces instruments financiers sont \u00e9mis par des banques pour garantir l\u2019ex\u00e9cution par les parties de leurs obligations contractuelles. Bien que les lettres de cr\u00e9dit et les garanties sur demande soient de nature semblable et qu\u2019elles soient r\u00e9gies, dans une large mesure, par les m\u00eames principes, elles ont chacune un objectif distinct. Les lettres de cr\u00e9dit visent \u00e0 garantir l\u2019ex\u00e9cution d\u2019une transaction; les parties sont cens\u00e9es y recourir comme principal mode de paiement. Les garanties sur demande, comme les lettres de cr\u00e9dit standby, sont contingentes par nature. Les parties n\u2019y ont recours qu\u2019en cas d\u2019inex\u00e9cution totale ou partielle d\u2019une obligation contractuelle (R. Goode, \u00ab Abstract Payment Undertakings in International Transactions \u00bb (1996), 22 Brook. J. Int\u2019l L. 1, p. 3\u20114).\n[213] Il convient de d\u00e9signer la Lettre de garantie et la Lettre de contre\u2011garantie comme des garanties sur demande dans les circonstances. Il en est ainsi pour deux raisons. Premi\u00e8rement, ces instruments ont pour objet de garantir le paiement au titre de la clause relative aux dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats liquid\u00e9s du Contrat de compensation, de sorte qu\u2019ils sont contingents par nature. Ils ne pouvaient \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9s que si Bombardier ne s\u2019acquittait pas de ses obligations en mati\u00e8re de compensation. Deuxi\u00e8mement, il est express\u00e9ment \u00e9nonc\u00e9 que la Lettre de garantie et la Lettre de contre\u2011garantie sont assujetties aux R\u00e8gles uniformes relatives aux garanties sur demande (1992) : [traduction] \u00ab NOTRE CONTRE\u2011GARANTIE [. . .] EST ASSUJETTIE AUX R\u00c8GLES UNIFORMES RELATIVES AUX GARANTIES SUR DEMANDE (PUBLICATION DE LA CCI 458) \u00bb (d.a., vol. IV, p. 118).\nA. Les garanties sur demande sont autonomes\n[214] Les garanties sur demande sont des contrats \u00e9tablis \u00e0 la demande d\u2019un donneur d\u2019ordre par lequel le garant, g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement une banque, s\u2019engage irr\u00e9vocablement \u00e0 payer le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire sur demande, ind\u00e9pendamment de tout litige pouvant opposer le donneur d\u2019ordre et le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire. Comme les lettres de cr\u00e9dit, les garanties sur demande sont autonomes. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Angelica\u2011Whitewear, l\u2019arr\u00eat de principe au Canada en mati\u00e8re de lettres de cr\u00e9dit, le juge Le Dain a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 comme suit la raison d\u2019\u00eatre du principe de l\u2019autonomie :\nLe principe fondamental r\u00e9gissant les lettres de cr\u00e9dit documentaires et la caract\u00e9ristique qui leur donne leur utilit\u00e9 et leur efficacit\u00e9 commerciales internationales sont que l\u2019obligation de la banque \u00e9mettrice d\u2019honorer une traite tir\u00e9e sur un cr\u00e9dit lorsqu\u2019elle est accompagn\u00e9e de documents qui pr\u00e9sentent l\u2019apparence de conformit\u00e9 avec les conditions du cr\u00e9dit est ind\u00e9pendante de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du contrat sous\u2011jacent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard duquel le cr\u00e9dit a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9. Les diff\u00e9rends entre les parties relativement \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du contrat sous\u2011jacent ne peuvent en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale justifier le refus par la banque \u00e9mettrice d\u2019honorer une traite qui est accompagn\u00e9e par des documents apparemment conformes. [Je souligne; p. 70.]\n[215] Ce raisonnement vaut aussi pour les garanties sur demande. Le juge Le Dain, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Angelica\u2011Whitewear, a fait observer que le principe de l\u2019autonomie se d\u00e9gage de la disposition g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des R\u00e8gles et usances uniformes relatives aux cr\u00e9dits documentaires (1962). Il ressort \u00e9galement des r\u00e8gles internationales qui r\u00e9gissent les garanties sur demande, soit les R\u00e8gles uniformes relatives aux garanties sur demande (1992), ainsi que de leur version r\u00e9vis\u00e9e de 2011. Les articles 2b) et 2c) des r\u00e8gles uniformes de 1992 consacrent explicitement le principe de l\u2019autonomie :\nb) Les garanties sont, par leur nature, un engagement distinct du ou des contrats ou conditions d\u2019adjudication pouvant en former la base, et les Garants ne sont en aucune fa\u00e7on concern\u00e9s ni engag\u00e9s par ces contrats ou conditions d\u2019adjudication, m\u00eame si la Garantie y fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence. Le devoir d\u2019un Garant aux termes d\u2019une Garantie est de payer la ou les sommes qui y sont stipul\u00e9es, sur pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019une demande de paiement \u00e9crite et autres documents sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9s dans la Garantie qui semblent \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue conformes aux termes de la Garantie.\nc) . . . Les Contregaranties sont par nature ind\u00e9pendantes de la Garantie \u00e0 laquelle elles se rapportent ainsi que de tous contrats de base ou conditions d\u2019adjudication et les Contregarants ne sont en aucune fa\u00e7on concern\u00e9s ou li\u00e9s par ces Garanties, contrats ou conditions d\u2019adjudication, m\u00eame si la Contregarantie inclut une r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 ceux\u2011ci.\n[216] Bien que les conditions relatives au paiement d\u2019une garantie sur demande refl\u00e8tent le contrat sous\u2011jacent, le garant s\u2019engage \u00e0 payer ind\u00e9pendamment de faits ou d\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nements ext\u00e9rieurs. En ce sens, la garantie sur demande est ind\u00e9pendante du contrat sous\u2011jacent (N. L\u2019Heureux et M. Lacoursi\u00e8re, Droit bancaire (5e \u00e9d. 2017), p. 428\u2011429). De fait, lorsque les parties \u00e0 une transaction commerciale s\u2019entendent pour utiliser des garanties sur demande afin de garantir l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de leurs obligations, elles expriment leur intention d\u2019\u00eatre li\u00e9es par une structure de type [traduction] \u00ab payez maintenant, argumentez plus tard \u00bb (J. F. Dolan, \u00ab Tethering the Fraud Inquiry in Letter of Credit Law \u00bb (2006), 21 B.F.L.R. 479, p. 480 (je souligne)).\n[217] L\u2019obligation de payer du garant peut \u00eatre d\u00e9clench\u00e9e seulement selon les conditions pr\u00e9cis\u00e9es par le donneur d\u2019ordre. Ces exigences peuvent \u00e9galement \u00eatre compl\u00e9t\u00e9es par les R\u00e8gles uniformes relatives aux garanties sur demande si elles sont express\u00e9ment incorpor\u00e9es. Une fois les conditions \u00e9tablies, \u00ab le seul contr\u00f4le [que la banque, et non le donneur d\u2019ordre,] peut exercer est celui de la r\u00e9gularit\u00e9 des documents soumis par le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire \u00bb (C. Gilbert, \u00ab Similarit\u00e9s et distinctions entre la fraude du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire d\u2019un cr\u00e9dit documentaire et celle du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire d\u2019une garantie de bonne ex\u00e9cution \u00bb (1987), 17 R.D.U.S. 585, p. 590). Le r\u00f4le du garant, qui consiste \u00e0 examiner avec \u00ab un soin raisonnable \u00bb (R\u00e8gles uniformes relatives aux garanties sur demande (1992), art. 9) les documents pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s pour s\u2019assurer qu\u2019ils respectent rigoureusement les conditions de la garantie sur demande, est \u00ab purement financier \u00bb (Gilbert, p. 590). \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, le juge Le Dain a \u00e9crit que \u00ab [l]a r\u00e8gle fondamentale porte que, apr\u00e8s un examen raisonnablement attentif, les documents doivent pr\u00e9senter une apparence de conformit\u00e9 avec les conditions de la lettre de cr\u00e9dit \u00bb (Angelica\u2011Whitewear, p. 94 (en italique dans l\u2019original)).\n[218] Le r\u00f4le de la banque en tant que garant est donc simple. La banque doit payer lorsqu\u2019elle re\u00e7oit une demande conforme. Elle ne peut pas s\u2019enqu\u00e9rir des circonstances entourant le contrat sous\u2011jacent pour savoir si l\u2019obligation vis\u00e9e par la garantie sur demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e. La banque ne dispose pas des comp\u00e9tences et de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es n\u00e9cessaires pour [traduction] \u00ab arbitrer les questions qui divisent les parties au contrat sous\u2011jacent \u00bb (R. F. Bertrams, Bank Guarantees in International Trade (4e \u00e9d. r\u00e9v. 2013), p. 82). La banque ne devrait pas et n\u2019est pas cens\u00e9e [traduction] \u00ab s\u2019immiscer dans des controverses \u00bb entre les parties au contrat sous\u2011jacent (Sztejn c. J. Henry Schroder Banking Corp., 31 N.Y.S.2d 631 (Sup. Ct. 1941), p. 633).\nB. L\u2019exception de fraude opposable au principe de l\u2019autonomie\n[219] L\u2019obligation de payer du garant lorsqu\u2019on lui pr\u00e9sente une demande conforme souffre d\u2019une exception : la fraude. Selon l\u2019arr\u00eat Angelica\u2011Whitewear, le donneur d\u2019ordre dispose de deux avenues pour emp\u00eacher le paiement au titre de la garantie sur demande. D\u2019abord, il peut saisir le tribunal comp\u00e9tent d\u2019une demande d\u2019injonction interlocutoire pour emp\u00eacher la banque d\u2019honorer la demande en pr\u00e9sentant une solide preuve prima facie de fraude. Sinon, le donneur d\u2019ordre doit pr\u00e9senter au garant des preuves suffisantes de fraude avant que le paiement soit effectu\u00e9. Le garant ne doit refuser d\u2019effectuer le paiement que dans les rares cas o\u00f9 il a une connaissance claire ou \u00e9vidente de la fraude (Angelica\u2011Whitewear, p. 84).\n[220] Les deux raisons d\u2019\u00eatre de l\u2019exception de fraude sont d\u2019assurer que les tribunaux n\u2019endossent pas la fraude et de prot\u00e9ger l\u2019utilit\u00e9 et l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 commerciales des garanties sur demande (R. P. Buckley et X. Gao, \u00ab The Development of the Fraud Rule in Letter of Credit Law : The Journey So Far and the Road Ahead \u00bb (2002), 23 U. Pa. J. Int\u2019l Econ. L. 663, p. 664\u2011667). L\u2019exception doit demeurer limit\u00e9e. Comme l\u2019a soulign\u00e9 le juge Le Dain, dans le contexte des lettres de cr\u00e9dit, \u00ab [l]a port\u00e9e potentielle de l\u2019exception de fraude ne doit pas constituer un moyen pour cr\u00e9er une incertitude et un manque de confiance graves dans le fonctionnement d\u2019op\u00e9rations par lettres de cr\u00e9dit et, en m\u00eame temps, l\u2019application du principe de l\u2019autonomie ne doit pas servir \u00e0 encourager ou \u00e0 faciliter la fraude dans ces op\u00e9rations \u00bb (Angelica\u2011Whitewear, p. 72). Il en va de m\u00eame pour les garanties sur demande. Les parties ne doivent pas avoir recours aux tribunaux pour emp\u00eacher les banques d\u2019honorer une garantie sur demande lorsqu\u2019il n\u2019existe pas de solide preuve prima facie de fraude ou que la preuve d\u2019une fraude claire ou \u00e9vidente ne peut pas \u00eatre \u00e9tablie.\n(1) La norme \u00e0 satisfaire pour \u00e9tablir la fraude est on\u00e9reuse\n[221] Les tribunaux peuvent examiner les documents pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s ou le contrat sous-jacent pour d\u00e9tecter une fraude (Angelica\u2011Whitewear, p. 83). Toutefois, une all\u00e9gation de fraude n\u2019est pas une invitation lanc\u00e9e aux tribunaux de laisser des parties commerciales avis\u00e9es remodeler leur entente en adoptant une structure de type [traduction] \u00ab argumentez maintenant, payez plus tard \u00bb lorsque la norme n\u2019est pas satisfaite (Dolan, p. 480 (je souligne)). La norme \u00e0 satisfaire pour \u00e9tablir la fraude est on\u00e9reuse, et l\u2019exception ne s\u2019applique pas lorsque le donneur d\u2019ordre peut seulement prouver un comportement repr\u00e9sentant [traduction] \u00ab un agissement moins grave qu\u2019une fraude \u00bb (Standard Trust Co. (Liquidation) c. Bank of Nova Scotia, 2001 NFCA 27, 201 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 8, par. 70\u201172; voir aussi Northern American Trust Co. c. Hospitality Equity Corp., [1995] A.J. No. 1306 (Lexis), 1995 CarswellAlta 1171 (WL) (B.R.), par. 31; Johannesen (Re), 2002 ABQB 756, 218 D.L.R. (4th) 148, par. 47).\n[222] Dans ce contexte, il n\u2019existe pas de d\u00e9finition pr\u00e9cise de la fraude et le juge Le Dain n\u2019en a pas donn\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Angelica\u2011Whitewear. De fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, la fraude touche certains aspects de l\u2019\u00ab ordre public \u00bb (J. Stoufflet, \u00ab Fraud in Documentary Credit, Letter of Credit and Demand Guaranty \u00bb (2001), 106 Dick. L. Rev. 21, p. 23). Je suis d\u2019accord avec l\u2019intervenante, l\u2019Association des banquiers canadiens, pour dire que la mauvaise foi \u00e0 elle seule ne suffit pas pour \u00e9tablir la fraude (m.interv., par. 22). Il doit y avoir d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments, propres au contexte pr\u00e9cis des garanties sur demande (Bertrams, p. 373). Les d\u00e9cisions o\u00f9 les tribunaux ont appliqu\u00e9 l\u2019exception de fraude se fondent souvent sur la d\u00e9finition \u00e9nonc\u00e9e par le juge Blair (alors juge \u00e0 la Cour de justice de l\u2019Ontario, division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale) dans le jugement Cineplex Odeon Corp. c. 100 Bloor West General Partner Inc., [1993] O.J. No. 112 (Lexis), 1993 CarswellOnt 2358 (WL) (C.J. (div. g\u00e9n.)), par. 31\u201132 (WL) :\n[traduction] La fraude est un mot simple de six lettres, qui signifie exactement ce qu\u2019il veut dire : \u00ab fraude \u00bb. La fraude n\u2019est pas simplement un diff\u00e9rend ou un d\u00e9saccord l\u00e9gitime sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation d\u2019un contrat, aussi in\u00e9gal que puisse para\u00eetre ce diff\u00e9rend. Bien que la notion de fraude puisse \u00e9chapper \u00e0 une d\u00e9finition pr\u00e9cise, il s\u2019agit d\u2019un concept bien connu en droit et, \u00e0 mon avis, elle doit impliquer le recours \u00e0 certains actes irr\u00e9guliers, malhonn\u00eates ou trompeurs. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Washburn c. Wright (1913), 31 O.L.R. 138 (Div. app.), le juge Riddell a d\u00e9clar\u00e9, \u00e0 la p. 147 :\nMais, supposons que le d\u00e9fendeur se soit m\u00e9pris sur ce point ou sur tout autre point, il n\u2019y a absolument aucune preuve de fraude. La fraude n\u2019est pas une erreur dans l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation d\u2019un contrat; elle doit \u00eatre \u00ab un acte malhonn\u00eate et moralement r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible accompli dans le dessein de causer de graves torts et pr\u00e9judices \u00e0 autrui par le recours \u00e0 des moyens qu\u2019il convient de qualifier d\u2019ill\u00e9gaux \u00bb : Ex p. Watson (1888), 21 Q.B.D. 301, le juge Wills, p. 309.\nLes cas dans lesquels la demande de paiement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vertu de la lettre de cr\u00e9dit peut \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9e de \u00ab manifestement fausse \u00bb ou \u00ab totalement injustifi\u00e9e \u00bb ou dans lesquels il est \u00e9vident qu\u2019il n\u2019existe \u00ab aucun droit au paiement \u00bb rel\u00e8vent tous des principes qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent et doivent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s en fonction de ces principes \u00ab en mati\u00e8re de fraude \u00bb : voir C.D.N. Research & Development Ltd. c. Bank of Nova Scotia (1980), 18 C.P.C. 62 (H.C. Ont.), p. 65; Henderson c. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (1982), 40 B.C.L.R. 318 (C.S. C.\u2011B.), p. 320; Edward Owen Engineering Ltd. c. Barclays Bank International Ltd.[, [1978] 1 Q.B. 159 (C.A.)], p. 169. [Je souligne.]\nComme l\u2019a not\u00e9 le juge Blair, il doit y avoir certains actes irr\u00e9guliers, malhonn\u00eates ou trompeurs; il doit s\u2019agir d\u2019une affaire o\u00f9 la demande de paiement au titre de la garantie peut \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9e de \u00ab manifestement fausse \u00bb ou de \u00ab totalement injustifi\u00e9e \u00bb ou encore o\u00f9 \u00ab il est \u00e9vident qu\u2019il n\u2019y a \u201caucun droit au paiement\u201d \u00bb.\n[223] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, je suis d\u2019accord avec mon coll\u00e8gue pour dire que \u00ab le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire qui demande le paiement tout en sachant qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas le droit d\u2019\u00eatre pay\u00e9 au titre du contrat sous-jacent peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme ayant commis une fraude \u00bb (motifs du juge Kasirer, par. 114, citant K. McGuinness, The Law of Guarantee (3e \u00e9d. 2013), \u00a717.338). Toutefois, il est essentiel dans chaque cas de comprendre le contexte factuel. Ce qui \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 peut constituer une demande valide peut ult\u00e9rieurement \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme invalide. Cela ne veut pas dire que le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire n\u2019avait pas \u00e0 ce moment le droit de pr\u00e9senter sa demande de paiement. Encore une fois, une demande de garantie est, de par sa nature m\u00eame, ind\u00e9pendante \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de tout litige sous\u2011jacent. Une demande de paiement sera frauduleuse seulement s\u2019il est \u00e9vident pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire qu\u2019il n\u2019existait aucun droit au paiement au moment o\u00f9 la demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, par exemple parce que le contrat sous\u2011jacent avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9 (voir, p. ex., OMERS Realty Corp. c. 7636156 Canada Inc. (Trustee in Bankruptcy of), 2020 ONCA 681, 153 O.R. (3d) 271, par. 45). Le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire qui ignore ne pas avoir le droit au paiement ne commet pas de fraude ou d\u2019acte assimilable \u00e0 une fraude du simple fait de pr\u00e9senter une demande au titre de la garantie sur demande.\n(2) Connaissance claire ou \u00e9vidente de la fraude\n[224] Le garant est tenu d\u2019honorer la demande de paiement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au titre de la garantie sur demande, sauf si un tribunal comp\u00e9tent le lui interdit express\u00e9ment ou si des preuves claires ou \u00e9videntes de la fraude du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire sont port\u00e9es \u00e0 sa connaissance (Angelica\u2011Whitewear, p. 84\u201185). Pour d\u00e9finir ce qu\u2019il faut entendre par \u00ab connaissance claire ou \u00e9vidente \u00bb, il n\u2019est pas utile de comparer cette situation avec celle o\u00f9 il y a absence de connaissance. Il va sans dire que le fait de n\u2019avoir aucune connaissance ne peut \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9 de \u00ab connaissance claire ou \u00e9vidente \u00bb. On peut avoir connaissance de certains faits sans pour autant que cela repr\u00e9sente une \u00ab connaissance claire ou \u00e9vidente \u00bb. Par exemple, des circonstances suspectes n\u2019entra\u00eenent pas de cons\u00e9quences juridiques. La banque doit payer lorsque les conditions du paiement sont par ailleurs remplies, peu importe ses soup\u00e7ons (Banco Nacional de Cuba c. Bank of Nova Scotia (1988), 4 O.R. (3d) 100 (H.C.J.), p. 119\u2011120).\n[225] La \u00ab connaissance claire ou \u00e9vidente \u00bb est \u00e9galement une norme on\u00e9reuse. Il ne s\u2019agit pas [traduction] \u00ab de savoir si un tribunal d\u00e9terminera ou pourra \u00e9ventuellement d\u00e9terminer qu\u2019il y a eu fraude, mais plut\u00f4t de savoir si, lorsque le [garant] examine la situation, il \u00e9tait clair et \u00e9vident \u00e0 ses yeux qu\u2019une fraude avait \u00e9t\u00e9 commise \u00bb (Bank of Montreal c. Mitchell (1997), 143 D.L.R. (4th) 697 (C.J. Ont. (div. g\u00e9n.)), p. 716 (je souligne), conf. en appel par (1997), 151 D.L.R. (4th) 574 (C.A. Ont.)). Une fraude \u00ab claire ou \u00e9vidente \u00bb au sens juridique n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessairement \u00ab claire ou \u00e9vidente \u00bb au sens commercial (M. S. Kurkela, Letters of Credit and Bank Guarantees Under International Trade Law (2e \u00e9d. 2008), p. 179). C\u2019est pourquoi, lorsqu\u2019un tribunal est appel\u00e9 \u00e0 contr\u00f4ler la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision d\u2019une banque d\u2019honorer son obligation de paiement au titre d\u2019une garantie sur demande, il doit se placer exactement dans la m\u00eame situation que celle dans laquelle se trouvait la banque \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, sans recourir \u00e0 un raisonnement ex post facto (Angelica\u2011Whitewear, p. 100\u2011102).\n[226] La norme applicable doit \u00eatre on\u00e9reuse pour trois raisons. Premi\u00e8rement, comme l\u2019a r\u00e9cemment affirm\u00e9 la Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Alberta dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Pacific Atlantic Pipeline Construction Ltd c. Coastal Gaslink Pipeline Ltd, 2024 ABCA 74, au par. 7 (CanLII) :\n[traduction] Une norme rigoureuse fait en sorte que les tribunaux n\u2019interviennent pas trop ais\u00e9ment dans le fonctionnement des lettres de cr\u00e9dit et ne minent pas leur utilit\u00e9 et leur efficacit\u00e9. La caract\u00e9ristique qui donne aux lettres de cr\u00e9dit une utilit\u00e9 et une efficacit\u00e9 commerciales internationales est qu\u2019elles fonctionnent ind\u00e9pendamment des litiges concernant l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du contrat sous\u2011jacent. Elles visent \u00e0 fournir aux b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires un \u00ab moyen facile d\u2019obtenir un paiement rapide \u00bb. Lorsqu\u2019un b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 une banque \u00e9mettrice une traite accompagn\u00e9e de documents qui semblent \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue \u00eatre conformes aux conditions de la lettre de cr\u00e9dit, la banque est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement tenue d\u2019honorer la traite : Angelica\u2011Whitewear, p. 70\u201173. Cette autonomie permet [traduction] \u00ab \u00e0 la fois l\u2019assurance d\u2019un paiement et son imm\u00e9diatet\u00e9 \u00bb : Lazar Sarna, Letters of Credit : The Law and Current Practice, 3e \u00e9d. (Toronto : Thomson Reuters, Release 2024\u20111) \u00e0 5 :1 (WL Can).\n[227] Deuxi\u00e8mement, la norme doit \u00eatre on\u00e9reuse pour garantir que les parties \u00e0 la transaction sous\u2011jacente, qui ont eu l\u2019occasion de soupeser les risques li\u00e9s \u00e0 la transaction et de n\u00e9gocier le droit applicable, ne transf\u00e8rent pas ces risques \u00e0 l\u2019institution bancaire qui garantit la transaction. En acceptant de fournir une garantie sur demande, le donneur d\u2019ordre (en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, Bombardier) accepte d\u2019assumer le risque que le paiement [traduction] \u00ab soit fait malgr\u00e9 qu\u2019il puisse par la suite \u00e9tablir lors d\u2019un litige ou d\u2019un arbitrage que le diff\u00e9rend doit \u00eatre r\u00e9solu en sa faveur \u00bb (Veolia Water Technologies, Inc. c. K+S Potash Canada General Partnership, 2019 SKCA 25, 440 D.L.R. (4th) 129, par. 43, citant Ouais Group Engineering & Contracting Ltd. c. Saipem SPA, [2013] EWHC 990 (B.R.), par. 45). Transf\u00e9rer le risque \u00e0 la banque \u00e9mettrice compromettrait son r\u00f4le dans ce type de transaction. La seule obligation d\u2019une banque est, et doit demeurer, de respecter strictement les instructions pr\u00e9vues dans la garantie sur demande. Apr\u00e8s tout, les banques ont tr\u00e8s peu \u00e0 gagner lorsqu\u2019elles agissent \u00e0 titre de garantes. La [traduction] \u00ab r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration relativement modeste qu\u2019elles touchent suppose que le r\u00f4le des banques se limite \u00e0 accomplir des t\u00e2ches qui peuvent \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9es rapidement, facilement et presque m\u00e9caniquement \u00bb (Bertrams, p. 82).\n[228] Troisi\u00e8mement, la norme doit \u00eatre on\u00e9reuse parce que lorsqu\u2019une fraude est all\u00e9gu\u00e9e concernant une demande de paiement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au titre d\u2019une garantie sur demande, la banque se trouve face \u00e0 un dilemme. La banque qui refuserait \u00e0 tort d\u2019honorer la demande de paiement s\u2019expose \u00e0 des poursuites judiciaires de la part du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire. Cependant, en effectuant le paiement demand\u00e9, la banque risque de ne pas pouvoir se faire rembourser par le donneur d\u2019ordre (P. Ellinger et D. Neo, The Law and Practice of Documentary Letters of Credit (2010), p. 149). C\u2019est la raison pour laquelle la fraude vis\u00e9e par la norme de la connaissance claire ou \u00e9vidente doit \u00eatre une fraude \u00ab qui cr\u00e8v[e] les yeux \u00bb (J.\u2011P. Mattout, Droit bancaire international (4e \u00e9d. 2009, p. 258). Tout doute doit profiter au b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire : \u00ab la fraude ne doit pas pr\u00eater \u00e0 interpr\u00e9tation, sinon le doute jouera n\u00e9cessairement en faveur du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire \u00bb (ibid., p. 259). Comme l\u2019a fait observer le juge Waller dans la d\u00e9cision Turkiye Is Bankasi AS c. Bank of China, [1996] 2 Lloyd\u2019s Rep. 611 (Q.B.D.), p. 617 :\n[traduction] Il n\u2019appartient tout simplement pas \u00e0 la banque de v\u00e9rifier les all\u00e9gations qui sont formul\u00e9es de part et d\u2019autre. La partie qui souhaite d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019une demande de paiement est frauduleuse doit pr\u00e9senter des preuves irr\u00e9futables \u00e0 la banque. Elle ne peut se contenter de formuler des all\u00e9gations et d\u2019attendre de la banque qu\u2019elle v\u00e9rifie si ces all\u00e9gations sont fond\u00e9es ou non. [Je souligne.]\n[229] Il va sans dire que lorsque des all\u00e9gations et contre\u2011all\u00e9gations sont formul\u00e9es au sujet de la fraude, il n\u2019appartient pas \u00e0 la banque de trancher ou de prendre parti; autrement, elle se retrouverait [traduction] \u00ab emp\u00eatr\u00e9e dans un conflit d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats insoluble \u00bb (Bertrams, p. 81). Cette t\u00e2che est r\u00e9serv\u00e9e aux tribunaux comp\u00e9tents.\n(3) Fraude commise par un tiers dans le contexte de contre\u2011garanties\n[230] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Angelica\u2011Whitewear, le juge Le Dain a \u00e9crit que la fraude commise par un tiers ne devrait pas emp\u00eacher un b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire innocent de demander le paiement au titre d\u2019une lettre de cr\u00e9dit (p. 84). Cette affirmation doit \u00eatre adapt\u00e9e au contexte de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, qui implique une lettre de garantie s\u00e9curis\u00e9e par une contre\u2011garantie. D\u2019ailleurs, la fraude commise par le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire d\u2019une lettre de garantie constitue toujours une fraude commise par un tiers pour l\u2019application de la contre\u2011garantie. Je reconnais que lorsque le garant a une connaissance claire ou \u00e9vidente de la fraude commise par le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de la lettre de garantie, mais qu\u2019il d\u00e9cide n\u00e9anmoins de payer, cette fraude peut lui \u00eatre imput\u00e9e.\n[231] C\u2019est le paiement effectu\u00e9 au titre de la garantie qui d\u00e9clenche l\u2019application de la demande de paiement au titre d\u2019une contre\u2011garantie. Pour d\u00e9terminer si la demande de paiement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire au titre de la contre\u2011garantie est frauduleuse, le tribunal doit aller au\u2011del\u00e0 de la ligne de d\u00e9marcation claire qui existe entre la garantie et la contre\u2011garantie. Cette analyse ne doit toutefois pas se transformer en un litige quant au contrat sous\u2011jacent (Bombardier Inc. c. Hermes Aero, 2004 CanLII 7014 (C.S.), par. 35 et 40; Banque Nationale du Canada c. CGU Cie d\u2019assurance du Canada, 2004 CanLII 49434 (C.S.), par. 49; SNC\u2011Lavalin Constructeurs international inc. c. Shariket Kahraba Skikda.spa, 2010 QCCS 3236, par. 27 (CanLII); SNC\u2011Lavalin Polska SP. ZOO c. BNP Paris Canada, 2017 QCCS 3694, par. 40\u201146 (CanLII)).\nVI. Application\n[232] Les questions en litige dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire peuvent se r\u00e9sumer comme suit : la conduite d\u2019Eurobank l\u2019emp\u00eache\u2011t\u2011elle de demander le paiement en vertu de la Lettre de contre\u2011garantie? Mon analyse se concentre d\u2019abord sur l\u2019argument principal d\u2019Eurobank, \u00e0 savoir que, pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette question, la Cour doit d\u00e9terminer, pour l\u2019application de la Lettre de contre\u2011garantie, si Eurobank aurait d\u00fb effectuer le paiement en vertu de la Lettre de garantie. Je me penche ensuite sur l\u2019argument subsidiaire d\u2019Eurobank, selon lequel notre Cour devrait se demander seulement si la demande de paiement \u00e9tait conforme aux conditions pertinentes de la Lettre de contre\u2011garantie.\nA. L\u2019incidence des jugements des tribunaux grecs pour l\u2019application de la Lettre de contre\u2011garantie\n[233] Avant d\u2019examiner les circonstances de la demande de paiement du MDG et de la d\u00e9cision d\u2019Eurobank de l\u2019honorer, je dois me dissocier du raisonnement des juridictions inf\u00e9rieures. \u00c0 mon avis, et je le dis avec \u00e9gards, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance et les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel ont commis une erreur en n\u2019accordant aucun poids \u2014 ne serait\u2011ce qu\u2019un tant soit peu \u2014 aux jugements des tribunaux grecs. Ils en ont tout simplement fait fi.\n[234] Tout d\u2019abord, je reconnais que les jugements grecs n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 formellement reconnus en vertu de l\u2019art. 3155 C.c.Q. et qu\u2019ils n\u2019ont donc pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9s ex\u00e9cutoires au Qu\u00e9bec. Toutefois, ce fait n\u2019est pas pertinent puisque la Lettre de garantie \u00e9tait r\u00e9gie par le droit grec et que les parties \u00e0 la Lettre de garantie n\u2019\u00e9taient pas domicili\u00e9es au Qu\u00e9bec. Il n\u2019y aurait eu aucune raison de demander la reconnaissance et l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des jugements grecs parce que rien dans ces d\u00e9cisions n\u2019\u00e9tait susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 au Qu\u00e9bec. Les tribunaux qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois n\u2019ont aucune juridiction sur le m\u00e9rite d\u2019un litige d\u00e9coulant de la Lettre de garantie.\n[235] Bien que les jugements grecs ne lient pas les tribunaux qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, dans ce contexte, le principe de courtoisie doit guider toute d\u00e9cision concernant le poids devant leur \u00eatre accord\u00e9 (Spar Aerospace Lt\u00e9e c. American Mobile Satellite Corp., 2002 CSC 78, [2002] 4 R.C.S. 205, par. 17). Il est important de garder \u00e0 l\u2019esprit que, lorsque des jugements \u00e9trangers sont admis en preuve sans \u00eatre formellement reconnus au Qu\u00e9bec, ils constituent n\u00e9anmoins une preuve prima facie des faits qui y sont rapport\u00e9s, de l\u2019application correcte du droit \u00e9tranger et de la juridiction du tribunal \u00e9tranger en la mati\u00e8re aux termes de l\u2019art. 2822 C.c.Q. Les tribunaux qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois ne peuvent simplement ignorer les d\u00e9cisions \u00e9trang\u00e8res (Canadian Forest Navigation Co. c. Canada, 2017 CAF 39, par. 16 (CanLII), citant H. K\u00e9lada, Reconnaissance et ex\u00e9cution des jugements \u00e9trangers (2013), p. 37). En l\u2019absence de toute contestation de l\u2019authenticit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision \u00e9trang\u00e8re ou de la juridiction du tribunal \u00e9tranger pour la rendre, les tribunaux qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois doivent reconna\u00eetre un \u00ab effet de fait \u00bb \u00e0 cette d\u00e9cision (G. Goldstein et E. Groffier, Droit international priv\u00e9, t. 1, Th\u00e9orie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale (1998), p. 372; C. Emanuelli, Droit international priv\u00e9 qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (3e \u00e9d. 2001), n\u00b0 327; G. Goldstein et J. A. Talpis, L\u2019effet au Qu\u00e9bec des jugements \u00e9trangers en mati\u00e8re de droits patrimoniaux (1991), p. 14\u201116 et 53\u201157; J.\u2011G. Castel, \u00ab Kuwait Airways Corp. c. Irak, 2010 CSC 40 \u00bb (2011), 56 R.D. McGill 751, p. 758). Une d\u00e9cision \u00e9trang\u00e8re introduite en preuve est une contrainte factuelle pour les tribunaux qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois et doit \u00eatre trait\u00e9e en cons\u00e9quence; \u00ab [i]l ne s\u2019agit pas de prolonger au Qu\u00e9bec les effets que la d\u00e9cision \u00e9trang\u00e8re a dans un pays \u00e9tranger, mais bien de la prendre en consid\u00e9ration en tant que fait \u00bb (Goldstein et Groffier, p. 372). Il est d\u2019une importance fondamentale de donner effet aux d\u00e9cisions \u00e9trang\u00e8res introduites en preuve, car elles constituent \u00ab une base de pr\u00e9visions certaine et pr\u00e9cise \u00bb pour les parties que ces d\u00e9cisions lient (P. Mayer, V. Heuz\u00e9 et B. Remy, Droit international priv\u00e9 (12e \u00e9d. 2019), n\u00b0 372).\n[236] \u00c9videmment, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance est libre de d\u00e9terminer le poids qu\u2019il convient d\u2019accorder \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision \u00e9trang\u00e8re \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de l\u2019ensemble de la preuve (voir, p. ex., Digiulian c. Succession de Digiulian, 2022 QCCA 531). Toutefois, il ne peut pas remettre en question les faits rapport\u00e9s ni l\u2019application correcte du droit \u00e9tranger par le tribunal \u00e9tranger (K\u00e9lada, p. 37\u201138, citant B. Audit et L. D\u2019Avout, Droit international priv\u00e9 (6e \u00e9d. 2010), n\u00b0 459; voir aussi Emanuelli, n\u00b0 326; Goldstein et Groffier, p. 373\u2011374, citant Bauron c. Davis (1897), 6 B.R. 547, p. 553). Pourtant, lorsqu\u2019il a rejet\u00e9 la D\u00e9cision du juge Kostis, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance \u00e9crit ce qui suit :\n[traduction] Il est curieux que le juge Kostis soit arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion qu\u2019\u00ab on ne [pouvait] pas supposer que la troisi\u00e8me d\u00e9fenderesse [Eurobank] s\u2019\u00e9tait engag\u00e9e \u00e0 ne pas invoquer la d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance de la Lettre de garantie, tout en \u00e9tant d\u00fbment repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en ce qui concerne un tel engagement \u00bb. Comme nous l\u2019avons vu, il existait une preuve \u00e9crite de l\u2019engagement du MDG de ne pas se pr\u00e9valoir de la Lettre de garantie.\nIl est encore plus d\u00e9routant que le juge Kostis ait pu arriver \u00e0 cette conclusion dans sa d\u00e9cision de six pages, lorsque l\u2019on consid\u00e8re que sa coll\u00e8gue la juge Pana est arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 une conclusion compl\u00e8tement diff\u00e9rente dans sa d\u00e9cision d\u00e9taill\u00e9e et bien r\u00e9dig\u00e9e de 30 pages concernant la conduite du MDG. . .\nL\u2019examen du bien\u2011fond\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision n\u2019a apport\u00e9 aucun nouvel \u00e9clairage qui am\u00e8nerait notre Cour \u00e0 une autre conclusion. La conduite du MDG constituait bien une fraude au sens de la r\u00e8gle d\u2019exception \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie des lettres de cr\u00e9dit.\n. . .\nSelon cette d\u00e9cision, qui \u00e9tait essentiellement d\u2019ordre proc\u00e9dural, les conditions permettant d\u2019obtenir une ordonnance d\u2019injonction interlocutoire n\u2019\u00e9taient pas remplies dans cette affaire, car la demanderesse ne subirait pas de pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable qui ne pourrait \u00eatre r\u00e9par\u00e9 par des dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats d\u2019une partie solvable comme le minist\u00e8re de la D\u00e9fense de la Gr\u00e8ce (le MDG).\nEn cons\u00e9quence, dans le Prot\u00eat extrajudiciaire que le MDG a adress\u00e9 \u00e0 Eurobank, il la sommait de \u00ab se conformer au jugement \u00bb qui ne lui avait rien ordonn\u00e9.\nEurobank n\u2019a rien fait devant notre Cour ni devant les tribunaux grecs apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u le Prot\u00eat extrajudiciaire du MDG. Il est \u00e9galement difficile de croire qu\u2019Eurobank n\u2019aurait pu retourner devant les tribunaux grecs d\u00e8s que la Sentence finale du Tribunal arbitral de la CCI a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue ou qu\u2019elle n\u2019aurait pu prendre des mesures pour r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer l\u2019argent qu\u2019elle avait vers\u00e9 au MDG, m\u00eame si ces d\u00e9marches auraient pu \u00eatre longues et ardues. Le jugement du juge Kostis reposait sur la pr\u00e9misse m\u00eame que le MDG \u00e9tait un d\u00e9fendeur solvable, en tant que membre de l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne, et qu\u2019il serait en mesure de rembourser Eurobank s\u2019il \u00e9tait condamn\u00e9 par les tribunaux grecs \u00e0 verser des dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats. Une fois que la Sentence finale du Tribunal arbitral de la CCI avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 nul le Contrat de compensation, il ne fait gu\u00e8re de doute que les tribunaux grecs n\u2019auraient eu d\u2019autre choix que d\u2019en tirer la cons\u00e9quence in\u00e9luctable et de refuser d\u2019ordonner le paiement au MDG ou finalement de condamner ce dernier \u00e0 rembourser Eurobank. . . [En italique dans l\u2019original; par. 189\u2011202 (CanLII).]\n[237] L\u2019authenticit\u00e9 de la D\u00e9cision du juge Kostis n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9e. Il n\u2019est pas non plus contest\u00e9 que les tribunaux grecs avaient juridiction \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la Lettre de garantie, puisque les parties \u00e9taient domicili\u00e9es en Gr\u00e8ce et que cette lettre \u00e9tait r\u00e9gie par le droit grec (Contrat de compensation, art. 28; Contrat d\u2019approvisionnement, art. 35.5, reproduit au d.a., vol. IV, p. 65). M\u00eame si le juge de premi\u00e8re instance pouvait d\u00e9cider du poids \u00e0 accorder \u00e0 la D\u00e9cision du juge Kostis en tant que fait servant \u00e0 \u00e9tablir si la conduite du MDG \u00e9tait frauduleuse, il ne pouvait pas, ce faisant, proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019examen du \u00ab bien\u2011fond\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision \u00bb. Toutefois, c\u2019est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment ce qu\u2019il a fait : [traduction] \u00ab L\u2019examen du bien\u2011fond\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision n\u2019a apport\u00e9 aucun nouvel \u00e9clairage qui m\u00e8nerait notre Cour \u00e0 une autre conclusion \u00bb (par. 191). En \u00e9cartant la D\u00e9cision du juge Kostis sur la base du bien\u2011fond\u00e9 ou non de la d\u00e9cision, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance est all\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la r\u00e8gle codifi\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019art. 2822 C.c.Q., qui pr\u00e9voit qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision \u00ab qui \u00e9mane apparemment d\u2019un officier public \u00e9tranger comp\u00e9tent fait preuve, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de tous, de son contenu \u00bb. Contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019avis de mon coll\u00e8gue sur ce point, il s\u2019agit, \u00e0 mon avis, d\u2019une erreur de droit. Dans de telles circonstances, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance devait donner un \u00ab effet de fait \u00bb \u00e0 la D\u00e9cision du juge Kostis et il a commis une erreur de droit en ne lui en donnant aucun.\n[238] J\u2019estime \u00e9galement, contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019avis de mon coll\u00e8gue, que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a commis des erreurs r\u00e9visables, c.\u2011\u00e0\u2011d. des erreurs manifestes et d\u00e9terminantes, en ne tenant pas compte de la D\u00e9cision du juge Kostis.\n[239] Premi\u00e8rement, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a mal interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019Injonction de la juge Pana et, par cons\u00e9quent, il a critiqu\u00e9 sans raison la D\u00e9cision du juge Kostis qui rejetait la demande d\u2019injonction interlocutoire d\u2019Eurobank. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a estim\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab curieux \u00bb et \u00ab encore plus d\u00e9routant que le juge Kostis ait pu arriver \u00e0 [la] conclusion [de rejeter la demande d\u2019injonction d\u2019Eurobank] dans sa d\u00e9cision de six pages, lorsque l\u2019on consid\u00e8re que sa coll\u00e8gue la juge Pana est arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 une conclusion compl\u00e8tement diff\u00e9rente dans sa d\u00e9cision d\u00e9taill\u00e9e et bien r\u00e9dig\u00e9e de 30 pages concernant la conduite du MDG \u00bb (par. 189\u2011190). Avec \u00e9gards, je suis d\u2019avis que cette conclusion du juge de premi\u00e8re instance \u00e9tait manifestement erron\u00e9e. Comme l\u2019a expliqu\u00e9 le MDG, la d\u00e9cision de la juge Pana se limitait \u00e0 quatre lignes sur la derni\u00e8re page du document (m.a., par. 64\u201166). Les 28 autres pages ne faisaient que reproduire int\u00e9gralement la demande d\u2019Eurobank. La juge Pana n\u2019a tir\u00e9 aucune conclusion ou n\u2019a rendu aucune d\u00e9cision concernant la conduite du MDG dans ces quatre lignes :\n[traduction] La cour accueille la demande d\u2019injonction pr\u00e9liminaire.\nLa cour permet (temporairement) [\u00e0 Eurobank] de ne pas liquider la lettre de garantie sans avoir \u00e0 subir des cons\u00e9quences juridiques ou devoir payer des p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019instruction de la requ\u00eate en mesures provisoires \u00e0 la date d\u2019audience indiqu\u00e9e ci\u2011apr\u00e8s.\n(d.a., vol. VI, p. 29)\nCette erreur \u00e9tait d\u00e9terminante. Elle a amen\u00e9 le juge de premi\u00e8re instance \u00e0 \u00e9carter la D\u00e9cision du juge Kostis au motif qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas pertinente pour d\u00e9terminer si la troisi\u00e8me et derni\u00e8re demande de paiement du MDG \u00e9tait frauduleuse et si la d\u00e9cision d\u2019Eurobank de payer \u00e9quivalait \u00e0 une participation \u00e0 cette fraude.\n[240] Deuxi\u00e8mement, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a tout simplement eu tort de d\u00e9cider qu\u2019Eurobank ne pouvait invoquer la D\u00e9cision du juge Kostis pour justifier sa d\u00e9cision de payer en vertu de la Lettre de garantie, pour le motif que le juge Kostis [traduction] \u00ab n\u2019avait pas ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 Eurobank de payer \u00bb (par. 198). Il faut garder \u00e0 l\u2019esprit le principe fondamental de toute garantie sur demande, \u00e0 savoir son ind\u00e9pendance du contrat sous\u2011jacent. Aux termes d\u2019une garantie sur demande, la banque a une obligation quasi absolue de payer la somme convenue sur pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019une demande \u00e9crite conforme. La Lettre de garantie constitue un engagement de payer irr\u00e9vocable et d\u00e9finitif. Compte tenu de l\u2019objectif et de l\u2019esprit d\u2019une telle lettre, Eurobank n\u2019avait d\u2019autre choix que de payer, sauf s\u2019il lui \u00e9tait express\u00e9ment interdit de le faire \u2014 et selon la D\u00e9cision du juge Kostis, ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas le cas.\n[241] Troisi\u00e8mement, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a manifestement commis une erreur en concluant, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la Sentence arbitrale, que [traduction] \u00ab les tribunaux grecs n\u2019auraient eu d\u2019autre choix que d\u2019en tirer la cons\u00e9quence in\u00e9luctable et de refuser d\u2019ordonner le paiement au MDG ou finalement de condamner ce dernier \u00e0 rembourser Eurobank \u00bb (par. 202). Ind\u00e9pendamment du fait que cette affirmation remet ind\u00fbment en question le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 de la D\u00e9cision du juge Kostis et comporte un raisonnement ex post facto, il \u00e9tait tout simplement erron\u00e9 de conclure que la Sentence arbitrale menait \u00e0 cette \u00ab cons\u00e9quence in\u00e9luctable \u00bb. L\u2019action intent\u00e9e par Eurobank contre le MDG en Gr\u00e8ce a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e par la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ath\u00e8nes et la Cour supr\u00eame de Gr\u00e8ce dans des arr\u00eats qui ont confirm\u00e9, bien qu\u2019indirectement, la D\u00e9cision du juge Kostis. La Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ath\u00e8nes a conclu que le MDG pouvait se pr\u00e9valoir de la lettre au moment o\u00f9 il l\u2019avait fait. Le MDG n\u2019\u00e9tait plus \u00e0 ce moment li\u00e9 par l\u2019Engagement \u00e9crit, il ne pouvait \u00eatre li\u00e9 par l\u2019Ordonnance provisoire et sa demande avait \u00e9t\u00e9 valablement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e avant le prononc\u00e9 de tout jugement du Tribunal arbitral de la CCI (d.a., vol. III, p. 104). La Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ath\u00e8nes a affirm\u00e9 que m\u00eame si Eurobank n\u2019avait pas droit au remboursement, Bombardier pouvait exercer un recours pour enrichissement sans cause contre le MDG une fois la Lettre de contre\u2011garantie pay\u00e9e (p. 103\u2011105). La Cour supr\u00eame de Gr\u00e8ce a confirm\u00e9 les conclusions de la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ath\u00e8nes dans leur int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 et a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019action d\u2019Eurobank (d\u00e9cision de la Cour supr\u00eame de Gr\u00e8ce, reproduite dans la requ\u00eate en production de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, p. 51\u201181).\n[242] L\u2019un des moyens d\u2019appel invoqu\u00e9s par Eurobank devant la Cour d\u2019appel du Qu\u00e9bec concernait la fa\u00e7on dont le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a trait\u00e9 la D\u00e9cision du juge Kostis. \u00c0 l\u2019appui de sa th\u00e8se, Eurobank a produit l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ath\u00e8nes en tant que nouvel \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve. Le juge Mainville a examin\u00e9 cette d\u00e9cision, mais a finalement refus\u00e9 de lui accorder quelque poids que ce soit, confirmant la fa\u00e7on dont le juge de premi\u00e8re instance avait trait\u00e9 la D\u00e9cision du juge Kostis. Ce faisant, le juge Mainville a r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019erreur de droit du juge de premi\u00e8re instance au regard de l\u2019art. 2822 C.c.Q. et les trois erreurs manifestes et d\u00e9terminantes que j\u2019ai relev\u00e9es (par. 65 (CanLII), citant les motifs de la C.S., par. 189\u2011191). Il a aussi affirm\u00e9 que [traduction] \u00ab des consid\u00e9rations d\u2019ordre public peuvent contraindre un tribunal qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois \u00e0 passer outre \u00e0 une loi \u00e9trang\u00e8re ou \u00e0 un jugement \u00e9tranger \u00bb (par. 67). Selon lui, le r\u00e9sultat auquel la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ath\u00e8nes est arriv\u00e9e \u00e9tait incompatible avec l\u2019ordre public tel qu\u2019il est entendu dans les relations internationales, et les jugements grecs avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 rendus en violation des principes de r\u00e9ciprocit\u00e9, d\u2019ordre et d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9. Il a conclu que l\u2019exception relative \u00e0 l\u2019ordre public pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019art. 3081 et au par. 3155(5) C.c.Q. emp\u00eachait la reconnaissance et l\u2019ex\u00e9cution au Qu\u00e9bec de la D\u00e9cision du juge Kostis.\n[243] Avec \u00e9gards, le juge Mainville a commis une erreur en concluant ainsi. L\u2019article 3081 et le par. 3155(5) C.c.Q. ne peuvent servir de fondement pour \u00e9carter l\u2019\u00ab effet de fait \u00bb des jugements grecs, non plus que l\u2019\u00ab exercice de pond\u00e9ration \u00bb r\u00e9gissant la reconnaissance et l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des d\u00e9cisions \u00e9trang\u00e8res en common law, puisque cet exercice est d\u00e9j\u00e0 codifi\u00e9 au par. 3155(5) C.c.Q. (Pro\u2011Swing Inc. c. Elta Golf Inc., 2006 CSC 52, [2006] 2 R.C.S. 612, par. 27 et 30). Eurobank n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 au tribunal d\u2019appliquer le droit grec, mais de donner aux jugements grecs un \u00ab effet de fait \u00bb. L\u2019article 3081 C.c.Q., qui codifie l\u2019exception d\u2019ordre public aux r\u00e8gles relatives au choix du droit applicable \u00e9tablies dans le Livre dixi\u00e8me du C.c.Q., n\u2019est d\u2019aucune pertinence (Goldstein et Groffier, p. 267; Emanuelli, n\u00b0 464). De plus, aucune partie n\u2019a demand\u00e9 la reconnaissance ou l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des jugements grecs au Qu\u00e9bec en application de l\u2019art. 3155 C.c.Q. L\u2019\u00ab effet de fait \u00bb d\u2019un jugement est \u00ab ind\u00e9pendant \u00bb de sa reconnaissance ou de son ex\u00e9cution au Qu\u00e9bec (J.-G. Castel, Droit international priv\u00e9 qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (1980), p. 846; Goldstein et Talpis, p. 57; Goldstein et Groffier, p. 372). L\u2019exception pr\u00e9vue au par. 3155(5) C.c.Q. ne s\u2019applique pas.\n[244] Importer l\u2019exception d\u2019ordre public ou d\u2019autres consid\u00e9rations semblables dans l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation du poids \u00e0 accorder \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision \u00e9trang\u00e8re en tant que contrainte factuelle n\u2019est appuy\u00e9e par aucun pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent et est contraire au texte et \u00e0 l\u2019objet de l\u2019art. 2822 C.c.Q. Lorsqu\u2019ils effectuent une telle appr\u00e9ciation, les tribunaux qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois ne peuvent se demander si la d\u00e9cision \u00e9trang\u00e8re devrait \u00eatre un fait sur la base de consid\u00e9rations d\u2019ordre public. Soit il s\u2019agit d\u2019un fait, soit il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019un fait. S\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un fait, il en est un important, particuli\u00e8rement lorsqu\u2019il lie les parties et influence leur comportement. Donner un \u00ab effet de fait \u00bb \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision \u00e9trang\u00e8re est tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rent d\u2019appliquer le droit \u00e9tranger, de reconna\u00eetre cette d\u00e9cision ou d\u2019incorporer la solution fournie par cette d\u00e9cision \u00e0 l\u2019ordre juridique du Qu\u00e9bec.\n[245] M\u00eame si j\u2019acceptais que des consid\u00e9rations d\u2019ordre public puissent servir \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer le poids qui doit \u00eatre donn\u00e9 aux jugements grecs en tant que preuve, j\u2019estime qu\u2019aucune ne trouve application. La D\u00e9cision du juge Kostis \u00e9tait absolument essentielle \u00e0 la compr\u00e9hension de la conduite du MDG et d\u2019Eurobank au moment du paiement. Toutefois, le juge Mainville n\u2019a mentionn\u00e9 aucune consid\u00e9ration d\u2019ordre public justifiant de l\u2019\u00e9carter. Lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019est pench\u00e9 sur le poids devant \u00eatre accord\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ath\u00e8nes, il a \u00e9crit qu\u2019elle devait \u00eatre \u00e9cart\u00e9e parce qu\u2019elle [traduction] \u00ab appuie [. . .] la th\u00e8se selon laquelle l\u2019\u00c9tat grec peut faire fi en toute impunit\u00e9 de l\u2019Ordonnance provisoire et de la Sentence finale du Tribunal arbitral de la CCI, m\u00eame s\u2019il s\u2019est officiellement engag\u00e9 \u00e0 se soumettre au processus d\u2019arbitrage, et m\u00eame si la Sentence finale a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e en tous points par la Cour d\u2019appel de Paris \u00bb (par. 69).\n[246] Avec \u00e9gards, je ne puis souscrire \u00e0 cette approche. \u00c0 ce stade, il est important de noter que la Sentence arbitrale n\u2019\u00e9tait pas pertinente eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 l\u2019action d\u2019Eurobank en enrichissement sans cause \u2014 qui porte sur la question de savoir si le MDG avait le droit de recourir \u00e0 la lettre de garantie au moment du paiement \u2014 et, par cons\u00e9quent, la Sentence arbitrale a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment \u00e9cart\u00e9e par la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ath\u00e8nes. De plus, il serait inappropri\u00e9 d\u2019attribuer la fraude \u00e0 Eurobank pour la violation all\u00e9gu\u00e9e de l\u2019Ordonnance provisoire par le MDG puisque Eurobank n\u2019\u00e9tait pas partie \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure d\u2019arbitrage. Ce raisonnement, s\u2019il est applicable, ne devrait pas \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 pour d\u00e9terminer la force probante devant \u00eatre donn\u00e9e aux jugements grecs, particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 la D\u00e9cision du juge Kostis, dans le cadre de l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de la conduite d\u2019Eurobank.\n[247] En outre, il est important de garder \u00e0 l\u2019esprit que l\u2019ordre public tel qu\u2019entendu dans les relations internationales doit \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9 \u00ab de mani\u00e8re restrictive \u00bb et est \u00ab plus restreint \u00bb que son pendant en droit interne (Beals c. Saldanha, 2003 CSC 72, [2003] 3 R.C.S. 416, par. 75; R.S. c. P.R., 2019 CSC 49, [2019] 3 R.C.S. 643, par. 53; voir aussi S. Guillemard et V. A. Ly, \u00c9l\u00e9ments de droit international priv\u00e9 qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (2019), p. 62; Emanuelli, n\u00b0 298). La prise en compte de l\u2019ordre public n\u2019est pas une invitation faite aux tribunaux qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois de \u00ab proc[\u00e9der] \u00e0 l\u2019examen au fond de la d\u00e9cision ou de la loi \u00e9trang\u00e8re \u00bb (R.S., par. 52; voir aussi Barer c. Knight Brothers LLC, 2019 CSC 13, [2019] 1 R.C.S. 573, par. 26). Les d\u00e9cisions \u00e9trang\u00e8res peuvent \u00eatre \u00e9cart\u00e9es seulement si les cons\u00e9quences d\u00e9coulant de l\u2019attribution d\u2019une force probante \u00e0 celles\u2011ci \u00ab serai[ent] \u00e0 ce point incompatible[s] avec certaines des valeurs qui sous\u2011tendent le syst\u00e8me juridique qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois qu\u2019[elles] ne pourrai[ent] \u00eatre incorpor\u00e9[es] \u00e0 celui\u2011ci \u00bb (R.S., par. 52). Comme je l\u2019explique plus loin, toute violation de l\u2019Ordonnance provisoire ou de la Sentence arbitrale est de nature purement contractuelle. Contrairement \u00e0 mon coll\u00e8gue, j\u2019estime qu\u2019une all\u00e9gation de manquement contractuel, manquement qui \u00e0 lui seul ne peut constituer une fraude, ne cr\u00e9e pas de \u00ab cas flagrants de conflit \u00bb, n\u2019est pas \u00ab manifestement incompatible \u00bb et ne constitue pas une divergence \u00ab grave \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019ordre public du Qu\u00e9bec tel qu\u2019entendu dans les relations internationales (R.S., par. 53\u201154; voir aussi les motifs du juge Kasirer, par. 108). Les cons\u00e9quences de l\u2019attribution d\u2019une force probante aux d\u00e9cisions de la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ath\u00e8nes et de la Cour supr\u00eame de Gr\u00e8ce ne sont pas \u00ab choquant[es] \u00bb (Guillemard et Ly, p. 61), et ne \u00ab heurtent pas notre sens des valeurs \u00bb (Beals, par. 75). Encore une fois, donner un \u00ab effet de fait \u00bb \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision \u00e9trang\u00e8re est diff\u00e9rent de l\u2019incorporation du r\u00e9sultat de cette d\u00e9cision dans l\u2019ordre juridique qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. L\u2019ordre public tel qu\u2019entendu dans les relations internationales ne peut pas justifier la mise \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cart des d\u00e9cisions de la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ath\u00e8nes et de la Cour supr\u00eame de Gr\u00e8ce.\n[248] Le juge Mainville a reproch\u00e9 aux tribunaux grecs de n\u2019avoir donn\u00e9 aucun poids aux ordonnances des tribunaux qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. Avec \u00e9gards, il a commis une erreur en concluant ainsi pour les raisons suivantes. Premi\u00e8rement, les ordonnances qu\u00e9b\u00e9coises visaient \u00e0 r\u00e9gir la conduite des parties grecques eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 la Lettre de garantie, qui est express\u00e9ment assujettie au droit grec (et non au droit qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois). Tout litige d\u00e9coulant de la Lettre de garantie relevait directement de la juridiction des tribunaux grecs. Conform\u00e9ment au principe de la courtoisie, il incombait aux tribunaux qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois de faire preuve de d\u00e9f\u00e9rence et de respect \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la juridiction des tribunaux grecs relativement \u00e0 la Lettre de garantie (Morguard Investments Ltd. c. De Savoye, [1990] 3 R.C.S. 1077, p. 1095). Deuxi\u00e8mement, l\u2019une des parties \u00e9tait inhabituelle : il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un organe du gouvernement grec ayant des droits souverains, qu\u2019il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019exercer. Troisi\u00e8mement, il est fort peu probable que les tribunaux grecs n\u2019aient pas accord\u00e9 le poids appropri\u00e9 aux ordonnances qu\u00e9b\u00e9coises. Au moment o\u00f9 la D\u00e9cision du juge Kostis a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue, la seule ordonnance qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise pertinente \u00e9tait l\u2019Injonction du juge Pr\u00e9vost, qui \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 expir\u00e9e. De plus, le juge Kostis avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 statu\u00e9 sur le diff\u00e9rend au moment o\u00f9 le juge Davis a prononc\u00e9 son injonction. La Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ath\u00e8nes et la Cour supr\u00eame de Gr\u00e8ce ont accord\u00e9 le poids ad\u00e9quat \u00e0 l\u2019Injonction du juge Davis. Elles l\u2019ont prise en compte comme contrainte factuelle pour le MDG et Eurobank, tout en reconnaissant \u00e0 juste titre qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait ni ex\u00e9cutoire ni contraignante en Gr\u00e8ce.\n[249] En outre, je suis d\u2019accord avec le juge Hamilton pour dire que la d\u00e9cision de rendre les ordonnances qu\u00e9b\u00e9coises \u00e9tait d\u2019embl\u00e9e discutable (par. 184\u2011185). Toute injonction accord\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019art. 940.4 C.p.c. doit reposer sur une des dispositions attributives de comp\u00e9tence du Livre dixi\u00e8me du C.c.Q. (F. Bachand, L\u2019intervention du juge canadien avant et durant un arbitrage commercial international (2005), no 397). Les ordonnances qu\u00e9b\u00e9coises ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mises sur la base de l\u2019art. 3138 C.c.Q., qui pr\u00e9voit que les tribunaux qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois peuvent ordonner des mesures provisoires ou conservatoires m\u00eame s\u2019ils ne sont pas comp\u00e9tents pour conna\u00eetre du fond du litige. Au regard de cette disposition, les tribunaux ne devraient que rarement, voire jamais, prononcer des injonctions ayant un effet extraterritorial : \u00ab [e]n cas d\u2019absence de comp\u00e9tence sur le fond, [. . .] l\u2019effet \u00e9ventuellement extraterritorial de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des mesures [provisoires ou conservatoires] jouera directement pour d\u00e9cider de les ordonner ou non \u00bb (G. Goldstein, Droit international priv\u00e9, vol. 2, Comp\u00e9tence internationale des autorit\u00e9s qu\u00e9b\u00e9coises et effets des d\u00e9cisions \u00e9trang\u00e8res (Art. 3134 \u00e0 3168 C.c.Q.) (2012), p. 101 (en italique dans l\u2019original); voir aussi J. A. Talpis avec la collaboration de S. L. Kath, \u00ab If I am from Grand\u2011M\u00e8re, Why Am I Being Sued in Texas? \u00bb \u2014 Responding to Inappropriate Foreign Jurisdiction in Quebec\u2011United States Crossborder Litigation (2001), p. 18; Bachand, no 397). En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les tribunaux qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois pouvaient valablement interdire \u00e0 Banque Nationale de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 un paiement en vertu de la Lettre de contre\u2011garantie, pour autant qu\u2019une solide preuve prima facie de fraude \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e. Toutefois, ils ne pouvaient valablement interdire au MDG ou \u00e0 Eurobank d\u2019agir en vertu de la Lettre de garantie. Il est int\u00e9ressant de noter que les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel ont infirm\u00e9 la conclusion du juge de premi\u00e8re instance ordonnant au MDG de se conformer \u00e0 la Sentence arbitrale parce que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance n\u2019avait pas juridiction \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard (motifs de la C.A., par. 46). Le m\u00eame raisonnement aurait d\u00fb s\u2019appliquer aux mesures provisoires que sollicitait Bombardier. Dans des circonstances telles que celles du pr\u00e9sent dossier, les tribunaux qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois ne peuvent ordonner \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tat grec d\u2019agir d\u2019une fa\u00e7on particuli\u00e8re, surtout lorsque des droits souverains sont en jeu.\n[250] Aucune consid\u00e9ration d\u2019ordre public ne justifie de faire fi des jugements grecs. J\u2019abonde dans le sens d\u2019Eurobank lorsqu\u2019elle affirme que, [traduction] \u00ab [e]n tant que banque domicili\u00e9e en Gr\u00e8ce, [Eurobank] est \u00e9videmment li\u00e9e par les jugements rendus en Gr\u00e8ce concernant [ses] transactions en Gr\u00e8ce, peu importe o\u00f9 ces jugements pourraient (ou non) \u00eatre reconnus et ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s \u00bb (m.a., par. 178 (caract\u00e8res gras et italique omis)). Toutefois, les ordonnances qu\u00e9b\u00e9coises et l\u2019Ordonnance provisoire n\u2019\u00e9taient pas ex\u00e9cutoires en Gr\u00e8ce. Toute pr\u00e9occupation li\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019ordre et l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 d\u00e9coule du refus des tribunaux qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois d\u2019accorder un poids, en tant que contraintes factuelles, aux jugements grecs qui lient et liaient les parties. Comme le soulignait avec justesse le regrett\u00e9 J.\u2011G. Castel, [traduction] \u00ab [l]a protection des attentes justifi\u00e9es des parties est un objectif particuli\u00e8rement important dans les affaires de droit international priv\u00e9 impliquant des transactions commerciales internationales, car \u201cil serait injuste et inappropri\u00e9 de tenir une personne responsable au regard du droit local d\u2019un \u00c9tat alors qu\u2019elle a model\u00e9 \u00e0 juste titre sa conduite pour se conformer aux exigences d\u2019un autre \u00c9tat\u201d \u00bb (\u00ab The Uncertainty Factor in Canadian Private International Law \u00bb (2007), 52 R.D. McGill 555, p. 558\u2011559, citant l\u2019American Law Institute, Restatement of the Law, Second : Conflict of Laws 2d (1971), \u00a76.(g). Cela est particuli\u00e8rement vrai en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la D\u00e9cision du juge Kostis, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque des faits ayant men\u00e9 \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\n[251] \u00c0 mon avis, les cours inf\u00e9rieures ne pouvaient faire fi de la D\u00e9cision du juge Kostis \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de l\u2019art. 2822 C.c.Q. et des faits de la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Les d\u00e9cisions de la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ath\u00e8nes et de la Cour supr\u00eame de Gr\u00e8ce ne pouvaient non plus \u00eatre \u00e9cart\u00e9es dans la mesure o\u00f9 elles confirment la D\u00e9cision du juge Kostis. Si ces jugements avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme des faits devant guider la conduite du MDG et d\u2019Eurobank pour d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019exception de fraude s\u2019applique \u00e0 la Lettre de contre\u2011garantie, la seule conclusion possible dans le cas pr\u00e9sent aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 que la demande du MDG en vertu de la lettre de garantie et la d\u00e9cision d\u2019Eurobank de proc\u00e9der au paiement \u00e9taient valables.\nB. La demande de paiement du MDG n\u2019\u00e9tait ni frauduleuse ni assimilable \u00e0 une fraude\n[252] J\u2019aborde maintenant la conclusion du juge de premi\u00e8re instance selon laquelle les exigences relatives \u00e0 l\u2019exception de fraude, \u00e9tablies dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Angelica\u2011Whitewear, \u00e9taient remplies. Compte tenu de l\u2019ensemble de la preuve, qui, je le souligne, comprend les jugements grecs, je suis d\u2019avis que cette conclusion ne peut \u00eatre maintenue. La norme \u00e0 satisfaire pour \u00e9tablir la fraude est on\u00e9reuse.\n(1) L\u2019engagement \u00e9crit du MDG\n[253] Lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019est demand\u00e9 si la conduite du MDG \u00e9tait frauduleuse, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a soulign\u00e9 que le MDG avait [traduction] \u00ab manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 sa parole \u00bb en demandant le paiement en vertu de la Lettre de garantie (par. 171\u2011177). Il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une erreur car il a ferm\u00e9 les yeux sur le texte de l\u2019Engagement \u00e9crit, le contexte dans lequel il a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 et le fait qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 valablement retir\u00e9 au moment de la demande du MDG. En d\u2019autres termes, le juge a omis d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019Engagement \u00e9crit dans son ensemble.\n[254] L\u2019Engagement \u00e9crit comporte huit paragraphes, qui mettent en lumi\u00e8re son contexte. La conclusion du juge de premi\u00e8re instance ne tient pas compte des sept premiers, qui indiquaient clairement que le MDG conservait tous ses droits l\u00e9gaux, y compris ses droits souverains conform\u00e9ment au droit public grec, d\u2019invoquer la Lettre de garantie. Les paragraphes pertinents de l\u2019Engagement \u00e9crit sont les suivants :\n[traduction]\n2. Le droit [du MDG] d\u2019imposer unilat\u00e9ralement des p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s au fournisseur, lorsque celui\u2011ci refuse d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter ou n\u2019ex\u00e9cute pas de mani\u00e8re appropri\u00e9e ses obligations contractuelles, est clairement pr\u00e9vu et d\u00e9crit tant dans le d\u00e9cret pr\u00e9sidentiel r\u00e9gissant ledit contrat (p.d. 284\/1989) que dans les clauses contractuelles elles\u2011m\u00eames.\n3. Ce droit [du MDG] est inextricablement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019exercice du pouvoir public; les p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s impos\u00e9es unilat\u00e9ralement par l\u2019administration, en ex\u00e9cution des clauses contractuelles, ont le caract\u00e8re d\u2019actes personnels d\u2019administration qui ne peuvent \u00eatre contest\u00e9s que devant les tribunaux administratifs grecs.\n4. [Bombardier] ne peut ni interdire [au MDG] ni l\u2019emp\u00eacher de quelque mani\u00e8re que ce soit d\u2019exercer son droit souverain, \u00e0 savoir de calculer et d\u2019imposer des p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s, lorsque les conditions fix\u00e9es par la loi et le contrat sont r\u00e9unies.\n7. [. . .] nous r\u00e9it\u00e9rons que [le MDG] n\u2019a pas envisag\u00e9 et qu\u2019au contraire, il a ni\u00e9 et nie toutes les r\u00e9clamations soulev\u00e9es par Bombardier Inc., que vous repr\u00e9sentez. Nous rappelons \u00e9galement que nous avons express\u00e9ment r\u00e9serv\u00e9 tous nos droits l\u00e9gaux, et nous vous informons encore une fois que, toujours dans le contexte de la proc\u00e9dure d\u2019arbitrage, nous ne renon\u00e7ons pas \u00e0 nos droits souverains.\n8. En tout \u00e9tat de cause, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que l\u2019audience devant la Cour internationale d\u2019arbitrage a \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9e du 25 au 29 juin 2012 et que la fin du proc\u00e8s est donc pr\u00e9visible, notre cabinet d\u00e9clare explicitement que nous attendrons la d\u00e9cision de la Cour internationale arbitrale, qui a le pouvoir de trancher de mani\u00e8re contraignante pour les parties les questions de fond d\u00e9coulant des litiges qui rel\u00e8vent de sa comp\u00e9tence, et que nous ne proc\u00e9derons \u00e0 l\u2019imposition d\u2019aucune p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de votre client, tant que la proc\u00e9dure est en cours, laquelle (instance) a de toute fa\u00e7on \u00e9t\u00e9 introduite conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la loi et au contrat. [Je souligne.]\n(d.a., vol. IV, p. 197\u2011199)\n[255] Ces paragraphes ont tous pour objet de pr\u00e9server les \u00ab droits l\u00e9gaux \u00bb du MDG, y compris ses droits souverains, de r\u00e9clamer le paiement en vertu de la Lettre de garantie, et le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a eu tort de les \u00e9carter au motif qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient d\u00e9nu\u00e9s de sens. En omettant d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019engagement \u00e9crit dans son ensemble, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a contrevenu \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle clairement exprim\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019art. 1427 C.c.Q., qui \u00e9nonce : \u00ab Les clauses s\u2019interpr\u00e8tent les unes par les autres, en donnant \u00e0 chacune le sens qui r\u00e9sulte de l\u2019ensemble du contrat \u00bb.\n[256] Sur ce point, j\u2019arrive aux m\u00eames conclusions que le juge Hamilton de la Cour d\u2019appel. Je souligne aussi que le juge Kostis, la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ath\u00e8nes et la Cour supr\u00eame de Gr\u00e8ce ont interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019Engagement \u00e9crit de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on. Le juge Kostis a express\u00e9ment pris en compte l\u2019Engagement \u00e9crit; il a conclu qu\u2019on ne pouvait pas [traduction] \u00ab supposer que [le MDG] s\u2019\u00e9tait engag\u00e9 \u00e0 ne pas invoquer la d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance de la lettre de garantie \u00bb (d.a., vol. VI, p. 76). La Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ath\u00e8nes a elle aussi conclu que l\u2019Engagement \u00e9crit du MDG n\u2019avait cr\u00e9\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab aucune fausse attente de la part de [Bombardier] \u00bb, compte tenu des explications du MDG dans les paragraphes en question (d.a., vol. III, p. 102). La Cour supr\u00eame de Gr\u00e8ce a confirm\u00e9 cette conclusion (p. 66).\n[257] Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a \u00e9galement ignor\u00e9 les conditions importantes \u00e9nonc\u00e9es aux par. 4, 7 et 8 de l\u2019Engagement \u00e9crit.\n[258] La premi\u00e8re phrase du par. 8 est tr\u00e8s importante. Elle confirme que le MDG a donn\u00e9 l\u2019Engagement \u00e9crit en tenant pour acquis que l\u2019audience d\u2019arbitrage se d\u00e9roulerait en juin 2012 et se terminerait peu de temps apr\u00e8s. L\u2019Engagement \u00e9crit a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 le 20 avril 2012, avant que Bombardier soul\u00e8ve sa nouvelle question concernant la validit\u00e9 du Contrat de compensation au regard de l\u2019art. 34 du Trait\u00e9 sur le fonctionnement de l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne, [2012] J.O. C. 326\/47. En raison de cette nouvelle question, la proc\u00e9dure d\u2019arbitrage a \u00e9t\u00e9 retard\u00e9e d\u2019une ann\u00e9e de plus. Les circonstances dans lesquelles l\u2019Engagement \u00e9crit a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 avaient consid\u00e9rablement chang\u00e9 : l\u2019audience s\u2019\u00e9tait prolong\u00e9e bien au\u2011del\u00e0 de juin 2012 et la fin n\u2019\u00e9tait plus \u00ab pr\u00e9visible \u00bb de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re. De toute \u00e9vidence, la condition selon laquelle le MDG s\u2019engageait \u00e0 ne pas se pr\u00e9valoir de la Lettre de garantie ne s\u2019appliquait plus.\n[259] Je suis d\u2019accord avec le juge Hamilton pour dire que le MDG pouvait valablement retirer son engagement. Comme il l\u2019a not\u00e9, c\u2019est ce que le MDG a fait en mettant Bombardier en demeure le 31 juillet 2013. Il s\u2019ensuit que, lorsque le MDG a demand\u00e9 le paiement le 18 d\u00e9cembre 2013, l\u2019Engagement \u00e9crit n\u2019\u00e9tait plus effectif. Le fait d\u2019avoir recours \u00e0 la Lettre de garantie dans ces circonstances ne peut servir de fondement pour conclure \u00e0 la fraude.\n[260] La Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ath\u00e8nes est arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 la m\u00eame conclusion, statuant qu\u2019il [traduction] \u00ab n\u2019existe aucun doute quant \u00e0 l\u2019intention [du MDG] de ne pas [invoquer la Lettre de garantie] dans le cadre de l\u2019instance d\u00e9j\u00e0 engag\u00e9e devant la [CCI] \u00bb (d.a., vol. III, p. 104). Une fois qu\u2019un nouvel argument a \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9, le MDG n\u2019\u00e9tait plus tenu de s\u2019abstenir d\u2019exercer ses droits souverains. La Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ath\u00e8nes a conclu : [traduction] \u00ab Au vu de ces faits, il n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9 par aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve que la conduite [du MDG] en ce qui concerne la d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance et le paiement [au MDG] de [la Lettre de garantie] \u00e9tait manifestement abusive \u00bb (p. 105).\n[261] La Cour supr\u00eame de Gr\u00e8ce fut du m\u00eame avis. Elle a reconnu que le MDG [traduction] \u00ab a accept\u00e9 volontairement et de bonne foi \u00bb de ne pas avoir recours \u00e0 la Lettre de garantie pendant que la proc\u00e9dure d\u2019arbitrage \u00e9tait en cours (p. 73). Toutefois, le MDG a donn\u00e9 l\u2019Engagement \u00e9crit en supposant que [traduction] \u00ab une d\u00e9cision sur cette question devait \u00eatre rendue d\u2019ici la fin de 2012 \u00bb (ibid.). Lorsque Bombardier a soulev\u00e9 son nouvel argument sur la validit\u00e9 du Contrat de compensation, elle [traduction] \u00ab a chang\u00e9 la port\u00e9e des proc\u00e9dures \u00bb (ibid.). Le contexte dans lequel l\u2019Engagement \u00e9crit a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 a chang\u00e9. La Cour supr\u00eame de Gr\u00e8ce a reconnu ce fait. En cons\u00e9quence, elle a conclu que [traduction] \u00ab en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il n\u2019y a eu aucun exercice abusif ou frauduleux du droit du [MDG] de demander la saisie de la lettre de garantie payable sur demande pour des motifs relatifs \u00e0 la relation sous-jacente entre lui et la d\u00e9bitrice, une entreprise canadienne, ni de son obligation de compenser [Eurobank] pour ce motif \u00bb (ibid., p. 70). De fait, les par. 4, 7 et 8 de l\u2019Engagement \u00e9crit indiquent clairement que le MDG a r\u00e9serv\u00e9 ses droits et que l\u2019Engagement \u00e9crit en tant que tel n\u2019\u00e9tait pas absolu.\n(2) Violation par le MDG des Ordonnances provisoires\n[262] Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a statu\u00e9 que la demande de paiement du MDG contrevenait \u00e0 l\u2019Ordonnance provisoire et \u00e0 l\u2019Injonction du juge Davis.\n[263] Le contexte dans lequel chacune de ces ordonnances a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mise est important. L\u2019Ordonnance provisoire et l\u2019Injonction du juge Davis ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9es sur la base de l\u2019Engagement \u00e9crit au sujet duquel j\u2019ai conclu, \u00e0 l\u2019instar du juge Hamilton, qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 valablement retir\u00e9. Afin d\u2019obtenir une injonction interdisant \u00e0 un b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de r\u00e9clamer le paiement au titre d\u2019une lettre de garantie, le demandeur doit \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence [traduction] \u00ab d\u2019une solide preuve prima facie \u00bb selon laquelle le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire est \u00ab express\u00e9ment priv\u00e9 du droit \u00bb de demander le paiement (Veolia Water Technologies, par. 43; voir aussi Pacific Atlantic Pipeline Construction Ltd c. Coastal Gaslink Pipeline Ltd, 2023 ABKB 736, par. 46 (CanLII), conf. 2024 ABCA 74, par. 6\u20117 et 9\u201110 (CanLII); Sirius International Insurance Co. (Publ.) c. FAI General Insurance Ltd., [2003] EWCA Civ 470, [2003] 1 W.L.R. 2214, inf. pour d\u2019autres motifs par [2004] UKHL 54, [2004] 1 W.L.R. 3251; Simic c. New South Wales Land and Housing Corporation, [2016] HCA 47, 260 C.L.R. 85).\n[264] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Pacific Atlantic Pipeline, le donneur d\u2019ordre a demand\u00e9 une injonction visant \u00e0 interdire au b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire d\u2019avoir recours \u00e0 une lettre de cr\u00e9dit standby. Le juge en son cabinet a examin\u00e9 une [traduction] \u00ab entente verbale d\u2019abstention \u00bb aux termes de laquelle le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire avait accept\u00e9 de ne pas avoir recours \u00e0 la lettre de cr\u00e9dit pendant l\u2019arbitrage. Le juge en son cabinet a reconnu que le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire avait affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019aurait pas recours \u00e0 l\u2019instrument, mais a conclu que ces affirmations n\u2019atteignaient pas le niveau de certitude qu\u2019exige une solide preuve prima facie (par. 59). Bien que chaque affaire soit diff\u00e9rente sur le plan factuel, elles ont toutes en commun une norme exigeante pour \u00e9tablir avec certitude juridique que le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire entend ne pas avoir recours \u00e0 l\u2019instrument et que cet engagement est applicable \u00e0 tous les moments pertinents.\n[265] \u00c0 mon avis, la norme on\u00e9reuse que requiert une solide preuve prima facie n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 atteinte ni pour l\u2019Ordonnance provisoire ni pour l\u2019Injonction du juge Davis. Il en est ainsi parce que l\u2019Engagement \u00e9crit avait \u00e9t\u00e9 valablement retir\u00e9 \u00e0 ce moment pr\u00e9cis. En fait, cinq jours avant que le MDG ne r\u00e9clame le paiement en vertu de la Lettre de garantie, il a avis\u00e9 Bombardier par lettre qu\u2019il avait l\u2019intention de le faire. Le MDG a joint \u00e0 cette lettre la d\u00e9cision minist\u00e9rielle officielle qui l\u2019autorisait \u00e0 le faire. De plus, l\u2019Engagement \u00e9crit r\u00e9servait express\u00e9ment les droits du MDG, y compris ses droits souverains, et cet engagement a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 dans un contexte o\u00f9 l\u2019arbitrage devait prendre fin en juin 2012. Toutefois, ces circonstances ont chang\u00e9 lorsque Bombardier a soulev\u00e9 un nouvel argument en ao\u00fbt 2012.\n[266] Ind\u00e9pendamment de la question de savoir si l\u2019Ordonnance provisoire aurait d\u00fb ou non \u00eatre \u00e9mise, il est essentiel de qualifier la nature de la violation de cette ordonnance pour d\u00e9terminer les cons\u00e9quences juridiques qui devraient en d\u00e9couler. L\u2019Ordonnance provisoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mise par le Tribunal arbitral de la CCI \u00e0 la demande de Bombardier le 13 ao\u00fbt 2013. Le Tribunal arbitral a conclu que Bombardier avait une preuve prima facie (je le souligne, et non une solide preuve prima facie) pour justifier des mesures provisoires \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de l\u2019Engagement \u00e9crit du MDG. Toutes les parties reconnaissent que l\u2019Ordonnance provisoire n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 et ne pouvait pas \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e par les tribunaux grecs \u2014 ou par les tribunaux qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (2013 QCCS 6892, par. 5 (CanLII)). Une telle violation n\u2019\u00e9quivaut pas \u00e0 une violation d\u2019une ordonnance judiciaire. Cela dit, il est vrai que le MDG et Bombardier avaient convenu que le Tribunal arbitral de la CCI aurait juridiction sur tout litige pouvant survenir entre eux. Ils \u00e9taient contractuellement tenus de respecter toute mesure conservatoire et provisoire ordonn\u00e9e par le Tribunal arbitral. Par cons\u00e9quent, la violation par le MDG de l\u2019Ordonnance provisoire \u00e9tait une violation contractuelle qui, \u00e0 elle seule, ne constitue pas une fraude.\n[267] Quant aux ordonnances qu\u00e9b\u00e9coises, le MDG a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa troisi\u00e8me et derni\u00e8re demande de paiement le 18 d\u00e9cembre 2013, soit \u00e0 un moment o\u00f9 aucune injonction ne lui interdisait de le faire. D\u2019ailleurs, l\u2019Injonction du juge Pr\u00e9vost avait expir\u00e9 le 26 ao\u00fbt 2013, et l\u2019Injonction du juge Davis n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mise que le 20 d\u00e9cembre 2013, apr\u00e8s la pr\u00e9sentation de la demande de paiement par le MDG. Cette demande \u00e9tait la suite logique de la demande du 12 ao\u00fbt 2013, qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendue par l\u2019Injonction de la juge Pana. C\u2019\u00e9tait donc une erreur de conclure que la demande du MDG pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e le 18 d\u00e9cembre 2013 contrevenait \u00e0 une injonction qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise. L\u2019Injonction du juge Davis a seulement ordonn\u00e9 au MDG de retirer sa demande de paiement apr\u00e8s le fait. Encore une fois, l\u2019Injonction du juge Davis n\u2019\u00e9tait pas ex\u00e9cutoire en Gr\u00e8ce, et il y a lieu de douter qu\u2019elle ait d\u00fb \u00eatre \u00e9mise en premier lieu.\n[268] Par cons\u00e9quent, il \u00e9tait erron\u00e9 de conclure que la conduite du MDG \u00e9tait frauduleuse ou assimilable \u00e0 une fraude sur la base de l\u2019Ordonnance provisoire ou de l\u2019Injonction du juge Davis. Ni le manquement all\u00e9gu\u00e9 au contrat ni le d\u00e9faut all\u00e9gu\u00e9 de se conformer \u00e0 des injonctions non contraignantes ne permettent de conclure \u00e0 une fraude dans les circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Tel fut aussi l\u2019avis de la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ath\u00e8nes, confirm\u00e9 d\u2019ailleurs par la Cour supr\u00eame de Gr\u00e8ce (d.a., vol. III, p. 104; d\u00e9cision de la Cour supr\u00eame de Gr\u00e8ce, p. 67 et 69).\n(3) Le moment choisi par le MDG pour demander le paiement\n[269] Une autre pr\u00e9occupation du juge de premi\u00e8re instance \u00e9tait le moment choisi par le MDG pour pr\u00e9senter sa demande (par. 182\u2011184). Il peut \u00eatre tentant d\u2019examiner la conduite du MDG apr\u00e8s le fait et de conclure qu\u2019il s\u2019est livr\u00e9 \u00e0 une sorte de fraude. Son d\u00e9faut de rembourser l\u2019argent qu\u2019il a obtenu en vertu de la Lettre de garantie, m\u00eame apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9claration de nullit\u00e9 du Contrat de compensation, est certainement discutable. Je ne puis cependant m\u2019engager dans un raisonnement inadmissible en examinant la conduite du MDG aujourd\u2019hui et en inf\u00e9rer une fraude. Je dois plut\u00f4t me limiter \u00e0 ce qui s\u2019est produit avant le paiement effectu\u00e9 en vertu de la Lettre de garantie, sans l\u2019avantage du recul. Tant et aussi longtemps que le contrat sous\u2011jacent est valable, le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire a le droit de demander le paiement au titre d\u2019une garantie sur demande. De fait, les cons\u00e9quences d\u2019une demande de paiement au titre d\u2019une garantie sur demande [traduction] \u00ab peuvent \u00eatre s\u00e9v\u00e8res, draconiennes et brutales \u00bb sans pour autant constituer une fraude (Royal Bank of Canada c. Darlington, [1995] O.J. No. 1044 (Lexis), 1995 CarswellOnt 2661 (WL) (C.J. (div. g\u00e9n.)), par. 181).\n[270] Il est essentiel de garder \u00e0 l\u2019esprit que la d\u00e9cision minist\u00e9rielle officielle autorisant le recours \u00e0 la Lettre de garantie a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise le 17 juillet 2013. La premi\u00e8re demande de paiement a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e le 5 ao\u00fbt 2013, apr\u00e8s l\u2019envoi de la lettre de demande \u00e0 Bombardier le 31 juillet 2013. Eurobank a refus\u00e9 d\u2019honorer la demande parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas conforme aux conditions de la Lettre de garantie. La deuxi\u00e8me demande de paiement a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e le 12 ao\u00fbt 2013, mais l\u2019Injonction de la juge Pana, \u00e9mise apr\u00e8s la pr\u00e9sentation de cette demande, emp\u00eachait Eurobank de payer. Aucune nouvelle demande n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e pendant que l\u2019Injonction de la juge Pana \u00e9tait en vigueur. \u00c0 mon avis, comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 expliqu\u00e9, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a commis une erreur en n\u2019accordant aucun poids aux jugements grecs. La D\u00e9cision du juge Kostis, dont l\u2019effet \u00e9tait d\u2019\u00e9carter l\u2019Injonction temporaire de la juge Pana, a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le central dans la d\u00e9cision du MDG de r\u00e9it\u00e9rer sa demande de paiement en vertu de la Lettre de garantie. Le MDG n\u2019a r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 sa demande de paiement qu\u2019une fois la D\u00e9cision du juge Kostis rendue en sa faveur, alors que l\u2019Injonction de la juge Pana avait expir\u00e9.\n[271] Cette troisi\u00e8me et derni\u00e8re demande de paiement a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e le 18 d\u00e9cembre 2013, deux jours seulement apr\u00e8s le prononc\u00e9 de la D\u00e9cision du juge Kostis, laquelle a d\u00e9clench\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sentation de cette demande. Il \u00e9tait clairement indiqu\u00e9 dans la demande de paiement ainsi que dans le Prot\u00eat extrajudiciaire que le MDG se pr\u00e9valait de la Lettre de garantie conform\u00e9ment aux conclusions du juge Kostis relativement aux all\u00e9gations de fraude (d.a., vol. VI, p. 79 et 149\u2011150). Il \u00e9tait totalement injustifi\u00e9 \u2014 c\u2019est le moins que l\u2019on puisse dire \u2014 de la part du juge de premi\u00e8re instance d\u2019\u00e9crire que, pour exercer ses droits en vertu du droit grec et de la Lettre de garantie, [traduction] \u00ab le MDG a eu recours \u00e0 ce qui semble \u00eatre rien de moins que du chantage juridique et de l\u2019extorsion pour forcer Eurobank \u00e0 payer \u00bb (par. 182 (je souligne)).\n[272] \u00c0 la face m\u00eame de la Lettre de garantie, il est clair que le MDG pouvait valablement demander le paiement au titre de cet instrument, malgr\u00e9 toute objection de Bombardier ou toute action en justice :\n[traduction] CONFORM\u00c9MENT \u00c0 CE QUI PR\u00c9C\u00c8DE, NOUS, ANZ GRINDLAYS BANK LIMITED (ATH\u00c8NES), FOURNISSONS LA LETTRE DE GARANTIE REQUISE POUR LE FOURNISSEUR ET NOUS NOUS ENGAGEONS PAR CONS\u00c9QUENT \u00c0 VOUS PAYER SUR SIMPLE PR\u00c9SENTATION DE VOTRE PREMI\u00c8RE DEMANDE IRR\u00c9VOCABLEMENT ET INCONDITIONNELLEMENT SANS PREUVE SUPPL\u00c9MENTAIRE AUTRE QUE VOTRE ATTESTATION QUE LE FOURNISSEUR NE S\u2019EST PAS R\u00c9GULI\u00c8REMENT ACQUITT\u00c9 DE SES OBLIGATIONS DE FOURNIR LES COMPENSATIONS SUSMENTIONN\u00c9ES DANS LE D\u00c9LAI PR\u00c9VU PAR L\u2019ARTICLE 5 PARAGRAPHE 5.1 ET L\u2019ARTICLE 19 DU CONTRAT DE COMPENSATION CI\u2011DESSUS, LE MONTANT TOTAL DE LA LETTRE DE GARANTIE DANS UN D\u00c9LAI DE (3) TROIS JOURS OUVRABLES APR\u00c8S LA DATE DE R\u00c9CEPTION DE VOTRE DEMANDE, LE TOUT IND\u00c9PENDAMMENT DE TOUTE OBJECTION ET\/OU TOUT TYPE D\u2019ARGUMENTS DU FOURNISSEUR, TOUTE ACTION EN JUSTICE ENTREPRISE PAR LE FOURNISSEUR DEVANT TOUTE JURIDICTION DE QUELQUE PAYS ET SANS QUE VOUS AYEZ \u00c0 VOUS ADRESSER \u00c0 UN TRIBUNAL D\u2019ARBITRAGE. [Je souligne.]\n(d.a., vol. IV, p. 112)\n[273] Comme le juge Kostis avait rejet\u00e9 la demande d\u2019injonction d\u2019Eurobank, la conclusion, du point de vue du MDG, \u00e9tait qu\u2019il avait un droit contractuel valable de se pr\u00e9valoir de la Lettre de garantie.\n[274] Lorsqu\u2019on la replace dans son contexte, comme l\u2019exigent le droit et les faits de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, la d\u00e9cision du MDG de se pr\u00e9valoir de la Lettre de garantie ne satisfait pas \u00e0 la norme on\u00e9reuse pour \u00e9tablir la fraude. M\u00eame si le MDG a agi \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019Ordonnance provisoire en pr\u00e9sentant une demande et \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019Injonction du juge Davis en ne retirant pas cette demande, ni cette ordonnance ni cette injonction n\u2019\u00e9taient ex\u00e9cutoires en Gr\u00e8ce. Le MDG agissait de toute \u00e9vidence conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la D\u00e9cision du juge Kostis lorsqu\u2019il a demand\u00e9 le paiement en vertu de la Lettre de garantie. Au vu de la D\u00e9cision du juge Kostis, on ne saurait dire que la demande du MDG \u00e9tait \u00ab clairement fausse \u00bb ou \u00ab totalement injustifi\u00e9e \u00bb ou qu\u2019il \u00e9tait \u00ab \u00e9vident qu\u2019il n\u2019existait aucun droit au paiement \u00bb.\n[275] Je suis d\u2019accord avec le juge Hamilton pour dire que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a commis une erreur en concluant \u00e0 la fraude en raison de la conduite du MDG, soit sa violation all\u00e9gu\u00e9e de l\u2019Engagement \u00e9crit, de l\u2019Ordonnance provisoire et de l\u2019Injonction du juge Davis, ainsi que du moment o\u00f9 il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande. Toutefois, avec \u00e9gards, je ne suis pas d\u2019accord avec le juge Hamilton pour dire que la d\u00e9cision du MDG de ne pas rembourser Eurobank apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9bout\u00e9 devant le Tribunal arbitral de la CCI permet de conclure \u00e0 la fraude (par. 200\u2011201). Toute conclusion concernant l\u2019intention du MDG de rembourser ou non rel\u00e8ve de la conjecture et est insuffisante pour conclure \u00e0 une fraude. Sa d\u00e9cision de ne pas rembourser doit plut\u00f4t \u00eatre examin\u00e9e \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re du fait que la Sentence arbitrale n\u2019avait pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 homologu\u00e9e en Gr\u00e8ce. On ne pouvait pas tenir pour acquis que la Sentence arbitrale serait homologu\u00e9e en Gr\u00e8ce et que le MDG ne s\u2019y conformerait pas une fois homologu\u00e9e. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, je souscris \u00e0 l\u2019opinion du juge Mainville selon laquelle le juge de premi\u00e8re instance n\u2019avait pas juridiction pour ordonner au MDG de se conformer \u00e0 la Sentence arbitrale (par. 46). Au moment de l\u2019audience devant notre Cour, Bombardier n\u2019avait pas encore demand\u00e9 l\u2019homologation de la Sentence arbitrale en Gr\u00e8ce.\nC. M\u00eame si la conduite du MDG \u00e9tait frauduleuse ou assimilable \u00e0 une fraude, Eurobank \u00e9tait innocente de cette fraude\n[276] Je me penche d\u00e9sormais sur la question de savoir si l\u2019exception de fraude s\u2019appliquerait aux circonstances en pr\u00e9sumant que la conduite du MDG \u00e9tait frauduleuse ou assimilable \u00e0 une fraude pour les fins de la Lettre de contre\u2011garantie. J\u2019estime que, compte tenu de l\u2019ensemble de la preuve, Eurobank (la b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire) doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme innocente de la fraude all\u00e9gu\u00e9e du MDG (le tiers) aux fins de la Lettre de contre\u2011garantie. L\u00e0 encore, la D\u00e9cision du juge Kostis a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le crucial dans la d\u00e9cision d\u2019Eurobank d\u2019honorer la demande de paiement du MDG. Lorsque l\u2019on tient compte de la D\u00e9cision du juge Kostis, force est de conclure qu\u2019Eurobank n\u2019avait pas une connaissance claire ou \u00e9vidente de la fraude et n\u2019y a pas particip\u00e9. Il y a une contradiction inh\u00e9rente entre l\u2019exigence qu\u2019une cour de r\u00e9vision \u2014 appel\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si une banque avait une connaissance suffisante de la fraude \u2014 se place dans la position de la banque \u00e9mettrice au moment du paiement, tout en \u00e9cartant du m\u00eame coup les d\u00e9cisions des tribunaux comp\u00e9tents qui liaient cette banque \u00e0 ce moment.\n(1) Connaissance d\u2019Eurobank\n[277] Lorsque le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire d\u2019une garantie sur demande a commis une fraude, celle\u2011ci ne sera imput\u00e9e au garant que s\u2019il est \u00e9tabli que ce dernier avait une connaissance claire ou \u00e9vidente de cette fraude. Dans ce contexte, on entend par \u00ab claire \u00bb, ce qui [traduction] \u00ab se pr\u00e9sente sans ambigu\u00eft\u00e9, se comprend ais\u00e9ment, est manifeste, non confus ou douteux \u00bb, tandis que le terme \u00ab \u00e9vident \u00bb signifie [traduction] \u00ab qui s\u2019impose de fa\u00e7on claire et sans peine \u00e0 l\u2019esprit, manifeste, indubitable \u00bb (Royal Bank of Canada, par. 209). En termes simples, il doit s\u2019agir d\u2019une fraude \u00ab qui cr\u00e8v[e] les yeux \u00bb (Mattout, p. 258).\n[278] Pour d\u00e9terminer si Eurobank avait une connaissance claire ou \u00e9vidente de la fraude all\u00e9gu\u00e9e, notre Cour doit se placer exactement dans la m\u00eame situation que celle dans laquelle se trouvait Eurobank en [traduction] \u00ab se mettant \u00e0 [sa] place \u00bb (Kurkela, p. 179-180; Unicredito Italiano S.P.A., Hong Kong Branch c. Alan Chung Wah Tang, [2002] HKCFI 339, par. 32 (HKLII)). Je me limite donc aux faits connus d\u2019Eurobank en date du 24 d\u00e9cembre 2013, date \u00e0 laquelle le paiement a eu lieu. Ce serait une erreur de se fonder sur des renseignements dont Eurobank ne disposait pas \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque. Par exemple, Eurobank ne savait pas si le MDG obtiendrait gain de cause dans la proc\u00e9dure d\u2019arbitrage ou ce qu\u2019il ferait s\u2019il \u00e9tait d\u00e9bout\u00e9.\n[279] Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a estim\u00e9 qu\u2019Eurobank a pay\u00e9 en vertu de la Lettre de garantie [traduction] \u00ab en toute connaissance \u00bb de la fraude du MDG (par. 210). Il s\u2019est appuy\u00e9 sur le fait qu\u2019Eurobank \u00e9tait au courant de l\u2019Engagement \u00e9crit ainsi que de la d\u00e9cision du MDG de se pr\u00e9valoir de la Lettre de garantie en violation de l\u2019Ordonnance provisoire et de l\u2019Injonction du juge Davis. Nul ne conteste qu\u2019Eurobank avait connaissance de ces faits; toutefois, ceux\u2011ci ne peuvent servir de fondement \u00e0 la conclusion qu\u2019Eurobank avait une connaissance claire ou \u00e9vidente de la fraude. Je m\u2019explique.\n[280] Apr\u00e8s la demande de paiement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le MDG en vertu de la Lettre de garantie le 5 ao\u00fbt 2013, Eurobank a saisi la Cour de premi\u00e8re instance d\u2019Ath\u00e8nes de sa propre demande d\u2019injonction. Cette demande a finalement \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e au m\u00e9rite par le juge Kostis le 16 d\u00e9cembre 2013. Eurobank, le MDG, Bombardier et Banque Nationale \u00e9taient tous repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s dans cette instance et ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 leur preuve quant \u00e0 la fraude all\u00e9gu\u00e9e. Dans le cadre de ce processus, le juge Kostis a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 de la proc\u00e9dure d\u2019arbitrage, de l\u2019Ordonnance provisoire, de l\u2019Injonction du juge Pr\u00e9vost et de l\u2019Engagement \u00e9crit. Malgr\u00e9 tout cela, le juge Kostis a \u00e9tabli que rien ne justifiait le prononc\u00e9 de l\u2019injonction : [traduction] \u00ab . . . la conduite [du MDG], qui d\u00e9fend ses droits, n\u2019est pas pour autant abusive; on ne peut pas non plus supposer que ce comportement est abusif. . . \u00bb (d.a., vol. VI, p. 75). Le juge Kostis a refus\u00e9 d\u2019interdire \u00e0 Eurobank de faire le paiement en vertu de la Lettre de garantie.\n[281] Eurobank s\u2019est ensuite retrouv\u00e9e devant un jugement d\u2019un tribunal comp\u00e9tent (qui, j\u2019insiste, \u00e9tait le seul tribunal comp\u00e9tent pour l\u2019application de la Lettre de garantie), lequel a conclu que le MDG pouvait valablement se pr\u00e9valoir de la Lettre de garantie. La D\u00e9cision du juge Kostis, en tant que contrainte factuelle, est un \u00e9l\u00e9ment d\u00e9terminant dans l\u2019analyse de la \u00ab connaissance claire ou \u00e9vidente \u00bb d\u2019Eurobank. Celle\u2011ci \u00e9tait au courant de l\u2019all\u00e9gation de conduite frauduleuse \u00e0 l\u2019endroit du MDG; Eurobank et les autres parties ont soumis au tribunal grec la preuve telle qu\u2019elle existait \u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0. Toutefois, le juge Kostis a tout de m\u00eame estim\u00e9 que le MDG pouvait valablement se pr\u00e9valoir de la lettre, car il n\u2019y avait aucune raison de conclure qu\u2019un acte frauduleux avait \u00e9t\u00e9 commis. Je m\u2019explique mal comment on peut conclure qu\u2019Eurobank avait connaissance de la fraude, encore moins qu\u2019elle en avait une connaissance claire ou \u00e9vidente dans ce contexte.\n[282] Apr\u00e8s que le juge Kostis ait rendu sa d\u00e9cision, le MDG a r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 sa demande de paiement le 18 d\u00e9cembre 2013. Eurobank a par la suite communiqu\u00e9 avec Banque Nationale pour l\u2019informer qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait d\u2019autre choix que de payer. Il ressort clairement de ces \u00e9changes qu\u2019Eurobank croyait \u2014 \u00e0 juste titre, selon moi \u2014 que le MDG formulait sa demande conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la D\u00e9cision du juge Kostis. En effet, Eurobank a inform\u00e9 Banque Nationale que sa demande d\u2019injonction avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e par le juge Kostis. Elle lui a en outre expliqu\u00e9 que l\u2019Injonction de la juge Pana avait par cons\u00e9quent expir\u00e9. En l\u2019absence d\u2019une injonction contraignante, elle devait payer le MDG : [traduction] \u00ab AUX TERMES DE [LA LETTRE DE GARANTIE] ET DU DROIT GREC APPLICABLE, NOUS AVONS L\u2019OBLIGATION DE PAYER AU B\u00c9N\u00c9FICIAIRE LA SOMME DE 13 868 354,40 $ DANS UN D\u00c9LAI DE TROIS JOURS OUVRABLES . . . \u00bb (d.a., vol. VI, p. 84).\n[283] Apr\u00e8s que le juge Davis ait accord\u00e9 l\u2019injonction le 20 d\u00e9cembre 2013, Eurobank a m\u00eame contact\u00e9 le MDG pour lui demander de reconsid\u00e9rer sa demande de paiement \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de cette injonction (d.a., vol. VI, p. 173\u2011176). C\u2019\u00e9tait le 23 d\u00e9cembre 2013. En r\u00e9ponse, le MDG a signifi\u00e9 \u00e0 Eurobank le Prot\u00eat extrajudiciaire, par lequel il lui intimait de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 un paiement en vertu de la Lettre de garantie, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de quoi elle s\u2019exposait \u00e0 des recours civils et \u00e0 des sanctions p\u00e9nales. [traduction] \u00ab Il s\u2019agissait de sanctions graves et Eurobank, en tant que banque grecque, y \u00e9tait expos\u00e9e \u00bb (motifs de la C.A., par. 215). Dans le Prot\u00eat extrajudiciaire, le MDG indiquait que l\u2019Injonction du juge Davis ne pouvait pas \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e en Gr\u00e8ce, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision contraire rendue par le juge Kostis. De plus, le MDG soulignait que [traduction] \u00ab les tribunaux grecs n\u2019auraient pas juridiction pour rendre un jugement dans le cadre d\u2019une demande visant \u00e0 obtenir des mesures et une injonction provisoires pour non\u2011paiement d\u2019une lettre de garantie payable sur demande, l\u2019\u00c9tat canadien agissant comme d\u00e9fendeur et b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de la lettre de garantie et une banque canadienne agissant comme d\u00e9bitrice \u00bb (d.a., vol. VI, p. 150).\n[284] C\u2019est dans ce contexte qu\u2019Eurobank devait prendre une d\u00e9cision. Selon le point de vue raisonnable d\u2019Eurobank (Mitchell, p. 716), la D\u00e9cision du juge Kostis et le Prot\u00eat extrajudiciaire auraient dissip\u00e9 toute connaissance de fraude qu\u2019elle aurait pu avoir. En effet, Eurobank a sp\u00e9cifiquement plaid\u00e9 devant les tribunaux grecs \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 2013 que le MDG [traduction] \u00ab avait exerc\u00e9 son droit \u00e0 un paiement en vertu de la Lettre de garantie d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui [\u00e9tait] et qui continu[e] d\u2019\u00eatre manifestement abusive et de mauvaise foi \u00bb (d.a., vol. VI, p. 19). Cet argument d\u2019Eurobank n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 retenu. Tout soup\u00e7on qui pouvait subsister dans l\u2019esprit d\u2019Eurobank dans ce contexte est par cons\u00e9quent devenu sans objet. Il ne s\u2019agit certainement pas d\u2019une \u00ab connaissance claire ou \u00e9vidente \u00bb o\u00f9 la fraude \u00ab cr\u00e8ve les yeux \u00bb. Je suis d\u2019accord avec le juge Hamilton de la Cour d\u2019appel que de tels soup\u00e7ons n\u2019atteignent pas le niveau requis pour que l\u2019on puisse conclure \u00e0 une connaissance claire ou \u00e9vidente (par. 217\u2011218; Banco Nacional, p. 119-120).\n(2) Participation all\u00e9gu\u00e9e d\u2019Eurobank\n[285] Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a conclu qu\u2019Eurobank avait particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la fraude du MDG en choisissant de payer [traduction] \u00ab en violation de non pas une, mais deux ordonnances \u00bb, c.\u2011\u00e0\u2011d., l\u2019Ordonnance provisoire et l\u2019Injonction Davis (par. 197). Bien qu\u2019Eurobank [traduction] \u00ab n\u2019ait \u00e9t\u00e9 associ\u00e9e d\u2019aucune fa\u00e7on que ce soit \u00bb avec la fraude all\u00e9gu\u00e9e du MDG, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a n\u00e9anmoins conclu qu\u2019elle \u00ab a sciemment permis \u00e0 la fraude de produire ses fruits \u00bb (par. 196 et 205). Il a conclu qu\u2019Eurobank avait le choix de se conformer \u00e0 ces deux ordonnances ou de se conformer au Prot\u00eat extrajudiciaire du MDG. Sur la base de la d\u00e9cision d\u2019Eurobank de se conformer \u00e0 celui\u2011ci, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a inf\u00e9r\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait eu participation frauduleuse.\n[286] Il est vrai que la d\u00e9cision d\u2019Eurobank de payer \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab volontaire \u00bb (motifs de la C.S., par. 196). Toutefois, la question du caract\u00e8re volontaire du paiement n\u2019est pas celle qu\u2019il convient de se poser. Lorsqu\u2019une banque effectue un paiement au titre d\u2019une garantie sur demande, elle le fait toujours volontairement. Ce qui importe, c\u2019est de savoir si un tribunal comp\u00e9tent a ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 Eurobank de ne pas payer sur la base d\u2019une solide preuve prima facie de fraude ou si elle a choisi de payer bien que des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve clairs ou \u00e9vidents de fraude lui aient \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u2014 aucune de ces situations, comme je l\u2019ai conclu, n\u2019\u00e9tant applicable. De simples soup\u00e7ons de \u00ab circonstances irr\u00e9guli\u00e8res \u00bb ne sont pas suffisants pour satisfaire \u00e0 la norme on\u00e9reuse de l\u2019exception de fraude. La difficult\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est qu\u2019il y avait des ordonnances contradictoires de diff\u00e9rentes cours et d\u2019un tribunal arbitral. En r\u00e9alit\u00e9, la seule ordonnance qui pouvait \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019Eurobank, soit la d\u00e9cision du juge Kostis, ne lui ordonnait pas de ne pas payer. Il n\u2019y avait aucun \u00ab choix \u00bb \u00e0 faire.\n[287] Bien que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance ait conclu que le juge Kostis, en refusant dans sa d\u00e9cision d\u2019accorder l\u2019injonction demand\u00e9e, n\u2019ait pas express\u00e9ment ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 Eurobank de payer, il faut garder \u00e0 l\u2019esprit la nature fondamentale des garanties sur demande. Comme je l\u2019ai expliqu\u00e9, une garantie sur demande oblige la banque \u00e0 payer sur pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019une demande de paiement \u00e9crite qui est conforme aux conditions de la garantie. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un engagement irr\u00e9vocable et d\u00e9finitif de payer. Les termes de la Lettre de garantie elle\u2011m\u00eame confirment ce principe :\n[traduction] [. . .] IND\u00c9PENDAMMENT DE TOUTE OBJECTION ET\/OU TOUT TYPE D\u2019ARGUMENTS DU FOURNISSEUR, TOUTE ACTION EN JUSTICE ENTREPRISE PAR LE FOURNISSEUR DEVANT TOUTE JURIDICTION DE QUELQUE PAYS ET SANS QUE VOUS AYEZ \u00c0 VOUS ADRESSER \u00c0 UN TRIBUNAL D\u2019ARBITRAGE. [Je souligne.]\n(d.a., vol. IV, p. 112)\n[288] Ce texte indique clairement qu\u2019Eurobank ne pouvait pas refuser de payer sans outrepasser ind\u00fbment son r\u00f4le de garant et empi\u00e9ter sur le domaine des parties. La seule mani\u00e8re d\u2019emp\u00eacher Eurobank de payer en vertu de la Lettre de garantie \u00e9tait une injonction \u00e9mise par un tribunal comp\u00e9tent sur la base d\u2019une solide preuve prima facie de fraude. Eurobank a sollicit\u00e9 cette injonction, qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e temporairement, mais a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9bout\u00e9e de sa demande d\u2019injonction permanente. Bombardier \u2014 et non Banque Nationale \u2014 a pris des mesures, mais a introduit une instance devant une cour qui n\u2019avait pas juridiction pour interdire \u00e0 Eurobank, ni au MDG d\u2019ailleurs, d\u2019honorer la Lettre de garantie.\n[289] Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019Eurobank aurait d\u00fb choisir de se conformer \u00e0 l\u2019Injonction du juge Davis et \u00e0 l\u2019Ordonnance provisoire plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00e0 la D\u00e9cision du juge Kostis et au Prot\u00eat extrajudiciaire. \u00c0 mon avis, il n\u2019est simplement pas raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019Eurobank, face \u00e0 ce soi\u2011disant \u00ab choix \u00bb, se conforme \u00e0 des ordonnances qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas ex\u00e9cutoires \u00e0 son encontre. L\u2019Injonction du juge Davis n\u2019\u00e9tait pas ex\u00e9cutoire en Gr\u00e8ce et elle, tout comme l\u2019Injonction du juge Pr\u00e9vost, n\u2019aurait probablement pas d\u00fb \u00eatre \u00e9mise en premier lieu. Pour ce qui est de l\u2019Ordonnance provisoire, Eurobank n\u2019\u00e9tait pas partie \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure d\u2019arbitrage et ne pouvait donc pas \u00eatre li\u00e9e par celle\u2011ci (Desputeaux c. \u00c9ditions Chouette (1987) inc., 2003 CSC 17, [2003] 1 R.C.S. 178, par. 62). Il convient de noter que la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ath\u00e8nes et la Cour supr\u00eame de Gr\u00e8ce ont conclu qu\u2019Eurobank n\u2019avait d\u2019autre choix que de payer. Le paiement devait \u00eatre fait en vertu de la Lettre de garantie en raison de son caract\u00e8re autonome et du fait qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait aucune injonction en vigueur. La D\u00e9cision du juge Kostis avait rejet\u00e9 la demande d\u2019injonction pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Eurobank et l\u2019Injonction du juge Davis et l\u2019Ordonnance provisoire n\u2019\u00e9taient pas contraignantes en Gr\u00e8ce (d\u00e9cision de la Cour supr\u00eame de Gr\u00e8ce, p. 67, citant avec approbation la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ath\u00e8nes, reproduite au d.a., vol. III, p. 100\u2011102). Je ne saurais mieux dire que le juge Hamilton : [traduction] \u00ab . . . il est important que l\u2019injonction soit demand\u00e9e \u00e0 la bonne cour et pour la bonne raison \u00bb (par. 210).\n[290] \u00c0 mon avis, la conduite d\u2019Eurobank est celle d\u2019un b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire innocent pour les fins de la Lettre de contre\u2011garantie. Eurobank a jou\u00e9 le r\u00f4le qu\u2019elle s\u2019\u00e9tait engag\u00e9e \u00e0 jouer aux termes de la Lettre de garantie. Elle n\u2019a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 aucune fraude et elle n\u2019avait pas non plus une connaissance claire ou \u00e9vidente de la fraude all\u00e9gu\u00e9e du MDG au moment du paiement. Comme les conditions relatives \u00e0 l\u2019exception de fraude n\u2019\u00e9taient pas remplies, l\u2019autonomie des garanties sur demande \u2014 leur principe directeur et leur raison d\u2019\u00eatre \u2014 devait l\u2019emporter.\n(3) La r\u00e9partition du risque entre les parties\n[291] Je ne puis accepter l\u2019argument de Bombardier selon lequel il appartenait \u00e0 Eurobank de supporter les risques li\u00e9s au paiement dans ce contexte. Il ressort clairement du texte de la Lettre de contre\u2011garantie qu\u2019Eurobank n\u2019a assum\u00e9 aucun risque en s\u2019engageant \u00e0 payer en vertu de la Lettre de garantie, sauf dans des circonstances tr\u00e8s limit\u00e9es. Il est \u00e9galement \u00e9vident qu\u2019Eurobank s\u2019est conform\u00e9e aux conditions strictes \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans la Lettre de contre\u2011garantie :\n[traduction] EN CONSID\u00c9RATION DE LA GARANTIE SUSMENTIONN\u00c9E QUE VOUS AVEZ \u00c9MISE \u00c0 NOTRE DEMANDE, NOUS, LA BANQUE NATIONALE DU CANADA, NOUS ENGAGEONS IRR\u00c9VOCABLEMENT PAR LA PR\u00c9SENTE \u00c0 VOUS REMBOURSER TOUTES LES SOMMES R\u00c9CLAM\u00c9ES PAR LE B\u00c9N\u00c9FICIAIRE DE VOTRE GARANTIE JUSQU\u2019\u00c0 CONCURRENCE DE 27 736 709 $ US (VINGT\u2011SEPT MILLIONS SEPT CENT TRENTE\u2011SIX MILLE SEPT CENT NEUF DOLLARS AM\u00c9RICAINS) PLUS FRAIS, DROITS DE TIMBRE ET TAXES SUR LA VALEUR AJOUT\u00c9E APPLICABLES, AU M\u00caME TAUX DE VALEUR QU\u2019\u00c0 LA DATE DE VOTRE PAIEMENT, APR\u00c8S R\u00c9CEPTION DE VOTRE T\u00c9LEX VALIDE\/SWIFT AUTHENTIFI\u00c9 INDIQUANT QUE VOUS AVEZ RE\u00c7U DE LA PART DU B\u00c9N\u00c9FICIAIRE DE VOTRE GARANTIE UNE DEMANDE DE PAIEMENT CONFORME AUX CONDITIONS DE VOTRE GARANTIE. [Je souligne.]\n(d.a., vol. IV, p. 118)\n[292] Une fois qu\u2019Eurobank s\u2019est conform\u00e9e \u00e0 la demande du MDG et qu\u2019elle a pay\u00e9 en vertu de la Lettre de garantie, Banque Nationale \u00e9tait oblig\u00e9e d\u2019honorer la demande de paiement d\u2019Eurobank en vertu de la Lettre de contre\u2011garantie. Les parties ont accept\u00e9 cette cha\u00eene causale de demandes et de paiements, qui reposait sur une structure de type [traduction] \u00ab payez maintenant, argumentez plus tard \u00bb.\n[293] Eurobank n\u2019\u00e9tait pas partie au Contrat de compensation. Il n\u2019est pas logique d\u2019un point de vue commercial qu\u2019Eurobank, en tant qu\u2019institution garantissant simplement la transaction, soit seule \u00e0 supporter les risques d\u00e9coulant de cette transaction. Comme je l\u2019ai expliqu\u00e9, une telle conclusion compromettrait le r\u00f4le des banques dans ce type de transaction. Bien que Bombardier affirme devant notre Cour que la d\u00e9cision de faire \u00e9mettre une contre\u2011garantie assujettie au droit qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois visait \u00e0 assurer qu\u2019elle puisse avoir recours \u00e0 l\u2019exception de fraude, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve laissent plut\u00f4t croire qu\u2019Eurobank a exig\u00e9 la Lettre de contre\u2011garantie afin d\u2019att\u00e9nuer tout risque auquel elle pouvait \u00eatre expos\u00e9e. De plus, la pratique commerciale internationale veut que les banques locales qui garantissent des transactions entre acteurs locaux et \u00e9trangers transigent avec une banque \u00e9trang\u00e8re au lieu de traiter directement avec la partie \u00e9trang\u00e8re (L\u2019Heureux et Lacoursi\u00e8re, p. 430-431; Mattout, p. 241\u2011244; Kurkela, p. 14; Bertrams, p. 118\u2011119; Ellinger et Neo, p. 335; Droit bancaire : Institutions, comptes, op\u00e9rations, services (8e \u00e9d. 2010), par J. Stoufflet, n\u00b0 880). En faisant en sorte que la Lettre de contre\u2011garantie soit garantie par une banque qui \u00e9tait locale \u00e0 Bombardier, Eurobank s\u2019attendait \u00e0 \u00eatre pay\u00e9e. Elle s\u2019est assur\u00e9e de ne pas avoir \u00e0 composer avec de lourdes proc\u00e9dures au Qu\u00e9bec en cas de litige concernant le paiement.\n[294] Puisque les exigences relatives \u00e0 l\u2019exception de fraude ne sont pas remplies, il ne reste que la Lettre de contre\u2011garantie. Comme le soutient Eurobank, elle s\u2019est acquitt\u00e9e de la seule obligation qui lui incombait en vertu de la Lettre de contre\u2011garantie \u2014 elle a inform\u00e9 Banque Nationale qu\u2019elle avait re\u00e7u une demande de paiement conforme de la part du MDG. Les conditions et formalit\u00e9s de la lettre \u00e9taient respect\u00e9es; rien dans ce contexte ne peut emp\u00eacher Banque Nationale d\u2019honorer cette demande. Respecter l\u2019autonomie de la Lettre de contre\u2011garantie et l\u2019examiner ind\u00e9pendamment de tout litige sous\u2011jacent m\u00e8ne \u00e0 la conclusion que Banque Nationale est tenue d\u2019honorer la demande de paiement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Eurobank.\nD. Incidence de la d\u00e9claration de nullit\u00e9 du Contrat de compensation sur les Lettres de garantie et de contre\u2011garantie\n[295] \u00c0 titre d\u2019argument subsidiaire \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa demande, Bombardier demande \u00e0 notre Cour d\u2019interdire \u00e0 Banque Nationale de payer en vertu de la Lettre de contre\u2011garantie au motif que le Contrat de compensation a \u00e9t\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab d\u00e9clar\u00e9 nul ab initio \u00bb par le Tribunal arbitral de la CCI (d.a., vol. VI, p. 143). Cette th\u00e8se repose sur deux arguments.\n[296] Premi\u00e8rement, Bombardier soutient qu\u2019Eurobank ne peut \u00eatre pay\u00e9e en vertu de la Lettre de contre\u2011garantie, parce que selon l\u2019art. 1422 C.c.Q., ce contrat est r\u00e9put\u00e9 n\u2019avoir jamais exist\u00e9 (m.i., par. 121 et 128). Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a retenu cet argument dans les termes suivants : [traduction] \u00ab Il est \u00e9vident que, comme la Lettre de garantie a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9e nulle ab initio par le Tribunal arbitral de la CCI dans sa sentence finale, laquelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 homologu\u00e9e par notre Cour, il doit en \u00eatre de m\u00eame pour la contre\u2011garantie et il doit \u00eatre ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 la [Banque Nationale] de ne pas payer Eurobank \u00bb (par. 240). \u00c0 mon avis, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a commis une erreur en tenant ces propos. Le Tribunal arbitral de la CCI n\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 la nullit\u00e9 ab initio que des clauses pertinentes du Contrat de compensation, et non de la Lettre de garantie elle\u2011m\u00eame. De plus, une telle d\u00e9claration du juge de premi\u00e8re instance va \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du principe bien \u00e9tabli de l\u2019autonomie de la garantie. Lorsque le contrat sous-jacent \u00e0 une garantie sur demande est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 nul, la garantie n\u2019en est pas pour autant invalide parce qu\u2019elle est contraire \u00e0 l\u2019ordre public comme le pr\u00e9voit l\u2019art. 1411 C.c.Q. Aux termes d\u2019une garantie sur demande, la banque s\u2019engage \u00e0 payer, sur simple pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019une demande et ind\u00e9pendamment de tout litige sous\u2011jacent. Cette obligation est [traduction] \u00ab s\u00e9par\u00e9e et distincte \u00bb du contrat sous\u2011jacent (G. B. Graham et B. Geva, \u00ab Standby Credits in Canada \u00bb (1984) 9 Rev. can. dr. comm. 180, p. 189; L\u2019Heureux et Lacoursi\u00e8re, p. 428-429). La nullit\u00e9 du Contrat de compensation ne fait pas dispara\u00eetre, aux termes de l\u2019art. 1371 C.c.Q., la cause de l\u2019obligation de payer qui incombe \u00e0 Banque Nationale. La Lettre de contre\u2011garantie demeure donc valide.\n[297] Deuxi\u00e8mement, Bombardier soutient que la Lettre de contre\u2011garantie ne devrait pas \u00eatre ex\u00e9cutoire parce que le Contrat de compensation \u00e9tait ill\u00e9gal (m.i., par. 126\u2011127). En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019examiner en d\u00e9tail cet argument puisque, lorsque Eurobank a pay\u00e9 en vertu de la Lettre de garantie et a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande en vertu de la Lettre de contre\u2011garantie, la Sentence arbitrale n\u2019avait pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue. En outre, Eurobank n\u2019\u00e9tait pas partie \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure d\u2019arbitrage et n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en mesure de savoir si le MDG obtiendrait ou non gain de cause. Il serait [traduction] \u00ab injuste \u00bb d\u2019imposer \u00e0 Eurobank une nouvelle exception au principe d\u2019autonomie pour cause illicite apr\u00e8s qu\u2019elle ait [traduction] \u00ab rempli [sa] part du march\u00e9 \u00bb (L. Sarna, Letters of Credit : The Law and Current Practice (3e \u00e9d. (feuilles mobiles)), p. 5\u201116.1). Eurobank ne devrait pas avoir \u00e0 faire les frais de la nullit\u00e9 du Contrat de compensation. Garantir la transaction \u00e9tait cens\u00e9 \u00eatre sans risque pour Eurobank. Son aversion pour le risque \u00e9tait \u00e0 l\u2019origine m\u00eame de l\u2019\u00e9mission de la Lettre de contre\u2011garantie. En fin de compte, [traduction] \u00ab [c]\u2019est Bombardier qui a pris un risque et c\u2019est elle qui doit l\u2019assumer \u00bb (motifs de la C.A., par. 230).\n[298] Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, la question du caract\u00e8re ex\u00e9cutoire de la Sentence arbitrale \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du MDG n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e. En effet, la Sentence arbitrale n\u2019a pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 homologu\u00e9e en Gr\u00e8ce, de sorte qu\u2019on ne peut formuler d\u2019hypoth\u00e8ses quant au r\u00e9sultat final.\nVII. Dispositif\n[299] Je suis d\u2019avis d\u2019accueillir le pourvoi, d\u2019annuler les jugements rendus en appel et en premi\u00e8re instance et de rejeter l\u2019action intent\u00e9e par Bombardier contre Eurobank et Banque Nationale, le tout avec d\u00e9pens en faveur d\u2019Eurobank devant toutes les cours.\nPourvoi rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens, les juges Karakatsanis et C\u00f4t\u00e9 sont dissidentes.\nProcureurs de l\u2019appelante Eurobank Ergasias S.A. : Renno Vathilakis inc., Montr\u00e9al.\nProcureurs de l\u2019appelante General Directorate for Defense Armaments and Investments of the Hellenic Ministry of National Defense : Angelopoulos Attorneys, Laval.\nProcureurs de l\u2019intim\u00e9e Bombardier inc. : Norton Rose Fulbright Canada, Montr\u00e9al; Bombardier inc., Dorval.\nProcureurs de l\u2019intim\u00e9e la Banque Nationale du Canada : Woods, Montr\u00e9al.\nProcureurs de l\u2019intervenante : Gowling WLG (Canada), Montr\u00e9al.\n[1] ANZ Grindlays Bank Limited a \u00e9t\u00e9 remplac\u00e9e par New TT Hellenic Postbank S.A. et enfin par Eurobank Ergasias S.A. Il est important de noter que, bien qu\u2019Eurobank ait remplac\u00e9 ANZ Grindlays et Postbank, ce n\u2019est pas la conduite d\u2019Eurobank dont il est question dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, mais celle de sa pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseure. Eurobank n\u2019\u00e9tait pas impliqu\u00e9e lorsque le paiement en vertu de la Lettre de garantie a \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9 au MDG en d\u00e9cembre 2013.",

Les personnes accus\u00e9es des groupes 2, 3, et 4 ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des requ\u00eates similaires \u00e0 celle d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par le groupe 1.\nLe juge de premi\u00e8re instance a ordonn\u00e9 l\u2019arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019ensemble des personnes accus\u00e9es du groupe 1.

Se fondant sur l\u2019effet cumulatif de ces violations, qu\u2019il consid\u00e9rait \u00eatres les plus graves, et d\u2019autres violations et contraventions aux proc\u00e9dures prescrites, le juge a conclu \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019un abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle. Les groupes 2, 3 et 4 ainsi que la Couronne ont convenu que la d\u00e9cision rendue \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du groupe 1 \u00e9tait applicable \u00e0 ces groupes et un arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9 \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard. La Cour d\u2019appel a accueilli les appels de la Couronne, cass\u00e9 les deux jugements et ordonn\u00e9 la tenue d\u2019un nouveau proc\u00e8s, incluant une nouvelle audition de la requ\u00eate, au motif que certaines personnes accus\u00e9es n\u2019avaient pas l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat requis pour obtenir un arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures et que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance avait omis de d\u00e9terminer si le droit de chaque personne accus\u00e9e garanti par. l\u2019al. 10b) avait \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9 avant de conclure \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019un abus de proc\u00e9dure sous l\u2019art. 7. Les personnes accus\u00e9es se pourvoient devant la Cour.\nArr\u00eat : Le pourvoi est rejet\u00e9.\nLe juge en chef Wagner et les juges Karakatsanis, Martin, Kasirer, Jamal et O\u2019Bonsawin : La tenue d\u2019un nouveau proc\u00e8s pour le groupe 1 ainsi que pour les groupes 2, 3 et 4, incluant de nouvelles auditions des requ\u00eates en arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures, est indiqu\u00e9e. Toutes les personnes accus\u00e9es avaient l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat requis afin de demander un arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures en vertu du par. 24(1) de la Charte m\u00eame si certaines d\u2019entre elles n\u2019ont subi aucune des violations constituant l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure all\u00e9gu\u00e9 ni aucune entorse \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de leur proc\u00e8s. Toutefois, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a err\u00e9 en omettant de d\u00e9terminer si le droit de chaque personne accus\u00e9e garanti par l\u2019al. 10b) de la Charte avait \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9, une d\u00e9termination n\u00e9cessaire afin de d\u00e9cider si l\u2019all\u00e9gation d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a \u00e9galement fait erreur en ordonnant l\u2019arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de toutes les personnes accus\u00e9es sans avoir d\u2019abord consid\u00e9r\u00e9 l\u2019existence des r\u00e9parations moins draconiennes qui auraient pu corriger enti\u00e8rement l\u2019atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de justice qu\u2019il croyait avoir identifi\u00e9e.\nDeux types de conduites \u00e9tatiques atteignent le seuil requis pour \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019un abus de proc\u00e9dure : celles qui compromettent l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 du proc\u00e8s (la \u00ab cat\u00e9gorie principale \u00bb), et celles qui, sans n\u00e9cessairement menacer l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 du proc\u00e8s de la personne accus\u00e9e, minent n\u00e9anmoins l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de justice (la \u00ab cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle \u00bb). L\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie principale fait intervenir les dispositions de la Charte qui visent \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 du proc\u00e8s des personnes accus\u00e9es, \u00e0 savoir les art. 8 \u00e0 14 de la Charte , ainsi que les principes de justice fondamentale \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 7. L\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle, pour sa part, fait intervenir uniquement les principes de justice fondamentale de l\u2019art. 7 de la Charte , lesquels prot\u00e8gent les personnes accus\u00e9es contre toute conduite \u00e9tatique in\u00e9quitable ou vexatoire au point de contrevenir aux notions fondamentales de justice et de miner ainsi l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de justice, et ce, peu importe l\u2019impact de la conduite sur les autres droits constitutionnels de la personne accus\u00e9e ou sur l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de son proc\u00e8s. Lorsqu\u2019un abus de proc\u00e9dure est constat\u00e9, peu importe la cat\u00e9gorie dont il rel\u00e8ve, et qu\u2019une garantie de la Charte est viol\u00e9e, le par. 24(1) de la Charte conf\u00e8re au tribunal comp\u00e9tent le pouvoir d\u2019accorder la r\u00e9paration qu\u2019il estime convenable et juste dans les circonstances. L\u2019arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures ne sera ordonn\u00e9 que dans l\u2019\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 la situation satisfait au crit\u00e8re exigeant qui requiert qu\u2019elle fasse partie des cas les plus manifestes. Pour qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse d\u2019un tel cas, trois conditions doivent \u00eatre r\u00e9unies : (1) il doit y avoir une atteinte au droit de la personne accus\u00e9e \u00e0 un proc\u00e8s \u00e9quitable ou \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de justice qui sera r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e, perp\u00e9tu\u00e9e ou aggrav\u00e9e par le d\u00e9roulement du proc\u00e8s ou par son issue; (2) il ne doit y avoir aucune autre r\u00e9paration susceptible de corriger l\u2019atteinte; (3) s\u2019il subsiste une incertitude quant \u00e0 l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 de l\u2019arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures \u00e0 l\u2019issue des deux premi\u00e8res \u00e9tapes, le tribunal doit mettre en balance les int\u00e9r\u00eats militant en faveur de cet arr\u00eat, d\u2019une part, et l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat que repr\u00e9sente pour la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 un jugement d\u00e9finitif statuant sur le fond, d\u2019autre part.\nUne personne accus\u00e9e a l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat requis pour demander une r\u00e9paration en vertu du par. 24(1), dont l\u2019arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures, lorsque ses all\u00e9gations \u00e9noncent les \u00e9l\u00e9ments essentiels qui devront \u00eatre d\u00e9montr\u00e9s afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir la violation de l\u2019un des droits que lui garantit la Charte . L\u2019existence d\u2019un pr\u00e9judice directement personnel ne fait pas partie des \u00e9l\u00e9ments essentiels qui doivent \u00eatre d\u00e9montr\u00e9s afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir la violation du droit garanti par l\u2019art. 7 en raison d\u2019un abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle. Une atteinte aux autres droits de la personne accus\u00e9e ou \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de son proc\u00e8s sera pertinente mais non d\u00e9terminante, car le type de pr\u00e9judice vis\u00e9 par les principes de justice fondamentale \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 7 va bien au\u2011del\u00e0 du pr\u00e9judice personnel; il faut seulement conclure \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019une conduite \u00e9tatique qui a des r\u00e9percussions \u00e0 plus grande \u00e9chelle, soit une conduite qui porte atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de justice aux yeux de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\nToutefois, pour conclure que le droit garanti \u00e0 une personne accus\u00e9e par l\u2019art. 7 a \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9 en raison de l\u2019existence d\u2019un abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle, il doit y avoir un lien de causalit\u00e9 suffisant entre la conduite abusive et les proc\u00e9dures visant la personne accus\u00e9e. Ce lien sera consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme suffisant lorsque les proc\u00e9dures criminelles intent\u00e9es contre cette personne sont entach\u00e9es par la conduite abusive, ce qui sera le cas lorsqu\u2019une conduite abusive a eu lieu dans le cadre de l\u2019enqu\u00eate, de l\u2019op\u00e9ration polici\u00e8re ou de l\u2019instance criminelle visant la personne accus\u00e9e. Cette exigence est conforme \u00e0 l\u2019objet de la doctrine de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle, soit permettre aux tribunaux de prot\u00e9ger l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de justice en se dissociant des conduites \u00e9tatiques qui abusent du processus judiciaire. Elle est \u00e9galement coh\u00e9rente avec les balises applicables \u00e0 l\u2019octroi d\u2019un arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures en vertu du par. 24(1), dont les trois conditions cumulatives permettent de filtrer les demandes en arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures afin de s\u2019assurer que seulement les cas les plus manifestes donnent droit \u00e0 cette r\u00e9paration, ce qui exclut les cas des personnes accus\u00e9es dont les proc\u00e9dures n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 entach\u00e9es au pr\u00e9alable par une conduite abusive.\nLorsqu\u2019une violation de l\u2019art. 7 de la Charte est invoqu\u00e9 conjointement avec une violation d\u2019une ou plusieurs garanties proc\u00e9durales, l\u2019ordre de priorit\u00e9 qu\u2019un tribunal doit suivre d\u00e9pendra des faits de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, de la nature des droits prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par la Charte en jeu et de la mani\u00e8re dont ils se recoupent. Dans le contexte de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure, tant l\u2019art. 7 que les garanties proc\u00e9durales sp\u00e9cifiques pr\u00e9vues aux art. 8 \u00e0 14 de la Charte visent \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger l\u2019individu contre les conduites qui sont vexatoires au point de contrevenir aux notions fondamentales de justice et de miner ainsi l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de justice. L\u2019article 7 joue un r\u00f4le compl\u00e9mentaire \u00e0 celui des art. 8 \u00e0 14 en offrant, contre les abus de proc\u00e9dures, une protection r\u00e9siduelle qui va au\u2011del\u00e0 des protections offertes par les garanties sp\u00e9cifiques pr\u00e9vues aux art. 8 \u00e0 14. Il n\u2019est donc pas inusit\u00e9 que l\u2019art. 7 de la Charte soit invoqu\u00e9 en m\u00eame temps qu\u2019une ou plusieurs autres garanties proc\u00e9durales. En effet, des conduites \u00e9tatiques abusives peuvent prendre toutes sortes de formes et l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle peut reposer sur un cumul d\u2019incidents ou d\u2019inconduites \u00e9tatiques. De plus, rien ne s\u2019oppose \u00e0 ce que ces incidents ou ces inconduites prennent la forme de violations d\u2019une garantie proc\u00e9durale de la Charte et que, par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure all\u00e9gu\u00e9 r\u00e9sulte d\u2019un cumul de violations d\u2019une ou de plusieurs garanties. Il s\u2019ensuit que les cadres d\u2019analyse des art. 7 et 8 \u00e0 14 peuvent coexister, et il est tout \u00e0 fait appropri\u00e9 d\u2019avoir recours au cadre d\u2019analyse d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 pour l\u2019application de l\u2019art. 7 afin d\u2019analyser tout cumul de violations d\u2019une ou de plusieurs garanties proc\u00e9durales dans le but de d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019ensemble de ces violations atteint le seuil requis pour \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure, soit une atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de justice. Bien entendu, le cadre d\u2019analyse applicable \u00e0 chacune de ces garanties demeurera pertinent pour d\u00e9terminer si les violations qui composent le cumul ont bel et bien eu lieu. En fait, la d\u00e9termination de l\u2019existence des violations composant le cumul devra, en toute logique, pr\u00e9c\u00e9der la d\u00e9termination de l\u2019existence de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle.\nEn l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, chacune des personnes accus\u00e9es a l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat requis afin de demander une r\u00e9paration en vertu du par. 24(1) de la Charte car toutes all\u00e8guent avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 directement vis\u00e9es par l\u2019enqu\u00eate et l\u2019op\u00e9ration polici\u00e8res ayant donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la conduite abusive reproch\u00e9e. L\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure all\u00e9gu\u00e9 par les personnes accus\u00e9es r\u00e9sulte d\u2019un cumul de violations de droits garantis par l\u2019art. 8 et l\u2019al. 10b) de la Charte qui d\u00e9note une situation de m\u00e9pris flagrant des autorit\u00e9s polici\u00e8res envers les droits de celles\u2011ci. Dans ces circonstances, il convient d\u2019adopter le cadre d\u2019analyse de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 pour l\u2019application de l\u2019art. 7 de la Charte afin de d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019ensemble des violations all\u00e9gu\u00e9es atteint le seuil requis pour \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure. Cette op\u00e9ration exige toutefois le recours au cadre d\u2019analyse propre \u00e0 chacune des dispositions en jeu, \u00e0 savoir l\u2019art. 8 et l\u2019al. 10b), afin de d\u00e9terminer si les all\u00e9gations de violations sont fond\u00e9es. Une fois que chacune des violations all\u00e9gu\u00e9es a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e, il sera alors possible de d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019ensemble de ces violations, consid\u00e9r\u00e9es globalement, constitue une conduite qui est vexatoire au point de contrevenir aux notions fondamentales de justice et de miner ainsi l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de justice.\nLe juge de premi\u00e8re instance en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce a commis une erreur de droit en concluant que les all\u00e9gations de violations du droit, pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019al. 10b), de recourir sans d\u00e9lai \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat \u00e9taient fond\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de toutes les personnes accus\u00e9es du groupe 1 au seul motif que les autorit\u00e9s polici\u00e8res avaient comme pratique de reporter syst\u00e9matiquement l\u2019exercice de ce droit sans d\u2019abord consid\u00e9rer les circonstances particuli\u00e8res de chaque arrestation. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance devait appliquer correctement le cadre d\u2019analyse de cette disposition \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de chacune d\u2019entre elles et tirer les conclusions qui s\u2019imposaient, ce qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas fait. Cette erreur justifie \u00e0 elle seule la tenue d\u2019une nouvelle audition de la requ\u00eate en arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures pour le groupe 1, parce que la conclusion du juge de premi\u00e8re instance voulant que le droit des personnes accus\u00e9es de recourir sans d\u00e9lai \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat ait \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9 constituait un pilier essentiel \u00e0 sa conclusion finale selon laquelle les personnes accus\u00e9es du groupe 1 ont subi une violation de leur droit garanti par l\u2019art. 7 en raison d\u2019un abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle. Puisque le sort des personnes accus\u00e9es des groupes 2, 3 et 4 est d\u00e9pendant de celui des personnes accus\u00e9es du groupe 1, la tenue de nouvelles auditions de la requ\u00eate en arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures pour les groupes 2, 3 et 4 s\u2019impose \u00e9galement.\nFinalement, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a err\u00e9 en ordonnant l\u2019arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de toutes les personnes accus\u00e9es sans avoir consid\u00e9r\u00e9 des r\u00e9parations moins draconiennes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de chacune d\u2019entre elles. Les trois conditions n\u00e9cessaires pour qu\u2019un arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures soit ordonn\u00e9 sont cumulatives et aucune n\u2019est facultative. Le juge a omis de s\u2019assurer que la deuxi\u00e8me condition \u00e9tait respect\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\nLe juge Rowe : Il y a accord avec la majorit\u00e9 quant au r\u00e9sultat et, dans une large mesure, quant \u00e0 son \u00e9nonc\u00e9 du droit et \u00e0 l\u2019application de celui\u2011ci en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Cependant, il y aurait lieu de formuler quelques clarifications additionnelles en ce qui concerne la m\u00e9thodologie qui doit \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e lorsqu\u2019un accus\u00e9 sollicite un arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures en vertu du par. 24(1) de la Charte pour de pr\u00e9tendues violations des droits qui lui sont garantis par les art. 8 \u00e0 14 et demande \u00e9galement l\u2019arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures en vertu du par. 24(1) pour cause d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019art. 7. Les tribunaux devraient proc\u00e9der de mani\u00e8re uniforme \u00e0 l\u2019analyse dans les cas o\u00f9 l\u2019art. 7 et les art. 8 \u00e0 14 de la Charte sont invoqu\u00e9s par un accus\u00e9 afin d\u2019obtenir un arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures. L\u2019ordre appropri\u00e9 des op\u00e9rations est le suivant : lorsque l\u2019un des droits garantis par les art. 8 \u00e0 14 est invoqu\u00e9 en m\u00eame temps que l\u2019art. 7, les tribunaux de r\u00e9vision devraient examiner le droit sp\u00e9cifique en premier, y compris (si n\u00e9cessaire) au regard de l\u2019article premier; et ce n\u2019est qu\u2019en l\u2019absence de violation du droit sp\u00e9cifique, ou lorsque la violation est justifi\u00e9e au regard de l\u2019article premier, que les tribunaux de r\u00e9vision devraient examiner l\u2019art. 7 et, si n\u00e9cessaire, l\u2019article premier encore une fois.\nJurisprudence\nCit\u00e9e par la juge O\u2019Bonsawin\nArr\u00eats examin\u00e9s : R. c.

Survol\n[1] Les tribunaux ont l\u2019obligation de prot\u00e9ger l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de justice en se dissociant des conduites \u00e9tatiques qui abusent du processus judiciaire. Ce type de conduites abusives peut prendre toutes sortes de formes. Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure all\u00e9gu\u00e9 est inusit\u00e9 en ce qu\u2019il r\u00e9sulte d\u2019un cumul de violations des droits garantis par l\u2019art. 8 et l\u2019al. 10b) de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s , dont plusieurs des 31 parties appelantes, mais pas toutes, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 victimes. Ces violations seraient survenues dans le cadre de l\u2019enqu\u00eate et de l\u2019op\u00e9ration polici\u00e8res d\u2019envergure appel\u00e9e \u00ab projet Nandou \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019issue desquelles les 31 parties appelantes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 arr\u00eat\u00e9es.\n[2] Le caract\u00e8re inusit\u00e9 de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure all\u00e9gu\u00e9 soul\u00e8ve deux questions principales. La premi\u00e8re a trait \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat pour agir des parties appelantes qui, pour une raison ou pour une autre, n\u2019ont subi aucune des violations qui constituent l\u2019abus ni aucune entorse \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de leur proc\u00e8s. En l\u2019absence d\u2019un pr\u00e9judice personnel quelconque, il convient de se demander si ces parties appelantes avaient le droit de demander une r\u00e9paration en vertu du par. 24(1) de la Charte .\n[3] La Cour sup\u00e9rieure a r\u00e9pondu par l\u2019affirmative \u00e0 cette question et, apr\u00e8s avoir conclu \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019un abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019art. 7 de la Charte , a ordonn\u00e9 l\u2019arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019ensemble des parties appelantes en vertu du par. 24(1). En appel, la Cour d\u2019appel du Qu\u00e9bec a ordonn\u00e9 la tenue d\u2019un nouveau proc\u00e8s pour toutes les parties appelantes au motif que la Cour sup\u00e9rieure avait omis de v\u00e9rifier si chacune d\u2019elles poss\u00e9dait l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat requis pour obtenir un arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures. Selon la Cour d\u2019appel, si la Cour sup\u00e9rieure avait fait cette v\u00e9rification, elle aurait conclu que certaines parties appelantes n\u2019avaient pas l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat requis pour obtenir une r\u00e9paration en vertu du par. 24(1).\n[4] Toujours selon la Cour d\u2019appel, la v\u00e9rification de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat pour agir des parties appelantes obligeait la Cour sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si le droit de chacune d\u2019elles garanti par l\u2019al. 10b) de la Charte avait \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9, ce qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas fait. En outre, la v\u00e9rification devait pr\u00e9c\u00e9der l\u2019analyse visant \u00e0 statuer sur l\u2019existence d\u2019un abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle sous l\u2019art. 7. Cette superposition de cadres d\u2019analyse soul\u00e8ve la deuxi\u00e8me question principale du pourvoi : Quelle d\u00e9marche le tribunal doit-il entreprendre lorsqu\u2019il statue sur l\u2019existence d\u2019un abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle qui, bien qu\u2019il soit r\u00e9gi par l\u2019art. 7 de la Charte , r\u00e9sulte n\u00e9anmoins d\u2019un cumul de violations d\u2019autres droits de la Charte ? Il convient en effet de se demander comment concilier les cadres d\u2019analyse en jeu, \u00e0 savoir celui de l\u2019art. 7 et ceux de l\u2019art. 8 et de l\u2019al. 10b) de la Charte .\n[5] Pour les motifs qui suivent, je suis d\u2019avis de rejeter le pourvoi, et ce, en partie pour les raisons exprim\u00e9es par la Cour d\u2019appel. Contrairement \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re, j\u2019estime que toutes les parties appelantes ont l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat requis pour demander une r\u00e9paration en vertu du par. 24(1) de la Charte m\u00eame si certaines d\u2019entre elles n\u2019ont subi aucune des violations constituant l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure all\u00e9gu\u00e9 ni aucune entorse \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de leur proc\u00e8s. Je suis toutefois d\u2019accord avec la Cour d\u2019appel lorsqu\u2019elle affirme que la Cour sup\u00e9rieure devait d\u00e9terminer si le droit de chaque partie appelante garanti par l\u2019al. 10b) de la Charte avait \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9, et qu\u2019elle ne l\u2019a pas fait, commettant ainsi une erreur r\u00e9visable. Vu les pr\u00e9tentions des parties appelantes, cette d\u00e9termination \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire afin de d\u00e9cider si l\u2019ensemble des violations atteignait le seuil de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle. Il s\u2019agit donc d\u2019une situation dans laquelle les cadres d\u2019analyse de l\u2019art. 8 et de l\u2019al. 10b) de la Charte sont compl\u00e9mentaires \u00e0 celui de l\u2019art. 7. Enfin, j\u2019estime que la Cour sup\u00e9rieure a \u00e9galement fait erreur en ordonnant l\u2019arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de toutes les parties appelantes sans avoir d\u2019abord consid\u00e9r\u00e9 des r\u00e9parations moins draconiennes qui auraient pu corriger enti\u00e8rement l\u2019atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de justice qu\u2019elle croyait avoir identifi\u00e9e. Ces erreurs justifient la tenue de nouveaux proc\u00e8s, incluant de nouvelles auditions de la requ\u00eate des parties appelantes en arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures et en exclusion de la preuve.\nII. Contexte factuel\n[6] L\u2019op\u00e9ration polici\u00e8re au c\u0153ur du pr\u00e9sent appel d\u00e9coule d\u2019une enqu\u00eate du nom de \u00ab projet Nandou \u00bb amorc\u00e9e en novembre 2014 dans les districts de Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, Qu\u00e9bec et Chicoutimi. Cette enqu\u00eate concernait des all\u00e9gations de trafic organis\u00e9 de stup\u00e9fiants, principalement du cannabis.\n[7] Au terme de l\u2019enqu\u00eate, le 29 mars 2016, une premi\u00e8re d\u00e9nonciation visant la majorit\u00e9 des parties appelantes est d\u00e9pos\u00e9e. Elle leur reproche d\u2019avoir commis divers actes criminels en lien avec la production et le trafic de stup\u00e9fiants. Certaines parties appelantes sont \u00e9galement accus\u00e9es de gangst\u00e9risme. Cette d\u00e9nonciation est suivie de la d\u00e9livrance de plusieurs mandats d\u2019arrestation et de perquisition.\n[8] Une op\u00e9ration polici\u00e8re d\u2019envergure est planifi\u00e9e. Plus de 250 polici\u00e8res et policiers y participeront. Une rencontre pr\u00e9paratoire, dirig\u00e9e par l\u2019enqu\u00eateur Toussaint, est organis\u00e9e afin d\u2019en orchestrer le d\u00e9roulement. Au cours de cette rencontre, ce dernier rappelle l\u2019importance de respecter le droit des personnes qui seront arr\u00eat\u00e9es de recourir sans d\u00e9lai \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat garanti par l\u2019al. 10b) de la Charte . Il ne donne toutefois aucune indication quant au moment o\u00f9 l\u2019exercice de ce droit devrait \u00eatre facilit\u00e9. Il affirme avoir tenu pour acquis que les polici\u00e8res et les policiers qui proc\u00e9deront aux arrestations connaissent les r\u00e8gles et sauront quand le faire.\n[9] L\u2019op\u00e9ration est lanc\u00e9e le matin du 31 mars 2016, un peu avant 7 h. Les 31 parties appelantes ont presque toutes \u00e9t\u00e9 arr\u00eat\u00e9es \u00e0 leur r\u00e9sidence dans les premi\u00e8res minutes de l\u2019op\u00e9ration. Les autres l\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 dans divers lieux, plus tard au cours de la journ\u00e9e ou dans les jours qui ont suivi.\n[10] Toutes les parties appelantes reconnaissent avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9es de leur droit de recourir sans d\u00e9lai \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat au moment de leur arrestation. La preuve d\u00e9montre cependant que toutes n\u2019ont pas r\u00e9agi de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on : beaucoup ont indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elles voulaient se pr\u00e9valoir de leur droit d\u00e8s qu\u2019elles en ont \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9es, certaines ont demand\u00e9 d\u2019exercer leur droit seulement une fois au poste de police, et les autres ont indiqu\u00e9 ne pas souhaiter recourir \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat ou l\u2019avoir d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait.\n[11] En fin de compte, parmi les parties appelantes arr\u00eat\u00e9es le matin du 31 mars 2016 et qui ont indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elles voulaient se pr\u00e9valoir imm\u00e9diatement de leur droit de recourir sans d\u00e9lai \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat, une seule s\u2019est vu offrir cette possibilit\u00e9 pendant qu\u2019elle se trouvait \u00e0 bord du v\u00e9hicule de police. Les autres ont d\u00fb attendre d\u2019\u00eatre rendues au poste de police. Le temps qui s\u2019est \u00e9coul\u00e9 entre l\u2019arrestation et le moment o\u00f9 la possibilit\u00e9 de communiquer avec une avocate ou un avocat leur a \u00e9t\u00e9 offerte a vari\u00e9, selon le cas, de 23 minutes \u00e0 1 heure 6 minutes. Aucun interrogatoire n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 men\u00e9 durant l\u2019intervalle. Il faut \u00e9galement noter que, parmi les parties appelantes qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 arr\u00eat\u00e9es plus tard dans la journ\u00e9e ou dans les journ\u00e9es qui ont suivi, l\u2019une d\u2019elles s\u2019est livr\u00e9e aux autorit\u00e9s au palais de justice alors qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait accompagn\u00e9e de son avocat, et une autre a \u00e9t\u00e9 arr\u00eat\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019a\u00e9roport, d\u2019o\u00f9 elle a eu recours \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019un avocat.\n[12] Dans le cadre de l\u2019enqu\u00eate du projet Nandou, les autorit\u00e9s polici\u00e8res ont obtenu plusieurs mandats en vertu du Code criminel , L.R.C. 1985, c. C-46 , et de la Loi r\u00e9glementant certaines drogues et autres substances , L.C. 1996, c. 19 . La plupart de ces mandats ont \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9s dans le district de Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, mais certains ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s dans un autre district judiciaire sans avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 vis\u00e9s dans ce district.\n[13] Parmi les mandats obtenus, 44 \u00e9taient des mandats g\u00e9n\u00e9raux autoris\u00e9s en vertu de l\u2019art. 487.01 du Code criminel et 40 d\u2019entre eux imposaient aux autorit\u00e9s polici\u00e8res l\u2019obligation de donner aux personnes concern\u00e9es un avis de perquisition secr\u00e8te avant la date pr\u00e9cis\u00e9e dans le mandat. De ce nombre, 20 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s, tous sans qu\u2019un avis ne soit donn\u00e9 avant la date en question.\n[14] Au terme d\u2019une enqu\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire, les 31 parties appelantes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9es \u00e0 proc\u00e8s, puis divis\u00e9es en 4 groupes distincts en vue de la tenue de proc\u00e8s s\u00e9par\u00e9s. Le 16 mars 2018, les sept parties appelantes du groupe 1, lesquelles devaient subir leur proc\u00e8s en premier, ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures et en exclusion de la preuve devant la Cour sup\u00e9rieure. Cette requ\u00eate contenait plusieurs all\u00e9gations li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate et \u00e0 l\u2019op\u00e9ration polici\u00e8res ayant men\u00e9 \u00e0 leur arrestation et \u00e0 leur mise en accusation, dont trois demeurent pertinentes dans le cadre du pr\u00e9sent pourvoi :\n(i) le d\u00e9faut de faciliter \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re occasion raisonnable l\u2019acc\u00e8s demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat au cours de l\u2019op\u00e9ration polici\u00e8re du 31 mars 2016, ce qui aurait engendr\u00e9 la violation du droit de recourir sans d\u00e9lai \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat garanti par l\u2019al. 10b) de la Charte ;\n(ii) le d\u00e9faut de donner les avis de perquisition secr\u00e8te dans le d\u00e9lai imparti, ce qui aurait engendr\u00e9 la violation du droit \u00e0 la protection contre les fouilles, perquisitions et saisies abusives garanti par l\u2019art. 8 de la Charte ;\n(iii) l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de mandats de perquisition en dehors du district judiciaire des juges les ayant autoris\u00e9s, sans que les mandats ne soient vis\u00e9s au sens de l\u2019ancien par. 487(2) du Code criminel , ce qui aurait \u00e9galement engendr\u00e9 la violation du droit \u00e0 la protection contre les fouilles, perquisitions et saisies abusives garanti par l\u2019art. 8 de la Charte .\n[15] Lors de l\u2019audience de la requ\u00eate des parties appelantes du groupe 1, celles-ci ont all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que le cumul de ces violations, dont certaines auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 planifi\u00e9es et voulues par les autorit\u00e9s polici\u00e8res, d\u00e9notait une situation de m\u00e9pris flagrant envers leurs droits, atteignait le seuil requis pour \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019un abus de proc\u00e9dure et ne laissait au tribunal aucun autre choix que d\u2019ordonner l\u2019arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures visant chacune d\u2019elles. Cela dit, les parties appelantes n\u2019ont pas mis l\u2019accent sur les entorses que ces violations auraient caus\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de leur proc\u00e8s et ont reconnu que certaines violations ne touchaient qu\u2019une partie du groupe et ne sauraient, \u00e0 elles seules, justifier un arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures.\nIII. Historique des proc\u00e9dures judiciaires\nA. Cour sup\u00e9rieure du Qu\u00e9bec, 2018 QCCS 6155 (le juge Dumas)\n[16] Le 27 ao\u00fbt 2018, le juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure a accueilli la requ\u00eate des parties appelantes du groupe 1 et a ordonn\u00e9 l\u2019arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures les visant. Traitant du droit de recourir sans d\u00e9lai \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat, le juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure a retenu de la preuve que, lorsqu\u2019une partie appelante indique vouloir contacter une avocate ou un avocat, \u00ab on lui r\u00e9pond syst\u00e9matiquement que cela se fera plus tard \u00bb au poste de police (par. 75 (CanLII)), alors qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucune preuve que les autorit\u00e9s polici\u00e8res ont examin\u00e9 la situation avant de reporter l\u2019exercice de son droit \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat. De l\u2019avis du juge, cette pratique viole le droit de toutes les parties appelantes du groupe 1 de recourir sans d\u00e9lai \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat, car elle \u00ab \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 un renversement de fardeau \u00bb (par. 84; voir aussi le par. 196) : les polici\u00e8res et les policiers auraient d\u00fb \u00e9valuer la faisabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019exercice imm\u00e9diat du droit des parties appelantes \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat d\u00e8s que celles-ci demandaient \u00e0 l\u2019exercer et non pas uniquement lorsqu\u2019elles insistaient pour l\u2019exercer sur place.\n[17] Il a ajout\u00e9 que, bien que les autorit\u00e9s polici\u00e8res n\u2019aient pas \u00e0 permettre \u00e0 une personne mise en \u00e9tat d\u2019arrestation d\u2019utiliser un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone saisi ou \u00e0 fournir leur propre t\u00e9l\u00e9phone cellulaire, rien ne les emp\u00eache de se munir de t\u00e9l\u00e9phones cellulaires bon march\u00e9 pouvant \u00eatre pr\u00eat\u00e9s \u00e0 ces personnes.\n[18] Le juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure s\u2019est ensuite int\u00e9ress\u00e9 au d\u00e9faut des autorit\u00e9s polici\u00e8res de donner les avis de perquisition secr\u00e8te dans le d\u00e9lai imparti. Il a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019argument de la Couronne voulant que la communication de la preuve soit substituable \u00e0 l\u2019avis de perquisition secr\u00e8te exig\u00e9 dans les mandats, concluant plut\u00f4t que cette position \u00e9quivalait \u00e0 dire que \u00ab malgr\u00e9 une ordonnance sp\u00e9cifique d\u2019un juge, aucun avis de perquisition secr\u00e8te ne sera donn\u00e9 si cette perquisition n\u2019a pas de r\u00e9sultat concret et que la personne n\u2019est pas accus\u00e9e \u00bb (par. 131). Selon lui, cette position d\u00e9coule d\u2019un \u00ab laxisme institutionnel \u00bb (par. 131).\n[19] Quant aux mandats autoris\u00e9s dans le district judiciaire de Trois-Rivi\u00e8res et ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s dans d\u2019autres districts, le juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure a conclu qu\u2019ils auraient d\u00fb \u00eatre vis\u00e9s dans les districts judiciaires en question avant d\u2019\u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s. S\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait agi de la seule violation d\u00e9montr\u00e9e, il aurait conclu \u00e0 une erreur de bonne foi, mais dans les circonstances elle devait s\u2019ajouter aux autres manquements d\u00e9j\u00e0 identifi\u00e9s.\n[20] Se fondant sur l\u2019effet cumulatif de ces violations et contraventions aux proc\u00e9dures prescrites, les plus graves \u00e9tant les violations touchant le droit de recourir sans d\u00e9lai \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat, le juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure a conclu \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019un abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle. Il a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00eatre en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un \u00ab probl\u00e8me syst\u00e9mique et persistant \u00bb et de violations susceptibles de d\u00e9consid\u00e9rer l\u2019administration de la justice (par. 216 et 219), extr\u00eames au point de justifier d\u2019ordonner l\u2019arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des sept parties appelantes du groupe 1. Selon lui, la continuation des proc\u00e9dures perp\u00e9tuerait l\u2019atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de justice caus\u00e9e par l\u2019abus et inviterait les autorit\u00e9s polici\u00e8res \u00e0 continuer d\u2019agir comme elles l\u2019ont fait en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\nB. Cour sup\u00e9rieure du Qu\u00e9bec, 2019 QCCS 6006 (le juge Dumas)\n[21] Les 5 et 6 septembre 2018, les trois autres groupes de parties appelantes (groupes 2, 3 et 4) ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des requ\u00eates similaires \u00e0 celle d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par le groupe 1. Apr\u00e8s s\u2019\u00eatre consult\u00e9es, les parties appelantes des groupes 2, 3 et 4 et la Couronne ont consenti \u00e0 ce que la preuve et les plaidoiries pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es lors de la requ\u00eate du groupe 1 soient vers\u00e9es dans le cadre de l\u2019audition des requ\u00eates des groupes 2, 3 et 4. Sans renoncer \u00e0 leur droit d\u2019appel, ces parties ont \u00e9galement convenu que la d\u00e9cision du groupe 1 s\u2019appliquait aux groupes 2, 3 et 4.\n[22] Pour les motifs exprim\u00e9s dans le jugement rendu le 27 ao\u00fbt 2018 concernant le groupe 1, et vu les admissions faites s\u00e9ance tenante par les parties, le juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure a ordonn\u00e9 l\u2019arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures contre les parties appelantes des groupes 2, 3 et 4 le 7 mai 2019.\nC. Cour d\u2019appel du Qu\u00e9bec, 2021 QCCA 1317, 75 C.R. (7th) 74 (les juges Thibault, Hogue et Beaupr\u00e9)\n[23] Le 3 septembre 2021, la Cour d\u2019appel a accueilli les appels, cass\u00e9 les deux jugements rendus par la Cour sup\u00e9rieure et ordonn\u00e9 la tenue d\u2019un nouveau proc\u00e8s, incluant une nouvelle audition de la requ\u00eate en arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures et en exclusion de la preuve, devant un autre juge. Dans son analyse, la Cour d\u2019appel a soulign\u00e9 d\u2019entr\u00e9e de jeu que, comme les r\u00e8gles entourant la \u00ab qualit\u00e9 pour agir \u00bb (par. 55) pr\u00e9voient qu\u2019une r\u00e9paration ne peut \u00eatre accord\u00e9e qu\u2019\u00e0 une personne victime d\u2019une violation de ses propres droits constitutionnels, il \u00e9tait donc n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019\u00e9valuer la situation de chaque partie appelante au cas par cas. Elle a conclu que le juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure a fait erreur en adoptant une d\u00e9marche qui l\u2019a conduit \u00e0 ordonner l\u2019arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de toutes les parties appelantes, sans avoir d\u2019abord \u00e9valu\u00e9 si le droit de recourir sans d\u00e9lai \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat garanti \u00e0 chacune d\u2019elles par l\u2019al. 10b) de la Charte avait ou non \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9. Elle a d\u2019ailleurs not\u00e9 que certaines parties appelantes ont indiqu\u00e9 ne pas vouloir parler \u00e0 une avocate ou \u00e0 un avocat apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9es de leur droit, alors que d\u2019autres ont eu l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 de le faire imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s leur mise en arrestation.\n[24] La Cour d\u2019appel a \u00e9galement relev\u00e9 plusieurs erreurs de droit dans l\u2019analyse du volet \u00ab mise en application \u00bb du droit de recourir sans d\u00e9lai \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat et a statu\u00e9 que le juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure avait fait erreur en imposant aux autorit\u00e9s polici\u00e8res une obligation plus on\u00e9reuse que celle pr\u00e9vue par la loi.\n[25] Enfin, se tournant vers la r\u00e9paration octroy\u00e9e, la Cour d\u2019appel a conclu que le juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure avait commis une erreur en omettant de consid\u00e9rer des r\u00e9parations moins draconiennes qui auraient pu suffire pour rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure qu\u2019il avait constat\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\nIV. Questions en litige\n[26] La r\u00e9solution du pourvoi exige de r\u00e9pondre aux quatre questions suivantes :\nA. Les parties appelantes avaient-elles toutes l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat requis afin de demander une r\u00e9paration en vertu du par. 24(1) de la Charte ?\nB. Le juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure a-t-il err\u00e9 en concluant \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019un abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle?\nC. Le juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure a-t-il err\u00e9 en ordonnant l\u2019arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de toutes les parties appelantes?\nD. La Couronne pouvait-elle soulever devant la Cour d\u2019appel l\u2019omission du juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure de consid\u00e9rer les circonstances particuli\u00e8res de l\u2019arrestation de chaque partie appelante des groupes 2, 3 et 4 apr\u00e8s avoir consenti au jugement?\n\u00c0 mon avis, les quatre questions doivent recevoir une r\u00e9ponse affirmative.\nV. Analyse\n[27] Le droit relatif \u00e0 l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure est bien \u00e9tabli. L\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure \u00ab s\u2019entend essentiellement d\u2019une conduite du minist\u00e8re public qui est inacceptable et qui compromet s\u00e9rieusement l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 du proc\u00e8s ou l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de justice \u00bb (R. c. Anderson, 2014 CSC 41, [2014] 2 R.C.S. 167, par. 50). Comme le sugg\u00e8re le passage pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent, deux types de conduites \u00e9tatiques atteignent le seuil requis pour \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019un abus de proc\u00e9dure : celles qui compromettent l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 du proc\u00e8s (la \u00ab cat\u00e9gorie principale \u00bb), et celles qui, sans n\u00e9cessairement menacer l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 du proc\u00e8s de la personne accus\u00e9e, minent n\u00e9anmoins l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de justice (la \u00ab cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle \u00bb) (Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration) c. Tobiass, [1997] 3 R.C.S. 391, par. 89; R. c. Regan, 2002 CSC 12, [2002] 1 R.C.S. 297, par. 55; R. c. Nixon, 2011 CSC 34, [2011] 2 R.C.S. 566, par. 36; R. c. Babos, 2014 CSC 16, [2014] 1 R.C.S. 309, par. 31; voir aussi Brind\u2019Amour c. R., 2014 QCCA 33, par. 53).\n[28] Bien qu\u2019il n\u2019existe pas comme tel de \u00ab droit \u00e0 la protection contre l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure \u00bb dans la Charte , diff\u00e9rentes garanties entrent en jeu selon les circonstances (R. c. O\u2019Connor, [1995] 4 R.C.S. 411, par. 73). L\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie principale fait intervenir les dispositions de la Charte qui visent principalement \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 du proc\u00e8s des personnes accus\u00e9es, \u00e0 savoir les art. 8 \u00e0 14 ainsi que les principes de justice fondamentale \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 7. L\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle, pour sa part, fait intervenir uniquement les principes de justice fondamentale de l\u2019art. 7, lesquels prot\u00e8gent les personnes accus\u00e9es contre toute conduite \u00e9tatique qui, bien que n\u2019\u00e9tant pas vis\u00e9e par les art. 8 \u00e0 14, est n\u00e9anmoins in\u00e9quitable ou vexatoire au point de contrevenir aux notions fondamentales de justice et de miner ainsi l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de justice (O\u2019Connor, par. 73; Tobiass, par. 89; Regan, par. 50; Nixon, par. 41; Babos, par. 31).\n[29] Lorsqu\u2019un abus de proc\u00e9dure est constat\u00e9, peu importe la cat\u00e9gorie dont il rel\u00e8ve, et qu\u2019une garantie de la Charte est viol\u00e9e, le par. 24(1) de la Charte conf\u00e8re au tribunal comp\u00e9tent le pouvoir d\u2019accorder \u00ab la r\u00e9paration [qu\u2019il] estime convenable et juste eu \u00e9gard aux circonstances \u00bb. Un large \u00e9ventail de r\u00e9parations s\u2019offre au tribunal (voir, p. ex., O\u2019Connor, par. 77). Toutefois, l\u2019arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures est de loin la r\u00e9paration la plus sollicit\u00e9e par les personnes victimes d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure. Ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9e d\u2019\u00ab ultime r\u00e9paration \u00bb (Tobiass, par. 86), l\u2019arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures ne sera ordonn\u00e9 que dans l\u2019\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 la situation satisfait au crit\u00e8re exigeant qui requiert qu\u2019elle fasse partie des \u00ab cas les plus manifestes \u00bb (O\u2019Connor, par. 69). Pour qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse d\u2019un tel cas, trois conditions doivent \u00eatre r\u00e9unies :\n(1) il doit y avoir une atteinte au droit de la personne accus\u00e9e \u00e0 un proc\u00e8s \u00e9quitable ou \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de justice qui \u00ab sera r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9[e], perp\u00e9tu\u00e9[e] ou aggrav\u00e9[e] par le d\u00e9roulement du proc\u00e8s ou par son issue \u00bb (Regan, par. 54; Babos, par. 32);\n(2) il ne doit y avoir aucune autre r\u00e9paration susceptible de corriger l\u2019atteinte (Regan, par. 54; Babos, par. 32);\n(3) s\u2019il subsiste une incertitude quant \u00e0 l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 de l\u2019arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures \u00e0 l\u2019issue des deux premi\u00e8res \u00e9tapes, le tribunal doit mettre en balance les int\u00e9r\u00eats militant en faveur de cet arr\u00eat, comme le fait de d\u00e9noncer la conduite r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible et de pr\u00e9server l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de justice, d\u2019une part, et \u00ab l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat que repr\u00e9sente pour la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 un jugement d\u00e9finitif statuant sur le fond \u00bb, d\u2019autre part (Regan, par. 57; Babos, par. 32).\n[30] Ce cadre juridique a \u00e9t\u00e9 raffin\u00e9 par notre Cour sur une p\u00e9riode de plusieurs d\u00e9cennies et appliqu\u00e9 dans diverses circonstances. Malgr\u00e9 tout, cet appel soul\u00e8ve pour la premi\u00e8re fois devant nous l\u2019application du droit relatif aux abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle \u00e0 un groupe de personnes accus\u00e9es qui demandent toutes l\u2019arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures les visant au motif qu\u2019un cumul de violations de droits garantis par la Charte , dont plusieurs d\u2019entre elles, mais pas toutes, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 victimes, porte atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de justice.\n[31] En effet, les parties appelantes ont toutes demand\u00e9 un arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures en vertu du par. 24(1) de la Charte au motif que l\u2019enqu\u00eate et l\u2019op\u00e9ration polici\u00e8res \u00e0 la source des proc\u00e9dures judiciaires intent\u00e9es contre elles \u00e9taient vici\u00e9es par un abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, elles ont all\u00e9gu\u00e9 qu\u2019un cumul de violations de leurs droits constitutionnels reconnus \u00e0 l\u2019art. 8 et \u00e0 l\u2019al. 10b) de la Charte atteignait le seuil requis pour \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de toutes d\u2019un abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle, bien que plusieurs d\u2019entre elles n\u2019aient \u00e9t\u00e9 victimes d\u2019aucune de ces violations ni d\u2019aucune entorse \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de leur proc\u00e8s. Ce type d\u2019all\u00e9gations soul\u00e8ve deux questions principales.\n[32] La premi\u00e8re question, mise \u00e0 l\u2019avant-plan par la Couronne et la Cour d\u2019appel, a trait \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat pour agir des parties appelantes qui n\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 victimes d\u2019aucune violation de leurs droits garantis par l\u2019art. 8 et l\u2019al. 10b) de la Charte ni d\u2019aucune entorse \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de leur proc\u00e8s. En l\u2019absence d\u2019un pr\u00e9judice personnel quelconque, il convient de se demander si ces personnes ont l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat requis pour demander une r\u00e9paration en vertu du par. 24(1) de la Charte .\n[33] La deuxi\u00e8me question a trait au cadre d\u2019analyse que le juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure devait appliquer afin de statuer sur l\u2019existence d\u2019un abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle qui, bien qu\u2019il soit r\u00e9gi par l\u2019art. 7 de la Charte , r\u00e9sulte n\u00e9anmoins d\u2019un cumul de violations de l\u2019art. 8 et de l\u2019al. 10b). Lorsque plusieurs dispositions de la Charte sont invoqu\u00e9es conjointement, il importe de se demander comment concilier les cadres d\u2019analyse en jeu, \u00e0 savoir celui de l\u2019art. 7 et ceux de l\u2019art. 8 et de l\u2019al. 10b) de la Charte . Apr\u00e8s avoir r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 cette question, il faudra ensuite d\u00e9terminer si le juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure a appliqu\u00e9 correctement le bon cadre d\u2019analyse avant de conclure \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019un abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle.\n[34] Outre ces deux questions principales, la Couronne pr\u00e9tend que le juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure a err\u00e9 en ordonnant l\u2019arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de toutes les parties appelantes sans avoir consid\u00e9r\u00e9 des r\u00e9parations moins draconiennes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de chacune d\u2019entre elles, et les parties appelantes soutiennent que la Couronne \u00e9tait forclose de soulever en appel l\u2019omission du juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure de consid\u00e9rer les circonstances particuli\u00e8res de l\u2019arrestation de chaque partie appelante des groupes 2, 3 et 4 apr\u00e8s avoir convenu que la d\u00e9cision rendue \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du groupe 1 s\u2019appliquait \u00e0 elles.\n[35] Les sections qui suivent r\u00e9pondent \u00e0 ces quatre questions, en commen\u00e7ant par l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat pour agir.\nA. Les parties appelantes avaient-elles toutes l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat requis afin de demander une r\u00e9paration en vertu du par. 24(1) de la Charte ?\n[36] Les parties appelantes plaident qu\u2019elles ont toutes l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat requis pour demander une r\u00e9paration en vertu du par. 24(1) de la Charte , puisqu\u2019une personne accus\u00e9e n\u2019a pas \u00e0 avoir subi une violation \u00ab directement personnelle \u00bb d\u2019un droit constitutionnel pour qu\u2019il y ait violation du droit qui lui est garanti par l\u2019art. 7 de la Charte en raison d\u2019un abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle (m.a., par. 27). Selon elles, cette cat\u00e9gorie concerne \u00ab le pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me judiciaire et address[e] le cas de figure o\u00f9 un accus\u00e9, sans \u00eatre directement cibl\u00e9 par la conduite abusive ni atteint par le pr\u00e9judice en r\u00e9sultant, est n\u00e9anmoins vis\u00e9 par une poursuite impliquant une telle conduite \u00bb (par. 53). Autrement dit, une personne accus\u00e9e peut, dans certains cas, \u00ab invoquer un abus de proc\u00e9dure sans avoir \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que la conduite en cause l\u2019affecte directement \u00bb (par. 56). Aux fins de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat pour agir, le par. 24(1) de la Charte requiert uniquement \u00ab qu\u2019une personne soit accus\u00e9e, ou que son droit \u00e0 la vie[,] \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 et \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de sa personne soit autrement compromis, dans un contexte o\u00f9 une conduite \u00e9tatique oppressive ou vexatoire li\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate ou aux proc\u00e9dures judiciaires la concernant porte atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me judiciaire au point d\u2019enfreindre l\u2019art. 7 de la Charte \u00bb (par. 72).\n[37] Pour sa part, la Couronne soutient qu\u2019afin d\u2019avoir l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat requis pour demander une r\u00e9paration en vertu du par. 24(1), une personne accus\u00e9e doit all\u00e9guer avoir subi une violation personnelle d\u2019un de ses droits garantis par la Charte . Lorsque la personne accus\u00e9e demande un arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures en raison d\u2019un abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle, elle doit all\u00e9guer que son droit garanti par l\u2019art. 7 a \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9. Pour qu\u2019il lui soit possible de le faire, elle n\u2019a pas besoin d\u2019avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 personnellement cibl\u00e9e par la conduite \u00e9tatique abusive, mais elle doit \u00eatre en mesure de d\u00e9montrer que la conduite en question a eu un \u00ab impact suffisant \u00bb sur elle (m.i., par. 72). Selon la Couronne, c\u2019est donc \u00e0 bon droit que la Cour d\u2019appel a affirm\u00e9 que le juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure a err\u00e9 en omettant de regarder individuellement la situation de chaque partie appelante, surtout en ce qui a trait au volet \u00ab mise en application \u00bb du droit \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat. Il s\u2019agissait de la seule mani\u00e8re de d\u00e9terminer si la conduite abusive avait eu un impact suffisant sur chacune d\u2019elles au regard de l\u2019art. 7.\n[38] Pour les motifs qui suivent, j\u2019en viens \u00e0 la conclusion que toutes les parties appelantes avaient l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat requis afin de demander un arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures en vertu du par. 24(1). Une personne accus\u00e9e a l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat requis pour demander une r\u00e9paration en vertu du par. 24(1) lorsqu\u2019elle all\u00e8gue la violation de l\u2019un des droits que lui garantit la Charte . Le droit pr\u00e9vu par l\u2019art. 7 est l\u2019un d\u2019entre eux. Il prot\u00e8ge les personnes accus\u00e9es contre les abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle. Ce type d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure survient lorsqu\u2019une conduite \u00e9tatique est in\u00e9quitable ou vexatoire au point de contrevenir aux notions fondamentales de justice, minant ainsi l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de justice, et ce, peu importe son impact sur les autres droits constitutionnels de la personne accus\u00e9e ou sur l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de son proc\u00e8s.\n[39] Toutefois, cela ne veut pas dire que toute personne accus\u00e9e aura l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat requis pour demander une r\u00e9paration en vertu du par. 24(1) de la Charte en raison de n\u2019importe quelle conduite \u00e9tatique abusive, peu importe le lien de causalit\u00e9 entre cette conduite et les proc\u00e9dures intent\u00e9es contre elle. Pour avoir cet int\u00e9r\u00eat, la personne accus\u00e9e doit all\u00e9guer que l\u2019enqu\u00eate ou l\u2019op\u00e9ration polici\u00e8re la visant ou encore les proc\u00e9dures judiciaires intent\u00e9es contre elle sont entach\u00e9es par la conduite abusive. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, chacune des parties appelantes satisfait \u00e0 cette exigence, car toutes all\u00e8guent avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 directement vis\u00e9es par l\u2019enqu\u00eate et l\u2019op\u00e9ration polici\u00e8res ayant donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la conduite abusive reproch\u00e9e.\n[40] Chacun de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments est explicit\u00e9 davantage dans les paragraphes qui suivent. Toutefois, avant de les aborder, j\u2019estime important de r\u00e9soudre une confusion terminologique.\n(1) La confusion entre \u00ab int\u00e9r\u00eat pour agir \u00bb et \u00ab qualit\u00e9 pour agir \u00bb\n[41] Dans leur m\u00e9moire respectif, la Couronne et les parties appelantes utilisent les termes juridiques \u00ab int\u00e9r\u00eat pour agir \u00bb et \u00ab qualit\u00e9 pour agir \u00bb de fa\u00e7on interchangeable (m.i., par. 16-17 et 53-54; m.a., par. 67-68). La Cour d\u2019appel semble avoir fait de m\u00eame (par. 45 et 55). Il est vrai que notre Cour a parfois eu recours \u00e0 ces deux termes ou \u00e0 leurs d\u00e9riv\u00e9s dans un m\u00eame arr\u00eat pour se r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 la m\u00eame id\u00e9e, soit celle exprim\u00e9e en anglais par les termes \u00ab standing \u00bb ou encore \u00ab locus standi \u00bb (voir, p. ex., Finlay c.

Legault Joly Thiffault, s.e.n.c.r.l., 2018 CSC 55, [2018] 3 R.C.S. 481, par. 10-11).\n[42] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il s\u2019agit de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat pour agir des parties appelantes qui est contest\u00e9 par la Couronne, et non pas leur qualit\u00e9, car chacune agit en son nom personnel et non pour une ou plusieurs autres personnes en vertu d\u2019une \u00ab qualit\u00e9 \u00bb particuli\u00e8re (voir, p. ex., Brunette, par. 2). En effet, la Couronne conteste le droit des parties appelantes de \u00ab demander un redressement particulier \u00bb au tribunal, \u00e0 savoir un arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures en vertu du par. 24(1) de la Charte , et d\u2019obtenir un jugement sur le bien-fond\u00e9 de cette demande (Finlay, p. 635; T. A. Cromwell, Locus Standi : A Commentary on the Law of Standing in Canada (1986), p. 7 et 9). Ce droit est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement r\u00e9serv\u00e9 aux personnes qui ont un \u00ab int\u00e9r\u00eat suffisant \u00bb dans l\u2019obtention du redressement demand\u00e9 (Brunette, par. 12). Tel qu\u2019il sera expliqu\u00e9 plus amplement ci-dessous, l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat pour agir est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme suffisant dans le cadre d\u2019une demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vertu du par. 24(1) lorsque la personne accus\u00e9e all\u00e8gue que l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des droits qui lui sont garantis par la Charte a \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9.\n(2) L\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat pour agir en vertu du par. 24(1) de la Charte est reconnu aux personnes accus\u00e9es all\u00e9guant que leurs propres droits ont \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9s\n[43] Le point de d\u00e9part pour statuer sur l\u2019existence de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat requis pour demander une r\u00e9paration en vertu du par. 24(1) de la Charte est le texte de cette disposition, qui pr\u00e9voit ce qui suit :\n24 (1) Toute personne, victime de violation ou de n\u00e9gation des droits ou libert\u00e9s qui lui sont garantis par la pr\u00e9sente charte, peut s\u2019adresser \u00e0 un tribunal comp\u00e9tent pour obtenir la r\u00e9paration que le tribunal estime convenable et juste eu \u00e9gard aux circonstances.\n[44] La Cour a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 ce texte et consid\u00e9r\u00e9 qu\u2019il signifie que l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat requis pour demander une r\u00e9paration en vertu du par. 24(1) est acquis lorsqu\u2019une personne \u00ab all\u00e8gue une atteinte \u00e0 ses propres droits constitutionnels \u00bb (R. c. Albashir, 2021 CSC 48, par. 33; R. c. Ferguson, 2008 CSC 6, [2008] 1 R.C.S. 96, par. 61; voir aussi R. c. Edwards, [1996] 1 R.C.S. 128, par. 55; R. c. Rahey, [1987] 1 R.C.S. 588, p. 619; R. c. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., [1985] 1 R.C.S. 295, p. 313). En d\u2019autres mots, l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat pour agir d\u2019une personne sera jug\u00e9 suffisant seulement si celle-ci all\u00e8gue \u00eatre victime d\u2019une violation de l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des droits qui lui sont garantis par la Charte .\n[45] Certaines d\u00e9cisions ont sugg\u00e9r\u00e9, sur le fondement d\u2019une interpr\u00e9tation litt\u00e9rale du texte de l\u2019art. 24, que l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat requis pour demander une r\u00e9paration en vertu de cette disposition et obtenir un jugement sur le bien-fond\u00e9 de cette demande n\u2019est acquis qu\u2019\u00e0 condition que la personne accus\u00e9e \u00e9tablisse qu\u2019il y a eu violation de l\u2019un des droits qui lui sont garantis par la Charte (voir, p. ex., Edwards, par. 45(1.) et (3.)). Cette interpr\u00e9tation confond l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat pour agir en justice avec le m\u00e9rite d\u2019une demande en justice (Cromwell, p. 2; F. Bachand, \u00ab Le droit d\u2019agir en justice \u00bb (2020), 66 R.D. McGill 109, p. 110-111; K. Roach, Constitutional Remedies in Canada (2e \u00e9d. (feuilles mobiles)), \u00a7 5:10). Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Finlay, notre Cour a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il est essentiel de distinguer l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat pour agir, ou le droit de demander un redressement particulier, des conditions y donnant ouverture (p. 635). Cette distinction a \u00e9t\u00e9 clarifi\u00e9e avec \u00e9loquence par le juge Scheibel dans R.L. Crain Inc. c. Couture (1983), 6 D.L.R. (4th) 478 (B.R. Sask.) :\n[traduction] . . . l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de la violation d\u2019un droit est un pr\u00e9requis \u00e0 l\u2019obtention d\u2019une r\u00e9paration. Ce n\u2019est pas un pr\u00e9requis \u00e0 l\u2019introduction d\u2019une demande fond\u00e9e sur le par. 24(1). Il ne fait pas de doute que, pour pr\u00e9senter une demande en vertu du par. 24(1), il suffit au demandeur d\u2019all\u00e9guer qu\u2019il y a eu violation ou n\u00e9gation de ses droits. [Je souligne; p. 517.]\n[46] En effet, en mati\u00e8re d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat pour agir, l\u2019accent est mis sur les all\u00e9gations de la personne qui sollicite une r\u00e9paration en vertu du par. 24(1) de la Charte . Ces all\u00e9gations doivent \u00e9noncer les \u00e9l\u00e9ments essentiels qui devront \u00eatre d\u00e9montr\u00e9s afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir la violation d\u2019au moins un des droits garantis par la Charte \u00e0 la partie demanderesse. Si elles le font, l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat requis pour demander une r\u00e9paration en vertu du par. 24(1) est acquis.\n[47] Selon la Cour d\u2019appel, l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat pour agir ne peut \u00eatre reconnu qu\u2019aux parties appelantes qui all\u00e8guent avoir subi une violation de leur propre droit de recourir sans d\u00e9lai \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat ou encore, bien qu\u2019elle ne le mentionne pas express\u00e9ment, de leur propre droit d\u2019\u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9 contre les fouilles, les perquisitions et les saisies abusives (par. 55 et 59). En d\u2019autres mots, elle a conclu que les parties appelantes qui n\u2019ont pas all\u00e9gu\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d\u2019une violation d\u2019au moins un des droits garantis par l\u2019art. 8 ou l\u2019al. 10b) de la Charte n\u2019ont pas l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat requis pour demander un arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures en vertu du par. 24(1) (par. 58-59). Avec \u00e9gards, je ne peux souscrire \u00e0 cette position, car elle ignore l\u2019all\u00e9gation d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle.\n[48] Toutes les parties appelantes ont all\u00e9gu\u00e9 la violation du droit qui leur est garanti par l\u2019art. 7 de la Charte en raison de l\u2019existence d\u2019un abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle (d.a., vol. XI, p. 101-102). Certes, elles ont all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que cet abus r\u00e9sultait d\u2019un cumul de violations du droit d\u2019\u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9 contre les fouilles, les perquisitions et les saisies abusives et du droit de recourir sans d\u00e9lai \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat (d.a., vol. I, p. 150, 154-155 et 158; voir aussi le d.a., vol. X, p. 55-56). Il est \u00e9galement vrai qu\u2019\u00e0 la face m\u00eame du dossier, certaines parties appelantes ne pouvaient raisonnablement all\u00e9guer avoir subi l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre de ces violations, voire possiblement les deux. Toutefois, cela n\u2019emp\u00eachait aucune des parties appelantes d\u2019avoir l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat requis pour demander au tribunal un arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures en vertu du par. 24(1) de la Charte et obtenir de ce dernier un jugement sur le bien-fond\u00e9 de leur demande, si elle avait d\u00fbment all\u00e9gu\u00e9 tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments essentiels qui doivent \u00eatre d\u00e9montr\u00e9s afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir la violation du droit qui lui est garanti par l\u2019art. 7 en raison d\u2019un abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle.\n[49] Je suis d\u2019accord avec les parties appelantes pour dire que l\u2019existence d\u2019un pr\u00e9judice directement personnel ne fait pas partie de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments essentiels. Tel qu\u2019il sera expliqu\u00e9 plus amplement ci-dessous, notre Cour a reconnu \u00e0 maintes reprises qu\u2019une violation de l\u2019art. 7 de la Charte peut r\u00e9sulter du seul fait qu\u2019une conduite \u00e9tatique porte atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de justice, et ce, peu importe si cette conduite a eu un impact sur les autres droits de la personne qui l\u2019invoque ou sur l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de son proc\u00e8s.\n(3) L\u2019article 7 de la Charte prot\u00e8ge les personnes accus\u00e9es contre les conduites \u00e9tatiques qui minent l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de justice, sans \u00e9gard \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019un pr\u00e9judice personnel\n[50] En effet, dans le cadre de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle, il \u00ab est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de concevoir le pr\u00e9judice subi comme un acte tendant \u00e0 miner les attentes de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 sur le plan de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019administration de la justice \u00bb (Nixon, par. 41). Comme le note la juge L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat O\u2019Connor, l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle\nne se rapporte pas \u00e0 une conduite touchant l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 du proc\u00e8s ou ayant pour effet de porter atteinte \u00e0 d\u2019autres droits de nature proc\u00e9durale \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s dans la Charte , mais envisage plut\u00f4t l\u2019ensemble des circonstances diverses et parfois impr\u00e9visibles dans lesquelles la poursuite est men\u00e9e d\u2019une mani\u00e8re in\u00e9quitable ou vexatoire au point de contrevenir aux notions fondamentales de justice et de miner ainsi l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du processus judiciaire. [par. 73]\n[51] En d\u2019autres mots, une atteinte aux autres droits de la personne accus\u00e9e ou \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de son proc\u00e8s sera \u00ab pertinente mais non d\u00e9terminante \u00bb (Nixon, par. 41), car le type de pr\u00e9judice vis\u00e9 par les principes de justice fondamentale \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 7 va bien au-del\u00e0 du pr\u00e9judice personnel (O\u2019Connor, par. 64). Il faut seulement conclure \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019une conduite \u00e9tatique qui a des r\u00e9percussions \u00e0 plus grande \u00e9chelle, soit une conduite qui porte atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de justice aux yeux de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\n[52] Bien entendu, le pr\u00e9judice personnel d\u00e9coulant d\u2019un pr\u00e9tendu abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle ne sera pas sans importance lorsque viendra le temps de statuer sur l\u2019existence de l\u2019abus en question. En fait, les entorses \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 du proc\u00e8s d\u2019une personne accus\u00e9e sont souvent indissociables des atteintes \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me judiciaire et compl\u00e9mentaires \u00e0 celles-ci (O\u2019Connor, par. 64; voir aussi R. c. Scott, [1990] 3 R.C.S. 979, p. 1007).\n[53] Toutefois, il demeure qu\u2019une personne accus\u00e9e peut subir une violation du droit qui lui est garanti par l\u2019art. 7 en raison d\u2019une conduite \u00e9tatique qui atteint le seuil requis pour \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019un abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle sans pour autant avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d\u2019un quelconque pr\u00e9judice personnel comme une atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019un de ses autres droits constitutionnels ou le fait que l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de son proc\u00e8s a \u00e9t\u00e9 compromise.\n[54] Cela ne veut pas dire que n\u2019importe quelle personne accus\u00e9e aura l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat requis pour demander une r\u00e9paration en vertu du par. 24(1) en raison de n\u2019importe quelle conduite \u00e9tatique qui mine l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de justice, peu importe le lien de causalit\u00e9 entre la conduite abusive et les proc\u00e9dures intent\u00e9es contre elle. Pour conclure que le droit garanti \u00e0 une personne accus\u00e9e par l\u2019art. 7 de la Charte a \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9 en raison d\u2019un abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle, il doit y avoir un \u00ab lien de causalit\u00e9 suffisant \u00bb entre la conduite abusive et les proc\u00e9dures visant cette personne (Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Bedford, 2013 CSC 72, [2013] 3 R.C.S. 1101, par. 75-78). C\u2019est vers ce lien que je me tourne maintenant.\n(4) Les proc\u00e9dures intent\u00e9es contre la personne accus\u00e9e doivent avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 entach\u00e9es par la conduite \u00e9tatique abusive\n[55] \u00c0 mon avis, le lien de causalit\u00e9 entre, d\u2019une part, la conduite \u00e9tatique qui mine l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de justice et, d\u2019autre part, la mise en cause des int\u00e9r\u00eats de la personne accus\u00e9e qui sont prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par l\u2019art. 7 de la Charte , \u00e0 savoir la vie, la libert\u00e9 et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de sa personne, sera consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme suffisant lorsque les proc\u00e9dures criminelles intent\u00e9es contre cette personne sont entach\u00e9es (en anglais, \u00ab tainted \u00bb) par la conduite abusive (voir R. c. Conway, [1989] 1 R.C.S. 1659, p. 1667).\n[56] Les proc\u00e9dures intent\u00e9es contre une personne accus\u00e9e seront consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme entach\u00e9es lorsqu\u2019une conduite abusive a eu lieu dans le cadre de l\u2019instance ou encore dans le cadre d\u2019une enqu\u00eate ou d\u2019une op\u00e9ration polici\u00e8re qui la visait ou qui a autrement servi \u00e0 recueillir de la preuve destin\u00e9e \u00e0 prouver sa culpabilit\u00e9 en lien avec le ou les chefs d\u2019accusation d\u00e9pos\u00e9s contre elle. \u00c9videmment, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que la conduite abusive ait eu un impact sur les autres droits garantis par la Charte \u00e0 cette personne ou encore sur l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de son proc\u00e8s pour satisfaire \u00e0 cette exigence. Elle doit seulement \u00eatre survenue dans le cadre de l\u2019enqu\u00eate, de l\u2019op\u00e9ration polici\u00e8re ou de l\u2019instance criminelle visant la personne accus\u00e9e. En l\u2019absence de ce lien, je vois difficilement comment la vie, la libert\u00e9 et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la personne accus\u00e9e sont mises en cause par la conduite abusive.\n[57] Cette exigence est conforme \u00e0 l\u2019objet de la doctrine de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle, soit permettre aux tribunaux de prot\u00e9ger l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de justice en se dissociant des conduites \u00e9tatiques qui abusent du processus judiciaire (D. M. Paciocco, \u00ab The Stay of Proceedings as a Remedy in Criminal Cases : Abusing the Abuse of Process Concept \u00bb (1991), 15 Crim. L.J. 315, p. 338). En l\u2019absence de tout lien entre la conduite abusive et les proc\u00e9dures visant la personne accus\u00e9e, le fait pour le tribunal de s\u2019en dissocier n\u2019aura pas pour effet de pr\u00e9server l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de justice.\n[58] Cette exigence est \u00e9galement coh\u00e9rente avec les balises applicables \u00e0 l\u2019octroi d\u2019un arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures en vertu du par. 24(1) de la Charte . Compos\u00e9es de trois conditions cumulatives, ces balises permettent de filtrer les demandes en arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures afin de s\u2019assurer que seulement les \u00ab cas les plus manifestes \u00bb donnent droit \u00e0 cette r\u00e9paration, ce qui exclut les cas des personnes accus\u00e9es dont les proc\u00e9dures n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 entach\u00e9es au pr\u00e9alable par une conduite abusive.\n[59] Pour s\u2019en convaincre, il suffit d\u2019examiner la premi\u00e8re condition, laquelle refl\u00e8te le caract\u00e8re prospectif de la r\u00e9paration que constitue l\u2019arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures (Tobiass, par. 91; Regan, par. 54). Cette condition vise \u00e0 emp\u00eacher que ne se perp\u00e9tue une atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de justice qui, faute d\u2019intervention, continuera \u00e0 perturber les parties et la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 dans son ensemble \u00e0 l\u2019avenir (O\u2019Connor, par. 75; Tobiass, par. 91; Regan, par. 54; Nixon, par. 42; Babos, par. 35). \u00c0 cette fin, le tribunal doit se demander si \u00ab la tenue d\u2019un proc\u00e8s en d\u00e9pit de la conduite reproch\u00e9e causerait [. . .] un pr\u00e9judice suppl\u00e9mentaire \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de justice \u00bb (Babos, par. 38). Cette question est indissociable du contexte pr\u00e9cis des proc\u00e9dures judiciaires intent\u00e9es contre chaque personne accus\u00e9e, car il s\u2019agit des proc\u00e9dures dont l\u2019arr\u00eat est sollicit\u00e9 (Paciocco, p. 341). En d\u2019autres mots, afin de satisfaire \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re condition pour \u00e9tablir qu\u2019un arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures s\u2019av\u00e8re une r\u00e9paration convenable, la personne accus\u00e9e doit convaincre le tribunal qu\u2019un pr\u00e9judice suppl\u00e9mentaire \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de justice serait caus\u00e9 par la poursuite comme telle des proc\u00e9dures dont elle-m\u00eame est l\u2019objet.\n[60] Or, c\u2019est seulement dans l\u2019\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 les proc\u00e9dures visant une personne accus\u00e9e sont entach\u00e9es par une conduite abusive que cette derni\u00e8re pourra pr\u00e9tendre que le refus d\u2019arr\u00eater ses proc\u00e9dures r\u00e9v\u00e9lera, perp\u00e9tuera ou aggravera l\u2019atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de justice, comme le requiert le par. 24(1) de la Charte . Si, au contraire, les proc\u00e9dures dont elle est l\u2019objet ne sont pas d\u2019abord entach\u00e9es par une conduite \u00e9tatique abusive, sa demande d\u2019arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures en vertu du par. 24(1) en raison de cet abus n\u2019aura aucune chance de succ\u00e8s. Pour cette raison, il est tout \u00e0 fait logique et souhaitable qu\u2019une telle personne n\u2019ait pas l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat requis pour demander un arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures en vertu du par. 24(1) en raison de cette conduite.\n[61] Enfin, la condition exigeant que les proc\u00e9dures soient entach\u00e9es par la conduite abusive est coh\u00e9rente avec la jurisprudence. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Castro, 2001 BCCA 507, 47 C.R. (5th) 391, la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie-Britannique a d\u00fb d\u00e9cider si l\u2019accus\u00e9 M. Castro et ses co-accus\u00e9s avaient l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat requis pour demander un arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures les visant en raison d\u2019un abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle dans un contexte o\u00f9 la conduite abusive n\u2019avait qu\u2019un lien indirect avec leurs proc\u00e9dures judiciaires. L\u2019affaire concernait deux enqu\u00eates connexes : le projet Escudo et le projet Eye Spy. Ce dernier \u00e9tait une op\u00e9ration d\u2019infiltration visant le blanchiment d\u2019argent et le trafic de drogue. Il a permis d\u2019identifier M. Castro comme un trafiquant de drogue potentiel. Le projet Escudo a alors \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en place pour cibler directement M. Castro et s\u2019est d\u00e9roul\u00e9 parall\u00e8lement au projet Eye Spy. La Couronne a plaid\u00e9 que les accus\u00e9s, dont M. Castro, n\u2019avaient pas l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat requis pour invoquer le caract\u00e8re ill\u00e9gal des transactions op\u00e9r\u00e9es dans le cadre du projet Eye Spy, puisque M. Castro et ses co-accus\u00e9s n\u2019ont pas all\u00e9gu\u00e9 avoir pris part \u00e0 ces transactions (par. 26). La Cour d\u2019appel a rejet\u00e9 cet argument au motif que les proc\u00e9dures visant M. Castro et ses co-accus\u00e9s \u00e9taient entach\u00e9es par la conduite abusive des autorit\u00e9s polici\u00e8res en lien avec le projet Eye Spy :\n[traduction] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, les appelants ont l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat requis pour plaider l\u2019ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 de la conduite de la police dans le cadre du projet Eye Spy parce que celui-ci visait \u00e0 recueillir et de fait a permis de recueillir des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui ont directement entra\u00een\u00e9 les poursuites contre les appelants. En raison du lien suffisamment \u00e9troit existant entre la conduite et les poursuites, il est possible de pr\u00e9tendre raisonnablement que les poursuites sont entach\u00e9es par l\u2019ill\u00e9galit\u00e9. Il appartiendra au juge qui entendra l\u2019affaire de trancher, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de toutes les circonstances, y compris les avis juridiques, la question de savoir si cela constitue un abus de proc\u00e9dure commandant un arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures. [Je souligne; par. 39.]\n[62] L\u2019arr\u00eat Babos fournit une autre illustration. Dans cette affaire, l\u2019une des trois inconduites que M. Babos reprochait \u00e0 la Couronne au soutien de sa demande d\u2019arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures le visant en vertu du par. 24(1) de la Charte pour cause d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle avait trait \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation, par une procureure de la Couronne, de moyens irr\u00e9guliers pour obtenir le dossier m\u00e9dical de son co-accus\u00e9, M. Piccirilli, aupr\u00e8s du centre de d\u00e9tention o\u00f9 ce dernier \u00e9tait incarc\u00e9r\u00e9 en attendant son proc\u00e8s. Bien que cette conduite ne visait pas M. Babos ni n\u2019impactait de pr\u00e8s ou de loin ses proc\u00e9dures, elle a eu lieu lors de son instance criminelle et nul n\u2019a remis en question le fait que, tout comme M. Piccirilli, il avait l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat requis pour l\u2019all\u00e9guer au soutien de sa demande en arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures.\n[63] Il s\u2019ensuit que le fait que la conduite abusive a entach\u00e9 les proc\u00e9dures visant une personne accus\u00e9e fait partie des \u00e9l\u00e9ments essentiels qui doivent \u00eatre d\u00e9montr\u00e9s afin que cette personne puisse \u00e9tablir une violation du droit qui lui est garanti par l\u2019art. 7 de la Charte en raison d\u2019un abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle. Une personne accus\u00e9e qui omet d\u2019all\u00e9guer explicitement ou implicitement que les proc\u00e9dures dont elle fait l\u2019objet sont entach\u00e9es par la conduite \u00e9tatique abusive n\u2019aura donc pas l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat requis pour demander une r\u00e9paration en vertu du par. 24(1) en raison d\u2019une telle conduite.\n(5) Application aux faits\n[64] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, toutes les parties appelantes ont all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que la conduite des autorit\u00e9s polici\u00e8res qu\u2019elles qualifient d\u2019abusive avait entach\u00e9 les proc\u00e9dures les visant. En effet, l\u2019ensemble des inconduites all\u00e9gu\u00e9es par chacune d\u2019entre elles, soit (i) le d\u00e9faut de faciliter \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re occasion raisonnable l\u2019acc\u00e8s demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat au cours de l\u2019op\u00e9ration polici\u00e8re du 31 mars 2016, (ii) l\u2019omission d\u2019envoyer des avis aux personnes contre lesquelles un mandat de perquisition secr\u00e8te a \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9, en contravention avec les termes du mandat, et (iii) l\u2019omission de faire viser les mandats avant de les ex\u00e9cuter \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur du district de Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, ont eu lieu dans le cadre de l\u2019enqu\u00eate et de l\u2019op\u00e9ration polici\u00e8res connues sous le nom de projet Nandou, projet qui visait directement toutes les parties appelantes et qui a servi \u00e0 recueillir de la preuve destin\u00e9e \u00e0 prouver leur culpabilit\u00e9.\n[65] Cela dit, avoir l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat pour agir n\u2019est que la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape d\u2019une demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vertu du par. 24(1) de la Charte . La question de savoir si un abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle existe demeure enti\u00e8re. Toutefois, avant de me pencher sur cette question, je consid\u00e8re utile de clarifier le cadre d\u2019analyse applicable lorsque l\u2019existence d\u2019un abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle qui violerait l\u2019art. 7 repose sur des all\u00e9gations de cumul de violations d\u2019autres droits de la Charte , en l\u2019occurrence les droits garantis par l\u2019art. 8 et l\u2019al. 10b).\nB. Le juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure a-t-il err\u00e9 en concluant \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019un abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle?\n(1) Le cadre d\u2019analyse applicable lorsque l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle r\u00e9sulte de la violation d\u2019autres droits garantis par la Charte\n[66] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat O\u2019Connor, notre Cour a \u00e9nonc\u00e9 que tant l\u2019art. 7 de la Charte que les garanties proc\u00e9durales sp\u00e9cifiques pr\u00e9vues aux art. 8 \u00e0 14 visent \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger \u00e0 la fois l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat individuel des personnes accus\u00e9es \u00e0 un proc\u00e8s \u00e9quitable et l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me judiciaire dans son ensemble (par. 64 et 73). Ce faisant, la Cour n\u2019a pas reconnu un quelconque \u00ab droit \u00e0 la protection contre l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure \u00bb dans la Charte . Elle a plut\u00f4t pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 affirmer que \u00ab [s]elon les circonstances, diff\u00e9rentes garanties en vertu de la Charte pourront entrer en jeu \u00bb (par. 73).\n[67] Parfois, les garanties proc\u00e9durales sp\u00e9cifiques de la Charte seront les mieux adapt\u00e9es pour corriger des abus de proc\u00e9dure. Par exemple, lorsqu\u2019une personne accus\u00e9e all\u00e8gue qu\u2019une inconduite de la Couronne l\u2019a emp\u00each\u00e9e d\u2019\u00eatre jug\u00e9e dans un d\u00e9lai raisonnable, la demande devrait \u00eatre trait\u00e9e au moyen du cadre d\u2019analyse relatif \u00e0 l\u2019al. 11b) de la Charte (O\u2019Connor, par. 73).\n[68] Lorsqu\u2019aucune des garanties proc\u00e9durales sp\u00e9cifiques ne vise l\u2019inconduite all\u00e9gu\u00e9e, notre Cour a \u00e9tabli que l\u2019art. 7 de la Charte agit comme rempart et fournit une protection suppl\u00e9mentaire aux personnes accus\u00e9es en les prot\u00e9geant contre les conduites \u00e9tatiques qui portent atteinte d\u2019autres fa\u00e7ons \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 du proc\u00e8s et contre celles, dites \u00ab r\u00e9siduelles \u00bb, qui minent autrement l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de justice (Nixon, par. 36). En ce sens, l\u2019art. 7 joue un r\u00f4le compl\u00e9mentaire \u00e0 celui des art. 8 \u00e0 14 en offrant, contre les abus de proc\u00e9dures, une protection r\u00e9siduelle qui va au-del\u00e0 des protections offertes par les garanties sp\u00e9cifiques pr\u00e9vues aux art. 8 \u00e0 14. Ce r\u00f4le a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu \u00e0 maintes reprises par la Cour \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur du cadre de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure (R. c. J.J., 2022 CSC 28, par. 113; R. c. Darrach, 2000 CSC 46, [2000] 2 R.C.S. 443, par. 24; R. c. White, [1999] 2 R.C.S. 417, par. 44; R. c. Mills, [1999] 3 R.C.S. 668, par. 72 et 76; R. c. Pearson, [1992] 3 R.C.S. 665, p. 688; R. c. Seaboyer, [1991] 2 R.C.S. 577, p. 603; Thomson Newspapers Ltd. c. Canada (Directeur des enqu\u00eates et recherches, Commission sur les pratiques restrictives du commerce), [1990] 1 R.C.S. 425, p. 537-538).\n[69] Il n\u2019est donc pas inusit\u00e9 que l\u2019art. 7 de la Charte soit invoqu\u00e9 en m\u00eame temps qu\u2019une ou plusieurs autres garanties proc\u00e9durales. Ce sera le cas lorsque, par exemple, une conduite \u00e9tatique abusive all\u00e9gu\u00e9e ne se limite pas simplement \u00e0 la violation d\u2019une garantie proc\u00e9durale pr\u00e9vue aux art. 8 \u00e0 14. En effet, des conduites \u00e9tatiques abusives peuvent prendre toutes sortes de formes. Notre Cour a d\u2019ailleurs reconnu express\u00e9ment qu\u2019il peut y avoir des cas o\u00f9 \u00ab la nature et le nombre des incidents consid\u00e9r\u00e9s globalement n\u00e9cessiteraient l\u2019arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures m\u00eame si, pris isol\u00e9ment, ils ne le justifieraient pas \u00bb (Babos, par. 73). Cette affirmation s\u2019applique tout autant au stade de la d\u00e9termination de l\u2019existence d\u2019un abus de proc\u00e9dure. Ainsi, l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle peut r\u00e9sulter d\u2019un cumul d\u2019incidents ou d\u2019inconduites \u00e9tatiques. De plus, rien ne s\u2019oppose \u00e0 ce que ces incidents ou ces inconduites prennent la forme de violations d\u2019une garantie proc\u00e9durale de la Charte et que, par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure all\u00e9gu\u00e9 r\u00e9sulte d\u2019un cumul de violations d\u2019une ou de plusieurs garanties.\n[70] Dans ces circonstances, comment concilier les cadres d\u2019analyse en jeu? Notre Cour a tent\u00e9 par le pass\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9tablir l\u2019ordre de priorit\u00e9 qu\u2019elle doit suivre lorsqu\u2019une violation de l\u2019art. 7 de la Charte est invoqu\u00e9 conjointement avec une violation d\u2019une ou plusieurs garanties proc\u00e9durales (R. c. Harrer, [1995] 3 R.C.S. 562, par. 13; Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Whaling, 2014 CSC 20, [2014] 1 R.C.S. 392, par. 76; J.J., par. 213 et 327), mais \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 les liens \u00ab inextricable[s] \u00bb entre ces dispositions (Seaboyer, p. 603; Mills, par. 69; J.J., par. 114) et le caract\u00e8re compl\u00e9mentaires de celles-ci, elle a pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 conclure ainsi :\nLa m\u00e9thode qu\u2019il convient d\u2019employer pour \u00e9valuer de multiples violations de la Charte all\u00e9gu\u00e9es par l\u2019accus\u00e9 peut d\u00e9pendre des faits de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, de la nature des droits prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par la Charte en jeu et de la mani\u00e8re dont ils se recoupent. La Cour a affirm\u00e9 \u00e0 maintes reprises que la m\u00e9thode pour ce faire est fortement tributaire du contexte et des faits . . .\n(J.J., par. 115)\n[71] Dans le contexte de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure, il convient de rappeler que tant l\u2019art. 7 que les art. 8 \u00e0 14 de la Charte visent \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger l\u2019individu contre les conduites qui sont in\u00e9quitables ou vexatoires au point de contrevenir aux notions fondamentales de justice et de miner ainsi l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de justice (O\u2019Connor, par. 64 et 73). Il s\u2019ensuit que les cadres d\u2019analyse de ces dispositions peuvent coexister. En effet, il est tout \u00e0 fait appropri\u00e9 d\u2019avoir recours au cadre d\u2019analyse de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 pour l\u2019application de l\u2019art. 7 afin d\u2019analyser tout cumul de violations d\u2019une ou de plusieurs garanties proc\u00e9durales dans le but de d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019ensemble de ces violations atteint le seuil requis pour \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure, soit une atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de justice.\n[72] Bien entendu, le cadre d\u2019analyse applicable \u00e0 chacune de ces garanties proc\u00e9durales demeurera pertinent pour d\u00e9terminer si les violations qui composent le cumul ont bel et bien eu lieu. En fait, la d\u00e9termination de l\u2019existence des violations composant le cumul devra, en toute logique, pr\u00e9c\u00e9der la d\u00e9termination de l\u2019existence de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle. Ce faisant, les cadres d\u2019analyse coexistent ensemble, ceux des garanties proc\u00e9durales \u00e9tant imbriqu\u00e9s dans celui de l\u2019art. 7.\n[73] Avant de me tourner vers le cadre d\u2019analyse applicable en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, je tiens \u00e0 r\u00e9it\u00e9rer que la preuve d\u2019une ou de plusieurs violations n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire aux fins d\u2019\u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019un abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle, car en ce qui concerne ce type d\u2019abus, l\u2019accent est mis sur les conduites qui minent l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de justice, et ce, ind\u00e9pendamment de leur caract\u00e8re attentatoire \u00e0 d\u2019autres droits de la Charte .\n(2) Le cadre d\u2019analyse applicable en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce\n[74] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure all\u00e9gu\u00e9 par les parties appelantes r\u00e9sulte d\u2019un cumul de violations de droits garantis par la Charte , \u00e0 savoir le droit d\u2019\u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9 contre les fouilles, les perquisitions et les saisies abusives et le droit de recourir sans d\u00e9lai \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat, qui d\u00e9note une situation de m\u00e9pris flagrant des autorit\u00e9s polici\u00e8res envers les droits de celles-ci (d.a., vol. X, p. 55-56; d.a., vol. XI, p. 15, 70-71 et 108-109). Les parties appelantes ne mettent pas l\u2019accent sur une quelconque entorse \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de leur proc\u00e8s r\u00e9sultant de ces violations. De plus, elles reconnaissent que, prises individuellement, les violations en cause ne sauraient justifier la r\u00e9paration qu\u2019elles demandent, soit l\u2019arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures les visant (motifs de la C.S. (2018), par. 5, 133 et 150). Elles all\u00e8guent plut\u00f4t que le cumul de violations et le m\u00e9pris qu\u2019il d\u00e9note chez les autorit\u00e9s polici\u00e8res ont caus\u00e9 une atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de justice.\n[75] Dans ces circonstances, il convient d\u2019adopter le cadre d\u2019analyse de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 pour l\u2019application de l\u2019art. 7 de la Charte afin de d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019ensemble des violations all\u00e9gu\u00e9es atteint le seuil requis pour \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure. Cette op\u00e9ration exige toutefois le recours au cadre d\u2019analyse propre \u00e0 chacune des dispositions en jeu, \u00e0 savoir l\u2019art. 8 et l\u2019al. 10b), afin de d\u00e9terminer si les all\u00e9gations de violations sont fond\u00e9es. Ce n\u2019est qu\u2019une fois que chacune des violations all\u00e9gu\u00e9es a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e qu\u2019il sera alors possible de d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019ensemble de ces violations, consid\u00e9r\u00e9es globalement, constitue une conduite qui est vexatoire au point de contrevenir aux notions fondamentales de justice et de miner ainsi l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de justice.\n[76] J\u2019ouvre ici une parenth\u00e8se. Les parties appelantes pr\u00e9tendent que certaines violations \u00e9taient \u00ab planifi\u00e9es et voulues \u00bb et que le cumul de celles-ci d\u00e9note un \u00ab m\u00e9pris flagrant \u00bb envers leurs droits (d.a., vol. I, p. 96). En outre, les parties appelantes qualifient de \u00ab syst\u00e9matique[s] \u00bb les violations all\u00e9gu\u00e9es du droit de recourir sans d\u00e9lai \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat (p. 92). Il va sans dire que le caract\u00e8re d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 et r\u00e9pandu d\u2019une ou de plusieurs violations des droits garantis par la Charte est pertinent pour d\u00e9terminer si le seuil requis pour \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle est atteint.\n[77] La Cour a d\u2019ailleurs d\u00e9j\u00e0 reconnu la pertinence de ces deux facteurs pour le cadre d\u2019analyse du par. 24(2) de la Charte , au stade de la d\u00e9termination de la gravit\u00e9 de la conduite attentatoire (R. c. Harrison, 2009 CSC 34, [2009] 2 R.C.S. 494, par. 22 et 25; R. c. Grant, 2009 CSC 32, [2009] 2 R.C.S. 353, par. 75; R. c. McColman, 2023 CSC 8, par. 58). Certes, le par. 24(2) est analytiquement distinct de l\u2019art. 8 et de l\u2019al. 10b) en ce sens qu\u2019il n\u2019entre en jeu qu\u2019au stade de la r\u00e9paration, apr\u00e8s qu\u2019une violation a \u00e9t\u00e9 constat\u00e9e. Toutefois, il demeure que la pr\u00e9occupation principale du par. 24(2), soit la confiance du public envers l\u2019administration de la justice (Grant, par. 67-68), recoupe l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par l\u2019art. 7 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle, soit l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de justice (O\u2019Connor, par. 61).\n(3) Application aux faits\n[78] Le juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure a conclu que les autorit\u00e9s polici\u00e8res avaient commis un cumul de violations des droits des parties appelantes du groupe 1 garantis par l\u2019art. 8 et l\u2019al. 10b) de la Charte et que, lorsqu\u2019examin\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on globale et dans leur contexte int\u00e9gral, ces violations r\u00e9v\u00e8lent un \u00ab probl\u00e8me syst\u00e9mique et persistant \u00bb (motifs de la C.S. (2018), par. 216) d\u2019une gravit\u00e9 extr\u00eame qui atteint le seuil requis pour \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle et justifier un arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures (par. 210, 217 et 219-220, citant Brind\u2019Amour, par. 93). Dans les paragraphes qui suivent, je m\u2019attarde \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si le juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure a err\u00e9 en tirant cette conclusion. \u00c0 cette fin, j\u2019applique le cadre d\u2019analyse de chaque droit invoqu\u00e9, en d\u00e9butant, comme l\u2019ont fait la Cour sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour d\u2019appel, par le droit de recourir sans d\u00e9lai \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat. Une fois que toutes les all\u00e9gations de violations auront \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9es, je serai en mesure d\u2019\u00e9valuer si l\u2019ensemble des violations identifi\u00e9es atteint le seuil de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019art. 7 de la Charte .\n[79] Avant de commencer, j\u2019estime utile de rappeler qu\u2019\u00ab [u]ne cour d\u2019appel n\u2019est justifi\u00e9e d\u2019intervenir que si le juge du proc\u00e8s s\u2019est fond\u00e9 sur des consid\u00e9rations erron\u00e9es en droit, a commis une erreur de fait susceptible de contr\u00f4le ou a rendu une d\u00e9cision \u201cerron\u00e9e au point de cr\u00e9er une injustice\u201d \u00bb (Babos, par. 48, citant R. c. Bellusci, 2012 CSC 44, [2012] 2 R.C.S. 509, par. 19; Regan, par. 117; Tobiass, par. 87; R. c.

Dans R. c. Bartle, [1994] 3 R.C.S. 173, le juge en chef Lamer a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 les trois obligations que cette disposition impose aux autorit\u00e9s polici\u00e8res :\n(1) informer la personne d\u00e9tenue de son droit d\u2019avoir recours sans d\u00e9lai \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019un avocat et de l\u2019existence de l\u2019aide juridique et d\u2019avocats de garde;\n(2) si la personne d\u00e9tenue a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle voulait exercer ce droit, lui donner la possibilit\u00e9 raisonnable de le faire (sauf en cas d\u2019urgence ou de danger);\n(3) s\u2019abstenir de tenter de soutirer des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e0 la personne d\u00e9tenue jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle ait eu cette possibilit\u00e9 raisonnable (encore une fois, sauf en cas d\u2019urgence ou de danger).\n(p. 192, citant R. c. Manninen, [1987] 1 R.C.S. 1233, p. 1241-1242; R. c. Evans, [1991] 1 R.C.S. 869, p. 890; R. c. Brydges, [1990] 1 R.C.S. 190, p. 203-204.)\n[81] Ces trois obligations visent \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger toute personne qui se retrouve dans une situation de vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 vis-\u00e0-vis l\u2019\u00c9tat du fait de sa d\u00e9tention (R. c. Suberu, 2009 CSC 33, [2009] 2 R.C.S. 460, par. 2 et 40-41). Lorsqu\u2019elle est sous le contr\u00f4le des autorit\u00e9s polici\u00e8res, la personne subit une entrave \u00e0 sa libert\u00e9 et s\u2019expose \u00e0 un risque d\u2019auto-incrimination involontaire (R. c. Taylor, 2014 CSC 50, [2014] 2 R.C.S. 495, par. 22, citant Bartle, p. 191).\n[82] Alors que la premi\u00e8re obligation est d\u00e9clench\u00e9e imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s la mise en d\u00e9tention (Suberu, par. 41), les deuxi\u00e8me et troisi\u00e8me obligations n\u2019entrent en jeu que si la personne d\u00e9tenue indique qu\u2019elle veut exercer son droit \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat. Si c\u2019est le cas, les autorit\u00e9s polici\u00e8res ont l\u2019obligation constitutionnelle de faciliter l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 cette assistance \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re occasion raisonnable et de s\u2019abstenir de soutirer des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e0 la personne d\u00e9tenue jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce moment (Manninen, p. 1241-1242; Taylor, par. 24 et 26).\n[83] La question de savoir si le d\u00e9lai qui s\u2019est \u00e9coul\u00e9 entre le moment o\u00f9 la personne d\u00e9tenue indique qu\u2019elle veut exercer son droit et le moment o\u00f9 elle l\u2019exerce est raisonnable en est une de fait, hautement contextuelle (Taylor, par. 24). L\u2019existence d\u2019obstacles ou encore de \u00ab circonstances exceptionnelles \u00bb justifiant la suspension momentan\u00e9e de l\u2019exercice du droit ne peut \u00eatre suppos\u00e9e; elle doit \u00eatre prouv\u00e9e (par. 33; R. c. Mian, 2014 CSC 54, [2014] 2 R.C.S. 689, par. 74; R. c. Strachan, [1988] 2 R.C.S. 980, p. 998-999). Il revient toujours \u00e0 la Couronne de faire la d\u00e9monstration des circonstances, exceptionnelles ou non, qui font en sorte que le d\u00e9lai \u00e9tait raisonnable (Taylor, par. 24).\n[84] Avant d\u2019appliquer ces principes aux faits, je consid\u00e8re n\u00e9cessaire de rappeler qu\u2019\u00e0 ce jour la loi n\u2019impose pas aux polici\u00e8res et aux policiers l\u2019obligation sp\u00e9cifique de fournir leurs propres t\u00e9l\u00e9phones aux personnes d\u00e9tenues, ni celle d\u2019avoir en main des appareils bon march\u00e9 en pr\u00e9vision de l\u2019exercice par ces personnes de leur droit de recourir sans d\u00e9lai \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat (Taylor, par. 27-28).\n(ii) Application aux faits\n[85] Le juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure a conclu \u00ab qu\u2019il y a eu violation du droit \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019un avocat et au droit d\u2019\u00eatre inform\u00e9 de ce droit \u00bb (motifs de la C.S. (2018), par. 85) \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de toutes les parties appelantes du groupe 1 au motif que la preuve r\u00e9v\u00e9lait l\u2019existence d\u2019une pratique \u00ab syst\u00e9matique \u00bb des autorit\u00e9s polici\u00e8res consistant \u00e0 reporter l\u2019exercice par ces personnes de leur droit de recourir sans d\u00e9lai \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat jusqu\u2019au moment o\u00f9 elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 conduites au poste de police, sans avoir examin\u00e9 au pr\u00e9alable les circonstances particuli\u00e8res de chaque arrestation (par. 75).\n[86] La Couronne soutient que la Cour d\u2019appel a eu raison de relever des erreurs de droit dans l\u2019analyse du juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure l\u2019ayant men\u00e9 \u00e0 cette conclusion. Elle pr\u00e9tend que le juge a fait erreur quant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tendue des obligations polici\u00e8res et que sa constatation d\u2019une violation \u00ab syst\u00e9matique \u00bb d\u00e9coule directement de cette erreur.\n[87] Pour leur part, les parties appelantes pr\u00e9tendent que le juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure n\u2019a commis aucune erreur susceptible de contr\u00f4le, et que c\u2019est la Cour d\u2019appel qui a plut\u00f4t fait erreur en intervenant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des conclusions mixtes de droit et de fait du premier juge en l\u2019absence d\u2019erreurs manifestes et d\u00e9terminantes.\n[88] Pour les motifs qui suivent, j\u2019estime que le juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure a commis une erreur de droit en concluant que le droit de recourir sans d\u00e9lai \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat de toutes les parties appelantes du groupe 1 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9.\n[89] Ma conclusion est empreinte de d\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des conclusions de fait du juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure. Celui-ci a conclu que quatre des sept parties appelantes du groupe 1 ont communiqu\u00e9 leur volont\u00e9 d\u2019exercer imm\u00e9diatement leur droit de recourir sans d\u00e9lai \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat, mais se sont vu r\u00e9pondre qu\u2019il serait exerc\u00e9 au poste de police, et ce, bien que les autorit\u00e9s polici\u00e8res n\u2019aient pas d\u2019abord examin\u00e9 si les circonstances permettaient l\u2019exercice imm\u00e9diat de leur droit (motifs de la C.S. (2018), par. 49-54, 58-59 et 68). Lorsque questionn\u00e9 sur la raison pour laquelle l\u2019une des parties appelantes ne s\u2019est pas vu offrir la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019avoir recours \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat sur place, le policier ayant proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 son arrestation a r\u00e9pondu ceci :\n. . . ce n\u2019est pas la normalit\u00e9. Ce n\u2019est pas de la mani\u00e8re qu\u2019on fait normalement. Normalement, on va se rendre directement au quartier g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, puis on va lui faire contacter son avocat dans un d\u00e9lai, t\u2019sais, raisonnable et directement l\u00e0 au quartier, et non sur place avec tout le monde qu\u2019il y a autour, question de confidentialit\u00e9 aussi, l\u00e0. [Je souligne.]\n(d.a., vol. IV, p. 29; voir aussi les motifs de la C.S. (2018), par. 54 et 57.)\n[90] De plus, comme l\u2019a soulign\u00e9 le juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure, l\u2019enqu\u00eateur en charge du volet \u00ab arrestation \u00bb lors de la rencontre pr\u00e9paratoire des polici\u00e8res et des policiers qui devaient participer \u00e0 l\u2019op\u00e9ration polici\u00e8re du 31 mars 2016 avait justement \u00e9t\u00e9 impliqu\u00e9, environ deux mois auparavant, dans une arrestation o\u00f9 son coll\u00e8gue s\u2019\u00e9tait fait reprocher d\u2019avoir r\u00e9pondu \u00ab avec un certain automatisme \u00bb \u00e0 une personne d\u00e9tenue ayant manifest\u00e9 son intention de se pr\u00e9valoir de son droit de recourir sans d\u00e9lai \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat que ce droit serait exerc\u00e9 au poste de police (par. 70, citant R. c. Martel, C.Q. Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, nos 400-01-064968-118, 400-01-064969-116, 400-01-064970-114, 27 janvier 2016, reproduit dans le d.a., vol. III, p. 1).\n[91] Dans ces circonstances, le juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure pouvait conclure \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019une pratique polici\u00e8re assimilable \u00e0 un \u00ab renversement de fardeau \u00bb (motifs de la C.S. (2018), par. 84) par lequel les polici\u00e8res et les policiers refusent d\u2019envisager l\u2019exercice imm\u00e9diat du droit \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat \u00e0 moins que la personne d\u00e9tenue ne le demande express\u00e9ment. Cette conclusion est le r\u00e9sultat de l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation souveraine des faits par le juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure et commande la retenue.\n[92] Toutefois, je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019existence de cette pratique, sans plus, ne permettait pas au juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure d\u2019inf\u00e9rer comme il l\u2019a fait que le droit des sept parties appelantes du groupe 1 de recourir sans d\u00e9lai \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat a \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9.\n[93] D\u2019abord, parmi les sept parties appelantes du groupe 1, l\u2019une d\u2019entre elles, M. Chounlamountry, s\u2019est vu offrir la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019exercer son droit \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat sur place et l\u2019a refus\u00e9 (motifs de la C.S. (2018), par. 55), et deux autres, MM. Girard et Mailhot, n\u2019ont pas demand\u00e9 \u00e0 exercer ce droit sur place (par. 56 et 62). Dans le cas de M. Girard, le juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure a retenu de la preuve qu\u2019il a exprim\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00ab voudra \u00bb exercer son droit \u00e0 l\u2019avocat plus tard (par. 56). Il s\u2019ensuit qu\u2019\u00e0 la seule lecture des constats du juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure, l\u2019obligation de mise en application du droit \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat n\u2019a m\u00eame pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clench\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019au moins trois parties appelantes du groupe 1.\n[94] Ensuite, bien que je sois d\u2019accord avec le juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure pour dire que la pratique qu\u2019il a identifi\u00e9e est r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible, elle n\u2019entra\u00eene pas pour autant la violation automatique de l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des trois obligations d\u00e9coulant du droit \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat garanti par l\u2019al. 10b) de la Charte .\n[95] La Cour a d\u00e9j\u00e0 reconnu que, en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, les autorit\u00e9s polici\u00e8res ne peuvent pas pr\u00e9sumer \u00e0 l\u2019avance qu\u2019elles seront dans l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 pratique de faciliter le recours \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat. Au contraire, elles doivent \u00eatre attentives aux circonstances particuli\u00e8res de la mise en d\u00e9tention et prendre des mesures proactives afin que le droit \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat se concr\u00e9tise en acc\u00e8s \u00e0 cette assistance (Taylor, par. 33). Il en est ainsi, car la capacit\u00e9 du d\u00e9tenu d\u2019exercer son droit d\u00e9pend enti\u00e8rement des autorit\u00e9s polici\u00e8res (par. 25).\n[96] Cela dit, le fait pour une polici\u00e8re ou un policier de pr\u00e9sumer \u00e0 l\u2019avance qu\u2019il sera raisonnable de tarder \u00e0 donner effet au droit \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat, ind\u00e9pendamment des circonstances de la mise en d\u00e9tention, n\u2019entra\u00eenera pas \u00e0 lui seul la violation de ce droit. Apr\u00e8s tout, la question centrale demeure celle de savoir si le d\u00e9lai \u00e9tait raisonnable eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble des circonstances, et ce, qu\u2019elles aient \u00e9t\u00e9 prises en consid\u00e9ration ou non par les autorit\u00e9s polici\u00e8res. Toutefois, le fait pour les autorit\u00e9s polici\u00e8res de pr\u00e9sumer que le d\u00e9lai sera raisonnable fera en sorte qu\u2019il sera beaucoup plus difficile pour la Couronne de d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il l\u2019\u00e9tait effectivement.\n[97] L\u2019affaire Taylor fournit une illustration de ce principe. Dans cette affaire, notre Cour devait d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019omission d\u2019un policier et d\u2019une polici\u00e8re de faciliter l\u2019acc\u00e8s de M. Taylor \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat dans les 20 \u00e0 30 minutes qui ont s\u00e9par\u00e9 le moment o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 admis \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital et celui o\u00f9 une premi\u00e8re s\u00e9rie d\u2019\u00e9chantillons de sang ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9lev\u00e9s constituait une violation de son droit de recourir sans d\u00e9lai \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat. Tant la polici\u00e8re que le policier avaient compl\u00e8tement oubli\u00e9 leur obligation de veiller \u00e0 ce que M. Taylor puisse exercer son droit \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re occasion raisonnable. Loin de conclure que l\u2019oubli constituait en soi une violation de l\u2019al. 10b) de la Charte , notre Cour s\u2019est plut\u00f4t concentr\u00e9e sur l\u2019impact de cet oubli sur la d\u00e9termination du caract\u00e8re raisonnable de l\u2019omission :\nComme les policiers n\u2019ont m\u00eame pas song\u00e9 cette nuit\u2011l\u00e0 \u00e0 l\u2019obligation qu\u2019ils avaient d\u2019offrir l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 un avocat, il s\u2019ensuit qu\u2019il n\u2019y a virtuellement aucune preuve concernant la question de savoir s\u2019il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 possible ou non de faire un appel t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique en priv\u00e9 et, par cons\u00e9quent, aucune base permettant d\u2019appr\u00e9cier le caract\u00e8re raisonnable de l\u2019omission de faciliter cet acc\u00e8s. [par. 35]\n[98] La polici\u00e8re avait pourtant t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 l\u2019environnement hospitalier dans lequel M. Taylor se trouvait, il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab absolument impossible \u00bb pour lui de communiquer avec une avocate ou un avocat de fa\u00e7on confidentielle (par. 30). La Cour a toutefois accord\u00e9 peu de poids \u00e0 son t\u00e9moignage, pour le motif suivant :\n. . . cette impossibilit\u00e9 pratique, invoqu\u00e9e r\u00e9trospectivement, n\u2019a qu\u2019une pertinence limit\u00e9e, puisque l\u2019agente a reconnu qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital uniquement pour assurer le suivi des \u00e9chantillons de sang et que la question de savoir si l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 un avocat \u00e9tait possible ne faisait alors pas partie de ses t\u00e2ches. Par cons\u00e9quent, elle aussi n\u2019a pas fait de d\u00e9marches \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard aupr\u00e8s des membres du personnel de l\u2019h\u00f4pital. [par. 30]\n[99] Vu l\u2019absence de preuve justifiant l\u2019omission, notre Cour est donc parvenue \u00e0 la conclusion que le droit de M. Taylor \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat garanti par l\u2019al. 10b) de la Charte avait \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9 avant le pr\u00e9l\u00e8vement de la premi\u00e8re s\u00e9rie d\u2019\u00e9chantillons sanguins (par. 37).\n[100] Il ressort de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de que le fait pour les autorit\u00e9s polici\u00e8res de reporter l\u2019exercice du droit d\u2019une personne d\u00e9tenue de recourir sans d\u00e9lai \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat jusqu\u2019au moment o\u00f9 cette personne est conduite au poste de police sans avoir examin\u00e9 au pr\u00e9alable les circonstances particuli\u00e8res de l\u2019arrestation n\u2019entra\u00eene pas, \u00e0 lui seul, la violation du droit garanti par l\u2019al. 10b) de la Charte . La question centrale demeure celle de savoir si le d\u00e9lai impos\u00e9 avant de faciliter l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 une avocate ou \u00e0 un avocat (dans l\u2019affaire Taylor, il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une omission de faciliter cet acc\u00e8s (par. 35)) \u00e9tait raisonnable dans les circonstances. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une question de fait qui doit \u00eatre tranch\u00e9e sur la base de la preuve vers\u00e9e au dossier (par. 24 et 32-33).\n[101] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, comme le souligne \u00e0 juste titre la Cour d\u2019appel, le juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure n\u2019a pas, soit dit en tout respect, analys\u00e9 le caract\u00e8re raisonnable du d\u00e9lai entre le moment o\u00f9 les parties appelantes du groupe 1 ont indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elles voulaient exercer leur droit \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat et le moment o\u00f9 elles ont pu l\u2019exercer. En effet, ses motifs portant sur le droit de recourir sans d\u00e9lai \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat des quatre parties appelantes du groupe 1 qui ont manifest\u00e9 leur intention de s\u2019en pr\u00e9valoir imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s en avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 omettent de mentionner le temps qu\u2019ont d\u00fb attendre trois d\u2019entre elles avant de pouvoir t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner \u00e0 leur avocate ou \u00e0 leur avocat (motifs de la C.S. (2018), par. 49-54, 58-61 et 68).\n[102] De plus, les motifs du juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure ne font que mentionner au passage certaines circonstances pertinentes pour l\u2019\u00e9valuation du caract\u00e8re raisonnable du d\u00e9lai, tels le fait qu\u2019une perquisition \u00e9tait en cours, la proximit\u00e9 du poste de police, la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des polici\u00e8res et des policiers, la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone sur les lieux ainsi que les enjeux li\u00e9s \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9 d\u2019un \u00e9ventuel appel, sans jamais analyser leur incidence sur le caract\u00e8re raisonnable du d\u00e9lai. Dans le cas d\u2019une des quatre parties appelantes en question, les motifs ne font m\u00eame pas \u00e9tat de l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre de ces circonstances (par. 68). J\u2019ajouterai que nulle part dans les motifs le fait que des complices soient arr\u00eat\u00e9s au m\u00eame moment n\u2019est pris en compte.\n[103] Certes, au par. 77 de ses motifs, le juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure \u00e9crit ceci :\nContrairement \u00e0 la situation rencontr\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Strachan o\u00f9 la situation devait \u00eatre stabilis\u00e9e avant que l\u2019accus\u00e9 puisse exercer son droit constitutionnel, il n\u2019y a aucune preuve d\u2019une telle situation en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Aucun effort n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait pour permettre la communication avec un avocat.\n[104] Avec \u00e9gards, ce paragraphe ne tranche pas la question du caract\u00e8re raisonnable des d\u00e9lais d\u2019attente des quatre parties appelantes du groupe 1 qui ont manifest\u00e9 leur intention de se pr\u00e9valoir imm\u00e9diatement de leur droit de recourir \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat. Bien que la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de stabiliser les lieux de l\u2019arrestation fasse partie des circonstances exceptionnelles justifiant le report momentan\u00e9 de l\u2019exercice de ce droit (Strachan, p. 998-999), ce n\u2019est pas l\u2019unique facteur \u00e0 prendre en compte afin d\u2019\u00e9valuer le caract\u00e8re raisonnable du d\u00e9lai.\n[105] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je conclus que le juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure a commis une erreur de droit en concluant que les all\u00e9gations de violations du droit de recourir sans d\u00e9lai \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat \u00e9taient fond\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de toutes les parties appelantes du groupe 1 au seul motif que les autorit\u00e9s polici\u00e8res avaient comme pratique de reporter syst\u00e9matiquement l\u2019exercice de ce droit sans d\u2019abord consid\u00e9rer les circonstances particuli\u00e8res de chaque arrestation. Cette erreur explique pourquoi le juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure a conclu que le droit de recourir sans d\u00e9lai \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat de trois parties appelantes a \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9 alors qu\u2019elles avaient soit d\u00e9j\u00e0 exerc\u00e9, soit report\u00e9 \u00e0 plus tard l\u2019exercice de leur droit apr\u00e8s en avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment inform\u00e9. Elle explique aussi pourquoi le juge a omis d\u2019analyser le caract\u00e8re raisonnable du d\u00e9lai entre le moment o\u00f9 les quatre autres parties appelantes du groupe 1 ont indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elles voulaient exercer leur droit \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat et le moment o\u00f9 elles ont pu l\u2019exercer.\n[106] Comme les parties appelantes ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de fonder leur all\u00e9gation d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure sur l\u2019existence d\u2019un cumul de violations, incluant celle du droit de recourir sans d\u00e9lai \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat, le juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure devait appliquer correctement le cadre d\u2019analyse de l\u2019al. 10b) \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de chacune d\u2019entre elles et tirer les conclusions qui s\u2019imposaient, ce qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas fait.\n[107] Bien entendu, la pratique polici\u00e8re r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible identifi\u00e9e plus t\u00f4t constitue en soi une inconduite \u00e9tatique pertinente pour la d\u00e9termination de l\u2019existence d\u2019un abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle. Toutefois, \u00e0 ce stade-ci, il est impossible de dire si la seule existence de cette inconduite atteignait, aux yeux du juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure, le m\u00eame niveau de gravit\u00e9 que le cumul de violations du droit de recourir sans d\u00e9lai \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat qu\u2019il croyait avoir identifi\u00e9. Apr\u00e8s tout, le d\u00e9lai \u00e9coul\u00e9 entre l\u2019arrestation et le moment o\u00f9 la possibilit\u00e9 de communiquer avec une avocate ou un avocat a \u00e9t\u00e9 offerte a vari\u00e9, selon le cas, de 23 minutes \u00e0 1 heure 6 minutes, et l\u2019impact de la pratique polici\u00e8re sur l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 du proc\u00e8s est, au mieux, incertain (motifs de la C.S. (2018), par. 189-191). Dans ces circonstances, la d\u00e9termination au cas par cas de l\u2019existence d\u2019une violation du droit garanti par l\u2019al. 10b) de la Charte rev\u00eatait une importance accrue aux fins de d\u00e9terminer la gravit\u00e9 de la pratique polici\u00e8re r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible et, ultimement, l\u2019existence d\u2019un abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle.\n[108] L\u2019erreur de droit commise par le juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure est d\u00e9cisive quant au sort du pourvoi pour les parties appelantes du groupe 1, puisque le juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que les violations du droit de recourir sans d\u00e9lai \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat \u00e9taient les plus graves (motifs de la C.S. (2018), par. 184). \u00c0 l\u2019inverse, il a qualifi\u00e9 l\u2019omission de faire viser les mandats ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur du district de Trois-Rivi\u00e8res d\u2019\u00ab erreur de bonne foi \u00bb (par. 152) et a sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9 que l\u2019omission de donner des avis de perquisition secr\u00e8te dans le d\u00e9lai imparti \u00ab n\u2019aurait pas permis l\u2019arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures \u00e0 elle seule \u00bb (par. 133). Dans ces circonstances, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de se pencher sur les conclusions du juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure au sujet de ces violations du droit d\u2019\u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9 contre les fouilles, les perquisitions et les saisies abusives. Comme l\u2019a reconnu la Cour d\u2019appel, le d\u00e9faut du juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure d\u2019\u00e9valuer, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de chaque partie appelante du groupe 1, le caract\u00e8re raisonnable du d\u00e9lai \u00e9coul\u00e9 avant que l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 de communiquer avec une avocate ou un avocat lui soit donn\u00e9e justifie, \u00ab \u00e0 elle seule \u00bb, la tenue d\u2019une nouvelle audition de la requ\u00eate en arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures et en exclusion de la preuve pour le groupe 1 (par. 56). Il en est ainsi parce que la conclusion du juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure voulant que le droit des parties appelantes du groupe 1 de recourir sans d\u00e9lai \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat ait \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9 constituait un pilier essentiel \u00e0 sa conclusion finale selon laquelle les parties appelantes du groupe 1 ont subi une violation de leur droit garanti par l\u2019art. 7 de la Charte en raison d\u2019un abus de proc\u00e9dure relavant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle. \u00c9carter la premi\u00e8re conclusion revient donc \u00e0 \u00e9carter la deuxi\u00e8me.\nb) Conclusion\n[109] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re des motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, je conclus, tout comme la Cour d\u2019appel, que le juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure a fait erreur lorsqu\u2019il a statu\u00e9 que le droit de toutes les parties appelantes du groupe 1 de recourir sans d\u00e9lai \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat a \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9. Puisque les violations de ce droit \u00e9taient, \u00e0 ses yeux, les plus graves, sa conclusion selon laquelle les parties appelantes du groupe 1 ont subi un abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle doit \u00eatre \u00e9cart\u00e9e.\n[110] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que le juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure n\u2019a pas proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019analyse individualis\u00e9e requise par l\u2019al. 10b) de la Charte afin de d\u00e9terminer si le droit des parties appelantes du groupe 1 de recourir sans d\u00e9lai \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat a \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9, notre Cour est plac\u00e9e devant le choix de confirmer le jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel ordonnant la tenue d\u2019une nouvelle audition de leur requ\u00eate ou d\u2019assumer le r\u00f4le de juge des faits. Vu la nature hautement circonstancielle de l\u2019analyse, je suis d\u2019avis qu\u2019il est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice qu\u2019il y ait une nouvelle audition de la requ\u00eate des parties appelantes du groupe 1.\n[111] La question de savoir s\u2019il en va de m\u00eame \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la requ\u00eate des parties appelantes des groupes 2, 3 et 4 sera discut\u00e9e plus bas. Avant d\u2019y r\u00e9pondre, j\u2019estime n\u00e9cessaire de souligner une autre erreur commise par le juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la d\u00e9termination de la r\u00e9paration convenable pour les parties appelantes du groupe 1, advenant le cas o\u00f9 il serait une fois de plus jug\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019issue de la nouvelle audition de la requ\u00eate, que le seuil requis pour \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle est atteint.\nC. Le juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure a-t-il err\u00e9 en ordonnant l\u2019arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de toutes les parties appelantes?\n[112] L\u2019arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures a \u00e9t\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9 d\u2019\u00ab ultime r\u00e9paration \u00bb (Tobiass, par. 86) \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 son caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif :\nElle est ultime en ce sens qu\u2019elle est d\u00e9finitive. Les accusations suspendues ne pourront jamais faire l\u2019objet de poursuites; la pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e victime ne sera jamais capable de se faire entendre en justice; la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 sera priv\u00e9e \u00e0 jamais de la possibilit\u00e9 de faire trancher l\u2019affaire par le juge des faits.\n(Regan, par. 53)\n[113] Pour ces raisons, et comme je l\u2019ai soulign\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, cette r\u00e9paration draconienne ne sera ordonn\u00e9e que dans l\u2019\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 la situation satisfait au crit\u00e8re exigeant qui requiert qu\u2019elle fasse partie des \u00ab cas les plus manifestes \u00bb (O\u2019Connor, par. 69). Pour qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse d\u2019un tel cas, les trois conditions suivantes doivent \u00eatre r\u00e9unies:\n(1) il doit y avoir une atteinte au droit de la personne accus\u00e9e \u00e0 un proc\u00e8s \u00e9quitable ou \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de justice qui \u00ab sera r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9[e], perp\u00e9tu\u00e9[e] ou aggrav\u00e9[e] par le d\u00e9roulement du proc\u00e8s ou par son issue \u00bb (Regan, par. 54; Babos, par. 32);\n(2) il ne doit y avoir aucune autre r\u00e9paration susceptible de corriger l\u2019atteinte (Regan, par. 54; Babos, par. 32);\n(3) s\u2019il subsiste une incertitude quant \u00e0 l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 de l\u2019arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures \u00e0 l\u2019issue des deux premi\u00e8res \u00e9tapes, le tribunal doit mettre en balance les int\u00e9r\u00eats militant en faveur de cet arr\u00eat, comme le fait de d\u00e9noncer la conduite r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible et de pr\u00e9server l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de justice, d\u2019une part, et \u00ab l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat que repr\u00e9sente pour la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 un jugement d\u00e9finitif statuant sur le fond \u00bb, d\u2019autre part (Regan, par. 57; Babos, par. 32).\n[114] Ces conditions sont cumulatives et aucune n\u2019est facultative. Avec \u00e9gards, j\u2019estime que le juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure a omis de s\u2019assurer que la deuxi\u00e8me condition \u00e9tait respect\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[115] \u00c0 d\u00e9faut d\u2019obtenir un arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019ensemble d\u2019entre elles, la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par les parties appelantes du groupe 1 visait express\u00e9ment \u00e0 obtenir une ordonnance excluant toute une liste d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve (d.a., vol. I, p. 158-159; d.a., vol. XI, p. 169; d.a., vol. XII, p. 1; voir aussi le d.a., vol. XX, p. 18-20).\n[116] Or, le juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure n\u2019a jamais fait mention de cette solution de rechange \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures dans son analyse \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la r\u00e9paration convenable (motifs de la C.S. (2018), par. 178-222). Il s\u2019est content\u00e9 d\u2019affirmer que \u00ab l\u2019arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures est le rem\u00e8de appropri\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce \u00bb (par. 217).\n[117] Peut-\u00eatre \u00e9tait-ce le cas, mais encore fallait-il expliquer pourquoi une r\u00e9paration moindre que l\u2019arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures ne pouvait pas corriger l\u2019atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de justice qu\u2019il croyait avoir identifi\u00e9e (voir, p. ex., Brind\u2019Amour, par. 102-103).\n[118] J\u2019ajouterais que cette omission de consid\u00e9rer des r\u00e9parations moindres est d\u2019autant plus significative dans un contexte o\u00f9 plusieurs personnes accus\u00e9es demandent une r\u00e9paration en vertu du par. 24(1) de la Charte en raison d\u2019un m\u00eame abus de proc\u00e9dure qui les a impact\u00e9es diff\u00e9remment. Dans ces circonstances, le tribunal peut tr\u00e8s bien conclure que la r\u00e9paration qui corrigerait enti\u00e8rement l\u2019atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de justice caus\u00e9e par cet abus implique des ordonnances individualis\u00e9es. Apr\u00e8s tout, il est important de rappeler ce qui suit :\n. . . la Charte a remplac\u00e9, entre les mains des juges, la hache par le scalpel et leur a donn\u00e9 un outil qui permet de fa\u00e7onner mieux que jamais des solutions qui tiennent compte [. . .] des pr\u00e9occupations parfois compl\u00e9mentaires et parfois contraires que sont l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 envers les individus [. . .], les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me judiciaire.\n(O\u2019Connor, par. 69)\nD. La Couronne pouvait-elle soulever devant la Cour d\u2019appel l\u2019omission du juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure de consid\u00e9rer les circonstances particuli\u00e8res de l\u2019arrestation de chaque partie appelante des groupes 2, 3 et 4 apr\u00e8s avoir consenti au jugement?\n[119] Enfin, les parties appelantes pr\u00e9tendent que le sort de l\u2019appel de celles d\u2019entre elles qui font partie des groupes 2, 3 et 4 est ind\u00e9pendant de celui des parties appelantes du groupe 1. En effet, elles ont soutenu devant nous que la Couronne n\u2019aurait pas d\u00fb \u00eatre autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 plaider, relativement au jugement ordonnant l\u2019arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des parties appelantes des groupes 2, 3 et 4, les m\u00eames arguments qu\u2019elle a plaid\u00e9s au sujet du jugement ordonnant l\u2019arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des parties appelantes du groupe 1. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, elles soutiennent que la Couronne aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre forclose de soulever l\u2019omission du juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure de consid\u00e9rer les circonstances particuli\u00e8res de l\u2019arrestation de chaque partie appelante des groupes 2, 3 et 4 pour d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y avait eu violation de leur droit de recourir sans d\u00e9lai \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat. Ayant explicitement \u00ab invit\u00e9 \u00bb le juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 statuer \u00ab sans autres formalit\u00e9s \u00bb sur les requ\u00eates de ces groupes, la Couronne ne saurait, selon elles, \u00eatre admise \u00e0 adopter une nouvelle position en appel et \u00e0 reprocher au juge de ne pas avoir fait une analyse au cas par cas (m.a., par. 92). Ce changement de position en appel contreviendrait au principe de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 la garantie contre le double p\u00e9ril consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019al. 11h) de la Charte .\n[120] Au soutien de leur argument, les parties appelantes s\u2019appuient sur l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Barton, 2019 CSC 33, [2019] 2 R.C.S. 579, qui \u00e9nonce l\u2019obligation qu\u2019a la Couronne, pour des raisons d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale, de ne pas avancer une nouvelle th\u00e8se de la responsabilit\u00e9 en appel. Dans Barton, par. 47, le juge Moldaver, qui s\u2019exprimait au nom des juges majoritaires, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit :\nPar souci d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 envers l\u2019accus\u00e9, et particuli\u00e8rement par souci de respecter le principe de la protection contre le double p\u00e9ril, consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019al. 11 h ) de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s , il est interdit au minist\u00e8re public d\u2019obtenir un nouveau proc\u00e8s en avan\u00e7ant une nouvelle th\u00e8se de la responsabilit\u00e9 en appel (voir Wexler c. The King, [1939] R.C.S. 350; Savard c. The King, [1946] R.C.S. 20, p. 33\u201134, 37 et 49; R. c. Penno, [1990] 2 R.C.S. 865, p. 895\u2011896; R. c. Egger, [1993] 2 R.C.S. 451, p. 481). En outre, comme le juge Doherty l\u2019a expliqu\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Varga, [traduction] \u00ab [l]e principe de la protection contre le double p\u00e9ril est compromis davantage lorsque les arguments plaid\u00e9s en appel contredisent la th\u00e8se que soutient le minist\u00e8re public au proc\u00e8s \u00bb (p. 793). Bref, \u00ab [l]\u2019appel form\u00e9 par le minist\u00e8re public ne saurait constituer un moyen de communication d\u2019une preuve diff\u00e9rente que celle pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au proc\u00e8s \u00bb (ibid.).\n[121] En r\u00e9ponse, la Couronne pr\u00e9tend ne pas avoir chang\u00e9 de position en appel ni invit\u00e9 le juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 statuer sur la requ\u00eate des groupes 2, 3 et 4 sans autres formalit\u00e9s. Je suis d\u2019accord avec elle. Selon le proc\u00e8s-verbal de l\u2019audience du 7 mai 2019, tant les parties appelantes que la Couronne ont convenu que la d\u00e9cision rendue \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du groupe 1, \u00e0 savoir l\u2019arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures, s\u2019appliquait aux groupes 2, 3, et 4, apr\u00e8s avoir d\u2019abord consenti \u00e0 ce que la preuve et les plaidoiries de l\u2019audition de la requ\u00eate du groupe 1 soient vers\u00e9es au dossier de la requ\u00eate des groupes 2, 3 et 4. Ce faisant, les parties n\u2019ont pas invit\u00e9 le juge \u00e0 statuer sur la requ\u00eate sans autres formalit\u00e9s. Elles ont plut\u00f4t reconnu qu\u2019un jugement identique suivrait une preuve et des plaidoiries identiques. Il semble que cette mani\u00e8re de proc\u00e9der constitue une utilisation efficace des ressources judiciaires.\n[122] Surtout, non seulement la Couronne n\u2019a-t-elle jamais renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 son droit d\u2019appel, mais il appert des \u00e9changes entre les parties et le juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure lors de l\u2019audience du 7 mai 2019 que tous savaient que la Couronne ferait appel du jugement qui serait rendu pour les groupes 2, 3 et 4 et que cet appel serait joint \u00e0 celui du premier jugement traitant du groupe 1, d\u00e9j\u00e0 intent\u00e9 par le biais du d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019un avis d\u2019appel (d.a., vol. XII, p. 199-200; voir aussi le d.a., vol. II, p. 55, par. 32, reproduisant le m\u00e9moire de la Couronne devant la Cour d\u2019appel dat\u00e9 du 22 ao\u00fbt 2019 indiquant que le m\u00e9moire initial visant les parties appelantes du groupe 1 a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit le 25 mars 2019, soit un peu plus d\u2019un mois avant l\u2019audience du 7 mai 2019). Il n\u2019y a donc eu ni surprise ni pr\u00e9judice pour les parties appelantes.\n[123] Je rejette donc ce moyen d\u2019appel. La Couronne \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 soulever l\u2019omission du juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure de consid\u00e9rer les circonstances particuli\u00e8res de l\u2019arrestation de chaque partie appelante des groupes 2, 3 et 4. Pour les raisons expos\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, je conclus que le juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure a commis une erreur de droit en statuant que les all\u00e9gations de violations du droit de recourir sans d\u00e9lai \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019une avocate ou d\u2019un avocat \u00e9taient fond\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des parties appelantes des groupes 2, 3 et 4. Cette erreur est \u00e9galement d\u00e9terminante quant au sort du pourvoi des parties appelantes des groupes 2, 3 et 4, et elle commande la tenue d\u2019une ou plusieurs nouvelles auditions de leur requ\u00eate en arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures et en exclusion de la preuve.\nVI. Conclusion\n[124] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, je suis d\u2019avis de rejeter le pourvoi. La tenue de nouveaux proc\u00e8s devant un autre juge, incluant de nouvelles auditions sur les requ\u00eates en arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures et en exclusion de la preuve, est indiqu\u00e9e.\nVersion fran\u00e7aise des motifs rendus par\nLe juge Rowe \u2014\n[125] Je souscris aux motifs de la juge O\u2019Bonsawin quant au r\u00e9sultat et, dans une large mesure, quant \u00e0 son \u00e9nonc\u00e9 du droit et \u00e0 l\u2019application de celui\u2011ci aux circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Cependant, comme le pr\u00e9sent cas fournit des indications sur la m\u00e9thodologie qui doit \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e lorsqu\u2019un accus\u00e9 sollicite un arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures en vertu du par. 24(1) de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s pour de pr\u00e9tendues violations des droits qui lui sont garantis par les art. 8 \u00e0 14 (en l\u2019occurrence par l\u2019al. 10b)), et demande \u00e9galement l\u2019arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures en vertu du par. 24(1) pour cause d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019art. 7, j\u2019estime qu\u2019il y aurait lieu de formuler quelques clarifications additionnelles. C\u2019est dans ce but que j\u2019expose les brefs motifs qui suivent.\n[126] La Cour n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 constante pour ce qui est de l\u2019ordre dans lequel l\u2019analyse juridique doit \u00eatre effectu\u00e9e dans les cas o\u00f9 un accus\u00e9 demande un arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures en vertu de l\u2019art. 7 et des art. 8 \u00e0 14 (R. c. J.J., 2022 CSC 28, par. 115). Dans certaines affaires, elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, lorsque sont invoqu\u00e9s l\u2019une des \u00ab Garanties juridiques \u00bb pr\u00e9vues aux art. 8 \u00e0 14 ainsi que le droit plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00e9nonc\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019art. 7, le droit sp\u00e9cifique devrait \u00eatre examin\u00e9 en premier (Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Whaling, 2014 CSC 20, [2014] 1 R.C.S. 392, par. 76; voir aussi R. c. Harrer, [1995] 3 R.C.S. 562, par. 13; R. c. G\u00e9n\u00e9reux, [1992] 1 R.C.S. 259, p. 310; R. c. Pearson, [1992] 3 R.C.S. 665, p. 688). Dans d\u2019autres affaires, la Cour s\u2019est pench\u00e9e en premier sur l\u2019art. 7. Par exemple, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Pan, 2001 CSC 42, [2001] 2 R.C.S. 344, la juge Arbour, qui s\u2019exprimait pour la Cour, a \u00e9crit ce qui suit : \u00ab il n\u2019y a pas lieu en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce d\u2019examiner les arguments des appelants au sujet des al. 11 d ) et 11 f ) de la Charte . Je souscris \u00e0 l\u2019opinion de la Cour d\u2019appel selon laquelle, d\u2019une part, c\u2019est au regard de l\u2019art. 7 de la Charte qu\u2019il convient d\u2019examiner les atteintes \u00e0 la Charte reproch\u00e9es dans les pr\u00e9sents pourvois, et, d\u2019autre part, il n\u2019y a aucun avantage \u00e0 analyser \u00e9galement les atteintes aux al. 11 d ) et 11 f ) de la Charte qu\u2019on reproche \u00bb (par. 79; voir aussi R. c. Cawthorne, 2016 CSC 32, [2016] 1 R.C.S. 983, par. 35). Parfois, l\u2019approche suivie par la Cour varie \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur d\u2019une m\u00eame d\u00e9cision. \u00c0 titre d\u2019exemple, dans R. c. St\u2011Onge Lamoureux, 2012 CSC 57, [2012] 3 R.C.S. 187, le juge Cromwell, dissident en partie, a examin\u00e9 certaines pr\u00e9tentions au regard de l\u2019art. 7 et certaines autres au regard de l\u2019art. 11, parce que les dispositions contest\u00e9es dans cette affaire \u00ab vis[aient] plus directement \u00bb l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre de ces articles (par. 125).\n[127] Cette absence de m\u00e9thodologie d\u00e9termin\u00e9e peut engendrer d\u2019autres probl\u00e8mes, particuli\u00e8rement l\u2019introduction de facteurs qui sont pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un article dans l\u2019examen d\u2019un autre article o\u00f9 ils ne le sont (peut-\u00eatre) pas. Il n\u2019est pas facile de dire s\u2019il s\u2019agit ou non d\u2019une telle situation en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et, si oui, dans quelle mesure c\u2019est le cas (voir les motifs de ma coll\u00e8gue, par. 66\u201177, 80\u201184, 94\u2011108 et 109\u2011110). Je ne sugg\u00e8re pas que ma coll\u00e8gue fait erreur dans son analyse; je dis plut\u00f4t qu\u2019on ne voit pas clairement ce qui \u00ab guide \u00bb l\u2019analyse.\n[128] Il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019un cas isol\u00e9. Au contraire, le fondement sur lequel les tribunaux concluent \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019une violation ne ressort pas toujours clairement des d\u00e9cisions de notre Cour. Par exemple, dans R. c. Babos, 2014 CSC 16, [2014] 1 R.C.S. 309, l\u2019all\u00e9gation d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur les art. 7 et 8, ainsi que sur l\u2019al. 11d). Le juge du proc\u00e8s avait conclu que tous les droits garantis par ces dispositions avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9s, sans proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019analyse de chacun de ces droits; notre Cour n\u2019a fourni aucune indication, puisque son analyse n\u2019a trait\u00e9 que de la r\u00e9paration. Voir aussi R. c. MacDonnell, [1997] 1 R.C.S. 305.\n[129] Les tribunaux devraient proc\u00e9der de mani\u00e8re uniforme \u00e0 l\u2019analyse dans les cas o\u00f9 l\u2019art. 7 et les art. 8 \u00e0 14 de la Charte sont invoqu\u00e9s par un accus\u00e9 afin d\u2019obtenir un arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures. \u00c0 mon avis, la s\u00e9quence suivante d\u00e9crit l\u2019ordre appropri\u00e9 des op\u00e9rations :\na) lorsque l\u2019un des droits garantis par les art. 8 \u00e0 14 est invoqu\u00e9 en m\u00eame temps que l\u2019art. 7, le droit sp\u00e9cifique devrait \u00eatre examin\u00e9 en premier, y compris (si n\u00e9cessaire) au regard de l\u2019article premier;\nb) ce n\u2019est qu\u2019en l\u2019absence de violation du droit sp\u00e9cifique, ou lorsque la violation est justifi\u00e9e au regard de l\u2019article premier, que les tribunaux de r\u00e9vision devraient examiner l\u2019art. 7 et, si n\u00e9cessaire, l\u2019article premier encore une fois.\n[130] Il est possible de consid\u00e9rer que les motifs de la juge O\u2019Bonsawin sont conformes \u00e0 ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, mais aussi qu\u2019ils appliquent une analyse \u00ab mixte \u00bb dans l\u2019examen de l\u2019al. 10b) et de l\u2019art. 7.

F.31, art. 12(1).\nUn journaliste de la SRC a demand\u00e9 d\u2019avoir acc\u00e8s \u00e0 23 lettres de mandat que le premier ministre de l\u2019Ontario a remises \u00e0 chacun de ses ministres peu apr\u00e8s avoir form\u00e9 le gouvernement en 2018. Les lettres exposent les opinions du premier ministre sur les priorit\u00e9s strat\u00e9giques en pr\u00e9vision du mandat du gouvernement. Le Bureau du Cabinet a refus\u00e9 la demande du journaliste. Il a pr\u00e9tendu que les lettres \u00e9taient soustraites \u00e0 la divulgation en application de l\u2019exception pr\u00e9vue pour les documents du Cabinet au par. 12(1) de la Loi sur l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information et la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e (\u00ab LAIPVP \u00bb) de l\u2019Ontario, dont la phrase liminaire prot\u00e8ge la confidentialit\u00e9 des documents qui auraient pour effet de r\u00e9v\u00e9ler l\u2019\u00ab objet des d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations \u00bb du Cabinet ou de ses comit\u00e9s. La SRC a interjet\u00e9 appel au Commissaire \u00e0 l\u2019information et \u00e0 la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e de l\u2019Ontario (\u00ab CIPVP ou Commissaire \u00bb), qui a conclu que les lettres n\u2019\u00e9taient pas exempt\u00e9es et qui a ordonn\u00e9 leur divulgation. Lors de la r\u00e9vision judiciaire, la Cour divisionnaire a jug\u00e9 raisonnable la d\u00e9cision du CIPVP, et les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel se sont dits du m\u00eame avis.\nArr\u00eat : Le pourvoi est accueilli et l\u2019ordonnance du CIPVP est annul\u00e9e.\nLe juge en chef Wagner et les juges Karakatsanis, Rowe, Martin, Jamal et O\u2019Bonsawin : Les lettres de mandat sont exemptes de divulgation suivant le par. 12(1) de la LAIPVP. La phrase liminaire du par. 12(1) commande une analyse substantielle du document demand\u00e9 et de son objet afin de d\u00e9terminer si la divulgation du document d\u00e9voilerait les d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du Cabinet. Le texte, l\u2019objet et le contexte de la disposition l\u00e9gislative m\u00e8nent inexorablement \u00e0 la conclusion que les lettres de mandat sont exemptes de divulgation suivant la phrase liminaire du par. 12(1). Les lettres de mandat font \u00e9tat des opinions du premier ministre sur l\u2019importance de certaines priorit\u00e9s strat\u00e9giques, et marquent le d\u00e9but d\u2019un processus fluide de formulation des politiques au sein du Cabinet. Les lettres sont r\u00e9v\u00e9latrices de l\u2019objet des d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du Cabinet.\nLa l\u00e9gislation sur l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information \u00e9tablit un \u00e9quilibre entre le besoin de savoir du public et la confidentialit\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire pour que l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif puisse gouverner efficacement. Toutes les lois de ce genre au Canada concilient ces deux objectifs essentiels en conf\u00e9rant au public un droit d\u2019acc\u00e8s g\u00e9n\u00e9ral aux renseignements d\u00e9tenus par le gouvernement, sous r\u00e9serve d\u2019exceptions ou d\u2019exclusions \u2014 notamment celles applicables aux documents ou aux renseignements confidentiels du Cabinet. En Ontario, le par. 12(1) de la LAIPVP exempte une liste de documents, ainsi que tout autre document qui aurait pour effet de r\u00e9v\u00e9ler l\u2019objet des d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du Cabinet ou de ses comit\u00e9s. Il appert du contexte l\u00e9gislatif que cette exception constituait une partie cruciale de l\u2019\u00e9quilibre \u00e9tabli par le l\u00e9gislateur entre l\u2019acc\u00e8s du public \u00e0 l\u2019information et les sph\u00e8res n\u00e9cessaires de confidentialit\u00e9 au sein du gouvernement. La confidentialit\u00e9 du Cabinet est prot\u00e9g\u00e9e non seulement par voie l\u00e9gislative, mais \u00e9galement par convention constitutionnelle. Puisque le par. 12(1) vise \u00e0 pr\u00e9server le secret des d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du Cabinet, la dimension constitutionnelle du secret du Cabinet est un \u00e9l\u00e9ment contextuel crucial dans l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du par. 12(1).\nDans la d\u00e9mocratie constitutionnelle du Canada, la confidentialit\u00e9 des d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du Cabinet est une condition pr\u00e9alable au gouvernement responsable, car elle permet la responsabilit\u00e9 minist\u00e9rielle collective. Le gouvernement responsable est un principe fondamental du r\u00e9gime de gouvernement canadien et la caract\u00e9ristique non f\u00e9d\u00e9rale la plus importante de la Constitution canadienne. Le secret du Cabinet d\u00e9coule de la dimension collective de la responsabilit\u00e9 minist\u00e9rielle, qui exige que les ministres puissent s\u2019exprimer librement au moment de d\u00e9lib\u00e9rer sans craindre que leurs propos fassent l\u2019objet d\u2019un examen public. Cela s\u2019impose pour que les ministres ne se censurent pas lors d\u2019un d\u00e9bat sur une politique, et qu\u2019ils puissent \u00eatre solidaires en public, et soient tenus responsables collectivement, d\u00e8s qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision de politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale est prise et annonc\u00e9e. Ces objectifs sont qualifi\u00e9s de consid\u00e9rations de franchise et de solidarit\u00e9 justifiant la confidentialit\u00e9 du Cabinet. Il existe \u00e9galement une troisi\u00e8me raison d\u2019\u00eatre de la convention relative \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9 du Cabinet : elle favorise l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 du processus d\u00e9cisionnel collectif. Le secret du Cabinet favorise donc la franchise, la solidarit\u00e9 et l\u2019efficacit\u00e9, tout cela pour contribuer \u00e0 un gouvernement efficace.\nLa pr\u00e9rogative de d\u00e9cider de l\u2019occasion et de la mani\u00e8re d\u2019annoncer des d\u00e9cisions du Cabinet repose sur l\u2019incidence pr\u00e9judiciable que pourrait avoir la divulgation pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e de priorit\u00e9s strat\u00e9giques sur le processus de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration. L\u2019efficacit\u00e9 du processus de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration justifie la confidentialit\u00e9 des d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du Cabinet avant qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision finale soit prise et rendue publique. Rendre public le processus d\u00e9cisionnel du Cabinet avant la formulation et l\u2019annonce d\u2019une d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive accro\u00eetrait la pression publique exerc\u00e9e sur les ministres par les parties prenantes et susciterait des critiques partisanes de la part d\u2019opposants politiques; cet examen attentif aurait pour effet de paralyser le processus d\u00e9cisionnel collectif. L\u2019objet des d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du Cabinet englobe aussi les discussions concernant le quand et le comment de la communication des priorit\u00e9s du gouvernement.\nLe processus de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration du Cabinet consiste en des discussions, des consultations et la formulation de politiques auxquelles participent le premier ministre, les ministres et le Cabinet dans son ensemble. Le premier ministre, en qualit\u00e9 de chef du Cabinet, jouit de vastes pouvoirs dans le processus de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration du Cabinet. \u00c0 bien des \u00e9gards, la fonction et les activit\u00e9s du premier ministre sont indissociables du Cabinet et de ses d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations. Le premier ministre pr\u00e9side le Cabinet, en fixe les ordres du jour, en choisit les membres et \u00e9tablit sa structure interne, fixe ses proc\u00e9dures, et il a le droit de constater le consensus et de d\u00e9terminer ce qu\u2019a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 le Cabinet. L\u2019\u00e9tablissement du programme, \u00e9tape qui survient t\u00f4t, est une partie vitale du processus d\u00e9cisionnel. Bien que les processus de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration aient chang\u00e9 au fil du temps tant au palier provincial que f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, la fonction essentielle de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement du programme et la participation centrale du premier ministre \u00e0 cette entreprise sont demeur\u00e9es inchang\u00e9es. Les stades du processus de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration du Cabinet ne surviennent pas tous autour de la table du Cabinet derri\u00e8re une porte close. Le processus d\u00e9cisionnel au sein du Cabinet s\u2019\u00e9tend au\u2011del\u00e0 des r\u00e9unions officielles de celui\u2011ci ou de ses comit\u00e9s. Les priorit\u00e9s communiqu\u00e9es aux ministres par le premier ministre au d\u00e9but du gouvernement marquent le commencement du processus de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration du Cabinet, et elles seront r\u00e9v\u00e9latrices de l\u2019objet des d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du Cabinet lorsqu\u2019on les met en corr\u00e9lation avec l\u2019action subs\u00e9quente du gouvernement.\nEn abordant les revendications de confidentialit\u00e9 du Cabinet, les d\u00e9cideurs administratifs et les cours de r\u00e9vision doivent \u00eatre attentifs non seulement \u00e0 l\u2019importance primordiale de l\u2019acc\u00e8s du public aux renseignements d\u00e9tenus par le gouvernement, mais aussi \u00e0 l\u2019objectif fondamental du secret du Cabinet de permettre un gouvernement efficace, de m\u00eame qu\u2019aux consid\u00e9rations d\u2019efficacit\u00e9, de franchise et de solidarit\u00e9 qui le sous\u2011tendent. Ils doivent aussi \u00eatre attentifs au caract\u00e8re dynamique de la prise de d\u00e9cisions par l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif, \u00e0 la fonction du Cabinet en soi et de ses membres, au r\u00f4le du premier ministre ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 la pr\u00e9rogative du Cabinet de choisir l\u2019occasion et la mani\u00e8re d\u2019annoncer ses d\u00e9cisions.\nEn l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de trancher la question de la norme de contr\u00f4le, car la m\u00eame conclusion s\u2019impose, peu importe que la norme de contr\u00f4le de la d\u00e9cision du CIPVP soit celle de la d\u00e9cision correcte ou celle de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable. La sph\u00e8re de protection restreinte des d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du Cabinet cr\u00e9\u00e9e par l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation et l\u2019application du par. 12(1) par le CIPVP n\u2019est pas justifi\u00e9e, m\u00eame \u00e0 l\u2019aune de la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable. Le CIPVP n\u2019a pas accord\u00e9 le poids qui convient au contexte juridique et factuel, y compris aux traditions et conventions constitutionnelles int\u00e9ressant la confidentialit\u00e9 du Cabinet, le r\u00f4le du premier ministre, ainsi que le caract\u00e8re fluide et dynamique du processus d\u00e9cisionnel du Cabinet. L\u2019interpr\u00e9tation \u00e9troite que le CIPVP a donn\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00ab objet des d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations \u00bb \u00e9tait donc d\u00e9raisonnable, tout comme son application de la disposition aux lettres de mandat.\nLa juge C\u00f4t\u00e9 : Il y a accord avec l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation que la majorit\u00e9 donne au par. 12(1) de la LAIPVP, de m\u00eame qu\u2019avec sa conclusion selon laquelle les lettres de mandat en cause sont exemptes de divulgation suivant cette disposition. Il y a toutefois d\u00e9saccord avec l\u2019affirmation de la majorit\u00e9 selon laquelle il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de trancher la question de la norme de contr\u00f4le applicable.\nLa Cour a reconnu que la norme de contr\u00f4le de la d\u00e9cision correcte s\u2019impose \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des questions de droit g\u00e9n\u00e9rales \u2014 comme le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 des limites du secret professionnel de l\u2019avocat et la port\u00e9e du privil\u00e8ge parlementaire \u2014 qui sont d\u2019une importance fondamentale, de grande port\u00e9e et susceptibles d\u2019avoir des r\u00e9percussions juridiques significatives sur le syst\u00e8me de justice dans son ensemble. La port\u00e9e du privil\u00e8ge du Cabinet n\u2019est pas une question unique au r\u00e9gime r\u00e9glementaire pr\u00e9cis de l\u2019Ontario, et il n\u2019y a aucune raison de principe pour laquelle le privil\u00e8ge du Cabinet devrait \u00eatre trait\u00e9 diff\u00e9remment du secret professionnel de l\u2019avocat ou du privil\u00e8ge parlementaire \u2014 ou est moins important qu\u2019eux pour le syst\u00e8me juridique dans son ensemble. La port\u00e9e du privil\u00e8ge du Cabinet est une question d\u2019importance capitale pour le syst\u00e8me juridique dans son ensemble. Elle doit \u00eatre l\u2019objet d\u2019un contr\u00f4le selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte parce que les cours de justice, au moment d\u2019effectuer un contr\u00f4le selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable, ne peuvent donner l\u2019unique r\u00e9ponse d\u00e9finitive que n\u00e9cessitent de telles questions.\nEn l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il y a d\u00e9saccord avec la majorit\u00e9 pour dire que la m\u00eame conclusion s\u2019ensuit, peu importe que la norme de contr\u00f4le appliqu\u00e9e soit celle de la d\u00e9cision correcte ou celle de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable. Les motifs du Commissaire \u00e9taient intelligibles et transparents, et plusieurs facteurs pertinents militent en faveur de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation que le Commissaire a donn\u00e9e au par. 12(1). Le fait que la majorit\u00e9 serait parvenue \u00e0 une conclusion diff\u00e9rente ne rend pas la d\u00e9cision du Commissaire d\u00e9raisonnable. La cour de justice effectuant un contr\u00f4le selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable doit centrer son attention sur la d\u00e9cision m\u00eame qu\u2019a rendue le d\u00e9cideur administratif, notamment sur sa justification, et non sur la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle elle serait parvenue. La majorit\u00e9 n\u2019utilise pas cette m\u00e9thodologie en pratique.\nIl y a cependant accord avec l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation que la majorit\u00e9 donne \u00e0 la port\u00e9e du privil\u00e8ge du Cabinet, soit l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation correcte, et \u00e0 sa conclusion selon laquelle les lettres de mandat sont exemptes de divulgation en vertu du par. 12(1). L\u2019\u00ab objet des d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations \u00bb englobe le processus de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration du Cabinet du d\u00e9but \u00e0 la fin, notamment les directives et les grandes priorit\u00e9s communiqu\u00e9es par le premier ministre aux ministres. En concluant \u00e0 l\u2019effet contraire, le Commissaire a retenu une interpr\u00e9tation incorrecte.\nJurisprudence\nCit\u00e9e par la juge Karakatsanis\nArr\u00eat appliqu\u00e9 : Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration) c.

Introduction\n[1] La l\u00e9gislation sur l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information (AI) \u00e9tablit un \u00e9quilibre entre le besoin de savoir du public et la confidentialit\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire pour que l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif puisse gouverner efficacement. Les deux sont essentiels au bon fonctionnement de notre d\u00e9mocratie. Le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi porte sur l\u2019\u00e9quilibre entre ces deux principes fondamentaux.\n[2] L\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information favorise la transparence, la reddition de comptes et une participation significative du public. Sans une connaissance ad\u00e9quate de ce qui se passe, les l\u00e9gislateurs et le public ne peuvent ni obliger le gouvernement \u00e0 rendre des comptes, ni contribuer de mani\u00e8re significative \u00e0 la prise de d\u00e9cisions, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9laboration de politiques et \u00e0 l\u2019adoption de lois. Ainsi, la l\u00e9gislation en mati\u00e8re d\u2019AI vise non pas \u00e0 entraver le gouvernement, mais \u00e0 \u00ab am\u00e9liorer les rouages du gouvernement \u00bb en le rendant \u00ab plus efficace, plus r\u00e9ceptif et plus responsable \u00bb envers le pouvoir l\u00e9gislatif et le public (Dagg c. Canada (Ministre des Finances), [1997] 2 R.C.S. 403, par. 63).\n[3] Toutefois, dans notre r\u00e9gime de gouvernement de type Westminster, l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif \u2014 \u00e0 l\u2019instar des pouvoirs judiciaire et l\u00e9gislatif \u2014 a \u00e9galement besoin de certaines sph\u00e8res de confidentialit\u00e9 pour s\u2019acquitter de sa fonction constitutionnelle. Les pouvoirs ex\u00e9cutif, l\u00e9gislatif et judiciaire jouent tous \u00ab des r\u00f4les \u00e0 la fois cruciaux et compl\u00e9mentaires dans notre d\u00e9mocratie constitutionnelle \u00bb, et \u00ab un pouvoir ne peut jouer son r\u00f4le lorsqu\u2019un autre empi\u00e8te ind\u00fbment sur lui \u00bb (Ontario c. Criminal Lawyers\u2019 Association of Ontario, 2013 CSC 43, [2013] 3 R.C.S. 3, par. 29). Par cons\u00e9quent, les conventions constitutionnelles d\u00e9coulent de la s\u00e9paration des pouvoirs et prot\u00e8gent les sph\u00e8res de confidentialit\u00e9 requises pour qu\u2019une institution gouvernementale \u00ab s\u2019acquitt[e] des fonctions qui lui sont attribu\u00e9es par la Constitution \u00bb (Colombie\u2011Britannique (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Provincial Court Judges\u2019 Association of British Columbia, 2020 CSC 20, [2020] 2 R.C.S. 506 (B.C. Judges), par. 66). Tout comme le privil\u00e8ge l\u00e9gislatif prot\u00e8ge la capacit\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sentants \u00e9lus de donner suite \u00e0 la volont\u00e9 du peuple (Chagnon c. Syndicat de la fonction publique et parapublique du Qu\u00e9bec, 2018 CSC 39, [2018] 2 R.C.S. 687), et le secret du d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 pr\u00e9serve l\u2019ind\u00e9pendance du pouvoir judiciaire (MacKeigan c. Hickman, [1989] 2 R.C.S. 796, p. 830\u2011831), la confidentialit\u00e9 du Cabinet accorde \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif la latitude dont il a besoin pour gouverner de mani\u00e8re efficace et responsable sur le plan collectif (Babcock c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2002 CSC 57, [2002] 3 R.C.S. 3, par. 15). Le secret du Cabinet est \u00ab essentie[l] au bon gouvernement \u00bb (ibid.), car il favorise la transparence des d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations, la solidarit\u00e9 minist\u00e9rielle et l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 du gouvernement en prot\u00e9geant les d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du Cabinet (B.C. Judges, par. 95\u201197; Carey c. Ontario, [1986] 2 R.C.S. 637, p. 658\u2011659).\n[4] Toutes les lois sur l\u2019AI au Canada concilient ces deux objectifs essentiels en conf\u00e9rant au public un droit d\u2019acc\u00e8s g\u00e9n\u00e9ral aux renseignements d\u00e9tenus par le gouvernement, sous r\u00e9serve d\u2019exceptions ou d\u2019exclusions \u2014 notamment celles applicables aux documents ou aux renseignements confidentiels du Cabinet. Le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi met en jeu cet \u00e9quilibre en ce qui concerne l\u2019exception pr\u00e9vue pour les documents du Cabinet au par. 12(1) de la Loi sur l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information et la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e, L.R.O. 1990, c. F.31 (LAIPVP), de l\u2019Ontario. Le paragraphe 12(1) exempte une liste de documents, ainsi que tout autre document qui aurait pour effet de r\u00e9v\u00e9ler l\u2019\u00ab objet des d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations \u00bb du Cabinet ou de ses comit\u00e9s. L\u2019interpr\u00e9tation que le Commissaire \u00e0 l\u2019information et \u00e0 la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e de l\u2019Ontario (CIPVP ou Commissaire) donne \u00e0 l\u2019\u00ab objet des d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations \u00bb est au c\u0153ur de la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\n[5] Le litige en mati\u00e8re d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce tire son origine d\u2019une demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par un journaliste de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Radio\u2011Canada (SRC) pour consulter 23 lettres que le premier ministre de l\u2019Ontario a remises \u00e0 chacun de ses ministres peu apr\u00e8s avoir form\u00e9 le gouvernement en 2018 (Lettres). Ces Lettres, commun\u00e9ment appel\u00e9es des \u00ab lettres de mandat \u00bb, exposent les opinions du premier ministre sur les priorit\u00e9s strat\u00e9giques en pr\u00e9vision du mandat du gouvernement. Le Bureau du Cabinet a refus\u00e9 la demande du journaliste, pr\u00e9tendant que les Lettres \u00e9taient soustraites \u00e0 la divulgation en application du par. 12(1) de la LAIPVP.\n[6] La SRC a interjet\u00e9 appel au CIPVP, qui a conclu que les Lettres n\u2019\u00e9taient pas exempt\u00e9es et qui a ordonn\u00e9 leur divulgation (ordonnance PO\u20113973, 2019 CanLII 76037). Lors du contr\u00f4le judiciaire, la Cour divisionnaire de l\u2019Ontario a jug\u00e9 raisonnable la d\u00e9cision du CIPVP, et les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Ontario se sont dits du m\u00eame avis (2020 ONSC 5085, 93 Admin. L.R. (6th) 1; 2022 ONCA 74, 160 O.R. (3d) 481). Le juge Lauwers, dissident, a estim\u00e9 que la d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable pour plusieurs raisons, mais principalement parce qu\u2019elle \u00e9rodait la sph\u00e8re du privil\u00e8ge du Cabinet que le par. 12(1) vise \u00e0 pr\u00e9server.\n[7] Comme je l\u2019expliquerai, je conclus que la d\u00e9cision du CIPVP \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable. Le Commissaire a soigneusement examin\u00e9 le texte de la disposition l\u00e9gislative et a tenu compte de certains des objectifs de la confidentialit\u00e9 du Cabinet. Ses motifs \u00e9taient intelligibles et transparents. Il n\u2019a toutefois pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 ad\u00e9quatement le contexte juridique et factuel dans lequel fonctionne le par. 12(1) \u2014 en particulier les traditions et conventions constitutionnelles qui entourent la confidentialit\u00e9 et le processus d\u00e9cisionnel du Cabinet, y compris le r\u00f4le que joue le premier ministre dans ce processus. La confidentialit\u00e9 du Cabinet cr\u00e9e les conditions n\u00e9cessaires pour assurer un gouvernement efficace. Le Commissaire n\u2019a pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 une des principales raisons d\u2019\u00eatre de la convention : favoriser l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 du processus d\u00e9cisionnel collectif. Le fait qu\u2019il ne s\u2019est pas pench\u00e9 sur la dimension constitutionnelle plus large de la confidentialit\u00e9 du Cabinet l\u2019a amen\u00e9 \u00e0 adopter une interpr\u00e9tation trop \u00e9troite du par. 12(1). Il a exclu les \u00ab r\u00e9sultats \u00bb du processus de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration, sans \u00e9gard \u00e0 l\u2019incidence qu\u2019une divulgation pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e des priorit\u00e9s strat\u00e9giques au d\u00e9but du processus pourrait avoir sur le bon fonctionnement du gouvernement.\n[8] En outre, m\u00eame suivant l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du par. 12(1) que le Commissaire a donn\u00e9e, l\u2019application qu\u2019il a faite de la norme aux Lettres \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable. L\u2019affirmation du CIPVP selon laquelle les Lettres ne contiennent que des \u00ab sujets \u00bb ou des \u00ab r\u00e9sultats \u00bb finaux non exempt\u00e9s du processus de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration du premier ministre ne tenait pas compte du contexte plus large du processus de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration du Cabinet. Tout d\u2019abord, comme le premier ministre est chef du Cabinet, ses d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations ne peuvent \u00eatre artificiellement dissoci\u00e9es de celles du Cabinet. De plus, loin de constituer de simples \u00ab sujets \u00bb comme les points d\u2019un ordre du jour, les Lettres refl\u00e8tent les opinions du premier ministre sur l\u2019importance de certaines priorit\u00e9s strat\u00e9giques, et marquent le d\u00e9but d\u2019un processus fluide de formulation des politiques au sein du Cabinet. Les Lettres sont r\u00e9v\u00e9latrices de l\u2019objet des d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du Cabinet, tant \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue que lorsqu\u2019on les met en corr\u00e9lation avec ce que fait effectivement le gouvernement.\n[9] Je suis d\u2019avis d\u2019accueillir le pourvoi et d\u2019annuler la d\u00e9cision du CIPVP.\nII. Motifs du CIPVP\n[10] Devant le CIPVP, le Bureau du Cabinet a affirm\u00e9 que les Lettres devaient \u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9es pour trois raisons : (1) les Lettres avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 inscrites \u00e0 l\u2019ordre du jour de la premi\u00e8re r\u00e9union du Cabinet, remises \u00e0 chaque ministre durant la r\u00e9union, et les messages cl\u00e9s du premier ministre sur des initiatives strat\u00e9giques ont vraisemblablement \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9s \u00e0 cette r\u00e9union; (2) les Lettres r\u00e9v\u00e8lent les d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du premier ministre dans l\u2019\u00e9tablissement des priorit\u00e9s strat\u00e9giques du Cabinet, lesquelles font intrins\u00e8quement partie du processus de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration du Cabinet; (3) la divulgation des Lettres aurait pour effet de r\u00e9v\u00e9ler l\u2019objet de futures d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du Cabinet, car de multiples priorit\u00e9s \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans les Lettres doivent faire l\u2019objet de d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations par le Cabinet et ses comit\u00e9s avant leur mise en \u0153uvre (par. 26\u201129). Le Bureau du Cabinet a soutenu que la divulgation pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e d\u2019initiatives strat\u00e9giques pourrait compromettre une discussion libre et franche de ces initiatives lors des prochaines r\u00e9unions du Cabinet, et il a insist\u00e9 sur la pr\u00e9rogative du premier ministre [traduction] \u00ab de fixer la mani\u00e8re dont le gouvernement communiquera ses priorit\u00e9s strat\u00e9giques et le moment o\u00f9 il le fera \u00bb (par. 30 et 32).\n[11] Le CIPVP a estim\u00e9 que les Lettres n\u2019\u00e9taient pas prot\u00e9g\u00e9es par le par. 12(1), et il a ordonn\u00e9 leur divulgation. Le CIPVP a d\u2019abord examin\u00e9 l\u2019objectif de l\u2019exception applicable aux documents du Cabinet, eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 deux consid\u00e9rations qui justifient de pr\u00e9server la confidentialit\u00e9 des d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du Cabinet : la franchise et la solidarit\u00e9 minist\u00e9rielles. Selon lui, l\u2019objectif \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab de favoriser des discussions libres et franches entre les membres du Cabinet sur les enjeux qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient appel\u00e9s \u00e0 trancher, sans \u00eatre pr\u00e9occup\u00e9s de l\u2019effet paralysant que pourrait avoir la divulgation de leurs d\u00e9clarations ou des documents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquels ils d\u00e9lib\u00e8rent \u00bb (par. 86).\n[12] Le CIPVP a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019argument de la SRC selon lequel l\u2019expression \u00ab objet des d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations \u00bb devrait viser uniquement les documents r\u00e9v\u00e9lant une discussion des avantages et des inconv\u00e9nients d\u2019une d\u00e9marche. Il a reconnu que [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019exception peut s\u2019\u00e9tendre de mani\u00e8re plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale aux points de vue, opinions, r\u00e9flexions, id\u00e9es et pr\u00e9occupations des membres du Cabinet \u00bb exprim\u00e9s au cours du processus de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration et aux documents qui \u00ab devaient servir, ou qui ont servi, de [. . .] fondement pour les discussions du Cabinet dans son ensemble \u00bb (par. 98 et 113; voir aussi les par. 116, 119 et 131). Le CIPVP a fait remarquer qu\u2019en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, [traduction] \u00ab [l]e paragraphe 12(1) vise \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger les communications d\u00e9lib\u00e9ratives qui surviennent au cours \u00bb du processus d\u2019\u00e9laboration de politiques par le Cabinet, et non les \u00ab r\u00e9sultats \u00bb de ce processus (c.\u2011\u00e0\u2011d. les d\u00e9cisions elles\u2011m\u00eames) ou de simples \u00ab th\u00e8mes \u00bb ou \u00ab sujets \u00bb de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration (par. 92 et 104). Il a toutefois reconnu que des th\u00e8mes ou sujets sont exempt\u00e9s lorsque [traduction] \u00ab le contexte ou d\u2019autres renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires permettraient au lecteur de tirer des inf\u00e9rences justes \u00bb concernant des d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du Cabinet (par. 100, citant l\u2019ordonnance PO\u20111725, 1999 CanLII 14318 (C.I.P.V.P. Ont.), p. 16) Plus loin dans sa d\u00e9cision, le CIPVP s\u2019est appuy\u00e9 sur un pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent o\u00f9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019al. 12(1)a) pour statuer que les documents ne relevant pas des exceptions pr\u00e9cises \u00e9nonc\u00e9es aux al. 12(1)a) \u00e0 f) ne sont admissibles \u00e0 la protection que s\u2019il est probable que leur divulgation [traduction] \u00ab permettrait de tirer des inf\u00e9rences justes concernant de v\u00e9ritables d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du Cabinet lors d\u2019une r\u00e9union donn\u00e9e de celui\u2011ci \u00bb (par. 94, 101 et 121).\n[13] Appliquant ces constatations, le CIPVP a jug\u00e9 que les Lettres n\u2019\u00e9taient pas prot\u00e9g\u00e9es parce que rien ne tendait \u00e0 indiquer qu\u2019elles devaient servir, ou ont servi, de fondement pour les discussions du Cabinet dans son ensemble (par. 113\u2011114). Les Lettres font tout au plus \u00e9tat de sujets susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre abord\u00e9s au cours d\u2019une r\u00e9union du Cabinet, ou de sujets d\u2019initiatives strat\u00e9giques non pr\u00e9cis\u00e9es susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre examin\u00e9s lors de futures r\u00e9unions (par. 115 et 119). De plus, le CIPVP a jug\u00e9 qu\u2019au lieu de r\u00e9v\u00e9ler les points de vue, opinions, r\u00e9flexions, id\u00e9es et pr\u00e9occupations de ministres, les Lettres repr\u00e9sentaient [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019aboutissement de la formulation par le premier ministre des politiques et objectifs que doit atteindre chaque minist\u00e8re \u00bb \u2014 ou \u00ab le fruit de ses d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations \u00bb \u2014 et d\u00e9bordaient du cadre du par. 12(1) (par. 132 et 134; voir aussi par. 79).\nIII. Analyse\n[14] Le paragraphe 12(1) prot\u00e8ge la confidentialit\u00e9 des documents qui \u00ab aurai[ent] pour effet de r\u00e9v\u00e9ler l\u2019objet des d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du [Cabinet] \u00bb. Des exceptions semblables se trouvent dans les lois sur l\u2019AI partout au pays[1]. Selon la phrase liminaire du par. 12(1), \u00ab [l]a personne responsable refuse de divulguer un document qui aurait pour effet de r\u00e9v\u00e9ler l\u2019objet des d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations \u00bb du Cabinet ou de ses comit\u00e9s. Les diff\u00e9rents alin\u00e9as de la disposition prot\u00e8gent une liste de documents qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e0 satisfaire \u00e0 la norme \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans la phrase liminaire du par. 12(1) pour \u00eatre admissibles \u00e0 la protection. Le paragraphe 12(1) en entier est reproduit \u00e0 l\u2019annexe ci\u2011joint. Seule la phrase liminaire de la disposition est en litige.\n[15] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la seule question en litige est de savoir si le public peut consulter les lettres de mandat du premier ministre. La r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette question tient \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation que donne le CIPVP de la phrase liminaire du par. 12(1) et \u00e0 son application de cette interpr\u00e9tation aux faits. Les parties affirment que notre Cour devrait r\u00e9viser la d\u00e9cision du CIPVP en fonction de la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable. Nous ne sommes pas li\u00e9s par cette entente, car la \u00ab s\u00e9lection et l\u2019application d\u2019une norme de contr\u00f4le par le juge de r\u00e9vision sont assujetties \u00e0 la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte \u00bb (Office r\u00e9gional de la sant\u00e9 du Nord c. Horrocks, 2021 CSC 42, par. 10; Agraira c. Canada (S\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique et Protection civile), 2013 CSC 36, [2013] 2 R.C.S. 559, par. 45\u201147).\n[16] Nous constatons cependant que, devant les juridictions inf\u00e9rieures, l\u2019affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 plaid\u00e9e et tranch\u00e9e selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable. Le juge Lauwers, dissident en Cour d\u2019appel, a soulev\u00e9, sans les d\u00e9cider, des questions s\u00e9rieuses concernant l\u2019application en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce de la norme de contr\u00f4le fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9cision correcte, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 les conventions constitutionnelles ainsi que les traditions et pratiques connexes que met en jeu le par. 12(1) (par. 106\u2011108). En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la m\u00eame conclusion s\u2019impose, peu importe que la norme de contr\u00f4le soit celle de la d\u00e9cision correcte ou celle de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable. La sph\u00e8re de protection restreinte des d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du Cabinet cr\u00e9\u00e9e par l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation et l\u2019application du par. 12(1) par le CIPVP n\u2019est pas justifi\u00e9e, m\u00eame \u00e0 l\u2019aune de la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable, qui commande une plus grande d\u00e9f\u00e9rence. Compte tenu de cette conclusion et du fait que les parties n\u2019ont pas soulev\u00e9 la question de la norme de contr\u00f4le applicable devant notre Cour, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de trancher cette question de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9finitive en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. En cons\u00e9quence, nous ne commenterons pas la [traduction] \u00ab question \u00e9pineuse \u00bb soulev\u00e9e par le juge Lauwers (au par. 108), et nous proc\u00e9derons au contr\u00f4le sur la base de la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable.\n[17] Le contr\u00f4le en fonction de la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable s\u2019int\u00e9resse tant au raisonnement suivi par le d\u00e9cideur qu\u2019au r\u00e9sultat de la d\u00e9cision (Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration) c. Vavilov, 2019 CSC 65, [2019] 4 R.C.S. 653, par. 83\u201184). Une d\u00e9cision est raisonnable lorsque \u00ab justifi\u00e9e au regard de l\u2019ensemble du droit et des faits pertinents \u00bb; par cons\u00e9quent, les contextes juridique et factuel \u00ab constituent des contraintes qui ont une influence sur le d\u00e9cideur dans l\u2019exercice des pouvoirs qui lui sont d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s \u00bb (par. 105). Parmi les contraintes contextuelles pertinentes, il peut s\u2019agir \u00ab du r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif applicable et de tout autre principe l\u00e9gislatif ou principe de common law pertinent, des principes d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des lois, de la preuve port\u00e9e \u00e0 la connaissance du d\u00e9cideur [. . .], des observations des parties, des pratiques et d\u00e9cisions ant\u00e9rieures de l\u2019organisme administratif et, enfin, de l\u2019impact potentiel de la d\u00e9cision sur l\u2019individu \u00bb (par. 106).\n[18] Lors du contr\u00f4le selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable, le juge doit \u00ab \u00eatre attentif \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re dont le d\u00e9cideur administratif met \u00e0 profit son expertise \u00bb ainsi que \u00ab son exp\u00e9rience institutionnelle \u00bb (par. 93; voir aussi par. 232\u2011234). Le juge ne doit pas appr\u00e9cier \u00e0 nouveau la preuve prise en compte par le d\u00e9cideur, sauf si le d\u00e9cideur s\u2019est fondamentalement m\u00e9pris sur un certain aspect de la preuve ou n\u2019en a pas tenu compte (par. 125\u2011126). Le contr\u00f4le en fonction de la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable suppose donc une d\u00e9f\u00e9rence envers le d\u00e9cideur, et, dans l\u2019analyse qui suit, j\u2019examinerai les motifs fournis par le CIPVP \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des arguments des parties et du contexte de l\u2019instance.\n[19] Le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l\u2019Ontario appelant fait valoir que la d\u00e9cision du CIPVP \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable pour plusieurs raisons, notamment les suivantes : (1) l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation que le CIPVP donne du par. 12(1) ne cadre pas avec l\u2019objectif de l\u2019exception, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire accorder une large protection \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9 du Cabinet, dans le droit fil de la tradition et de la convention constitutionnelle; (2) le CIPVP a \u00e9tabli de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9raisonnable un crit\u00e8re plus rigoureux pour le par. 12(1) en exigeant la preuve que les Lettres se rapportaient \u00e0 de \u00ab v\u00e9ritables d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du Cabinet lors d\u2019une r\u00e9union donn\u00e9e de celui\u2011ci \u00bb; (3) le CIPVP a conclu \u00e0 tort que les Lettres n\u2019\u00e9taient pas exempt\u00e9es parce qu\u2019elles constituaient des \u00ab r\u00e9sultats \u00bb du processus de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration du premier ministre, ou de simples \u00ab sujets \u00bb et \u00ab th\u00e8mes \u00bb des r\u00e9unions du Cabinet.\n[20] La SRC intim\u00e9e cherche \u00e0 faire confirmer la d\u00e9cision du CIPVP, faisant remarquer que ce dernier \u00e9tait conscient de l\u2019objectif de l\u2019exception et qu\u2019il a raisonnablement conclu que la divulgation des Lettres n\u2019entraverait pas la r\u00e9alisation de cet objectif. La SRC soutient que la d\u00e9cision du CIPVP ne reposait pas sur le point de savoir s\u2019il y avait eu de \u00ab v\u00e9ritables \u00bb d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations lors d\u2019une r\u00e9union \u00ab donn\u00e9e \u00bb du Cabinet. Elle \u00e9tait plut\u00f4t fond\u00e9e sur une insuffisance de preuve montrant que les Lettres auraient pour effet de r\u00e9v\u00e9ler l\u2019objet de n\u2019importe quelles d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations tenues lors de n\u2019importe quelle r\u00e9union du Cabinet. Toujours selon la SRC, le CIPVP a reconnu que les \u00ab r\u00e9sultats \u00bb du processus de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration peuvent \u00eatre exempt\u00e9s s\u2019ils permettraient de tirer des inf\u00e9rences justes concernant l\u2019objet de d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du Cabinet, et il a raisonnablement conclu que les Lettres ne r\u00e9pondaient pas \u00e0 ce crit\u00e8re. Comme le requiert le processus \u00e9tabli par la loi, la SRC a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 ses observations sans avoir vu les Lettres, lesquelles n\u2019avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9es qu\u2019au CIPVP et aux juges si\u00e9geant en r\u00e9vision en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[21] Comme je l\u2019expliquerai, je conviens avec le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l\u2019Ontario que le Commissaire ne s\u2019est pas pench\u00e9 ad\u00e9quatement sur le contexte juridique et factuel g\u00e9n\u00e9ral au moment d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter le par. 12(1). En cons\u00e9quence, il a rejet\u00e9 d\u00e9raisonnablement les arguments du Bureau du Cabinet au sujet de l\u2019incidence qu\u2019aurait la divulgation des Lettres sur les d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du Cabinet. Les contraintes juridiques et factuelles qui jouent sur le par. 12(1) impliquent des traditions et conventions constitutionnelles qui r\u00e9gissent la confidentialit\u00e9 et le processus de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration du Cabinet. Vu le caract\u00e8re essentiel de ces traditions et conventions pour le bon fonctionnement de notre d\u00e9mocratie, il \u00e9tait vital que la d\u00e9cision du CIPVP tienne valablement compte de ce contexte. Le d\u00e9faut du CIPVP d\u2019en tenir compte l\u2019a amen\u00e9 \u00e0 retenir une interpr\u00e9tation d\u00e9raisonnablement \u00e9troite du par. 12(1) et \u00e0 mal qualifier les Lettres elles\u2011m\u00eames.\n[22] Je proc\u00e9derai en \u00e9valuant le caract\u00e8re raisonnable de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation donn\u00e9e par le CIPVP au par. 12(1) au regard de la l\u00e9gislation et de la toile de fond juridique de la confidentialit\u00e9 du Cabinet. J\u2019\u00e9valuerai ensuite la qualification des Lettres par le Commissaire eu \u00e9gard au contexte \u00e9voqu\u00e9 par le Bureau du Cabinet au sujet du processus de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration et du r\u00f4le du premier ministre.\nA. L\u2019interpr\u00e9tation donn\u00e9e par le CIPVP au par. 12(1)\n[23] Une d\u00e9cision raisonnable est justifi\u00e9e au regard des aspects importants du texte, du contexte et de l\u2019objet de la loi, suivant le principe moderne en mati\u00e8re d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des lois (Vavilov, par. 117\u2011122). Il est peu probable que l\u2019omission mineure d\u2019un certain \u00e9l\u00e9ment du texte, du contexte ou de l\u2019objet permette de juger la d\u00e9cision d\u00e9raisonnable. N\u00e9anmoins, le tribunal interviendra si \u00ab l\u2019aspect omis de l\u2019analyse am\u00e8ne la cour de r\u00e9vision \u00e0 perdre confiance dans le r\u00e9sultat auquel est arriv\u00e9 le d\u00e9cideur \u00bb (par. 122).\n[24] \u00c0 mon avis, la d\u00e9cision du CIPVP t\u00e9moigne d\u2019une prise en compte soign\u00e9e du texte du par. 12(1) \u2014 par exemple, le CIPVP a pris note du sens des mots \u00ab objet \u00bb, \u00ab d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations \u00bb, \u00ab notamment \u00bb et \u00ab aurait pour effet \u00bb qui figurent dans la disposition (par. 9, 90\u201197 et 111). Le CIPVP a \u00e9galement not\u00e9 l\u2019objectif g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des lois sur l\u2019AI de faciliter la d\u00e9mocratie (par. 106), et a tenu compte de deux des objectifs de la confidentialit\u00e9 du Cabinet : la franchise et la solidarit\u00e9 (par. 87). Mais le CIPVP n\u2019a pas port\u00e9 attention au contexte juridique important qui entoure l\u2019exception et doit guider l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de son objet de de son texte. Ce manquement a amen\u00e9 le CIPVP \u00e0 adopter une interpr\u00e9tation trop \u00e9troite de l\u2019objet et de la port\u00e9e de l\u2019exception.\n[25] D\u2019apr\u00e8s les parties, les objets qui sous\u2011tendent la loi \u00e9taient des consid\u00e9rations cl\u00e9s pour l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation qu\u2019a fait le CIPVP du par. 12(1). La LAIPVP a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e en 1987 sur le fondement de recommandations faites en 1980 par la Commission de l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information et de la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e de l\u2019Ontario, pr\u00e9sid\u00e9e par le commissaire D. Carlton Williams. Comme l\u2019a fait observer le CIPVP, la LAIPVP cr\u00e9e un droit g\u00e9n\u00e9ral d\u2019acc\u00e8s du public \u00e0 l\u2019information gouvernementale, sous r\u00e9serve d\u2019exceptions n\u00e9cessaires qui sont restreintes et pr\u00e9cises (par. 107, citant l\u2019al. 1a)).\n[26] Il appert du contexte l\u00e9gislatif que l\u2019exception de la LAIPVP visant les documents du Cabinet constituait une partie cruciale de l\u2019\u00e9quilibre \u00e9tabli par le l\u00e9gislateur entre l\u2019acc\u00e8s du public \u00e0 l\u2019information et les sph\u00e8res n\u00e9cessaires de confidentialit\u00e9 au sein du gouvernement (voir Assembl\u00e9e l\u00e9gislative de l\u2019Ontario, Journal des d\u00e9bats (Hansard), no 21, 1re sess., 33e l\u00e9g., 12 juillet 1985, p. 753\u2011755) (hon. Ian G. Scott) (reconnaissant que la LAIPVP exigeait un [traduction] \u00ab \u00e9quilibre \u00bb entre des int\u00e9r\u00eats oppos\u00e9s et que l\u2019exception visant les documents du Cabinet prot\u00e9geait les \u00ab institutions centrales du gouvernement repr\u00e9sentatif \u00bb)). En envisageant l\u2019adoption d\u2019une loi sur l\u2019AI en Ontario, la commission Williams a reconnu dans son rapport officiel que les changements aux pratiques d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information gouvernementale devaient \u00eatre compatibles avec les traditions de la province et les conventions constitutionnelles li\u00e9es au fonctionnement efficace du Cabinet (Commission on Freedom of Information and Individual Privacy, Public Government for Private People : The Report of the Commission on Freedom of Information and Individual Privacy (1980) (rapport Williams), p. 83 et 85).\n[27] La confidentialit\u00e9 du Cabinet est prot\u00e9g\u00e9e non seulement par voie l\u00e9gislative, mais \u00e9galement par convention constitutionnelle, soit les r\u00e8gles de conduite \u00e9tablies par les institutions gouvernementales qui ne sont pas appliqu\u00e9es par les tribunaux mais qui sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme obligatoires par ceux et celles qui mettent en \u0153uvre la Constitution (A. Heard, Canadian Constitutional Conventions : The Marriage of Law & Politics (2e \u00e9d. 2014), p. 5; voir aussi Renvoi : R\u00e9solution pour modifier la Constitution, [1981] 1 R.C.S. 753, p. 880). Puisque le par. 12(1) vise \u00e0 pr\u00e9server le secret du processus de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration du Cabinet, la dimension constitutionnelle du secret du Cabinet \u00e9tait un \u00e9l\u00e9ment contextuel crucial dans l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du par. 12(1).\n[28] Dans notre d\u00e9mocratie constitutionnelle, la confidentialit\u00e9 des d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du Cabinet est une condition pr\u00e9alable au gouvernement responsable, car elle permet la responsabilit\u00e9 minist\u00e9rielle collective. Le gouvernement responsable est un principe fondamental de notre r\u00e9gime de gouvernement (SEFPO c. Ontario (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), [1987] 2 R.C.S. 2, p. 38) et la [traduction] \u00ab caract\u00e9ristique non f\u00e9d\u00e9rale la plus importante de la Constitution canadienne \u00bb (P. W. Hogg et W. K. Wright, Constitutional Law of Canada (5e \u00e9d. suppl.), \u00a7 9:3). Le gouvernement est \u00ab responsable \u00bb en ce sens que l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif doit rendre des comptes \u00e0 l\u2019assembl\u00e9e l\u00e9gislative et garder sa confiance (\u00a7 9:1; Heard, p. 90). Les ministres du Cabinet sont \u00e0 la fois individuellement responsables de leur propre conduite et de leurs minist\u00e8res respectifs, et collectivement responsables de la politique et de l\u2019action gouvernementales (G. White, Cabinets and First Ministers (2005), p. 15\u201116).\n[29] Le secret du Cabinet d\u00e9coule de la dimension collective de la responsabilit\u00e9 minist\u00e9rielle (Y. Campagnolo, \u00ab The Political Legitimacy of Cabinet Secrecy \u00bb (2017), 51 R.J.T.U.M. 51, p. 59). La responsabilit\u00e9 minist\u00e9rielle collective exige que les ministres puissent s\u2019exprimer librement au moment de d\u00e9lib\u00e9rer sans craindre que leurs propos fassent l\u2019objet d\u2019un examen public (motifs du CIPVP, par. 86\u201187 et 97). Cela s\u2019impose pour que les ministres ne se censurent pas lors d\u2019un d\u00e9bat sur une politique, et qu\u2019ils puissent \u00eatre solidaires en public, et soient tenus responsables collectivement, d\u00e8s qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision de politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale est prise et annonc\u00e9e. Les auteurs appellent ces objectifs les consid\u00e9rations de [traduction] \u00ab franchise \u00bb et de \u00ab solidarit\u00e9 \u00bb qui justifient la confidentialit\u00e9 du Cabinet (voir Campagnolo (2017), p. 66\u201172). \u00c0 la base, la confidentialit\u00e9 du Cabinet favorise la reddition de comptes de l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif en permettant les d\u00e9saccords priv\u00e9s et la franchise dans les d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations minist\u00e9rielles, malgr\u00e9 la solidarit\u00e9 publique (ibid.; voir aussi N. d\u2019Ombrain, \u00ab Cabinet secrecy \u00bb (2004), 47 Admin. pub. Can. 332, p. 336).\n[30] Les auteurs parlent \u00e9galement d\u2019une troisi\u00e8me raison d\u2019\u00eatre de la convention relative \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9 du Cabinet : elle favorise l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 du processus d\u00e9cisionnel collectif (voir Campagnolo (2017), p. 68). Le secret du Cabinet favorise donc la franchise, la solidarit\u00e9 et l\u2019efficacit\u00e9, tout cela pour contribuer \u00e0 un gouvernement efficace. Cet objectif est \u00e9galement refl\u00e9t\u00e9 dans la jurisprudence de notre Cour. Dans Carey, notre Cour a fait remarquer que l\u2019objet m\u00eame de la confidentialit\u00e9 est le bon fonctionnement du gouvernement (p. 664, 670\u2011671 et 673). Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Babcock, la juge en chef McLachlin a affirm\u00e9 : \u00ab La confidentialit\u00e9 des d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du Cabinet est essentielle au bon gouvernement \u00bb (par. 15). Et dans Untel c. Ontario (Finances), 2014 CSC 36, [2014] 2 R.C.S. 3, notre Cour a soulign\u00e9 que la communication aux journalistes ou aux opposants politiques de priorit\u00e9s strat\u00e9giques \u00e0 un stade pr\u00e9coce du processus de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration \u00ab [est un] mat\u00e9riau hautement inflammable [qui] pourrait facilement alimenter un brasier capable de d\u00e9truire rapidement la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 du gouvernement \u00bb (par. 44, citant Conseil canadien des \u0153uvres de charit\u00e9 chr\u00e9tiennes c. Canada (Ministre des Finances), [1999] 4 C.F. 245, par. 31).\n[31] Par cons\u00e9quent, la confidentialit\u00e9 du Cabinet n\u2019est [traduction] \u00ab pas seulement un exp\u00e9dient politique commode; elle est essentielle \u00e0 un gouvernement efficace \u00bb (voir White, p. 139; voir aussi p. 138). Notre jurisprudence s\u2019attache en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00e0 la valeur que repr\u00e9sente le secret des d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations pour le fonctionnement efficace des institutions gouvernementales, notamment le Cabinet. Elle reconna\u00eet \u00e9galement qu\u2019une trop grande transparence risque de nuire \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation de cet objectif (voir Babcock, par. 18; Ontario (S\u00fbret\u00e9 et S\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique) c. Criminal Lawyers\u2019 Association, 2010 CSC 23, [2010] 1 R.C.S. 815 (Criminal Lawyers\u2019 Association 2010), par. 40; B.C. Judges, par. 96; voir aussi Untel, par. 44; rapport Williams, p. 235).\n[32] Le CIPVP a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il saisissait l\u2019importance des consid\u00e9rations de franchise et de solidarit\u00e9 qui justifient la confidentialit\u00e9 du Cabinet, citant l\u2019arr\u00eat Babcock de notre Cour (voir par. 87). Le CIPVP a tenu compte de ces consid\u00e9rations quand il a affirm\u00e9 que le par. 12(1) avait pour objectif de [traduction] \u00ab favoriser des discussions libres et franches entre les membres du Cabinet sur les enjeux qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient appel\u00e9s \u00e0 trancher, sans \u00eatre pr\u00e9occup\u00e9s de l\u2019effet paralysant que pourrait avoir la divulgation de leurs d\u00e9clarations ou des documents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquels ils d\u00e9lib\u00e8rent \u00bb (par. 86). Mais l\u2019examen par le CIPVP de la convention relative \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9 du Cabinet s\u2019est essentiellement arr\u00eat\u00e9 l\u00e0 (voir par. 87). Malgr\u00e9 les arguments du Bureau du Cabinet selon lesquels la divulgation des Lettres de mandat pourrait nuire \u00e0 l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 du processus d\u00e9cisionnel du Cabinet (d.a., vol. III, p. 101\u2011102), le Commissaire n\u2019a pas trait\u00e9 d\u2019un objectif principal du secret du Cabinet \u2014 promouvoir l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 de la prise de d\u00e9cisions collective \u2014, ni du but ultime de cette convention constitutionnelle : un gouvernement efficace. Il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un \u00e9l\u00e9ment contextuel capital pour l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du par. 12(1).\n[33] Certes, la franchise et la solidarit\u00e9 minist\u00e9rielles sont des composantes d\u2019un gouvernement efficace, mais ce ne sont que des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de l\u2019assise sur laquelle reposent la confidentialit\u00e9 du Cabinet et l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 gouvernementale \u2014 et donc du contexte juridique dans lequel op\u00e8re le par. 12(1). Il \u00e9tait par cons\u00e9quent crucial que, pour interpr\u00e9ter raisonnablement la phrase liminaire du par. 12(1), le CIPVP tienne pleinement compte de la fonction exerc\u00e9e par le Cabinet dans notre r\u00e9gime de gouvernement, et des limites de la confidentialit\u00e9 dont il a besoin pour s\u2019acquitter efficacement de cette fonction (voir Criminal Lawyers\u2019 Association 2010, par. 40; motifs de la C.A., par. 163). Le d\u00e9faut du CIPVP d\u2019en tenir compte \u00e9tait pertinent. Il l\u2019a amen\u00e9 : (1) \u00e0 attribuer un objectif trop \u00e9troit au par. 12(1); et (2) \u00e0 n\u00e9gliger des arguments importants pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par le Bureau du Cabinet qui \u00e9clairaient la port\u00e9e de l\u2019exception.\n[34] Premi\u00e8rement, si le CIPVP avait reconnu que le secret des d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations vise fondamentalement \u00e0 assurer un gouvernement efficace, il n\u2019aurait pas pu \u00e9noncer l\u2019objectif comme \u00e9tant simplement de permettre \u00ab des discussions libres et franches entre les membres du Cabinet \u00bb. Comme l\u2019a fait remarquer le juge Lauwers, une interpr\u00e9tation contextuelle du par. 12(1) indique plut\u00f4t que la disposition vise, de fa\u00e7on plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, \u00e0 instaurer la confidentialit\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire au fonctionnement efficace de l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif (par. 187 et 208).\n[35] Deuxi\u00e8mement, si le CIPVP avait formul\u00e9 l\u2019objectif du par. 12(1) en des termes plus larges, il n\u2019aurait peut\u2011\u00eatre pas rejet\u00e9 un argument central du Bureau du Cabinet qui int\u00e9resse la port\u00e9e du par. 12(1). Le Bureau du Cabinet a fait valoir qu\u2019en plus d\u2019assurer la franchise et la solidarit\u00e9 minist\u00e9rielles, le secret du Cabinet contribue \u00e9galement \u00e0 garantir le d\u00e9roulement efficace du processus de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration en pr\u00e9servant la confidentialit\u00e9 des d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive soit prise et annonc\u00e9e (motifs du CIPVP, par. 30\u201132; d.a., vol. III, p. 90, 101\u2011102, 228 et 232). Devant notre Cour, le Bureau du Cabinet et l\u2019intervenante l\u2019Association canadienne des libert\u00e9s civiles ont fait valoir que la convention relative au secret du Cabinet a pour objet l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 du processus de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration (m.a., par. 11 et 54; m. interv., par. 7\u20118). Cet argument repose sur la troisi\u00e8me raison d\u2019\u00eatre de la convention relative au secret du Cabinet. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Conway c. Rimmer, [1968] A.C. 910 (H.L.), p. 952, lord Reid a donn\u00e9 une c\u00e9l\u00e8bre explication de la valeur que repr\u00e9sente la confidentialit\u00e9 du Cabinet pour l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 du gouvernement, en tenant des propos cit\u00e9s avec approbation par notre Cour dans Carey, p. 658\u2011659 :\n[La divulgation pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e de secrets du Cabinet] [. . .] susciterait ou attiserait des critiques publiques ou politiques mal fond\u00e9es ou sp\u00e9cieuses. Il est d\u00e9j\u00e0 assez difficile de gouverner et aucun gouvernement ne pourrait envisager avec \u00e9quanimit\u00e9 que les rouages internes de l\u2019appareil gouvernemental soient expos\u00e9s au regard de ceux qui sont pr\u00eats \u00e0 critiquer sans pourtant poss\u00e9der une connaissance suffisante des faits et qui agissent peut\u2011\u00eatre dans leur int\u00e9r\u00eat personnel.\n[36] La pr\u00e9rogative de d\u00e9cider de l\u2019occasion et de la mani\u00e8re d\u2019annoncer des d\u00e9cisions du Cabinet repose sur l\u2019incidence pr\u00e9judiciable que pourrait avoir la divulgation pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e de priorit\u00e9s strat\u00e9giques sur le processus de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration. Comme l\u2019explique le professeur Campagnolo, selon la convention \u00e9tablie, l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 du processus de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration justifie \u00ab la confidentialit\u00e9 des d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du Cabinet avant qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision finale soit prise et rendue publique par les ministres \u00bb (Le secret minist\u00e9riel : Th\u00e9orie et pratique (2020), p. 37). Rendre public le processus d\u00e9cisionnel du Cabinet avant la formulation et l\u2019annonce d\u2019une d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive \u00ab accro\u00eetr[ait] la pression publique exerc\u00e9e sur les ministres par les parties prenantes et susciter[ait] des critiques partisanes de la part d\u2019opposants politiques \u00bb; cet examen attentif \u00ab aurait pour effet de paralyser le processus d\u00e9cisionnel collectif \u00bb (p. 37).\n[37] \u00c9tant que, dans une large mesure, le CIPVP ne s\u2019est pas pench\u00e9 sur cet argument important, il n\u2019a pas trait\u00e9 de l\u2019observation du Bureau du Cabinet suivant lequel le fait de d\u00e9cider [traduction] \u00ab quand et comment \u00bb communiquer des priorit\u00e9s strat\u00e9giques au public et aux partis d\u2019opposition est en soi une partie importante du processus de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration du Cabinet (d.a., vol. III, p. 103 (je souligne); voir aussi White, p. 22\u201123). Les documents qu\u2019on pr\u00e9sente au Cabinet pour lui demander de trancher un enjeu de politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale comprennent invariablement une strat\u00e9gie de communication, laquelle doit elle aussi faire l\u2019objet de d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations au sein du Cabinet et recevoir son approbation (voir, p. ex., Bureau du Conseil priv\u00e9, Guide de r\u00e9daction des documents du Cabinet (2013), p. 6\u20117, 11\u201112 et 29). Le Cabinet peut charger des ministres des communications publiques li\u00e9es \u00e0 leur portefeuille respectif. En outre, selon la tradition, le Cabinet fait souvent des annonces importantes de d\u00e9cisions de politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e l\u00e9gislative (rapport Williams, p. 286).\n[38] C\u2019est ce qui s\u2019est produit en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Le jour suivant la remise des Lettres aux ministres, la lieutenante\u2011gouverneure a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 le discours du Tr\u00f4ne du nouveau gouvernement devant l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e l\u00e9gislative de l\u2019Ontario, et y a expos\u00e9 le programme du gouvernement en vue de la session l\u00e9gislative (Cabinet du premier ministre, Un gouvernement pour la population : Discours du Tr\u00f4ne, 12 juillet 2018 (en ligne)). Certaines priorit\u00e9s strat\u00e9giques identifi\u00e9es dans les Lettres ont \u00e9t\u00e9 annonc\u00e9es, tandis que d\u2019autres sont rest\u00e9es confidentielles. Les priorit\u00e9s qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 annonc\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9es en des termes tr\u00e8s g\u00e9n\u00e9raux qui ne refl\u00e9taient pas n\u00e9cessairement la description qui en \u00e9tait faite dans les Lettres. Le d\u00e9sir du gouvernement de rendre une information publique n\u2019est clairement pas pertinent pour ce qui est de la question de savoir si cette information est prot\u00e9g\u00e9e. Cependant, cela d\u00e9montre que l\u2019objet des d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du Cabinet englobe aussi les discussions concernant le quand et le comment de la communication des priorit\u00e9s du gouvernement.\n[39] L\u2019omission d\u2019aborder de mani\u00e8re significative les arguments du Bureau du Cabinet au sujet des bases fondamentales de la confidentialit\u00e9 du Cabinet a eu des cons\u00e9quences sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation donn\u00e9e par le CIPVP \u00e0 la port\u00e9e du par. 12(1). Le CIPVP a conclu que les \u00ab r\u00e9sultats \u00bb du processus de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration ne sont pas vis\u00e9s par la phrase liminaire du par. 12(1), point \u00e0 la ligne, sans reconna\u00eetre qu\u2019une part importante de la confidentialit\u00e9 du Cabinet est la pr\u00e9rogative du gouvernement de d\u00e9cider de l\u2019occasion et de la mani\u00e8re d\u2019annoncer des priorit\u00e9s strat\u00e9giques (voir par. 104). Comme le CIPVP a finalement qualifi\u00e9 les Lettres de r\u00e9sultats ou de fruits non exempt\u00e9s du processus de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration du premier ministre, tel qu\u2019il est expliqu\u00e9 ci\u2011dessous, cette omission \u00e9tait importante.\n[40] Tel que l\u2019indique clairement l\u2019arr\u00eat Vavilov, le d\u00e9faut de s\u2019attaquer de mani\u00e8re significative aux arguments principaux formul\u00e9s par les parties est un indicateur qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision est d\u00e9raisonnable (par. 128); il est en outre d\u00e9raisonnable de faire abstraction d\u2019un aspect important du contexte l\u00e9gislatif lorsque le d\u00e9cideur aurait pu parvenir \u00e0 une interpr\u00e9tation diff\u00e9rente s\u2019il avait pris en compte l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment cl\u00e9 (par. 122).\nB. L\u2019application par le CIPVP du par. 12(1) aux Lettres\n[41] En se demandant de quelle mani\u00e8re l\u2019exception s\u2019appliquait aux Lettres, le CIPVP n\u2019a pas non plus, dans ses motifs, trait\u00e9 suffisamment des conventions et traditions importantes qui entourent le processus d\u00e9cisionnel du Cabinet, y compris le r\u00f4le que joue le premier ministre dans ce processus.\n[42] Devant le CIPVP, le Bureau du Cabinet a invoqu\u00e9 un pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent du CIPVP reconnaissant que les conventions constitutionnelles touchant le premier ministre rendent sa fonction d\u2019\u00e9tablir les priorit\u00e9s et le programme du Cabinet indissociable des d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du Cabinet (d.a., vol. III, p. 92\u201194, citant l\u2019ordonnance PO\u20111725). De plus, en soutenant que la divulgation des Lettres aurait pour effet de r\u00e9v\u00e9ler l\u2019objet de futures d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du Cabinet, le Bureau du Cabinet a insist\u00e9 sur le fait qu\u2019\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 les conventions et la pratique, [traduction] \u00ab bon nombre des priorit\u00e9s strat\u00e9giques confi\u00e9es \u00e0 chaque ministre dans les lettres de mandat obligeront chaque ministre \u00e0 \u00e9laborer une proposition op\u00e9rationnelle, l\u00e9gislative ou de politique financi\u00e8re qui serait renvoy\u00e9e au [Cabinet] et \u00e0 ses comit\u00e9s pour d\u00e9cision avant sa mise en \u0153uvre \u00bb (d.a., vol. III., p. 100). Le Bureau du Cabinet a fait valoir que les d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations se d\u00e9roulent [traduction] \u00ab en continu \u00bb et que les Lettres de mandat \u00ab amorcent un processus de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration continu au Cabinet qui va forc\u00e9ment au\u2011del\u00e0 de la premi\u00e8re r\u00e9union de celui\u2011ci \u00bb (motifs du CIPVP, par. 27).\n[43] Selon le CIPVP, les Lettres n\u2019\u00e9taient pas r\u00e9v\u00e9latrices des d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du premier ministre ou de futures d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du Cabinet. Le Commissaire a conclu que les Lettres ne divulguaient pas l\u2019objet des d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du premier ministre, car elles constituaient l\u2019\u00ab aboutissement \u00bb ou le \u00ab fruit \u00bb de son processus de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration. En ce qui a trait aux futures d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du Cabinet, le CIPVP a mentionn\u00e9 que le document qui n\u2019appartient pas aux cat\u00e9gories pr\u00e9cises de documents \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es aux al. 12(1)a) \u00e0 f) ne sera prot\u00e9g\u00e9 que [traduction] \u00ab si [. . .] le contexte ou des renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires permettraient de tirer des inf\u00e9rences justes concernant de v\u00e9ritables d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du Cabinet lors d\u2019une r\u00e9union donn\u00e9e de celui\u2011ci \u00bb (par. 110).\n[44] Je conviens avec la SRC que, d\u2019apr\u00e8s une interpr\u00e9tation lib\u00e9rale des motifs, le CIPVP n\u2019a pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que le processus de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration s\u2019entendait uniquement des discussions tenues lors d\u2019une r\u00e9union donn\u00e9e du Cabinet. Le CIPVP a n\u00e9anmoins rejet\u00e9 l\u2019argument du Bureau du Cabinet suivant lequel les Lettres amorcent un processus de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration continu en partie parce que le Bureau du Cabinet n\u2019avait pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les priorit\u00e9s examin\u00e9es dans les Lettres feraient l\u2019objet de discussions lors d\u2019une future r\u00e9union du Cabinet (par. 116). Pour ce qui est de ces priorit\u00e9s qui, a convenu le CIPVP, seraient renvoy\u00e9es au Cabinet, le CIPVP a conclu qu\u2019elles n\u2019\u00e9taient pas exempt\u00e9es parce qu\u2019elles \u00e9taient de simples sujets qui ne r\u00e9v\u00e9laient pas l\u2019objet des d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations.\n[45] \u00c0 mon avis, le raisonnement qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de et les conclusions qu\u2019a tir\u00e9es le Commissaire \u00e0 propos des Lettres ne sont pas d\u00e9fendables, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 deux principales contraintes contextuelles : la nature du processus d\u00e9cisionnel du Cabinet et la fonction exerc\u00e9e par le premier ministre \u00e0 titre de chef du Cabinet dans ce processus. Ces conventions constitutionnelles vont \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du raisonnement du CIPVP. Je m\u2019explique.\n[46] Tout d\u2019abord, le processus de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration du Cabinet consiste en des discussions, des consultations et la formulation de politiques auxquelles participent le premier ministre, les ministres et le Cabinet dans son ensemble \u2014 appuy\u00e9s par les conseils fournis par les fonctionnaires tout au long du processus. Le premier ministre, en qualit\u00e9 de chef du Cabinet, jouit de vastes pouvoirs dans le processus de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration du Cabinet suivant la convention. \u00c0 bien des \u00e9gards, la fonction et les activit\u00e9s du premier ministre sont indissociables du Cabinet et de ses d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations. Le premier ministre pr\u00e9side le Cabinet, en fixe les ordres du jour, en choisit les membres et \u00e9tablit sa structure interne (p. ex. le nombre, la nature et la composition des comit\u00e9s du Cabinet), fixe ses proc\u00e9dures, et il a le droit de constater le consensus et de d\u00e9terminer ce qu\u2019a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 le Cabinet (Hogg et Wright, \u00a7 9:5\u20119:6).\n[47] Comme l\u2019a reconnu notre Cour dans Untel, \u00ab le processus d\u2019\u00e9laboration des politiques s\u2019accompagne de faux d\u00e9parts, d\u2019impasses, de mauvais virages, de changements d\u2019orientation, de demandes [de conseils] ult\u00e9rieurement rejet\u00e9s, de r\u00e9\u00e9valuations des priorit\u00e9s et de repond\u00e9ration de l\u2019importance relative des facteurs pertinents au fur et \u00e0 mesure de l\u2019analyse du probl\u00e8me \u00bb (par. 44, citant Conseil canadien des \u0153uvres de charit\u00e9 chr\u00e9tiennes, par. 31). Autrement dit, le processus est dynamique, fluide, et continue d\u2019\u00e9voluer au gr\u00e9 des changements de pouvoir. Le Cabinet jouit d\u2019une grande marge de man\u0153uvre au chapitre de son organisation, de ses processus et de sa composition (White, p. 34).\n[48] L\u2019\u00e9tablissement du programme, \u00e9tape qui survient t\u00f4t, est [traduction] \u00ab une partie vitale \u00bb du processus d\u00e9cisionnel (S. Brooks, Canadian Democracy (9e \u00e9d. 2020), p. 241). Le r\u00f4le jou\u00e9 par le premier ministre et le Cabinet dans l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de la politique et des priorit\u00e9s budg\u00e9taires du gouvernement [traduction] \u00ab est institutionnalis\u00e9 au moyen de la structure officielle du processus d\u00e9cisionnel du cabinet \u00bb (ibid.). Bien que les processus de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration aient chang\u00e9 au fil du temps tant au palier provincial que f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, la fonction essentielle de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement du programme et la participation centrale du premier ministre \u00e0 cette entreprise sont demeur\u00e9es inchang\u00e9es.\n[49] Le caract\u00e8re dynamique et fluide du processus de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration du Cabinet implique \u00e9galement que les stades du processus ne surviennent pas tous autour de la table du Cabinet derri\u00e8re une porte close. Le processus d\u00e9cisionnel au sein du Cabinet s\u2019\u00e9tend au\u2011del\u00e0 des r\u00e9unions officielles de celui\u2011ci ou de ses comit\u00e9s, et englobe [traduction] \u00ab [l]es conversations \u00e0 deux dans les corridors [. . .], dans le bureau [du premier ministre] [. . .], au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, ou quelle que soit la mani\u00e8re dont elles peuvent survenir et leur lieu \u00bb (Brooks, p. 242). Comme l\u2019\u00e9crit le professeur Brooks, [traduction] \u00ab [a]ucun organigramme ne peut illustrer cet aspect informel mais crucial \u00bb du processus de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration, ni le caract\u00e8re central du r\u00f4le du premier ministre dans celui\u2011ci (ibid.).\n[50] Le CIPVP a visiblement reconnu le r\u00f4le que joue le premier ministre dans le processus d\u00e9cisionnel du Cabinet, citant un pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent du CIPVP qui reconnaissait que, [traduction] \u00ab en raison de la fonction unique qu\u2019exerce le premier ministre en fixant les priorit\u00e9s et en supervisant l\u2019\u00e9laboration des politiques ainsi que les programmes l\u00e9gislatif et administratif du Cabinet, les d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du premier ministre [. . .] ne sauraient \u00eatre dissoci\u00e9es des d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du Cabinet dans son ensemble \u00bb (par. 23, citant l\u2019ordonnance PO\u20111725, p. 14\u201116). Pourtant, plusieurs des conclusions du CIPVP entrent en conflit avec la fonction du premier ministre au sein du Cabinet et la nature du processus d\u00e9cisionnel du Cabinet \u2014 deux \u00e9l\u00e9ments essentiels du contexte l\u00e9gislatif qui entoure le par. 12(1) (voir Vavilov, par. 120).\n[51] Tout d\u2019abord, en qualifiant les Lettres de r\u00e9sultats non exempt\u00e9s du processus de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration du premier ministre, le CIPVP a cr\u00e9\u00e9 une dichotomie artificielle entre le processus de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration du premier ministre et celui du reste du Cabinet (voir, p. ex., par. 132). Cette dichotomie contredit non seulement le pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent du CIPVP, mais, fait plus important, elle va \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la fonction constitutionnelle qu\u2019exerce le premier ministre \u00e0 ce titre au sein du Cabinet.\n[52] Les priorit\u00e9s communiqu\u00e9es aux ministres par le premier ministre au d\u00e9but du gouvernement marquent le commencement du processus de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration du Cabinet, et elles peuvent changer. Les ministres peuvent tenter de persuader le premier ministre et le reste du Cabinet qu\u2019il convient d\u2019ajouter, d\u2019abandonner ou d\u2019aborder diff\u00e9remment des priorit\u00e9s (voir, p. ex., H. Bakvis, \u00ab Prime Minister and Cabinet in Canada : An Autocracy in Need of Reform? \u00bb (2000), 35:4 R. \u00e9tudes can. 60, p. 65\u201166 (qui traite du r\u00f4le important des ministres et de leur capacit\u00e9 d\u2019orienter les priorit\u00e9s du gouvernement)). En outre, le premier ministre peut revoir les priorit\u00e9s \u00e0 tout moment tout au long du processus \u2014 que ce soit en raison de points de vue de coll\u00e8gues du Cabinet, de conseils de fonctionnaires ou d\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nements et de circonstances changeantes.\n[53] Les Lettres contiennent \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue des communications entre le premier ministre et les ministres du Cabinet \u00e0 propos de priorit\u00e9s strat\u00e9giques, dont un grand nombre si ce n\u2019est la majorit\u00e9 devraient faire l\u2019objet de d\u00e9cisions du Cabinet, tant en ce qui concerne leur contenu que la mani\u00e8re de les communiquer au public. Le Cabinet [traduction] \u00ab formule et met en \u0153uvre toutes les politiques de l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif \u00bb, et toutes les questions importantes de politique gouvernementale sont soumises au Cabinet pour d\u00e9cision (Hogg et Wright, \u00a7 9:5; M. Schacter et P. Haid, Cabinet Decision\u2011Making in Canada : Lessons and Practices (1999), p. 1; voir aussi Brooks, p. 236). Rien dans les conventions ou les pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents ne justifie de distinguer le r\u00f4le du premier ministre dans ce processus du reste du Cabinet. La divulgation des priorit\u00e9s initiales du premier ministre, lorsqu\u2019on les compare aux annonces ult\u00e9rieures de la politique du gouvernement et \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il a effectivement accompli, aurait pour effet de r\u00e9v\u00e9ler la teneur de ce qui s\u2019est produit au cours du processus de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration du Cabinet. L\u2019affirmation du CIPVP suivant laquelle les Lettres constituent [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019aboutissement de la formulation par le premier ministre des politiques et objectifs que doit atteindre chaque minist\u00e8re \u00bb, ou \u00ab le fruit de ses d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations \u00bb \u00e9tait donc hors de propos et un motif d\u00e9raisonnable de refuser la protection qu\u2019accorde le par. 12(1) (par. 132 et 134 (je souligne); voir aussi par. 79).\n[54] De m\u00eame, dans la mesure o\u00f9 le CIPVP exigeait une preuve reliant les Lettres \u00e0 de \u00ab v\u00e9ritables d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du Cabinet lors d\u2019une r\u00e9union donn\u00e9e de celui\u2011ci \u00bb, cette approche \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable. Pareille exigence est bien trop \u00e9troite et ne tient pas compte des r\u00e9alit\u00e9s du processus de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration, notamment l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de priorit\u00e9s par le premier ministre et ses fonctions de supervision, dont il ne s\u2019acquitte pas n\u00e9cessairement \u00e0 une r\u00e9union donn\u00e9e du Cabinet et qu\u2019il peut exercer tout au long du processus de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration du Cabinet. Par cons\u00e9quent, il serait d\u00e9raisonnable pour le Commissaire d\u2019instaurer un crit\u00e8re plus rigoureux pour l\u2019exception \u00e0 la divulgation qui n\u00e9cessiterait une preuve reliant le document \u00e0 de \u00ab v\u00e9ritables d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du Cabinet lors d\u2019une r\u00e9union donn\u00e9e de celui\u2011ci \u00bb.\n[55] Je conviens avec la SRC que le CIPVP n\u2019a pas retenu ce crit\u00e8re partout dans ses motifs. N\u00e9anmoins, le fait qu\u2019il se soit concentr\u00e9 sur l\u2019existence de v\u00e9ritables d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations lors d\u2019une r\u00e9union donn\u00e9e du Cabinet a influenc\u00e9 sa conclusion selon laquelle la possibilit\u00e9 que certaines priorit\u00e9s strat\u00e9giques [traduction] \u00ab ne soient jamais renvoy\u00e9es au Cabinet ou [. . .] fassent l\u2019objet de modifications substantielles \u00bb \u00e9tait une \u00ab faille \u00bb de l\u2019argument du continuum avanc\u00e9 par le Bureau du Cabinet et supposait que les Lettres ne pouvaient pas \u00eatre exempt\u00e9es dans leur ensemble (par. 121). Cette conclusion \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable, parce qu\u2019elle ne tenait pas compte du fait que la divulgation de priorit\u00e9s strat\u00e9giques pr\u00e9liminaires qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mises en \u0153uvre ou qui ont fait l\u2019objet de modifications consid\u00e9rables avant leur mise en \u0153uvre aurait pour effet de r\u00e9v\u00e9ler l\u2019objet des d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du Cabinet \u2014 que la d\u00e9cision d\u2019abandonner ou de modifier la priorit\u00e9 en question ait \u00e9t\u00e9 prise par le Cabinet, par ses comit\u00e9s ou par le premier ministre.\n[56] Enfin, le CIPVP a conclu que les Lettres n\u2019\u00e9taient pas exempt\u00e9es, car m\u00eame les priorit\u00e9s qui seraient renvoy\u00e9es dans l\u2019avenir au Cabinet constituaient de simples \u00ab sujets \u00bb ou objets d\u2019\u00e9ventuelles d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations. Cette conclusion \u00e9tait elle aussi vici\u00e9e par le d\u00e9faut de mettre les Lettres en contexte. Le CIPVP a dit que les sujets ou objets des d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du Cabinet ne sont pas prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par le par. 12(1) \u00e0 moins que leur divulgation ne permette de tirer des inf\u00e9rences justes quant \u00e0 l\u2019objet de ces d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations (par. 99\u2011101). Toutefois, le CIPVP n\u2019a pas pris en compte le contexte g\u00e9n\u00e9ral au moment de d\u00e9cider si les Lettres r\u00e9pondaient \u00e0 son crit\u00e8re.\n[57] Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, les Lettres sont des communications entre le premier ministre et ses coll\u00e8gues du Cabinet qui portent sur des priorit\u00e9s strat\u00e9giques qui sont ou seront soumises au Cabinet; elles ne peuvent \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9es de simples \u00ab sujets \u00bb comme les points g\u00e9n\u00e9raux d\u2019un ordre du jour. Les Lettres r\u00e9v\u00e8lent les opinions initiales du premier ministre sur les priorit\u00e9s du nouveau gouvernement \u2014 des priorit\u00e9s appel\u00e9es \u00e0 changer \u00e0 mesure que se d\u00e9roulent le processus de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration. La communication des opinions initiales du premier ministre \u00e0 d\u2019autres membres du Cabinet fait partie du processus d\u00e9cisionnel du Cabinet, et elle sera r\u00e9v\u00e9latrice de l\u2019objet des d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du Cabinet lorsqu\u2019on la met en corr\u00e9lation avec l\u2019action subs\u00e9quente du gouvernement. Ce contexte est crucial. Il dissipe en outre la crainte du CIPVP que le fait d\u2019exempter les priorit\u00e9s figurant dans les lettres de mandat aurait pour cons\u00e9quence que l\u2019exception [traduction] \u00ab englobe tout document qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis ou ne devait pas \u00eatre soumis au Cabinet s\u2019il contient des renseignements qui, pr\u00e9tend le Bureau du Cabinet, pourraient devenir l\u2019objet d\u2019une future r\u00e9union du Cabinet \u00bb (par. 118). L\u2019affirmation du CIPVP que les Lettres constituaient de simples sujets reposait donc sur une m\u00e9prise fondamentale du contexte factuel et juridique, allait \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du texte des Lettres, et \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable (voir Vavilov, par. 126).\nC. Conclusion\n[58] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, le CIPVP n\u2019a pas accord\u00e9 le poids qui convient au contexte juridique et factuel, y compris aux traditions et conventions constitutionnelles int\u00e9ressant la confidentialit\u00e9 du Cabinet, le r\u00f4le du premier ministre, ainsi que le caract\u00e8re fluide et dynamique du processus d\u00e9cisionnel du Cabinet. Le d\u00e9faut du CIPVP de saisir les contraintes contextuelles pesant sur sa d\u00e9cision l\u2019a conduit \u00e0 des interpr\u00e9tations et conclusions d\u00e9raisonnables. Il a qualifi\u00e9 les Lettres de r\u00e9sultats du processus de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration du premier ministre, conclu qu\u2019elles \u00e9taient de simples sujets qui ne permettaient pas de tirer des inf\u00e9rences justes concernant les d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du Cabinet, et exig\u00e9 du Bureau du Cabinet qu\u2019il produise une preuve pour d\u00e9montrer que la divulgation des Lettres permettrait de tirer des inf\u00e9rences justes concernant de \u00ab v\u00e9ritables d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du Cabinet lors d\u2019une r\u00e9union donn\u00e9e de celui\u2011ci \u00bb (par. 100; voir aussi par. 116\u2011117). L\u2019interpr\u00e9tation \u00e9troite que le CIPVP a donn\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00ab objet des d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations \u00bb \u00e9tait donc d\u00e9raisonnable. M\u00eame d\u2019apr\u00e8s sa conception de la disposition, son application de celle\u2011ci aux Lettres \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable. Les Lettres, ainsi que les observations du Bureau du Cabinet, \u00e9taient clairement suffisantes pour \u00e9tablir que les Lettres relevaient du par. 12(1). La d\u00e9cision du CIPVP d\u2019ordonner la divulgation doit \u00eatre annul\u00e9e.\n[59] J\u2019ajouterais ce qui suit. Il ne fait aucun doute que, comme le soutient la SRC, l\u2019acc\u00e8s du public aux renseignements d\u00e9tenus par le gouvernement est essentiel \u00e0 notre processus d\u00e9mocratique (voir m.i., par. 49, citant Untel, par. 41). Comme l\u2019a soulign\u00e9 notre Cour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Dagg, \u00ab s\u2019ils n\u2019ont pas une connaissance suffisante de ce qui se passe \u00bb, ni le l\u00e9gislateur ni le public ne peuvent esp\u00e9rer demander des comptes au gouvernement ou contribuer \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9laboration des politiques (par. 61, citant D. C. Rowat, \u00ab How Much Administrative Secrecy? \u00bb (1965), 31 R. can. \u00e9con. et sci. pol. 479, p. 480). La LAIPVP pr\u00e9voit n\u00e9anmoins que, lorsqu\u2019ils entrent en jeu, d\u2019autres grands int\u00e9r\u00eats publics \u2014 qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale, du droit \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e ou de la confidentialit\u00e9 des d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du Cabinet \u2014 rev\u00eatent une importance suffisante pour l\u2019emporter sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du public dans l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information (voir LAIPVP, art. 16, 20 et 21).\n[60] Vu le r\u00f4le cl\u00e9 que joue la confidentialit\u00e9 du Cabinet dans le bon fonctionnement de notre r\u00e9gime de gouvernement de type Westminster, la jurisprudence d\u00e9taillant la port\u00e9e que doit avoir cette confidentialit\u00e9 soul\u00e8ve d\u2019importantes questions pour la stabilit\u00e9 et la l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 de notre d\u00e9mocratie. La confidentialit\u00e9 du Cabinet permet \u00e0 la fois le bon fonctionnement d\u2019un gouvernement responsable en favorisant la reddition de comptes minist\u00e9rielle collective envers la l\u00e9gislature, et accorde \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif la marge de man\u0153uvre op\u00e9rationnelle dont il a besoin pour fonctionner efficacement (B.C. Judges, par. 65\u201167 et 96; Carey, p. 659; voir aussi Criminal Lawyers\u2019 Association 2010, par. 40). Ces fonctions sont primordiales tant pour le principe du gouvernement responsable que pour la s\u00e9paration des pouvoirs. Les sph\u00e8res de confidentialit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019abri d\u2019une \u00ab ing\u00e9rence externe indue \u00bb sont essentielles \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 de l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif de \u00ab s\u2019acquitter des fonctions qui lui sont attribu\u00e9es par la Constitution \u00bb (B.C. Judges, par. 66 et 96).\n[61] En abordant les revendications de confidentialit\u00e9 du Cabinet, les d\u00e9cideurs administratifs et les cours de r\u00e9vision doivent \u00eatre attentifs non seulement \u00e0 l\u2019importance primordiale de l\u2019acc\u00e8s du public aux renseignements d\u00e9tenus par le gouvernement, mais aussi \u00e0 l\u2019objectif fondamental du secret du Cabinet de permettre un gouvernement efficace, de m\u00eame qu\u2019aux consid\u00e9rations d\u2019efficacit\u00e9, de franchise et de solidarit\u00e9 qui le sous\u2011tendent. Ils doivent aussi \u00eatre attentifs au caract\u00e8re dynamique et fluide de la prise de d\u00e9cisions par l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif, \u00e0 la fonction du Cabinet en soi et de ses membres, au r\u00f4le du premier ministre ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 la pr\u00e9rogative du Cabinet de choisir l\u2019occasion et la mani\u00e8re d\u2019annoncer ses d\u00e9cisions.\n[62] Pareille approche est compatible avec la phrase liminaire du par. 12(1), laquelle commande une analyse substantielle du document demand\u00e9 et de son objet afin de d\u00e9terminer si la divulgation du document d\u00e9voilerait les d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du Cabinet, au lieu d\u2019exclure cat\u00e9goriquement de la protection certains types de renseignements. Ainsi, les \u00ab d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations \u00bb dans leur sens t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique peuvent s\u2019entendre notamment des r\u00e9sultats du processus de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration du Cabinet ou des d\u00e9cisions qui en sont issues, des sujets de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration et des priorit\u00e9s fix\u00e9es par le premier ministre, m\u00eame s\u2019ils ne d\u00e9bouchent pas en fin de compte sur une mesure gouvernementale. En outre, les d\u00e9cideurs doivent toujours \u00eatre attentifs \u00e0 ce que peuvent r\u00e9v\u00e9ler m\u00eame des documents formul\u00e9s en termes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux \u00e0 propos de ces d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations \u00e0 un lecteur avis\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019ils sont situ\u00e9s dans le contexte plus large. L\u2019\u00e9tablissement et la discussion de priorit\u00e9s strat\u00e9giques dans les communications entre les membres du Cabinet sont plus susceptibles de r\u00e9v\u00e9ler l\u2019objet des d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations, surtout lorsque ces priorit\u00e9s sont examin\u00e9es en corr\u00e9lation avec d\u2019autres renseignements disponibles, y compris ce que le Cabinet d\u00e9cide de faire.\n[63] Pour ce qui est de la r\u00e9paration \u00e0 accorder dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, lorsque \u00ab l\u2019interaction du texte, du contexte et de l\u2019objet ouvre la porte \u00e0 une seule interpr\u00e9tation raisonnable \u00bb, il \u00ab ne servirait \u00e0 rien \u00bb de renvoyer la question au premier d\u00e9cideur (Vavilov, par. 124). En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le texte, l\u2019objet et le contexte de la disposition l\u00e9gislative m\u00e8nent inexorablement \u00e0 la conclusion que les Lettres sont exemptes de divulgation suivant la phrase liminaire du par. 12(1). Je ne renverrais pas l\u2019affaire au CIPVP.\n[64] Je suis d\u2019avis d\u2019accueillir le pourvoi et d\u2019annuler l\u2019ordonnance du CIPVP, et de condamner la SRC \u00e0 payer les d\u00e9pens \u00e0 l\u2019appelant. Le compte rendu priv\u00e9 de l\u2019instance d\u00e9pos\u00e9 \u00e0 notre Cour fera toujours partie du dossier de la Cour, mais il sera confidentiel, mis sous scell\u00e9s, et ne fera pas partie du dossier public.\nVersion fran\u00e7aise des motifs rendus par\nLa juge C\u00f4t\u00e9 \u2014\nI. Introduction\n[65] Je souscris \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation que ma coll\u00e8gue donne au par. 12(1) de la Loi sur l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information et la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e, L.R.O. 1990, c. F.31 (\u00ab Loi \u00bb), de m\u00eame qu\u2019\u00e0 sa conclusion selon laquelle les lettres de mandat en cause sont exemptes de divulgation suivant cette disposition. Toutefois, je ne suis pas d\u2019accord pour dire que \u00ab la m\u00eame conclusion s\u2019impose, peu importe que la norme de contr\u00f4le soit celle de la d\u00e9cision correcte ou celle de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable \u00bb (par. 16). En effet, selon l\u2019arr\u00eat Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration) c. Vavilov, 2019 CSC 65, [2019] 4 R.C.S. 653, \u00ab [l]e contr\u00f4le selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable est m\u00e9thodologiquement distinct du contr\u00f4le selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte \u00bb (par. 12; Mason c. Canada (Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration), 2023 CSC 21, par. 58). Pour les motifs expos\u00e9s ci\u2011apr\u00e8s, je consid\u00e8re que la question soulev\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce \u2014 la port\u00e9e du privil\u00e8ge du Cabinet \u2014 est une question de droit g\u00e9n\u00e9rale qui rev\u00eat une importance capitale pour le syst\u00e8me juridique dans son ensemble. Je suis donc d\u2019avis de r\u00e9viser la d\u00e9cision du Commissaire \u00e0 l\u2019information et \u00e0 la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e en fonction de la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte.\nII. Norme de contr\u00f4le\n[66] La s\u00e9lection et l\u2019application d\u2019une norme de contr\u00f4le par le juge de r\u00e9vision sont assujetties \u00e0 la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte (Office r\u00e9gional de la sant\u00e9 du Nord c. Horrocks, 2021 CSC 42, par. 10). Comme le signale ma coll\u00e8gue, notre Cour a conclu dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Agraira c. Canada (S\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique et Protection civile), 2013 CSC 36, [2013] 2 R.C.S. 559, qu\u2019en se \u00ab \u201cmet[tant] \u00e0 la place\u201d du tribunal d\u2019instance inf\u00e9rieure la cour d\u2019appel se concentre effectivement sur la d\u00e9cision administrative \u00bb (par. 46, citant Merck Frosst Canada Lt\u00e9e c. Canada (Sant\u00e9), 2012 CSC 3, [2012] 1 R.C.S. 23, par. 247 (italique omis)). Notre Cour n\u2019est pas li\u00e9e par la norme de contr\u00f4le qu\u2019ont appliqu\u00e9e les cours inf\u00e9rieures, ni par l\u2019accord intervenu entre les parties au sujet de la norme de contr\u00f4le applicable. Elle effectue sa propre r\u00e9vision de la d\u00e9cision du Commissaire (voir Horrocks, par. 10, citant D. J. M. Brown, assist\u00e9 de D. Fairlie, Civil Appeals (feuilles mobiles), \u00a7 14:45).\n[67] Selon les enseignements de Vavilov, \u00ab la cour de r\u00e9vision doit \u00eatre pr\u00eate \u00e0 d\u00e9roger \u00e0 la pr\u00e9somption d\u2019application de la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable dans les cas o\u00f9 le respect de la primaut\u00e9 du droit exige une r\u00e9ponse unique, d\u00e9cisive et d\u00e9finitive \u00e0 la question dont elle est saisie \u00bb (par. 32). La norme de contr\u00f4le applicable est une question essentielle, que ma coll\u00e8ge et le juge Lauwers ont jug\u00e9 s\u00e9rieuse (voir les motifs de la juge Karakatsanis, par. 16; 2022 ONCA 74, 160 O.R. (3d) 481, par. 106\u2011108). Par cons\u00e9quent, je ne peux souscrire \u00e0 l\u2019affirmation selon laquelle \u00ab il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de trancher de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9finitive \u00bb la question de la norme de contr\u00f4le applicable (motifs de la juge Karakatsanis, par. 16). \u00c0 mon avis, la port\u00e9e du privil\u00e8ge du Cabinet entre dans la cat\u00e9gorie d\u00e9j\u00e0 existante, reconnue dans Vavilov, de questions de droit g\u00e9n\u00e9rales d\u2019importance capitale pour le syst\u00e8me juridique dans son ensemble. Cette question appelle en cons\u00e9quence l\u2019application de la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte. Je m\u2019explique.\n[68] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Vavilov, notre Cour a reconnu que \u00ab la norme de contr\u00f4le de la d\u00e9cision correcte s\u2019impose \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des questions de droit g\u00e9n\u00e9rales qui sont \u201cd\u2019une importance fondamentale, de grande port\u00e9e\u201d et susceptibles d\u2019avoir des r\u00e9percussions juridiques significatives sur le syst\u00e8me de justice dans son ensemble ou sur d\u2019autres institutions gouvernementales \u00bb (par. 59). Notre Cour a donn\u00e9 des exemples pr\u00e9cis de ce genre de question : \u00ab . . . lorsqu\u2019une proc\u00e9dure administrative est prescrite par l\u2019application des doctrines de l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de la chose jug\u00e9e et de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure (Toronto (Ville), par. 15); la port\u00e9e de l\u2019obligation de neutralit\u00e9 religieuse de l\u2019\u00c9tat (Saguenay, par. 49); le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 des limites du secret professionnel de l\u2019avocat (University of Calgary, par. 20); et la port\u00e9e du privil\u00e8ge parlementaire (Chagnon, par. 17) \u00bb (par. 60).\n[69] Il n\u2019y a aucune raison de principe pour laquelle le privil\u00e8ge du Cabinet devrait \u00eatre trait\u00e9 diff\u00e9remment du secret professionnel de l\u2019avocat ou du privil\u00e8ge parlementaire \u2014 ou est moins important qu\u2019eux pour le syst\u00e8me juridique dans son ensemble. S\u2019exprimant au nom des juges majoritaires de la Cour dans Chagnon c. Syndicat de la fonction publique et parapublique du Qu\u00e9bec, 2018 CSC 39, [2018] 2 R.C.S. 687, ma coll\u00e8gue a fait remarquer que le privil\u00e8ge parlementaire contribue \u00e0 maintenir la s\u00e9paration des pouvoirs et joue un r\u00f4le important au sein de notre d\u00e9mocratie parlementaire bas\u00e9e sur le mod\u00e8le du Parlement de Westminster (par. 1). Cela fait \u00e9cho \u00e0 sa prise en compte de l\u2019importance du privil\u00e8ge du Cabinet en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, lequel met en jeu des traditions et conventions constitutionnelles \u00ab essentiel[les] au bon fonctionnement de notre d\u00e9mocratie \u00bb (par. 1; voir aussi les par. 3, 7, 21, 27\u201128 et 60). En effet, \u00ab [t]out comme le privil\u00e8ge l\u00e9gislatif prot\u00e8ge la capacit\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sentants \u00e9lus de donner suite \u00e0 la volont\u00e9 du peuple \u00bb, elle affirme, citant Chagnon, que \u00ab la confidentialit\u00e9 du Cabinet accorde \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif la latitude dont il a besoin pour gouverner de mani\u00e8re efficace et responsable sur le plan collectif \u00bb (par. 3).\n[70] La port\u00e9e du privil\u00e8ge du Cabinet n\u2019est pas une question unique au r\u00e9gime r\u00e9glementaire pr\u00e9cis de l\u2019Ontario (voir Vavilov, par. 61; Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2014 CSC 40, [2014] 2 R.C.S. 135, par. 60). Comme le signale ma coll\u00e8gue, des exemptions semblables figurent dans les lois sur l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information partout au pays (par. 14). \u00c0 preuve, le Commissaire se fonde sur l\u2019arr\u00eat O\u2019Connor c. Nova Scotia (Minister of the Priorities and Planning Secretariat), 2001 NSCA 132, 197 N.S.R. (2d) 154, de la Cour d\u2019appel de la Nouvelle\u2011\u00c9cosse, par opposition \u00e0 l\u2019approche diff\u00e9rente adopt\u00e9e par la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie\u2011Britannique dans Aquasource Ltd. c. Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Commissioner (B.C.) (1998), 111 B.C.A.C. 95. De plus, les tribunaux doivent \u00e9tablir la port\u00e9e du privil\u00e8ge du Cabinet, notamment sous le r\u00e9gime de l\u2019art. 39 de la Loi sur la preuve au Canada , L.R.C. 1985, c. C\u20115 , lorsqu\u2019ils sont saisis de questions d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de la preuve. En fait, l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation que ma coll\u00e8gue donne \u00e0 l\u2019objet du privil\u00e8ge du Cabinet repose en grande partie sur la jurisprudence de common law ou la jurisprudence concernant les lois d\u2019autres ressorts sur l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information (voir, p. ex., les par. 3 et 31). Cela confirme les vastes cons\u00e9quences des d\u00e9cisions sur la nature et la port\u00e9e du privil\u00e8ge du Cabinet.\n[71] Pour ces motifs, je suis d\u2019avis que la port\u00e9e du privil\u00e8ge du Cabinet est une question d\u2019importance capitale pour le syst\u00e8me juridique dans son ensemble qui doit recevoir une r\u00e9ponse d\u00e9cisive et d\u00e9finitive. Dans les arr\u00eats Chagnon et Alberta (Information and Privacy Commissioner) c. University of Calgary, 2016 CSC 53, [2016] 2 R.C.S. 555, notre Cour s\u2019est fond\u00e9e sur des aspects constitutionnels pour affirmer que le privil\u00e8ge parlementaire et le secret professionnel de l\u2019avocat sont des questions de droit d\u2019importance capitale (voir Chagnon, par. 1\u20114 et 23\u201125; University of Calgary, par. 20). Par cons\u00e9quent, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9cider si la superposition constitutionnelle en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce fait aussi entrer cette question dans la cat\u00e9gorie distincte de questions constitutionnelles reconnue dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Vavilov (voir les motifs de la C.A., par. 108).\nIII. Une m\u00e9thode qui \u00ab s\u2019int\u00e9resse avant tout aux motifs de la d\u00e9cision \u00bb\n[72] Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 au d\u00e9but des pr\u00e9sents motifs, je ne suis pas d\u2019accord pour dire que la m\u00eame conclusion s\u2019ensuit, peu importe que la norme de contr\u00f4le appliqu\u00e9e soit celle de la d\u00e9cision correcte ou celle de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable. Il ne faut jamais oublier que \u00ab [l]e contr\u00f4le selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable est m\u00e9thodologiquement distinct du contr\u00f4le selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte \u00bb (Vavilov, par. 12; Mason, par. 58). Les questions de droit g\u00e9n\u00e9rales d\u2019importance capitale pour le syst\u00e8me juridique dans son ensemble doivent \u00eatre l\u2019objet d\u2019un contr\u00f4le selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte parce que les cours de justice, au moment d\u2019effectuer un contr\u00f4le selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable, ne peuvent donner l\u2019unique r\u00e9ponse d\u00e9finitive que n\u00e9cessitent de telles questions (Vavilov, par. 62). Donc, le choix entre la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte et celle de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable dictera le genre de r\u00e9vision qu\u2019une cour peut effectuer, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire si la r\u00e9vision \u00ab s\u2019int\u00e9resse[ra] avant tout aux motifs de la d\u00e9cision \u00bb ou si la cour se livrera \u00e0 une analyse de novo (Vavilov, par. 83\u201184 et 116).\n[73] Ce qui distingue le contr\u00f4le selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable du contr\u00f4le selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte \u00ab tient au fait que la cour de justice effectuant le premier type de contr\u00f4le doit centrer son attention sur la d\u00e9cision m\u00eame qu\u2019a rendue le d\u00e9cideur administratif, notamment sur sa justification, et non sur la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle elle serait parvenue \u00e0 la place du d\u00e9cideur administratif \u00bb (Vavilov, par. 15 et 83; Mason, par. 8). Une approche de principe en fonction de la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable en est une qui fait passer au premier plan les motifs du d\u00e9cideur administratif (Vavilov, par. 83; voir Mason, par. 58\u201163). \u00ab Le r\u00f4le des cours de justice consiste [. . .] \u00e0 r\u00e9viser la d\u00e9cision et, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00e0 tout le moins, \u00e0 s\u2019abstenir de trancher elles\u2011m\u00eames la question en litige \u00bb (Vavilov, par. 83 (en italique dans l\u2019original)). Le juge de r\u00e9vision n\u2019\u00e9tablit pas son propre crit\u00e8re pour ensuite jauger ce qu\u2019a fait le d\u00e9cideur.\n[74] Avec \u00e9gards, ma coll\u00e8gue n\u2019utilise pas cette m\u00e9thodologie en pratique. Elle effectue plut\u00f4t sa propre interpr\u00e9tation du par. 12(1), ainsi que de l\u2019importance et de la nature du privil\u00e8ge du Cabinet, pour ensuite la comparer \u00e0 celle du Commissaire. Le fait que ma coll\u00e8gue serait parvenue \u00e0 une conclusion diff\u00e9rente de celle du Commissaire ne rend pas celle\u2011ci d\u00e9raisonnable. Toutefois, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des motifs de ma coll\u00e8gue, lesquels, d\u2019apr\u00e8s moi, impliquent dans les faits un examen en fonction de la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte, je conclus que la d\u00e9cision du Commissaire est incorrecte.\nIV. Analyse\n[75] Je souscris \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation que ma coll\u00e8gue donne \u00e0 la port\u00e9e du privil\u00e8ge du Cabinet, soit l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation correcte, et \u00e0 sa conclusion selon laquelle les lettres de mandat sont exemptes de divulgation en vertu du par. 12(1). L\u2019\u00ab objet des d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations \u00bb englobe le processus de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration du Cabinet du d\u00e9but \u00e0 la fin, notamment les directives et les grandes priorit\u00e9s communiqu\u00e9es par le premier ministre aux ministres. En concluant \u00e0 l\u2019effet contraire, le Commissaire a retenu une interpr\u00e9tation incorrecte. Toutefois, je crains qu\u2019en appliquant la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable, ma coll\u00e8gue n\u2019ait pas manifest\u00e9 la d\u00e9f\u00e9rence que commandent les motifs du Commissaire selon maints arr\u00eats de notre Cour (voir Kanthasamy c. Canada (Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration), 2015 CSC 61, [2015] 3 R.C.S. 909, par. 112, le juge Moldaver, dissident; Vavilov, par. 13, 15, 83 et 99; Mason, par. 60).\n[76] Ma coll\u00e8gue se livre \u00e0 sa propre interpr\u00e9tation de la port\u00e9e du privil\u00e8ge du Cabinet au sens du par. 12(1) (voir les par. 1\u20114, 24\u201133, 36, 46\u201149 et 59\u201162), et se sert de ses conclusions comme crit\u00e8re pour juger la d\u00e9cision du Commissaire. Par exemple, ma coll\u00e8gue mentionne trois raisons d\u2019\u00eatre de la convention relative \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9 du Cabinet : \u00ab . . . la franchise, la solidarit\u00e9 et l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 . . . \u00bb (par. 30). D\u2019apr\u00e8s elle, le Commissaire a tenu compte des deux premi\u00e8res raisons d\u2019\u00eatre, mais \u00ab n\u2019a pas trait\u00e9 d\u2019un objectif principal du secret du Cabinet \u2014 promouvoir l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 de la prise de d\u00e9cisions collective \u00bb, ni du but ultime de se doter d\u2019un gouvernement efficace (par. 32). Toutefois, cette troisi\u00e8me raison d\u2019\u00eatre, l\u2019\u00ab efficacit\u00e9 \u00bb, quoiqu\u2019un principe important du privil\u00e8ge du Cabinet, n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9e comme telle par notre Cour. Par cons\u00e9quent, je ne suis pas d\u2019accord pour affirmer qu\u2019il \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable pour le Commissaire de ne pas aborder un concept qui n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pleinement exprim\u00e9 que dans la doctrine (voir les motifs de la juge Karakatsanis, par. 30 et 36, citant Y. Campagnolo, \u00ab The Political Legitimacy of Cabinet Secrecy \u00bb (2017), 51 R.J.T.U.M. 51, p. 68, et Y. Campagnolo, Le secret minist\u00e9riel : Th\u00e9orie et pratique (2020), p. 37).\n[77] Au terme de son analyse exhaustive de l\u2019objectif du privil\u00e8ge du Cabinet, ma coll\u00e8gue conclut qu\u2019il \u00e9tait \u00ab crucial que [. . .] le [Commissaire] tienne pleinement compte de la fonction exerc\u00e9e par le Cabinet dans notre r\u00e9gime de gouvernement, et des limites de la confidentialit\u00e9 dont il a besoin pour s\u2019acquitter efficacement de cette fonction \u00bb (par. 33). \u00c0 mon avis, le Commissaire a fait exactement cela, en renvoyant \u00e0 l\u2019examen, par notre Cour, de la question dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Babcock c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2002 CSC 57, [2002] 3 R.C.S. 3 :\n[traduction] Le Bureau du Cabinet et l\u2019appelante pr\u00e9sentent tous deux des observations sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des premiers mots du paragraphe 12(1). Les deux reconnaissent qu\u2019il convient d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter ces mots \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de leur objectif sous\u2011jacent de favoriser des discussions libres et franches entre les membres du Cabinet sur les enjeux qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient appel\u00e9s \u00e0 trancher, sans se soucier de l\u2019effet paralysant que pourrait avoir la divulgation de leurs d\u00e9clarations ou des documents dont ils d\u00e9lib\u00e8rent. Cet objectif figure dans plusieurs d\u00e9cisions mentionn\u00e9es par les parties, notamment dans le passage suivant de l\u2019arr\u00eat Babcock c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) cit\u00e9 par le Bureau du Cabinet :\nLa tradition d\u00e9mocratique britannique, dont s\u2019inspire la tradition canadienne, reconna\u00eet depuis longtemps la confidentialit\u00e9 des discussions tenues dans l\u2019enceinte du Cabinet et des documents pr\u00e9par\u00e9s en vue de ces discussions. Cette confidentialit\u00e9 s\u2019explique ais\u00e9ment. Les personnes auxquelles incombe la lourde responsabilit\u00e9 de prendre des d\u00e9cisions gouvernementales doivent se sentir libres de discuter de tous les aspects des probl\u00e8mes dont elles sont saisies et d\u2019exprimer toutes les opinions possibles, sans crainte de voir les documents qu\u2019elles ont lus, les propos qu\u2019elles ont tenus et les \u00e9l\u00e9ments sur lesquels elles ont fond\u00e9 leur d\u00e9cision faire ult\u00e9rieurement l\u2019objet d\u2019un examen public [. . .] Si leurs d\u00e9clarations \u00e9taient susceptibles de divulgation, les membres du Cabinet pourraient censurer leurs propos, consciemment ou non. Ils pourraient se garder d\u2019exprimer des positions impopulaires ou de faire des commentaires qui risqueraient d\u2019\u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s politiquement incorrects.\n(Ordonnance PO\u20113973, 2019 CanLII 76037, par. 86, citant Babcock, par. 18)\n[78] Au paragraphe 87, le Commissaire justifie ainsi son interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019arr\u00eat Babcock :\n[traduction] Je constate que l\u2019arr\u00eat Babcock concerne l\u2019appel du rejet d\u2019une demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au cours d\u2019une poursuite civile pour contraindre la production de documents que le greffier du Conseil priv\u00e9 a attest\u00e9s comme constituant des renseignements confidentiels du Cabinet au sens de l\u2019art. 39 de la Loi sur la preuve au Canada . L\u2019objectif de l\u2019art. 39 qu\u2019a d\u00e9crit la Cour dans Babcock n\u2019est pas, tel que le sugg\u00e8re le Bureau du Cabinet (voir le paragraphe 47 de la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance), de mettre les ministres du Cabinet \u00e0 l\u2019abri des questions ou commentaires de membres du public au sujet de la politique publique ou d\u2019autres questions qui font ou pourraient faire l\u2019objet de d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du Cabinet. Le souci exprim\u00e9 dans Babcock est plut\u00f4t d\u2019emp\u00eacher que l\u2019objet des d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations elles\u2011m\u00eames soit r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 par la divulgation de documents et d\u2019exposer ces d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations aux commentaires et \u00e0 la critique du public, ce qui risque d\u2019avoir des effets pr\u00e9judiciables sur la franchise et la solidarit\u00e9 des membres du Cabinet. Toutes les autres sources qui m\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9es \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard appuient le m\u00eame point de vue. [En italique dans l\u2019original.]\n[79] Ma coll\u00e8gue affirme que l\u2019\u00ab examen par le [Commissaire] de la convention relative \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9 du Cabinet s\u2019est essentiellement arr\u00eat\u00e9 l\u00e0 \u00bb (par. 32). Avec \u00e9gards, je ne suis pas d\u2019accord. Apr\u00e8s son examen de l\u2019arr\u00eat Babcock, le Commissaire est revenu aux objectifs sous\u2011jacents de la Loi et de l\u2019exception visant les documents du Cabinet \u2014 de m\u00eame qu\u2019\u00e0 la fonction exerc\u00e9e par le Cabinet dans notre r\u00e9gime de gouvernement \u2014 tout au long de son analyse (voir, p. ex., les par. 97, 102 et 105\u2011108). Il n\u2019a pas \u00ab n\u00e9glig[\u00e9] \u00bb d\u2019importants arguments pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par le Bureau du Cabinet (motifs de la juge Karakatsanis, par. 33). Il les a tout simplement rejet\u00e9s, et je suis enti\u00e8rement d\u2019accord avec ma coll\u00e8gue lorsqu\u2019elle reconna\u00eet que les motifs du Commissaire \u00e9taient intelligibles et transparents (par. 7). Le fait que ma coll\u00e8gue soit en d\u00e9saccord, tout comme moi, avec son interpr\u00e9tation ne rend pas celle\u2011ci d\u00e9raisonnable.\n[80] Dans sa conclusion, ma coll\u00e8gue estime que l\u2019interaction du texte l\u00e9gislatif, du contexte et de l\u2019objet m\u00e8ne \u00ab inexorablement \u00bb \u00e0 une seule interpr\u00e9tation raisonnable du par. 12(1) (par. 63). Il est parfois \u00e9vident que les facteurs pertinents militent \u00ab si fortement \u00bb en faveur d\u2019une interpr\u00e9tation en particulier qu\u2019elle constitue la seule interpr\u00e9tation raisonnable de la disposition en cause (Vavilov, par. 124, citant avec approbation Nova Tube Inc.\/Nova Steel Inc. c. Conares Metal Supply Ltd., 2019 CAF 52).\n[81] Toutefois, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, plusieurs facteurs pertinents militent en faveur de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du Commissaire, et ma coll\u00e8gue ne tient pas compte de bon nombre d\u2019entre eux dans son examen du raisonnement suivi par le Commissaire. Ce dernier s\u2019est appuy\u00e9 entre autres sur les objectifs d\u00e9clar\u00e9s de la loi (voir les par. 106\u2011108); le principe selon lequel \u00ab les exceptions au droit d\u2019acc\u00e8s doivent \u00eatre limit\u00e9es et pr\u00e9cises \u00bb (sous\u2011al. 1a)(ii) de la Loi); les arr\u00eats Babcock et Dagg c. Canada (Ministre des Finances), [1997] 2 R.C.S. 403, de notre Cour; la jurisprudence des cours d\u2019appel de partout au pays, notamment l\u2019arr\u00eat O\u2019Connor; et un corpus abondant de d\u00e9cisions administratives ant\u00e9rieures. Ces facteurs viennent tous \u00e9tayer son interpr\u00e9tation.\n[82] Comme l\u2019a fait remarquer le juge Sossin au nom de la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour d\u2019appel, la coh\u00e9rence dont ont fait preuve les Commissaires \u00e0 l\u2019information et \u00e0 la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e de l\u2019Ontario dans la mani\u00e8re dont ils abordent depuis longtemps leur loi habilitante peut \u00eatre vue comme un indicateur du caract\u00e8re raisonnable de la d\u00e9cision du Commissaire (par. 49\u201150). Je suis du m\u00eame avis. Avec \u00e9gards, j\u2019ai de s\u00e9rieuses r\u00e9serves \u00e0 propos du fait de juger d\u00e9raisonnable une d\u00e9cision qui respecte des d\u00e9cennies de jurisprudence administrative \u2014 notamment O\u2019Connor, qui est sans doute l\u2019arr\u00eat de principe en appel sur la mise en balance de l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information et du privil\u00e8ge du Cabinet. C\u2019est n\u00e9anmoins l\u2019effet qu\u2019a la d\u00e9cision de ma coll\u00e8gue en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\nV. R\u00e9sum\u00e9 et dispositif\n[83] Bien que je souscrive \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation que donne ma coll\u00e8gue au par. 12(1), c\u2019est exactement cela \u2014 son interpr\u00e9tation. En plus d\u2019\u00eatre requis par l\u2019arr\u00eat Vavilov, le contr\u00f4le en fonction de la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte permet d\u2019\u00e9liminer mes inqui\u00e9tudes au sujet du manque de d\u00e9f\u00e9rence accord\u00e9 au Commissaire. L\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du par. 12(1) de la Loi par ma coll\u00e8gue est correcte; les lettres r\u00e9clam\u00e9es sont exemptes de divulgation en vertu de cette disposition. Je suis donc d\u2019avis d\u2019accueillir le pourvoi et d\u2019annuler la d\u00e9cision du Commissaire.\nANNEXE\nLoi sur l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information et la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e, L.R.O. 1990, c.

La Loi \u00e9tablit des normes nationales et assure aux peuples autochtones un contr\u00f4le effectif sur le bien\u2011\u00eatre de leurs enfants. Elle \u00e9nonce aux art. 9 \u00e0 17 des normes et principes nationaux, lesquels \u00e9tablissent un cadre normatif applicable, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle du pays, relativement \u00e0 la fourniture de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille culturellement adapt\u00e9s. \u00c0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 8a) et au par. 18(1), elle affirme que le droit inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale reconnu et confirm\u00e9 par l\u2019art. 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 comprend la comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative en mati\u00e8re de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille autochtones. De plus, elle \u00e9tablit un cadre \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur duquel les groupes, collectivit\u00e9s ou peuples autochtones peuvent exercer la comp\u00e9tence affirm\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019al. 8a) et confirm\u00e9e au par. 18(1) de la Loi . La Loi pr\u00e9voit aussi comment ses dispositions et la comp\u00e9tence qui y est affirm\u00e9e vont interagir avec d\u2019autres lois. L\u2019article 21 incorpore par renvoi les textes l\u00e9gislatifs adopt\u00e9s par un groupe, une collectivit\u00e9 ou un peuple autochtones, et leur donne force de loi \u00e0 titre de lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales et le par. 22(3) pr\u00e9cise qu\u2019il est entendu que les textes l\u00e9gislatifs d\u2019un groupe, d\u2019une collectivit\u00e9 ou d\u2019un peuple autochtones l\u2019emportent sur toute disposition incompatible d\u2019un texte de loi provincial.\nPar suite de l\u2019adoption de la Loi , la procureure g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Qu\u00e9bec a soumis par renvoi \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appel du Qu\u00e9bec la question de sa validit\u00e9 constitutionnelle, lui demandant si la Loi est ultra vires de la comp\u00e9tence du Parlement en vertu de la Constitution du Canada. La Cour d\u2019appel a statu\u00e9 que la Loi est constitutionnellement valide, \u00e0 l\u2019exception de l\u2019art. 21 et du par. 22(3), dispositions qui donnent priorit\u00e9 aux textes l\u00e9gislatifs d\u2019un groupe, d\u2019une collectivit\u00e9 ou d\u2019un peuple autochtones sur les lois provinciales. Selon elle, ces dispositions outrepassent la comp\u00e9tence du Parlement en ce qu\u2019elles modifient ind\u00fbment l\u2019architecture constitutionnelle du Canada. Le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Qu\u00e9bec et le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada interjettent appel de l\u2019avis rendu par la Cour d\u2019appel.\nArr\u00eat : Le pourvoi du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Qu\u00e9bec est rejet\u00e9 et le pourvoi du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada est accueilli.\nLa Loi est dans son ensemble valide sur le plan constitutionnel. L\u2019enjeu essentiel auquel s\u2019attaque la Loi consiste \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger le bien\u2011\u00eatre des enfants, des jeunes et des familles autochtones en favorisant la fourniture de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille culturellement adapt\u00e9s et, ce faisant, \u00e0 favoriser le processus de r\u00e9conciliation avec les peuples autochtones. Elle rel\u00e8ve nettement du pouvoir de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer du Parlement en vertu du par. 91(24) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 sur \u00ab les Indiens et les terres r\u00e9serv\u00e9es pour les Indiens \u00bb.\nLe Parlement s\u2019est engag\u00e9 dans une d\u00e9marche de r\u00e9conciliation par voie l\u00e9gislative par le biais d\u2019une loi innovante. En vertu de celle\u2011ci, les corps dirigeants autochtones et le gouvernement du Canada travailleront de concert en vue de rem\u00e9dier aux torts du pass\u00e9 et d\u2019instaurer une assise solide pour des relations renouvel\u00e9es de nation \u00e0 nation en mati\u00e8re de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille, liant la Couronne dans ses rapports envers les peuples autochtones du pays. Ce faisant, le Parlement r\u00e9pond non seulement de fa\u00e7on imm\u00e9diate \u00e0 l\u2019engagement pris par le Canada de mettre en \u0153uvre la D\u00e9claration et de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 l\u2019appel \u00e0 l\u2019action de la Commission de v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et r\u00e9conciliation du Canada, mais il \u00e9vite aussi les al\u00e9as de la n\u00e9gociation constitutionnelle, les lenteurs des r\u00e8glements par trait\u00e9s et les in\u00e9vitables conflits associ\u00e9s aux r\u00e8glements par les tribunaux.\nLa d\u00e9termination de la validit\u00e9 constitutionnelle d\u2019une loi proc\u00e8de en deux \u00e9tapes. \u00c0 la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse, soit celle de la qualification de la loi, le tribunal identifie l\u2019objet et les effets de celle\u2011ci afin d\u2019en d\u00e9gager l\u2019objet principal ou encore la caract\u00e9ristique dominante. Dans l\u2019examen de l\u2019objet de la loi, le tribunal prend en consid\u00e9ration tant des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve intrins\u00e8que, tels que le pr\u00e9ambule, les dispositions et le titre de la loi, que des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve extrins\u00e8que, par exemple les d\u00e9bats parlementaires. Quant \u00e0 l\u2019examen des effets, le tribunal doit s\u2019int\u00e9resser aux effets juridiques, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire ceux d\u00e9coulant directement des dispositions de la loi elle\u2011m\u00eame, et aux effets pratiques, soit les effets secondaires d\u00e9coulant de son application. Ensuite, \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse, le tribunal classifie la loi parmi les chefs de comp\u00e9tence \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s aux art. 91 et 92 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 .\nComme la question soumise \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appel en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ne portait sur aucune disposition particuli\u00e8re de la Loi , c\u2019est celle\u2011ci dans son int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 qu\u2019il faut d\u2019abord qualifier, puis classifier. D\u2019abord, en ce qui concerne le caract\u00e8re v\u00e9ritable de la Loi , celui\u2011ci d\u00e9coule de l\u2019examen de ses objectifs et effets. Consid\u00e9r\u00e9e dans son int\u00e9gralit\u00e9, la Loi a pour caract\u00e8re v\u00e9ritable de prot\u00e9ger le bien\u2011\u00eatre des enfants, des jeunes et des familles autochtones en favorisant la fourniture de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille culturellement adapt\u00e9s et, ce faisant, de contribuer au processus de r\u00e9conciliation avec les peuples autochtones.\nPremi\u00e8rement, la preuve intrins\u00e8que consid\u00e9r\u00e9e globalement tend \u00e0 indiquer que la Loi a pour objet pr\u00e9dominant de prot\u00e9ger le bien\u2011\u00eatre des enfants, des jeunes et des familles autochtones de trois fa\u00e7ons interreli\u00e9es : l\u2019affirmation de la comp\u00e9tence des collectivit\u00e9s autochtones en mati\u00e8re de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille; l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de normes nationales applicables dans l\u2019ensemble du Canada; la mise en \u0153uvre des aspects de la D\u00e9claration en droit canadien. Ensuite, l\u2019objet d\u00e9gag\u00e9 \u00e0 partir de la preuve intrins\u00e8que est confirm\u00e9 par la preuve extrins\u00e8que. Les extraits des d\u00e9bats rappellent la gravit\u00e9 du probl\u00e8me de la surrepr\u00e9sentation des enfants autochtones dans les syst\u00e8mes de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille. Ils permettent \u00e9galement de pr\u00e9ciser en quoi l\u2019objet fondamental de la Loi est intimement li\u00e9 aux trois objectifs identifi\u00e9s \u00e0 partir de la preuve intrins\u00e8que. L\u2019affirmation de la comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative des groupes, collectivit\u00e9s et peuples autochtones et l\u2019adoption de normes nationales \u00e9taient per\u00e7ues comme faisant partie int\u00e9grante de la mise en \u0153uvre des aspects de la D\u00e9claration. De m\u00eame, l\u2019affirmation de la comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative \u00e9tait \u00e9galement consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme ais\u00e9ment conciliable avec les normes nationales formul\u00e9es par le Parlement, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les collectivit\u00e9s autochtones avaient particip\u00e9 \u00e0 leur formulation et qu\u2019il est pr\u00e9vu qu\u2019elles participent \u00e0 leur mise en \u0153uvre par la suite. Les trois volets constituent autant d\u2019objectifs qui se renforcent mutuellement pour prot\u00e9ger le bien\u2011\u00eatre des enfants, des jeunes et des familles autochtones.\nLa Loi a pour effet juridique d\u2019instaurer un r\u00e9gime uniforme de protection du bien\u2011\u00eatre des enfants, des jeunes et des familles autochtones par l\u2019affirmation de la comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative autochtone, par des normes nationales et par des mesures concr\u00e8tes de mise en \u0153uvre. En pratique, il est raisonnablement permis de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce que la Loi prot\u00e8ge le bien\u2011\u00eatre des enfants, des jeunes et des familles autochtones et favorise la r\u00e9conciliation avec les peuples autochtones. Il est raisonnable de pr\u00e9voir que les enfants et les familles autochtones recevront des services mieux adapt\u00e9s \u00e0 leurs r\u00e9alit\u00e9s culturelles, ce qui r\u00e9duira la surrepr\u00e9sentation des enfants autochtones dans les \u00e9tablissements de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille. Il est aussi raisonnable de penser que la Loi permettra d\u2019\u00e9viter le gaspillage de temps et de ressources qu\u2019impliquent des litiges ou n\u00e9gociations prolong\u00e9es sur la question de savoir si un groupe, une collectivit\u00e9 ou un peuple autochtones donn\u00e9 a comp\u00e9tence en mati\u00e8re de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille, et si oui dans quelle mesure. Les effets des trois cat\u00e9gories interreli\u00e9es de dispositions vont dans le m\u00eame sens.\nLes dispositions affirmant le droit \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale produisent des effets juridiques substantiels, en raison de la relation qui existe entre la l\u00e9gislation et le gouvernement. La souverainet\u00e9 parlementaire a pour corollaire logique que le Parlement et les l\u00e9gislatures peuvent lier la Couronne par des lois. En corr\u00e9lation avec l\u2019art. 7 de la Loi , qui \u00e9nonce express\u00e9ment que celle\u2011ci lie la Couronne du chef du Canada ou d\u2019une province, l\u2019affirmation contraignante du Parlement sur la port\u00e9e de l\u2019art. 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 lie le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la position affirm\u00e9e en tant que r\u00e8gle de droit positif d\u2019origine l\u00e9gislatif. Le Parlement s\u2019engage \u00e0 agir comme si les peuples autochtones b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient d\u2019un droit inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale en mati\u00e8re de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille et s\u2019assure que la Couronne s\u2019engage pareillement \u00e0 agir en conformit\u00e9 avec sa position, en la liant express\u00e9ment par le biais de l\u2019art. 7. Dans la mesure o\u00f9 l\u2019affirmation \u00e9nonc\u00e9e au par. 18(1) de la Loi figure dans une loi qui est constitutionnellement valide au regard de l\u2019art. 91(24) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 , l\u2019affirmation du Parlement et l\u2019engagement corollaire de la Couronne produisent leur effet. Le jeu combin\u00e9 de l\u2019art. 7, de l\u2019al. 8a) et du par. 18(1) de la Loi pourrait aussi produire d\u2019autres effets juridiques en obligeant la Couronne \u00e0 agir comme si le principe de l\u2019honneur de la Couronne est engag\u00e9. En ce qui concerne les effets pratiques, l\u2019affirmation r\u00e9alise la fonction p\u00e9dagogique, \u00e9ducative du droit. Elle peut en partie \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme un pas en vue d\u2019op\u00e9rer un changement, une adaptation de la culture qui anime l\u2019action des gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux et pourrait contribuer \u00e0 inculquer de nouvelles attitudes ou approches qui favoriseront davantage une culture de respect envers les peuples autochtones du Canada et de r\u00e9conciliation avec eux.\nLes dispositions \u00e9non\u00e7ant des normes nationales \u00e9tablissent un cadre normatif applicable, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle du pays, relativement \u00e0 la fourniture de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille culturellement adapt\u00e9s. Certains de ces principes orientent l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la Loi par les tribunaux et r\u00e9gissent son application par les gouvernements. Ce cadre normatif lie les fournisseurs f\u00e9d\u00e9raux et provinciaux assurant de tels services, ainsi que les fournisseurs autochtones dans certains cas. En attendant la pleine r\u00e9alisation de la comp\u00e9tence reconnue aux Autochtones, bon nombre des normes nationales \u00e9nonc\u00e9es pourraient avoir pour effet, en pratique, de faire en sorte que les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille fournis \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des enfants autochtones soient culturellement adapt\u00e9s \u00e0 ceux\u2011ci et conformes \u00e0 leur int\u00e9r\u00eat. On peut raisonnablement s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce que les normes qui ont une port\u00e9e pr\u00e9ventive diminuent la propension historique des syst\u00e8mes de protection de l\u2019enfance \u00e0 prendre en charge les enfants autochtones et ainsi \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elles contribuent, lorsque cela est possible, \u00e0 leur maintien dans leur milieu d\u2019origine. Pour ce qui est des normes qui interviennent apr\u00e8s qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision ait \u00e9t\u00e9 prise de placer un enfant, elles sont vraisemblablement susceptibles de r\u00e9duire le placement massif et disproportionn\u00e9 des enfants autochtones en dehors de leurs familles et de leurs communaut\u00e9s. Le fait de s\u2019attaquer \u00e0 la surrepr\u00e9sentation prot\u00e8ge le bien\u2011\u00eatre des enfants, des jeunes et des familles autochtones.\nLes dispositions \u00e9non\u00e7ant des mesures concr\u00e8tes de mise en \u0153uvre facilitent l\u2019adoption par les groupes, collectivit\u00e9s ou peuples autochtones de mesures l\u00e9gislatives sur les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille. La Loi a pour effet pratique anticip\u00e9 de rendre le droit canadien davantage compatible avec la D\u00e9claration. La Loi met \u00e9galement en place des m\u00e9canismes visant \u00e0 faciliter et \u00e0 encourager, dans une perspective d\u2019avenir, la n\u00e9gociation d\u2019ententes entre la Couronne et les communaut\u00e9s autochtones. Il est \u00e9galement permis de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce que les dispositions de la Loi favoriseront la r\u00e9conciliation avec les peuples autochtones et acc\u00e9l\u00e8rent certains aspects de ce processus de r\u00e9conciliation. On peut s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce que le Canada se rapproche de l\u2019objectif d\u2019\u00e9tablir et de maintenir une relation de respect r\u00e9ciproque entre les peuples autochtones et non autochtones.\nConcernant la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse, soit celle de la classification de la Loi , la comp\u00e9tence du Parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral en vertu du par. 91(24) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 repr\u00e9sente une assise s\u00fbre pour son adoption. Lier le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral \u00e0 l\u2019affirmation \u00e9nonc\u00e9e au par. 18(1), \u00e9tablir des normes nationales et faciliter la mise en \u0153uvre des textes l\u00e9gislatifs d\u2019un groupe, d\u2019une collectivit\u00e9 ou d\u2019un peuple autochtones sont autant de mesures qui rel\u00e8vent des pouvoirs du Parlement en vertu du par. 91(24). La Loi ne modifie pas l\u2019architecture constitutionnelle du Canada.\nD\u2019abord, les effets accessoires des normes nationales sur l\u2019exercice par les provinces de leurs comp\u00e9tences, y compris sur le travail de leurs fonctionnaires, n\u2019ont aucune incidence sur la validit\u00e9 constitutionnelle de la Loi . Les normes nationales rel\u00e8vent de la comp\u00e9tence du f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et peuvent, en cons\u00e9quence, lier les gouvernements provinciaux. La doctrine du double aspect permet l\u2019application concurrente de l\u00e9gislations f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et provinciales \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la m\u00eame situation de fait.\nPar ailleurs, rien n\u2019emp\u00eache le Parlement d\u2019affirmer que le droit inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale des peuples autochtones reconnu et confirm\u00e9 par l\u2019art. 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 comprend la comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative en mati\u00e8re de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille. Ce faisant, il ne modifie pas unilat\u00e9ralement l\u2019art. 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 . Il \u00e9nonce plut\u00f4t dans la Loi , par le biais d\u2019affirmations liant la Couronne, sa position \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du contenu de cette disposition constitutionnelle, ce que le partage des comp\u00e9tences et la s\u00e9paration des pouvoirs ne l\u2019emp\u00eachent pas de faire. La justesse de sa position n\u2019a pas \u00e0 \u00eatre tranch\u00e9e pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la question pos\u00e9e dans le renvoi, et la classification de l\u2019affirmation sous l\u2019un des chefs de comp\u00e9tences \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s dans la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 doit, dans le contexte de la question pos\u00e9e, \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par la classification de la Loi dans son ensemble.\nIl est aussi constitutionnellement loisible au Parlement de recourir \u00e0 l\u2019incorporation anticipatoire par renvoi de dispositions adopt\u00e9es par d\u2019autres entit\u00e9s comme technique de r\u00e9daction l\u00e9gislative s\u2019il poss\u00e8de la comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l\u2019adoption de la loi qu\u2019il veut incorporer par renvoi. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, par le biais de l\u2019art. 21, le Parlement a validement incorpor\u00e9 par renvoi les textes l\u00e9gislatifs, avec leurs modifications successives, des groupes, collectivit\u00e9s ou peuples autochtones en mati\u00e8re de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille. Le Parlement dispose du pouvoir l\u00e9gislatif ind\u00e9pendant d\u2019adopter de tels textes de loi en vertu de la comp\u00e9tence sur les Indiens et les terres r\u00e9serv\u00e9es pour les Indiens que lui conf\u00e8re le par. 91(24) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 . Ainsi, l\u2019art. 21 de la Loi , une simple disposition d\u2019incorporation par renvoi, ne modifie pas non plus l\u2019architecture de la Constitution.\nFinalement, il est tout aussi loisible au Parlement d\u2019affirmer que les textes l\u00e9gislatifs d\u2019un groupe, d\u2019une collectivit\u00e9 ou d\u2019un peuple autochtones auront pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance sur d\u2019autres lois en cas de conflit. Le paragraphe 22(3) de la Loi constitue une simple reformulation l\u00e9gislative de la doctrine de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance f\u00e9d\u00e9rale suivant laquelle les dispositions d\u2019une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale valide l\u2019emportent sur les dispositions incompatibles d\u2019une loi provinciale. Bien qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse d\u2019une doctrine d\u2019origine judiciaire dont la port\u00e9e et l\u2019application rel\u00e8vent des tribunaux plut\u00f4t que du Parlement ou des l\u00e9gislatures, cela n\u2019emp\u00eache pas le Parlement de d\u00e9clarer ce qu\u2019il entend par la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. C\u2019est aux tribunaux qu\u2019il appartient ultimement de trancher toute all\u00e9gation d\u2019incompatibilit\u00e9 entre des r\u00e8gles de droit f\u00e9d\u00e9rales et provinciales, et de prononcer toute d\u00e9claration n\u00e9cessaire en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance.

Introduction\n[1] Dans un d\u00e9cret pris le 18 d\u00e9cembre 2019, le gouvernement du Qu\u00e9bec a confi\u00e9 \u00e0 la procureure g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la province le mandat de contester, par un renvoi \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appel, la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de la Loi concernant les enfants, les jeunes et les familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations, des Inuits et des M\u00e9tis , L.C. 2019, c. 24 (\u00ab Loi \u00bb), au motif que cette loi exc\u00e8de la comp\u00e9tence du Parlement du Canada. Pr\u00e9cisant que la loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00ab soul\u00e8ve des enjeux constitutionnels fondamentaux eu \u00e9gard notamment au partage des comp\u00e9tences l\u00e9gislatives et \u00e0 l\u2019architecture constitutionnelle du Canada \u00bb, le gouvernement a soumis \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appel du Qu\u00e9bec la question constitutionnelle suivante :\nLa Loi concernant les enfants, les jeunes et les familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations, des Inuits et des M\u00e9tis est-elle ultra vires de la comp\u00e9tence du Parlement du Canada en vertu de la Constitution du Canada?\n(D\u00e9cret 1288-2019, (2020) 152 G.O. II, 154, p. 155)\nEn r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette question, la Cour d\u2019appel a statu\u00e9 que la Loi est constitutionnellement valide, \u00e0 l\u2019exception de l\u2019art. 21 et du par. 22(3), dispositions qui donnent priorit\u00e9 aux textes l\u00e9gislatifs d\u2019un groupe, d\u2019une collectivit\u00e9 ou d\u2019un peuple autochtones sur les lois provinciales et, de ce fait, outrepassent la comp\u00e9tence du Parlement.\n[2] Saisie de la m\u00eame question, notre Cour est d\u2019avis que la Loi est dans son ensemble valide sur le plan constitutionnel. Elle rel\u00e8ve de la comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative du Parlement \u00e9nonc\u00e9e au par. 91(24) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 sur \u00ab [l]es Indiens et les terres r\u00e9serv\u00e9es pour les Indiens \u00bb. Portant sur les relations au sein des familles autochtones et le contr\u00f4le que les collectivit\u00e9s autochtones exercent sur les enfants autochtones, la loi attaqu\u00e9e concerne, au premier chef, ce qu\u2019on appelle l\u2019autochtonit\u00e9, l\u2019indianit\u00e9 ou la \u00ab quiddit\u00e9 indienne \u00bb, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire les Autochtones en tant qu\u2019Autochtones, ce qui commande son rattachement au par. 91(24) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 .\n[3] Cette loi s\u2019inscrit dans un programme l\u00e9gislatif plus vaste, mis en branle par le Parlement afin de mener \u00e0 bien la r\u00e9conciliation avec les Premi\u00e8res Nations, les Inuits et les M\u00e9tis, et ce, \u00ab gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 des relations renouvel\u00e9es de nation \u00e0 nation, de gouvernement \u00e0 gouvernement et entre les Inuits et la Couronne, qui reposent sur la reconnaissance des droits, le respect, la coop\u00e9ration et le partenariat \u00bb (pr\u00e9ambule). Le cadre servant d\u2019assise \u00e0 cette initiative de r\u00e9conciliation entam\u00e9e par le Parlement est la D\u00e9claration des Nations Unies sur les droits des peuples autochtones, A.G. R\u00e9s. 61\/295, Doc. N.U. A\/RES\/61\/295 (\u00ab D\u00e9claration \u00bb ou \u00ab DNUDPA \u00bb), adopt\u00e9e par l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Nations Unies en 2007. Cet instrument international pr\u00e9cise que \u00ab [l]es peuples autochtones, dans l\u2019exercice de leur droit \u00e0 l\u2019autod\u00e9termination, ont le droit d\u2019\u00eatre autonomes et de s\u2019administrer eux-m\u00eames pour tout ce qui touche \u00e0 leurs affaires int\u00e9rieures et locales \u00bb (art. 4). Parmi les mati\u00e8res dont traite la D\u00e9claration, sont particuli\u00e8rement pertinentes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du pr\u00e9sent renvoi les dispositions de celle-ci qui \u00e9noncent \u00ab le droit des familles et des communaut\u00e9s autochtones de conserver la responsabilit\u00e9 partag\u00e9e de l\u2019\u00e9ducation [. . .] et du bien-\u00eatre de leurs enfants, conform\u00e9ment aux droits de l\u2019enfant \u00bb (pr\u00e9ambule; voir aussi l\u2019art. 14). La D\u00e9claration rappelle aussi le droit des peuples autochtones de transmettre aux g\u00e9n\u00e9rations futures leur histoire, leur langue et leur culture (par. 13(1)), en plus de souligner le droit de ne faire l\u2019objet d\u2019aucun acte de violence, y compris \u00ab le transfert forc\u00e9 d\u2019enfants autochtones d\u2019un groupe \u00e0 un autre \u00bb (par. 7(2)).\n[4] Si la D\u00e9claration n\u2019a pas force ex\u00e9cutoire en tant que trait\u00e9 au Canada, elle pr\u00e9voit n\u00e9anmoins, pour les besoins de sa mise en \u0153uvre, l\u2019obligation qu\u2019ont les \u00c9tats de prendre, \u00ab en consultation et en coop\u00e9ration avec les peuples autochtones, les mesures appropri\u00e9es, y compris l\u00e9gislatives, pour atteindre les buts \u00bb qu\u2019elle vise (art. 38). Reconnue par le Parlement comme \u00ab un instrument international universel en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne qui trouve application en droit canadien \u00bb, la D\u00e9claration est consacr\u00e9e dans le droit positif du pays par la Loi sur la D\u00e9claration des Nations Unies sur les droits des peuples autochtones , L.C. 2021, c. 14 (\u00ab Loi sur la DNUDPA \u00bb), al. 4a). Cette loi reconna\u00eet que la D\u00e9claration \u00ab fournit un cadre pour la r\u00e9conciliation \u00bb (pr\u00e9ambule); l\u2019art. 5 de cette m\u00eame loi impose au gouvernement du Canada l\u2019obligation de prendre, en consultation et en collaboration avec les peuples autochtones, \u00ab toutes les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour veiller \u00e0 ce que les lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales soient compatibles avec la D\u00e9claration \u00bb. Le pr\u00e9ambule de la loi pr\u00e9voit express\u00e9ment que la mise en \u0153uvre de la D\u00e9claration au Canada \u00ab doit comporter notamment des mesures concr\u00e8tes visant \u00e0 lutter contre les injustices \u00bb auxquelles se heurtent entre autres les jeunes et les enfants autochtones.\n[5] La loi attaqu\u00e9e dans le pr\u00e9sent renvoi s\u2019inscrit donc directement dans la foul\u00e9e de l\u2019engagement pris par le Canada de \u00ab mettre en \u0153uvre la D\u00e9claration des Nations Unies sur les droits des peuples autochtones \u00bb, comme le confirme le premier attendu de son pr\u00e9ambule. Le pr\u00e9ambule de la Loi renvoie aussi aux appels \u00e0 l\u2019action de la Commission de v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et r\u00e9conciliation du Canada qui demandent aux gouvernements \u00ab de mettre en \u0153uvre la D\u00e9claration des Nations Unies sur les droits des peuples autochtones dans le cadre de la r\u00e9conciliation \u00bb (Honorer la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, r\u00e9concilier pour l\u2019avenir : Sommaire du rapport final de la Commission de v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et r\u00e9conciliation du Canada (2015), p. 202, appel \u00e0 l\u2019action no 43). Cette demande fait \u00e9cho \u00e0 celle pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans les appels \u00e0 la justice de l\u2019Enqu\u00eate nationale sur les femmes et les filles autochtones disparues et assassin\u00e9es (voir R\u00e9clamer notre pouvoir et notre place : le rapport final de l\u2019Enqu\u00eate nationale sur les femmes et les filles autochtones disparues et assassin\u00e9es (2019), vol. 1b, p. 189-246). Au c\u0153ur de cette d\u00e9marche de r\u00e9conciliation, la Loi s\u2019attaque explicitement aux torts occasionn\u00e9s aux enfants autochtones et \u00e0 leurs familles. \u00ab [L]e Parlement reconna\u00eet les s\u00e9quelles d\u00e9coulant des pensionnats indiens ainsi que les torts, notamment les traumatismes interg\u00e9n\u00e9rationnels, caus\u00e9s aux peuples autochtones par les politiques et les pratiques coloniales \u00bb, peut-on lire dans le pr\u00e9ambule. Le Parlement reconna\u00eet \u00e9galement dans celui-ci les \u00ab bouleversements \u00bb subis par les femmes et filles autochtones en lien avec les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance ainsi que \u00ab l\u2019importance de r\u00e9unir avec leurs familles et leurs collectivit\u00e9s les enfants autochtones qui en ont \u00e9t\u00e9 s\u00e9par\u00e9s dans le cadre de la fourniture de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille \u00bb. Pour r\u00e9aliser ces objectifs, le Parlement affirme la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 \u00ab de respecter la diversit\u00e9 de tous les peuples autochtones, notamment en ce qui a trait \u00e0 leurs lois \u00bb, et \u00ab de mettre fin \u00e0 la surrepr\u00e9sentation des enfants autochtones dans les syst\u00e8mes de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille \u00bb.\n[6] Le Parlement entreprend cette d\u00e9marche de r\u00e9conciliation par voie l\u00e9gislative en faveur des enfants autochtones en recourant \u00e0 une approche \u00ab inusit\u00e9e \u00bb, pour reprendre le terme utilis\u00e9 par la Cour d\u2019appel (2022 QCCA 185, par. 515 (CanLII)). L\u2019article 8 annonce les trois volets de l\u2019objet de la Loi , qui constituent autant de voies juridiques distinctes r\u00e9unies dans un tout organique et visant un m\u00eame but de r\u00e9conciliation : l\u2019affirmation pour le Canada, faite par le Parlement et liant la Couronne, de la vitalit\u00e9 de la comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative des peuples autochtones en mati\u00e8re de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille et la fourniture de tels services en fonction de normes nationales. Premi\u00e8rement, la Loi a pour objet \u00ab d\u2019affirmer le droit inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale lequel comprend la comp\u00e9tence en mati\u00e8re de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille \u00bb (al. 8a)). Cette affirmation vise, pour employer le vocable de la Loi , les \u00ab textes l\u00e9gislatifs \u00bb de groupes, collectivit\u00e9s ou peuples autochtones et exprime l\u2019id\u00e9e que ces textes seraient les mieux adapt\u00e9s pour r\u00e9gir la situation des enfants et des familles autochtones. Deuxi\u00e8mement \u2014 et un peu en contrepoint du premier objet mentionn\u00e9 \u2014, la Loi \u00e9nonce \u00ab des principes applicables \u00e0 la fourniture de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des enfants autochtones, et ce, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle nationale \u00bb (al. 8b)). L\u2019\u00e9laboration par le Parlement de normes l\u00e9gislatives nationales visant la protection des enfants autochtones r\u00e9pond directement au quatri\u00e8me appel \u00e0 l\u2019action de la Commission de v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et r\u00e9conciliation. Troisi\u00e8mement, la Loi a \u00e9galement pour objet \u00ab de contribuer \u00e0 la mise en \u0153uvre de la D\u00e9claration des Nations Unies sur les droits des peuples autochtones \u00bb (al. 8c)). Encore ici, cet objet r\u00e9pond \u00e0 l\u2019appel adress\u00e9 par la Commission de v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et r\u00e9conciliation au gouvernement du Canada lui demandant d\u2019\u00e9laborer un plan d\u2019action et d\u2019autres mesures concr\u00e8tes pour atteindre les objectifs de la D\u00e9claration.\n[7] On notera que les trois volets de l\u2019objet \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 8 refl\u00e8tent l\u2019ouverture du Parlement \u00e0 utiliser trois diff\u00e9rents types de normes juridiques qui seront entrelac\u00e9es dans ce cadre de r\u00e9conciliation afin d\u2019assurer le bien-\u00eatre des enfants autochtones : la comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative des peuples autochtones en mati\u00e8re de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille, les dispositions l\u00e9gislatives \u00e9dict\u00e9es par le Parlement afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir des normes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle nationale, et les normes internationales dont parle la D\u00e9claration. La m\u00e9taphore du \u00ab tressage \u00bb de ces trois types de normes a \u00e9t\u00e9 utilement propos\u00e9e pour expliquer la fa\u00e7on dont on devrait proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la mise en \u0153uvre de la D\u00e9claration au Canada, afin de \u00ab d\u00e9terminer, en se fondant sur le droit international en guise d\u2019orientation, comment le droit de l\u2019\u00c9tat et le droit autochtone peuvent s\u2019imbriquer afin de cr\u00e9er une \u201ctresse\u201d unique et solide (ou un droit unique bien d\u00e9fini) \u00bb (G. Christie, \u00ab R\u00e8gles de droit autochtones, droit canadien et DNUDPA \u00bb, dans Mise en application de la DNUDPA : Tisser des liens entre le droit autochtone et les lois internationales et nationales (2017), 56, p. 57; voir aussi O. Fitzgerald et R. Schwartz, \u00ab Introduction \u00bb, ibid., 1, p. 3).\n[8] Annonc\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019art. 8 et r\u00e9alis\u00e9 par la Loi dans son ensemble, l\u2019effort du Parlement pour natter cette \u00ab tresse \u00bb \u00e0 trois brins constitue le cadre pr\u00e9cis de r\u00e9conciliation en ce qui a trait aux services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et aux familles autochtones, dans l\u2019esprit de la D\u00e9claration. On r\u00e9pond ainsi de fa\u00e7on imm\u00e9diate \u00e0 l\u2019engagement pris par le Canada de mettre en \u0153uvre la D\u00e9claration et de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 l\u2019appel \u00e0 l\u2019action de la Commission de v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et r\u00e9conciliation; ce faisant, on \u00e9vite les al\u00e9as de la n\u00e9gociation constitutionnelle, les lenteurs des r\u00e8glements par trait\u00e9s, conclus \u00e0 la pi\u00e8ce, entre la Couronne et chacune des diverses collectivit\u00e9s autochtones concern\u00e9es et les in\u00e9vitables conflits associ\u00e9s aux r\u00e8glements par les tribunaux (sur ce point, voir les explications de l\u2019auteur K. Wilkins, \u00ab Strategizing UNDRIP Implementation : Some Fundamentals \u00bb, dans J. Borrows et autres, dir., Braiding Legal Orders : Implementing the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (2019), 177).\n[9] Rien n\u2019emp\u00eache le Parlement d\u2019affirmer que les peuples autochtones ont comp\u00e9tence pour adopter des lois en mati\u00e8re de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille, comme il le fait au par. 18(1) de la Loi . Cette \u00ab affirmation \u00bb, par laquelle le Parlement d\u00e9clare que le droit inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale reconnu et confirm\u00e9 par l\u2019art. 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 comprend la \u00ab comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative \u00bb en mati\u00e8re de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille autochtones, constitue certes un engagement l\u00e9gislatif auquel il est tenu dans sa conduite avec les peuples autochtones. Par ailleurs, rien n\u2019emp\u00eache le Parlement de d\u00e9clarer, ainsi qu\u2019il le fait \u00e0 l\u2019art. 7, que cet engagement, tout comme les autres qui sont pris envers les peuples autochtones dans la Loi pour assurer la protection des enfants, \u00ab lie \u00bb Sa Majest\u00e9. Ceci rev\u00eat une grande importance puisque, sauf indication contraire comme celle \u00e9nonc\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019art. 7, nul texte ne lie Sa Majest\u00e9 ni n\u2019a d\u2019effets sur ses droits et pr\u00e9rogatives (voir la Loi d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation , L.R.C. 1985, c. I-21, art. 17 ; Wilkins, p. 184, se r\u00e9f\u00e9rant \u00e0 Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Thouin, 2017 CSC 46, [2017] 2 R.C.S. 184, par. 1 et 19-21). Il est tout aussi loisible au Parlement d\u2019affirmer que les textes l\u00e9gislatifs d\u2019un groupe, d\u2019une collectivit\u00e9 ou d\u2019un peuple autochtones auront pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance sur d\u2019autres lois en cas de conflit. En outre, il est certain que les questions concernant la port\u00e9e de l\u2019art. 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 et l\u2019application de la doctrine de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance f\u00e9d\u00e9rale rel\u00e8vent ultimement non pas du pouvoir l\u00e9gislatif, mais du pouvoir judiciaire en droit canadien, puisqu\u2019elles soul\u00e8vent des questions d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation constitutionnelle. Il va sans dire que le Parlement ne peut, par l\u2019adoption d\u2019une simple loi, amender la Constitution, y compris les droits prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par l\u2019art. 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 , ou le partage des comp\u00e9tences \u00e9tabli par la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 . Cela dit, la comp\u00e9tence du Parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral en vertu du par. 91(24) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 repr\u00e9sente une assise s\u00fbre pour adopter une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale comportant de telles affirmations et imposant de telles obligations \u00e0 Sa Majest\u00e9, tout comme elle constitue une assise solide pour imposer des normes nationales en mati\u00e8re de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des enfants autochtones (al. 8b)). Contrairement \u00e0 ce que plaide le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Qu\u00e9bec, l\u2019\u00ab architecture constitutionnelle \u00bb canadienne n\u2019en est nullement \u00e9branl\u00e9e.\nII. Contexte\n[10] Durant la majeure partie de l\u2019histoire du Canada, les l\u00e9gislateurs ont appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 tort une politique d\u2019assimilation qui visait \u00ab \u00e0 sortir [les peuples autochtones] de leur \u00e9tat de tutelle et de d\u00e9pendance, et [\u00e0] les pr\u00e9parer [. . .] \u00e0 un degr\u00e9 de civilisation plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 \u00bb (Rapport annuel du d\u00e9partement de l\u2019Int\u00e9rieur pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e expir\u00e9e le 30 juin 1876, reproduit dans Documents de la session, vol.

Les donn\u00e9es concernant la surrepr\u00e9sentation des enfants autochtones dans les syst\u00e8mes de protection de l\u2019enfance sont tout bonnement accablantes. Au Canada, selon les donn\u00e9es du recensement de 2016, environ 7,7 p. 100 des enfants de moins de 15 ans sont autochtones, alors qu\u2019ils repr\u00e9sentent 52,2 p. 100 des enfants plac\u00e9s en famille d\u2019accueil priv\u00e9e (Services aux Autochtones Canada, Le gouvernement du Canada annonce l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur de la Loi concernant les enfants, les jeunes et les familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations, des Inuits et des M\u00e9tis, 10 septembre 2019 (en ligne)).\n[12] Progressivement, le Canada a abandonn\u00e9 sa politique d\u2019assimilation en faveur d\u2019une politique de r\u00e9conciliation. Le Parlement a \u00e9tabli la Commission de v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et r\u00e9conciliation du Canada et lui a confi\u00e9 le double mandat de \u00ab r\u00e9v\u00e9ler aux Canadiens la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 complexe sur l\u2019histoire et les s\u00e9quelles durables des pensionnats dirig\u00e9s par des \u00c9glises \u00bb et \u00ab d\u2019orienter et d\u2019inspirer un processus de t\u00e9moignage et de gu\u00e9rison, qui devrait aboutir \u00e0 la r\u00e9conciliation au sein des familles autochtones et entre les Autochtones et les communaut\u00e9s non autochtones, les \u00c9glises, les gouvernements et les Canadiens en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00bb (Honorer la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, r\u00e9concilier pour l\u2019avenir, p. 27).\n[13] La Commission de v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et r\u00e9conciliation du Canada a formul\u00e9 plusieurs appels \u00e0 l\u2019action en lien avec la protection des enfants autochtones. Tout particuli\u00e8rement, dans l\u2019appel \u00e0 l\u2019action no 4, la Commission\ndemand[e] au gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral de mettre en place des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives en mati\u00e8re de protection des enfants autochtones qui \u00e9tablissent des normes nationales en ce qui a trait aux cas de garde et de prise en charge par l\u2019\u00c9tat concernant des enfants autochtones, et qui pr\u00e9voient des principes qui :\ni. confirment le droit des gouvernements autochtones d\u2019\u00e9tablir et de maintenir en place leurs propres organismes de protection de l\u2019enfance;\nii. exigent des organismes de protection de l\u2019enfance et des tribunaux qu\u2019ils tiennent compte dans leurs d\u00e9cisions des s\u00e9quelles laiss\u00e9es par les pensionnats;\niii. \u00e9tablissent, en tant que priorit\u00e9 de premier plan, une exigence selon laquelle le placement temporaire ou permanent des enfants autochtones le soit dans un milieu adapt\u00e9 \u00e0 leur culture.\n(Honorer la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, r\u00e9concilier pour l\u2019avenir, p. 147-148)\nLa Commission a \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 aux gouvernements d\u2019adopter et de mettre en \u0153uvre la DNUDPA dans son int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 en tant que \u00ab cadre pour la r\u00e9conciliation \u00bb (Honorer la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, r\u00e9concilier pour l\u2019avenir, p. 198\u2011202, appels \u00e0 l\u2019action nos 43-44).\n[14] En 2016, le Canada s\u2019est engag\u00e9 sur la sc\u00e8ne internationale \u00e0 appuyer \u00ab sans r\u00e9serve \u00bb la DNUDPA et \u00e0 la mettre en \u0153uvre (C.

Celle-ci reconna\u00eet en particulier \u00ab le droit des familles et des communaut\u00e9s autochtones de conserver la responsabilit\u00e9 partag\u00e9e de l\u2019\u00e9ducation, de la formation, de l\u2019instruction et du bien-\u00eatre de leurs enfants, conform\u00e9ment aux droits de l\u2019enfant \u00bb (pr\u00e9ambule). Elle \u00e9nonce, aux art. 3 et 4 respectivement, que les peuples autochtones ont le droit de \u00ab d\u00e9termine[r] librement leur statut politique et [d\u2019]assure[r] librement leur d\u00e9veloppement \u00e9conomique, social et culturel \u00bb, ainsi que le droit, dans l\u2019exercice de leur droit \u00e0 l\u2019autod\u00e9termination, \u00ab d\u2019\u00eatre autonomes et de s\u2019administrer eux-m\u00eames pour tout ce qui touche \u00e0 leurs affaires int\u00e9rieures et locales \u00bb. Le paragraphe 7(2) de la DNUDPA pr\u00e9cise que \u00ab [l]es peuples autochtones ont le droit, \u00e0 titre collectif, de vivre dans la libert\u00e9, la paix et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 en tant que peuples distincts et ne font l\u2019objet d\u2019aucun acte de g\u00e9nocide ou autre acte de violence, y compris le transfert forc\u00e9 d\u2019enfants autochtones d\u2019un groupe \u00e0 un autre. \u00bb Le paragraphe 13(1) de la DNUDPA reconna\u00eet que les peuples autochtones ont \u00ab le droit de revivifier, d\u2019utiliser, de d\u00e9velopper et de transmettre aux g\u00e9n\u00e9rations futures leur histoire, leur langue, leurs traditions orales, leur philosophie, leur syst\u00e8me d\u2019\u00e9criture et leur litt\u00e9rature \u00bb, droit qui est renforc\u00e9 par l\u2019obligation corollaire qu\u2019ont les \u00c9tats de prendre des mesures afin de le prot\u00e9ger (par. 13(2)). En outre, l\u2019art. 38 de la DNUDPA pr\u00e9voit que \u00ab [l]es \u00c9tats prennent, en consultation et en coop\u00e9ration avec les peuples autochtones, les mesures appropri\u00e9es, y compris l\u00e9gislatives, pour atteindre les buts de la [. . .] D\u00e9claration. \u00bb\n[15] En 2021, le Parlement a \u00e9dict\u00e9 la Loi sur la DNUDPA, laquelle confirme, \u00e0 l\u2019al. 4a), que la D\u00e9claration \u00ab constitue un instrument international universel en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne qui trouve application en droit canadien \u00bb. C\u2019est donc aux termes de cette loi du Parlement que la D\u00e9claration est int\u00e9gr\u00e9e dans le droit positif interne du pays. \u00c0 son al. 4b), la loi \u00e9nonce qu\u2019elle a en outre pour objet \u00ab d\u2019encadrer la mise en \u0153uvre de la D\u00e9claration par le gouvernement du Canada \u00bb. \u00c0 l\u2019art. 5, elle pr\u00e9voit que le \u00ab gouvernement du Canada, en consultation et en collaboration avec les peuples autochtones, prend toutes les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour veiller \u00e0 ce que les lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales soient compatibles avec la D\u00e9claration \u00bb. Par ailleurs, l\u2019al. 6(2)b) dispose que le ministre responsable de cette loi \u00e9laborera et mettra en \u0153uvre un plan d\u2019action, lequel comportera notamment \u00ab des mesures de contr\u00f4le ou de surveillance, des voies de recours, des mesures de r\u00e9paration ou d\u2019autres mesures de reddition de comptes en lien avec la mise en \u0153uvre de la D\u00e9claration \u00bb. Plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, dans le pr\u00e9ambule de cette loi, le Parlement a soulign\u00e9 l\u2019engagement du gouvernement du Canada \u00e0 \u00ab prendre des mesures efficaces \u2014 d\u2019ordre l\u00e9gislatif, politique et administratif, entre autres \u2014 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle nationale et internationale, en consultation et en collaboration avec les peuples autochtones, afin d\u2019atteindre les objectifs de la D\u00e9claration \u00bb. Le Parlement y a aussi mentionn\u00e9 les appels \u00e0 l\u2019action de la Commission de v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et r\u00e9conciliation et les appels \u00e0 la justice de l\u2019Enqu\u00eate nationale sur les femmes et les filles autochtones disparues et assassin\u00e9es lui demandant de mettre en \u0153uvre la DNUDPA.\n[16] L\u2019appel adress\u00e9 aux l\u00e9gislateurs afin qu\u2019ils adoptent des lois affirmant l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale des peuples autochtones et facilitant l\u2019exercice de ces droits a eu des \u00e9chos dans d\u2019autres contextes. Par exemple, sur la sc\u00e8ne internationale, l\u2019importance de telles mesures a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9e \u00e0 maintes reprises (voir, p. ex., DNUDPA, art. 38; Nations Unies, Assembl\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Rapport du Rapporteur sp\u00e9cial sur la situation des droits de l\u2019homme et des libert\u00e9s fondamentales des populations autochtones, M. S. James Anaya, Doc. N.U. A\/HRC\/9\/9, 11 ao\u00fbt 2008; Nations Unies, Haut-Commissariat aux droits de l\u2019homme, Statement upon conclusion of the visit to Canada by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples, James Anaya, 15 octobre 2013 (en ligne)).\n[17] La prise de mesures l\u00e9gislatives de cette nature a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crite comme faisant partie d\u2019un processus que certains qualifient de [traduction] \u00ab r\u00e9conciliation par voie l\u00e9gislative \u00bb, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire l\u2019adoption de lois visant \u00ab \u00e0 faire respecter, \u00e0 promouvoir, \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger et \u00e0 accommoder les droits inh\u00e9rents au moyen de m\u00e9canismes ou de cadres \u00e9nonc\u00e9s l\u00e9gislativement \u00bb (voir N. S. W. Metallic, \u00ab Aboriginal Rights, Legislative Reconciliation, and Constitutionalism \u00bb (2023), 27:2 R. \u00e9tudes const. 1, p. 5). Autrement dit, de telles lois ne se veulent pas la source des droits en question, mais reposent plut\u00f4t sur la pr\u00e9misse que ces droits existent. Des initiatives similaires ont \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9es de \u00ab loi[s] de reconnaissance \u00bb, notamment dans le Rapport de la Commission royale sur les peuples autochtones, vol. 2, Une relation \u00e0 red\u00e9finir (1996), p. 347 (voir aussi S. Grammond, \u00ab Un cadre conceptuel pour la reconnaissance du droit autochtone \u00bb (2022), 52 R.G.D. 181, p. 204).\n[18] Certaines mesures l\u00e9gislatives fond\u00e9es sur la reconnaissance de droits autochtones ont \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9es. \u00c0 titre d\u2019exemple, la Loi sur les langues autochtones , L.C. 2019, c. 23 , commence par l\u2019attendu suivant : \u00ab que la reconnaissance et la mise en \u0153uvre des droits relatifs aux langues autochtones sont des \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui sont au c\u0153ur de la r\u00e9conciliation avec les peuples autochtones et de l\u2019\u00e9dification du pays, notamment dans la foul\u00e9e des appels \u00e0 l\u2019action formul\u00e9s par la Commission de v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et r\u00e9conciliation du Canada \u00bb (pr\u00e9ambule).\nIII. Survol de la Loi\n[19] Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ses engagements en lien avec la DNUDPA, le Parlement a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de promulguer une loi innovante qui \u00e9tablit des normes nationales et assure aux peuples autochtones un contr\u00f4le effectif sur le bien-\u00eatre de leurs enfants. D\u2019entr\u00e9e de jeu, le Parlement reconna\u00eet dans le pr\u00e9ambule m\u00eame de la Loi qu\u2019une r\u00e9forme en profondeur des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et aux familles autochtones est requise pour combattre la surrepr\u00e9sentation des enfants dans les syst\u00e8mes de services aux familles. Cette r\u00e9forme, qui comprend une affirmation de la comp\u00e9tence des peuples autochtones en la mati\u00e8re, sera une \u00e9tape marquante sur la voie de la r\u00e9conciliation. La Loi a notamment pour but d\u2019affirmer le droit inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale (al. 8a)) et, comme le pr\u00e9cise le par. 9(2) , la Loi doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e en conformit\u00e9 avec le principe de \u00ab continuit\u00e9 culturelle \u00bb des peuples autochtones. En effet, le Parlement place l\u2019enfant au c\u0153ur de cette id\u00e9e de continuit\u00e9 culturelle, et ce, pour des raisons \u00e9videntes : le fait de faire en sorte que les peuples autochtones eux-m\u00eames exercent le contr\u00f4le sur les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance permettra d\u2019\u00e9viter les traumatismes interg\u00e9n\u00e9rationnels et les politiques d\u2019assimilation du pass\u00e9 (voir le pr\u00e9ambule). Le fait que l\u2019enfant r\u00e9side avec les membres de sa famille et de sa collectivit\u00e9 renforce la transmission de la culture autochtone et favorise souvent l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de l\u2019enfant (par. 9(2)). Bien entendu, une affirmation l\u00e9gislative concernant l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation \u00e0 donner \u00e0 une norme constitutionnelle ne lie pas les tribunaux.\n[20] La collaboration entre les peuples autochtones et les instances gouvernementales qui a men\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019adoption de la Loi , laquelle comporte des dispositions d\u00e9claratoires explicites, met en lumi\u00e8re l\u2019engagement ferme du Parlement d\u2019\u00e9tablir une nouvelle structure l\u00e9gislative pour la r\u00e9conciliation. Selon ce cadre cr\u00e9\u00e9 par la Loi , les corps dirigeants autochtones et le gouvernement du Canada travailleront de concert en vue de rem\u00e9dier aux torts du pass\u00e9 et d\u2019instaurer une assise solide pour des relations renouvel\u00e9es de nation \u00e0 nation en mati\u00e8re de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille, liant la Couronne dans ses rapports envers les peuples autochtones du pays.\n[21] En cons\u00e9quence, la Loi constitue un pas de plus vers la r\u00e9conciliation. De fait, son pr\u00e9ambule reconna\u00eet express\u00e9ment une grande partie du contexte d\u00e9crit pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment. Il pr\u00e9cise que la Loi vise \u00e0 \u00ab mettre en \u0153uvre la D\u00e9claration des Nations Unies sur les droits des peuples autochtones \u00bb, \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre \u00ab les s\u00e9quelles d\u00e9coulant des pensionnats indiens ainsi que les torts, notamment les traumatismes interg\u00e9n\u00e9rationnels, caus\u00e9s aux peuples autochtones par les politiques et les pratiques coloniales \u00bb et \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux appels \u00e0 l\u2019action lanc\u00e9s par la Commission de v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et r\u00e9conciliation du Canada.\n[22] L\u2019article 8 \u00e9nonce que la Loi a pour objet :\na) d\u2019affirmer le droit inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale lequel comprend la comp\u00e9tence en mati\u00e8re de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille;\nb) d\u2019\u00e9noncer des principes applicables \u00e0 la fourniture de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des enfants autochtones, et ce, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle nationale;\nc) de contribuer \u00e0 la mise en \u0153uvre de la D\u00e9claration des Nations Unies sur les droits des peuples autochtones.\nCes trois volets interreli\u00e9s de l\u2019objet se retrouvent \u00e0 divers endroits dans le texte de la Loi , laquelle \u00ab lie Sa Majest\u00e9 du chef du Canada ou d\u2019une province \u00bb (art. 7).\n[23] Par exemple, l\u2019affirmation du droit inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale \u00e9nonc\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019al. 8a) figure \u00e9galement au par. 18(1) :\nAffirmation\n18 (1) Le droit inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale reconnu et confirm\u00e9 par l\u2019article 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 comprend la comp\u00e9tence en mati\u00e8re de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille, notamment la comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative en mati\u00e8re de tels services et l\u2019ex\u00e9cution et le contr\u00f4le d\u2019application des textes l\u00e9gislatifs pris en vertu de cette comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative.\n[24] Cette affirmation se refl\u00e8te \u00e9galement \u00e0 l\u2019art. 2 de la Loi , qui exige que celle-ci soit interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 maintenir l\u2019ensemble des droits pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l\u2019art. 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 . En effet, le Parlement a indiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019art. 2 que la Loi \u00ab maintient les droits des peuples autochtones reconnus et confirm\u00e9s par l\u2019article 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 ; elle n\u2019y porte pas atteinte \u00bb.\n[25] En outre, les \u00ab principes applicables [. . .] \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle nationale \u00bb vis\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019al. 8b) sont exprim\u00e9s aux art. 9 \u00e0 17, lesquels \u00e9tablissent des normes nationales pour la fourniture des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des enfants autochtones. L\u2019article 9 pr\u00e9cise que la Loi \u00ab doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e et administr\u00e9e en conformit\u00e9 avec le principe de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de l\u2019enfant \u00bb et souligne les principes de continuit\u00e9 culturelle et d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle. Le paragraphe 10(3) \u00e9nonce les facteurs qui doivent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s pour d\u00e9terminer l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de l\u2019enfant autochtone. L\u2019article 11 pr\u00e9voit que les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille doivent \u00eatre fournis de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 tenir compte des besoins et de la culture de l\u2019enfant, et de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 lui permettre de conna\u00eetre ses origines familiales et \u00e0 favoriser l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle. Le paragraphe 12(1) exige que le fournisseur de services avise le p\u00e8re ou la m\u00e8re de l\u2019enfant ainsi que le corps dirigeant autochtone concern\u00e9 avant de prendre toute mesure importante \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019enfant. L\u2019article 13 \u00e9tablit le droit des parents, du fournisseur de soins et du corps dirigeant autochtone de faire des repr\u00e9sentations dans le cadre \u00ab de toute proc\u00e9dure judiciaire de nature civile relative \u00e0 la fourniture de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un enfant autochtone \u00bb. L\u2019article 14 priorise les soins pr\u00e9ventifs, y compris les services pr\u00e9natals. L\u2019article 15 interdit la prise en charge d\u2019un enfant autochtone \u00ab seulement en raison de sa condition socio-\u00e9conomique \u00bb. Les articles 16 et 17 \u00e9tablissent un ordre de priorit\u00e9 pour le placement de l\u2019enfant, \u00ab dans la mesure o\u00f9 cela est compatible avec son int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00bb.\n[26] De plus, la Loi \u00e9tablit un cadre \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur duquel les groupes, collectivit\u00e9s ou peuples autochtones peuvent exercer la comp\u00e9tence affirm\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019al. 8a) et confirm\u00e9e au par. 18(1). La Loi pr\u00e9voit que les corps dirigeants autochtones qui ont l\u2019intention d\u2019exercer cette comp\u00e9tence peuvent en aviser le ministre f\u00e9d\u00e9ral responsable ainsi que les gouvernements provinciaux concern\u00e9s et leur demander de conclure des accords de coordination (par. 20(1) et (2)). Lorsqu\u2019ils concluent un tel accord, ou lorsqu\u2019ils font des efforts raisonnables \u00e0 cette fin dans l\u2019ann\u00e9e suivant leur demande, leur \u00ab texte l\u00e9gislatif, avec ses modifications successives [. . .] pendant la p\u00e9riode au cours de laquelle ce texte est en vigueur [. . .] [a] \u00e9galement force de loi, \u00e0 titre de loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00bb (par. 21(1)). Les dispositions relatives aux services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille dans les lois adopt\u00e9es par les groupes, collectivit\u00e9s ou peuples autochtones s\u2019appliquent \u00ab \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un enfant autochtone, sauf si [leur] application est contraire \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de l\u2019enfant \u00bb (art. 23).\n[27] La Loi pr\u00e9voit aussi comment ses dispositions et la comp\u00e9tence qui y est affirm\u00e9e vont interagir avec d\u2019autres lois. Premi\u00e8rement, l\u2019art. 19 indique que \u00ab [l]a Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s s\u2019applique \u00e0 tout corps dirigeant autochtone qui exerce la comp\u00e9tence en mati\u00e8re de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille pour le compte d\u2019un groupe, d\u2019une collectivit\u00e9 ou d\u2019un peuple autochtones. \u00bb Deuxi\u00e8mement, l\u2019art. 3 \u00e9nonce que les dispositions de trait\u00e9s ou d\u2019accords relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale d\u00e9j\u00e0 existants et comprenant des dispositions relatives aux services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille l\u2019emportent sur les dispositions incompatibles de la Loi . Troisi\u00e8mement, les par. 21(3) et 22(1) pr\u00e9cisent que les seuls textes de loi f\u00e9d\u00e9raux qui l\u2019emportent sur les textes l\u00e9gislatifs adopt\u00e9s par un groupe, une collectivit\u00e9 ou un peuple autochtones par suite de la conclusion d\u2019un accord de coordination ou apr\u00e8s une ann\u00e9e d\u2019efforts raisonnables en vue de conclure un tel accord sont les art. 10 \u00e0 15 de la Loi et les dispositions de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne , L.R.C. 1985, c. H-6 . Quatri\u00e8mement, en ce qui a trait aux textes de loi provinciaux, le par. 22(3) pr\u00e9cise qu\u2019il \u00ab est entendu \u00bb que les textes l\u00e9gislatifs d\u2019un groupe, d\u2019une collectivit\u00e9 ou d\u2019un peuple autochtones adopt\u00e9s en vertu d\u2019un accord de coordination ou apr\u00e8s une ann\u00e9e d\u2019efforts raisonnables pour conclure un tel accord l\u2019emportent sur toute disposition incompatible d\u2019un texte de loi provincial. La Loi pr\u00e9cise toutefois que, en l\u2019absence d\u2019incompatibilit\u00e9, elle ne porte pas atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019application de quelque loi provinciale ou r\u00e8glement pris en vertu de celle-ci (art. 4). Enfin, le par. 24(1) de la Loi \u00e9tablit la fa\u00e7on de r\u00e9soudre les cas o\u00f9 il y aurait, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un enfant autochtone, incompatibilit\u00e9 entre des textes l\u00e9gislatifs de deux groupes, collectivit\u00e9s ou peuples autochtones.\nIV. La question pos\u00e9e dans le renvoi\n[28] Par suite de l\u2019adoption de la Loi , la procureure g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Qu\u00e9bec a soumis par renvoi la question suivante \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appel du Qu\u00e9bec :\nLa Loi concernant les enfants, les jeunes et les familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations, des Inuits et des M\u00e9tis est-elle ultra vires de la comp\u00e9tence du Parlement du Canada en vertu de la Constitution du Canada?\n[29] Cette question consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si le Parlement avait comp\u00e9tence pour adopter la Loi . Pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette question, il faudra \u00e9galement examiner les objections soulev\u00e9es selon lesquelles la Loi modifie l\u2019architecture constitutionnelle du Canada. L\u2019un des attendus du d\u00e9cret concernant le renvoi fait \u00e9tat de cet aspect pr\u00e9cis :\nAttendu que cette loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale soul\u00e8ve des enjeux constitutionnels fondamentaux eu \u00e9gard notamment au partage des comp\u00e9tences l\u00e9gislatives et \u00e0 l\u2019architecture constitutionnelle du Canada;\n(D\u00e9cret 1288-2019, p. 154)\nV. L\u2019avis de la Cour d\u2019appel du Qu\u00e9bec (2022 QCCA 185)\n[30] \u00c0 la question de savoir si la Loi est ultra vires de la comp\u00e9tence du Parlement, la Cour d\u2019appel a r\u00e9pondu \u00ab non \u00bb, sauf en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019art. 21 et au par. 22(3) de la Loi qui, a-t-elle conclu, modifient ind\u00fbment l\u2019architecture constitutionnelle du Canada.\n[31] Dans son analyse, la Cour d\u2019appel a divis\u00e9 la Loi en deux parties : la \u00ab Partie I \u00bb, notamment l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de normes nationales, et la \u00ab Partie II \u00bb, notamment l\u2019affirmation de la comp\u00e9tence ainsi que les dispositions concernant l\u2019incorporation par renvoi et la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance.\n[32] La Cour d\u2019appel a d\u2019abord fait remarquer qu\u2019il est \u00ab clair que la [DNUDPA] oriente cette intervention l\u00e9gislative \u00bb (par. 27). \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de ce lien, ainsi que de l\u2019objet et des effets de la Loi , la cour a conclu que celle-ci a pour caract\u00e8re v\u00e9ritable \u00ab de prot\u00e9ger et d\u2019assurer le bien-\u00eatre des enfants, familles et peuples autochtones en favorisant des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance qui soient culturellement adapt\u00e9s, et ce, dans le but de mettre fin \u00e0 la surrepr\u00e9sentation des enfants autochtones dans les syst\u00e8mes de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance \u00bb (par. 333). En cons\u00e9quence, la Loi \u00ab constitue un exercice valide de la comp\u00e9tence f\u00e9d\u00e9rale sur les Autochtones \u00bb (par. 355). C\u2019est le cas malgr\u00e9 les possibles effets accessoires de la Loi sur le travail des fonctionnaires provinciaux et malgr\u00e9 les initiatives l\u00e9gislatives ant\u00e9rieures des provinces dans ce domaine (par. 347-349).\n[33] La Cour d\u2019appel a statu\u00e9 que le Parlement \u00ab peut r\u00e9glementer et encadrer les droits ancestraux \u00bb et \u00ab cerner la port\u00e9e de ces droits \u00bb (par. 448), et que cela ne constitue pas une modification de la Constitution, puisque ce sont les tribunaux qui ont le dernier mot \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Selon elle, toutes les dispositions qu\u2019elle a appel\u00e9es la \u00ab Partie II \u00bb seraient invalides si l\u2019affirmation \u00e9nonc\u00e9e au par. 18(1) \u00e9tait erron\u00e9e. Cette partie \u00ab repose uniquement sur la pr\u00e9misse que l\u2019art. 35 reconna\u00eet et confirme le droit \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale des peuples autochtones \u00bb (par. 437). \u00ab Si un tel droit n\u2019est pas compris \u00e0 l\u2019art. 35, alors la Partie II de la Loi doit \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9e inconstitutionnelle dans son ensemble puisque la pr\u00e9misse sur laquelle elle repose est invalide \u00bb (par. 453). En cons\u00e9quence, la Cour d\u2019appel a conclu qu\u2019elle devait se demander si le droit \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille est un droit ancestral reconnu et confirm\u00e9 par l\u2019art. 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 .\n[34] La Cour d\u2019appel a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il y a lieu d\u2019adapter le crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Van der Peet, [1996] 2 R.C.S. 507, dans le contexte de la revendication d\u2019un droit g\u00e9n\u00e9rique \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale. Elle a expliqu\u00e9 que le droit ancestral \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale revendiqu\u00e9 comprend \u00e0 tout le moins le droit \u00e0 l\u2019autor\u00e9glementation en mati\u00e8re de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille (par. 486-494). \u00ab [I]l s\u2019agit d\u2019un droit g\u00e9n\u00e9rique qui s\u2019\u00e9tend \u00e0 tous les peuples autochtones \u00bb (par. 494).\n[35] La Cour d\u2019appel a ensuite conclu que l\u2019art. 21 et le par. 22(3) \u00e9taient invalides, parce qu\u2019ils auraient pour effet de modifier unilat\u00e9ralement la Constitution en donnant priorit\u00e9 aux textes l\u00e9gislatifs d\u2019un groupe, d\u2019une collectivit\u00e9 ou d\u2019un peuple autochtones sur les lois provinciales (par. 538, 541 et 543-544). La cour a expliqu\u00e9 que les textes l\u00e9gislatifs adopt\u00e9s en vertu du droit \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019art. 35 \u00ab ne sont pas des lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales adopt\u00e9es sous l\u2019art. 91 assujeties \u00e0 la doctrine de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, mais plut\u00f4t des lois autochtones qui r\u00e9pondent \u00e0 des imp\u00e9ratifs autochtones \u00bb (par. 540).\nVI. Appels\n[36] Le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Qu\u00e9bec et le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada interjettent appel de l\u2019avis rendu par la Cour d\u2019appel du Qu\u00e9bec. Le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Qu\u00e9bec plaide que l\u2019ensemble de la Loi est ultra vires de la comp\u00e9tence du Parlement, parce qu\u2019elle empi\u00e8te ind\u00fbment sur certains domaines relevant de la comp\u00e9tence exclusive des provinces, particuli\u00e8rement le pouvoir de la province de diriger ses propres organismes, et parce que la Loi repr\u00e9sente une tentative de modification unilat\u00e9rale de la Constitution. Le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada pr\u00e9tend au contraire que la Loi constitue un exercice valide du pouvoir de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer du Parlement en vertu du par. 91(24) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 . Il pr\u00e9tend aussi que les dispositions relatives \u00e0 l\u2019incorporation par renvoi et \u00e0 la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance ne posent aucun probl\u00e8me, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que l\u2019incorporation par renvoi est une technique l\u00e9gislative reconnue depuis longtemps et que la disposition sur la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance ne fait qu\u2019\u00e9noncer, pour plus de certitude, ce que le droit constitutionnel pr\u00e9voit d\u00e9j\u00e0.\nVII. Analyse\n[37] La d\u00e9termination de la validit\u00e9 constitutionnelle d\u2019une loi proc\u00e8de en deux \u00e9tapes, soit d\u2019abord par l\u2019identification de son caract\u00e8re v\u00e9ritable et, ensuite, par sa classification parmi les chefs de comp\u00e9tence \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s aux art. 91 et 92 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 (Murray\u2011Hall c. Qu\u00e9bec (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2023 CSC 10, par. 22, se r\u00e9f\u00e9rant au Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la Loi sur la non\u2011discrimination g\u00e9n\u00e9tique, 2020 CSC 17, [2020] 2 R.C.S. 283, par. 26).\n[38] L\u2019analyse qui suit porte sur la Loi dans son ensemble. C\u2019est donc dire qu\u2019afin de d\u00e9cider de la validit\u00e9 constitutionnelle de la Loi , nous ne faisons pas de distinction entre ce que les procureurs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux ont qualifi\u00e9 de Partie I (art. 1 \u00e0 17, sauf l\u2019al. 8a)) et Partie II (al. 8a) et art. 18 \u00e0 26). Comme la question soumise \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appel du Qu\u00e9bec ne portait sur aucune disposition particuli\u00e8re de la Loi , c\u2019est donc celle-ci dans son int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 qu\u2019il faut d\u2019abord qualifier, puis classifier.\nA. Qualification : Quel est le caract\u00e8re v\u00e9ritable de la Loi ?\n(1) Le cadre d\u2019analyse\n[39] \u00c0 la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse, soit celle de la qualification de la loi, le tribunal identifie l\u2019objet et les effets de celle-ci afin d\u2019en d\u00e9gager l\u2019objet principal ou encore la caract\u00e9ristique dominante (Renvois relatifs \u00e0 la Loi sur la tarification de la pollution caus\u00e9e par les gaz \u00e0 effet de serre, 2021 CSC 11 (\u00ab Renvois sur les gaz \u00e0 effet de serre \u00bb), par. 51, se r\u00e9f\u00e9rant \u00e0 Transport Desgagn\u00e9s inc. c. W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 Canada Inc., 2019 CSC 58, [2019] 4 R.C.S. 228, par. 31). Dans son examen de l\u2019objet de la loi, le tribunal prend en consid\u00e9ration tant des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve intrins\u00e8que, tels que le pr\u00e9ambule de la loi et ses dispositions, que des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve extrins\u00e8que, par exemple le Hansard et les proc\u00e8s-verbaux de comit\u00e9s parlementaires (Renvois sur les gaz \u00e0 effet de serre, par. 51, se r\u00e9f\u00e9rant \u00e0 Bande Kitkatla c. Colombie-Britannique (Ministre des Petites et moyennes entreprises, du Tourisme et de la Culture), 2002 CSC 31, [2002] 2 R.C.S. 146, par. 53, et Banque canadienne de l\u2019Ouest c. Alberta, 2007 CSC 22, [2007] 2 R.C.S. 3, par. 27). Quant \u00e0 l\u2019examen des effets, il implique de s\u2019int\u00e9resser aux effets juridiques, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire ceux d\u00e9coulant directement des dispositions de la loi elle\u2011m\u00eame, et aux effets pratiques, soit les effets \u00ab secondaires \u00bb d\u00e9coulant de son application (Renvois sur les gaz \u00e0 effet de serre, par. 51, se r\u00e9f\u00e9rant \u00e0 Kitkatla, par. 54, et R. c. Morgentaler, [1993] 3 R.C.S. 463, p. 480).\n[40] S\u2019il est utile de prendre en compte le contexte dans lequel la loi a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9dict\u00e9e, la loi elle-m\u00eame doit demeurer le point central de l\u2019exercice de qualification. Comme le soulignait le juge Kasirer dans le Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la Loi sur la non\u2011discrimination g\u00e9n\u00e9tique, \u00ab l\u2019analyse du tribunal relative au caract\u00e8re v\u00e9ritable doit \u00eatre ancr\u00e9e dans le texte des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives contest\u00e9es \u00bb (par. 165). De plus, \u00ab [l]e caract\u00e8re v\u00e9ritable devrait [. . .] exprimer le caract\u00e8re essentiel de la loi en termes aussi pr\u00e9cis que le permet la loi \u00bb (Renvois sur les gaz \u00e0 effet de serre, par. 52, se r\u00e9f\u00e9rant au Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la Loi sur la non\u2011discrimination g\u00e9n\u00e9tique, par. 32).\n(2) Le caract\u00e8re v\u00e9ritable de la Loi\n[41] \u00c0 notre avis, la Loi prot\u00e8ge le bien-\u00eatre des enfants, des jeunes et des familles autochtones en promouvant la fourniture de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille culturellement adapt\u00e9s et, ce faisant, elle favorise le processus de r\u00e9conciliation avec les peuples autochtones. Il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 de son caract\u00e8re v\u00e9ritable, lequel d\u00e9coule de l\u2019objet et des effets de ce texte de loi.\na) L\u2019objet de la Loi\n(i) La preuve intrins\u00e8que\n[42] Le pr\u00e9ambule d\u2019une loi et les dispositions \u00e9non\u00e7ant son objet peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s pour d\u00e9terminer l\u2019objet de la loi en question (Renvois sur les gaz \u00e0 effet de serre, par. 51 et 59). En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019art. 8 \u00e9nonce en trois volets l\u2019objet de la Loi , volets que le pr\u00e9ambule de celle-ci aide \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter.\n[43] Premi\u00e8rement, la Loi a pour objet d\u2019\u00ab affirmer le droit inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale lequel comprend la comp\u00e9tence en mati\u00e8re de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille \u00bb (al. 8a)). Le pr\u00e9ambule situe cet objet dans un contexte plus large, d\u00e9clarant que \u00ab le Parlement affirme le droit \u00e0 l\u2019autod\u00e9termination des peuples autochtones, y compris le droit inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale lequel comprend la comp\u00e9tence en mati\u00e8re de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille \u00bb. Cette affirmation est reprise dans les dispositions substantielles de la Loi (par. 18(1) ) et elle sous\u2011tend la reconnaissance par le Parlement des textes l\u00e9gislatifs des groupes, collectivit\u00e9s ou peuples autochtones. \u00c0 cette fin, la Loi vise \u00ab \u00e0 mener \u00e0 bien la r\u00e9conciliation avec les Premi\u00e8res Nations, les Inuits et les M\u00e9tis gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 des relations renouvel\u00e9es de nation \u00e0 nation, de gouvernement \u00e0 gouvernement et entre les Inuits et la Couronne, qui reposent sur la reconnaissance des droits, le respect, la coop\u00e9ration et le partenariat \u00bb (pr\u00e9ambule).\n[44] Deuxi\u00e8mement, la Loi a pour objet d\u2019\u00e9noncer des normes nationales concernant la fourniture des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille en contexte autochtone (al. 8b) et pr\u00e9ambule), dans le but de garantir le respect de la dignit\u00e9 des enfants autochtones. Le pr\u00e9ambule met d\u2019ailleurs l\u2019accent sur l\u2019importance de cette d\u00e9marche, soulignant que \u00ab la Commission de v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et r\u00e9conciliation du Canada a lanc\u00e9 des appels \u00e0 l\u2019action demandant aux gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, provinciaux et autochtones de travailler ensemble pour le bien-\u00eatre des enfants autochtones et demandant l\u2019\u00e9diction de dispositions l\u00e9gislatives f\u00e9d\u00e9rales qui \u00e9tablissent des normes nationales \u00e0 cette fin \u00bb. Le renvoi \u00e0 l\u2019appel \u00e0 l\u2019action no 4 dans le pr\u00e9ambule tend \u00e0 indiquer que l\u2019intention du Parlement en ce qui concerne les normes nationales n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u2019imposer celles-ci unilat\u00e9ralement, sans \u00e9gard pour le point de vue des groupes, collectivit\u00e9s ou peuples autochtones. De fait, le pr\u00e9ambule fait \u00e9tat de l\u2019engagement du gouvernement du Canada \u00e0 \u00ab dialoguer avec les peuples autochtones et les gouvernements des provinces pour appuyer une r\u00e9forme en profondeur des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille fournis \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des enfants autochtones \u00bb. En cons\u00e9quence, la Loi appuie l\u2019opinion selon laquelle l\u2019intention est de faire en sorte que les normes nationales soient \u00e9labor\u00e9es en collaboration, et qu\u2019elles soient appliqu\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle du pays pour \u00ab aider \u00e0 faire en sorte que les services qui sont fournis [aux enfants autochtones] ne comportent pas de lacune, et ce, qu\u2019ils r\u00e9sident ou non dans une r\u00e9serve \u00bb (pr\u00e9ambule).\n[45] Troisi\u00e8mement, la Loi a pour objet \u00ab de contribuer \u00e0 la mise en \u0153uvre de la D\u00e9claration des Nations Unies sur les droits des peuples autochtones \u00bb (al. 8c)). Le Parlement a choisi d\u2019accorder une importance particuli\u00e8re \u00e0 cet objectif en faisant r\u00e9f\u00e9rence, au tout d\u00e9but du pr\u00e9ambule de la Loi , \u00e0 l\u2019engagement du gouvernement du Canada de mettre en \u0153uvre des aspects de la DNUDPA. D\u2019ailleurs, le libell\u00e9 du texte sugg\u00e8re que le Parlement souhaitait que la Loi dans son ensemble constitue une mesure l\u00e9gislative concr\u00e8te pour mettre en \u0153uvre la DNUDPA en droit canadien.\n[46] De plus, notre Cour a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que \u00ab [l]e titre de la loi [. . .] constitue une forme importante de preuve intrins\u00e8que \u00bb (Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la Loi sur la non\u2011discrimination g\u00e9n\u00e9tique, par. 35; voir aussi Renvois sur les gaz \u00e0 effet de serre, par. 58). Dans la pr\u00e9sente esp\u00e8ce, le titre \u00ab Loi concernant les enfants, les jeunes et les familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations, des Inuits et des M\u00e9tis \u00bb confirme que la Loi a pour pr\u00e9occupation principale les enfants, les jeunes et les familles autochtones. Le pr\u00e9ambule \u00e9nonce une multitude d\u2019objectifs visant ces personnes : \u00ab r\u00e9unir [les enfants autochtones] avec leurs familles et leurs collectivit\u00e9s \u00bb, \u00ab combler [leurs] besoins \u00bb de sorte que \u00ab les services qui sont fournis \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard ne comportent pas de lacune \u00bb, \u00ab mettre fin \u00e0 [leur] surrepr\u00e9sentation [. . .] dans les syst\u00e8mes de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille \u00bb et \u00ab favoriser [leur] dignit\u00e9, [leur] bien-\u00eatre et [leur] plein \u00e9panouissement \u00bb. Ces objectifs participent tous de l\u2019objet fondamental de la Loi , soit la promotion du bien-\u00eatre des enfants, des jeunes et des familles autochtones.\n[47] Consid\u00e9r\u00e9e globalement, la preuve intrins\u00e8que tend \u00e0 indiquer que la Loi a pour objet de prot\u00e9ger le bien-\u00eatre des enfants, des jeunes et des familles autochtones. Cet objet pr\u00e9dominant de la Loi comporte trois aspects : affirmer la comp\u00e9tence des collectivit\u00e9s autochtones en mati\u00e8re de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille; \u00e9tablir des normes nationales applicables dans l\u2019ensemble du Canada; mettre en \u0153uvre des aspects de la DNUDPA en droit canadien. Cependant, comme le fait clairement ressortir la preuve extrins\u00e8que relative \u00e0 l\u2019intention du Parlement, ces trois aspects sont interreli\u00e9s.\n(ii) La preuve extrins\u00e8que\n[48] L\u2019objet d\u00e9gag\u00e9 \u00e0 partir de la preuve intrins\u00e8que est confirm\u00e9 par la preuve extrins\u00e8que, notamment divers extraits du Hansard. Ceux-ci rappellent d\u2019abord la gravit\u00e9 du probl\u00e8me de la surrepr\u00e9sentation des enfants autochtones dans les syst\u00e8mes de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille, probl\u00e8me que plusieurs ont qualifi\u00e9 de \u00ab crise humanitaire \u00bb lors de ces d\u00e9bats (D\u00e9bats de la Chambre des communes, vol. 148, no 392, 1re sess., 42e l\u00e9g., 19 mars 2019, p. 26135 (l\u2019hon. S. O\u2019Regan); D\u00e9bats de la Chambre des communes, vol. 148, no 409, 1re sess., 42e l\u00e9g., 3 mai 2019, p. 27325 (D. Vandal) et 27350 (A. Virani)). Lors de la deuxi\u00e8me lecture du projet de loi C-92, le ministre des Services aux Autochtones a d\u2019ailleurs qualifi\u00e9 de \u00ab statistique d\u00e9sastreuse et honteuse \u00bb le fait que 52 p. 100 des enfants pris en charge par les syst\u00e8mes de protection de l\u2019enfance sont autochtones, alors que les Autochtones repr\u00e9sentent moins de 8 p. 100 de la population canadienne (D\u00e9bats de la Chambre des communes, 19 mars 2019, p. 26135). Nous avons not\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t que le pr\u00e9ambule de la Loi t\u00e9moigne d\u2019une volont\u00e9 de revoir en profondeur l\u2019approche qui \u00e9tait suivie jusque l\u00e0 en mati\u00e8re de protection de l\u2019enfance. Le ministre a formul\u00e9 des propos au m\u00eame effet, soulignant que le \u00ab mod\u00e8le occidental et urbain \u00bb doit \u00eatre revu sans quoi \u00ab nous allons continuer de causer de graves pr\u00e9judices \u00e0 des personnes et \u00e0 des communaut\u00e9s \u00bb (ibid.). \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, la preuve extrins\u00e8que confirme que l\u2019objet de la Loi vise fondamentalement la protection du bien-\u00eatre des enfants, des jeunes et des familles autochtones.\n[49] Les d\u00e9bats permettent \u00e9galement de pr\u00e9ciser en quoi l\u2019objet fondamental de la Loi \u2014 la promotion du bien-\u00eatre des enfants, des jeunes et des familles autochtones \u2014 est intimement li\u00e9 aux trois objectifs identifi\u00e9s \u00e0 partir de la preuve intrins\u00e8que.\n[50] Premi\u00e8rement, le ministre des Services aux Autochtones a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le projet de loi visait \u00e0 affirmer \u00ab sans \u00e9quivoque le droit inh\u00e9rent qu\u2019ont les Premi\u00e8res Nations, les Inuits et les M\u00e9tis d\u2019administrer eux-m\u00eames leurs propres services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille \u00bb (D\u00e9bats de la Chambre des communes, vol. 148, no 425, 1re sess., 42e l\u00e9g., 3 juin 2019, p. 28448). Il a soulign\u00e9 en ces termes l\u2019importance de cette affirmation :\nLe temps est venu de respecter les promesses que nous avons faites aux enfants, aux familles et aux collectivit\u00e9s autochtones. Nous avons promis que le vieux syst\u00e8me d\u00e9faillant qui s\u00e9pare sans raison valable de nombreux enfants de leur famille, qui les \u00e9loigne de leur culture, de leur terre et de leur langue, ne sera pas maintenu. Nous affirmons et reconnaissons que les familles autochtones savent ce qui convient le mieux aux enfants autochtones.\n. . .\n. . . [Les peuples autochtones] ont toujours eu ce droit. \u00c0 pr\u00e9sent, nous le reconnaissons et nous le confirmons. Nous faisons en sorte qu\u2019il devienne r\u00e9alit\u00e9 et donnons aux peuples autochtones la possibilit\u00e9 de trouver des solutions locales efficaces aux probl\u00e8mes. Nous savons que leurs solutions seront plus efficaces. [Nous soulignons.]\n(ibid., p. 28449-28450)\n[51] Deuxi\u00e8mement, relativement aux normes nationales, que r\u00e9clamait l\u2019appel \u00e0 l\u2019action no 4 de la Commission de v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et r\u00e9conciliation, le secr\u00e9taire parlementaire du ministre des Services aux Autochtones a soulign\u00e9 qu\u2019elles visent \u00e0 ce que \u00ab la prestation de tous les services aux enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations, des Inuits et des M\u00e9tis tienne compte des besoins de chaque enfant, y compris celui de grandir en entretenant des liens solides avec sa famille, sa culture, sa langue et sa communaut\u00e9 \u00bb (D\u00e9bats de la Chambre des communes, 3 mai 2019, p. 27324). Il a par ailleurs insist\u00e9 sur le fait que non seulement ces normes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans le cadre d\u2019un vaste processus de consultation impliquant quelque 2 000 particuliers et organismes communautaires, r\u00e9gionaux et nationaux, mais qu\u2019elles pourraient \u00eatre \u00ab enrichi[es] et [. . .] adapt[\u00e9es] [par les communaut\u00e9s autochtones] pour tenir compte de leur culture et de leurs traditions uniques \u00bb (ibid.).\n[52] Troisi\u00e8mement, la preuve extrins\u00e8que confirme aussi que la Loi avait pour but de mettre en \u0153uvre certains aspects de la DNUDPA en droit canadien et que cette mise en \u0153uvre \u00e9tait consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant intimement li\u00e9e \u00e0 la fois \u00e0 l\u2019affirmation du droit \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale des peuples autochtones et \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de normes nationales pour la prestation de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des enfants autochtones. Par exemple, selon le secr\u00e9taire parlementaire du ministre de la Justice et procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada et de la ministre des Institutions d\u00e9mocratiques, la notion de \u00ab comp\u00e9tence inh\u00e9rente \u00bb est \u00ab fondamentale pour le respect de la D\u00e9claration des Nations Unies sur les droits des peuples autochtones \u00bb (D\u00e9bats de la Chambre des communes, 3 mai 2019, p. 27353). De mani\u00e8re analogue, lors de la troisi\u00e8me lecture du projet de loi, le d\u00e9put\u00e9 Mike Bossio a soulign\u00e9 que les normes nationales sont elles-m\u00eames \u00ab conformes \u00e0 la D\u00e9claration des Nations Unies sur les droits des peuples autochtones \u00bb (D\u00e9bats de la Chambre des communes, 3 juin 2019, p. 28459).\n[53] La preuve extrins\u00e8que r\u00e9v\u00e8le donc que les diff\u00e9rents volets de l\u2019objet de la Loi \u00e9taient consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant interreli\u00e9s. L\u2019affirmation de la comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative des groupes, collectivit\u00e9s et peuples autochtones et l\u2019adoption des normes nationales \u00e9taient per\u00e7ues comme faisant partie int\u00e9grante de la mise en \u0153uvre des aspects de la DNUDPA. De m\u00eame, l\u2019affirmation de la comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative autochtone \u00e9tait \u00e9galement consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme ais\u00e9ment conciliable avec les normes nationales formul\u00e9es par le Parlement, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les collectivit\u00e9s autochtones avaient particip\u00e9 \u00e0 leur formulation et qu\u2019il est pr\u00e9vu qu\u2019elles participent \u00e0 leur mise en \u0153uvre par la suite. En cons\u00e9quence, chacun des trois volets de l\u2019objet de la Loi \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 8 est li\u00e9 aux deux autres. Ils constituent autant d\u2019objectifs qui se renforcent mutuellement pour prot\u00e9ger le bien-\u00eatre des enfants, des jeunes et des familles autochtones. La prochaine section porte sur les effets juridiques et pratiques de la Loi dans la poursuite de ces objectifs interreli\u00e9s.\nb) Les effets de la Loi\n(i) Effets juridiques\n[54] C\u2019est \u00e0 partir des dispositions d\u2019un texte de loi qu\u2019on identifie les effets juridiques de celui-ci, en s\u2019interrogeant sur \u00ab la mani\u00e8re dont le texte l\u00e9gislatif dans son ensemble influe sur les droits et les obligations de ceux qui sont assujettis \u00e0 ses dispositions \u00bb (Renvois sur les gaz \u00e0 effet de serre, par. 70, citant Morgentaler, p. 482).\n[55] Dans le pr\u00e9sent cas, les dispositions de la Loi peuvent \u00eatre regroup\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale en trois cat\u00e9gories, qui sont n\u00e9cessairement interreli\u00e9es : (1) les dispositions affirmant le droit \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale; (2) les dispositions \u00e9tablissant des normes nationales; (3) les dispositions \u00e9non\u00e7ant des mesures concr\u00e8tes de mise en \u0153uvre. Ensemble, les dispositions relevant de ces trois cat\u00e9gories cr\u00e9ent un r\u00e9gime national uniforme de protection du bien-\u00eatre des enfants, des jeunes et des familles autochtones.\n1. Les dispositions affirmant le droit \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale\n[56] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 8a) et le par. 18(1) contiennent des affirmations sur la port\u00e9e de l\u2019art. 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 qui lient la Couronne (art. 7). Ces affirmations produisent des effets juridiques substantiels. C\u2019est le cas en raison de certains postulats de base au sujet de la relation qui existe entre la l\u00e9gislation et le gouvernement, que nous allons exposer ci-apr\u00e8s avant de nous pencher sur la fa\u00e7on dont ils \u00e9clairent l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des effets juridiques de la Loi .\n[57] Un postulat fondamental de notre architecture constitutionnelle est la souverainet\u00e9 parlementaire (voir, p. ex., Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la r\u00e9glementation pancanadienne des valeurs mobili\u00e8res, 2018 CSC 48, [2018] 3 R.C.S. 189, par. 56\u201158). Ce principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la souverainet\u00e9 parlementaire au Canada est expliqu\u00e9 ainsi par les professeurs Hogg et Wright : [traduction] \u00ab Non seulement les l\u00e9gislatures ou le Parlement peuvent-ils, en agissant \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur de la sph\u00e8re de comp\u00e9tence qui leur est attribu\u00e9e, \u00e9dicter toute loi qu\u2019ils choisissent d\u2019\u00e9dicter, mais ils peuvent \u00e9galement abroger toute loi qu\u2019ils ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 adopt\u00e9e \u00bb (P. W. Hogg et W. K. Wright, Constitutional Law of Canada (5e \u00e9d. suppl.), \u00a7 12:9 (note en bas de page omise)). Le corollaire logique de ce postulat est que le Parlement et les l\u00e9gislatures peuvent lier la Couronne par des lois (voir, p. ex., P. W. Hogg, P. J. Monahan et W. K. Wright, Liability of the Crown (4e \u00e9d. 2011), p. 396-397). Cela peut \u00eatre accompli au moyen de dispositions expresses ou par implication n\u00e9cessaire (FIOE c. Alberta Government Telephones, [1989] 2 R.C.S. 318, p. 326-330). Par le truchement de ce pouvoir de lier la Couronne, la souverainet\u00e9 parlementaire s\u2019exerce ainsi sur toutes sortes d\u2019acteurs gouvernementaux. En imposant des limites \u00e0 ces acteurs par des lois liant la Couronne, les l\u00e9gislateurs peuvent fa\u00e7onner l\u2019exercice des pouvoirs publics (Dunsmuir c. Nouveau-Brunswick, 2008 CSC 9, [2008] 1 R.C.S. 190, par. 28; voir aussi H. Brun, G. Tremblay et E. Brouillet, Droit constitutionnel (6e \u00e9d. 2014), par. IX.39-IX.41). Les acteurs gouvernementaux sont li\u00e9s par des limites de nature l\u00e9gislative que leur imposent le Parlement et les l\u00e9gislatures, sous r\u00e9serve des imp\u00e9ratifs constitutionnels. C\u2019est \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de ces principes fondateurs que les effets juridiques de l\u2019al. 8a) et du par. 18(1) doivent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s.\n[58] Dans le cas qui nous occupe, l\u2019art. 7 \u00e9nonce express\u00e9ment que la Loi lie la Couronne du chef du Canada ou d\u2019une province. Cette disposition repr\u00e9sente ainsi une \u00ab d\u00e9rogation claire \u00bb \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle voulant que \u00ab nul texte ne lie Sa Majest\u00e9 ni n\u2019a d\u2019effet sur ses droits et pr\u00e9rogatives \u00bb (Thouin, par. 20; Loi d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation , art. 17 ). Pour les besoins de l\u2019analyse de la validit\u00e9 constitutionnelle de la Loi , la question \u00e0 laquelle il faut r\u00e9pondre consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer les effets juridiques de l\u2019al. 8a) et du par. 18(1), lorsque ces dispositions sont examin\u00e9es en corr\u00e9lation avec l\u2019art. 7. Comme l\u2019a soulign\u00e9 la Cour d\u2019appel, \u00ab [l]e proc\u00e9d\u00e9, on en conviendra, est inaccoutum\u00e9. Bien s\u00fbr, les l\u00e9gislatures agissent naturellement sur la foi de leur conviction quant \u00e0 ce que leur permet la Constitution, mais l\u2019affirmation l\u00e9gislative expresse de la signification ou de la port\u00e9e d\u2019une disposition constitutionnelle sort de l\u2019ordinaire r\u00e9dactionnel \u00bb (par. 222). De fait, la Cour d\u2019appel a soulign\u00e9 que cette approche d\u00e9claratoire est \u00ab inhabituelle, sinon inusit\u00e9e \u00bb (par. 515). Le pr\u00e9sent renvoi offre une occasion d\u2019expliquer les effets juridiques de ces dispositions.\n[59] En \u00e9dictant une affirmation contraignante, le Parlement lie le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la position qu\u2019il a affirm\u00e9e en tant que r\u00e8gle de droit positif d\u2019origine l\u00e9gislative (voir, p. ex., Wilkins, p. 184\u2011185). C\u2019est le cas parce que, comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 expliqu\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, les acteurs gouvernementaux sont li\u00e9s par les lois qui cr\u00e9ent, structurent et circonscrivent leurs pouvoirs. L\u2019obligation impos\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019art. 7 est de nature l\u00e9gislative. Elle lie la Couronne, tant f\u00e9d\u00e9rale que provinciale, par le biais d\u2019une \u00ab d\u00e9rogation claire \u00bb au principe de l\u2019immunit\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00c9tat, d\u00e9rogation adopt\u00e9e dans une loi constitutionnellement valide en vertu du par. 91(24) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 (voir Thouin, par. 20).\n[60] Il est vrai que le Parlement affirme, dans la Loi , le droit inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale, droit qui, comme le pr\u00e9cise le pr\u00e9ambule, comprend la comp\u00e9tence en mati\u00e8re de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille. Ajoutons que le Parlement pr\u00e9cise, \u00e0 l\u2019art. 2 , que la Loi maintient les droits des peuples autochtones reconnus et confirm\u00e9s par l\u2019art. 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 ; elle n\u2019y porte pas atteinte. Si le Parlement ne peut lier les tribunaux \u2014 en leur qualit\u00e9 de gardiens de la Constitution \u2014 ou encore les provinces, relativement \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation d\u00e9finitive \u00e0 donner \u00e0 l\u2019art. 35, ces affirmations l\u00e9gislatives sont lourdes de sens sur le terrain, o\u00f9 les questions se rapportant au bien-\u00eatre des enfants se d\u00e9cident. En consacrant au par. 18(1) de la Loi sa compr\u00e9hension de la port\u00e9e de cette disposition constitutionnelle, le Parlement s\u2019engage \u00e0 agir comme si les peuples autochtones b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient d\u2019un droit inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale en mati\u00e8re de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille. De surcro\u00eet, en liant express\u00e9ment la Couronne \u00e0 cette affirmation par le biais de l\u2019art. 7, le Parlement s\u2019assure que cette derni\u00e8re s\u2019engage pareillement \u00e0 agir en conformit\u00e9 avec sa position selon laquelle ce droit \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale \u00e9tait reconnu. \u00c9videmment, il demeure que tous les acteurs du syst\u00e8me, y compris les provinces, peuvent contester devant les tribunaux la compr\u00e9hension du Parlement quant \u00e0 la port\u00e9e des droits reconnus et confirm\u00e9s par l\u2019art. 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 . Il est bien possible en effet qu\u2019une province fasse une lecture diff\u00e9rente de l\u2019art. 35 de celle exprim\u00e9e au par. 18(1) de la Loi . Ultimement, ce sont les tribunaux qui auront le dernier mot sur la port\u00e9e de l\u2019art. 35, vu sa nature constitutionnelle.\n[61] Dans la mesure o\u00f9 l\u2019affirmation \u00e9nonc\u00e9e au par. 18(1) figure dans une loi qui est constitutionnellement valide au regard du par. 91(24) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 , l\u2019affirmation du Parlement et l\u2019engagement corollaire de la Couronne produisent leur effet. L\u2019affirmation par le Parlement que le gouvernement compte agir en conformit\u00e9 avec sa position selon laquelle les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance rel\u00e8vent d\u2019un droit inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale semble d\u2019ailleurs \u00eatre conforme \u00e0 la politique mise en place par le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard par suite de l\u2019issue de l\u2019Accord de Charlottetown de 1992 (voir les explications des auteurs P. W. Hogg et M. E. Turpel, \u00ab Implementing Aboriginal Self-Government : Constitutional and Jurisdictional Issues \u00bb (1995), 74 R. du B. can. 187, p. 189).\n[62] D\u00e8s lors, un des effets de l\u2019art. 7 de la Loi est que dor\u00e9navant le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ne peut plus soutenir, dans quelque instance ou discussion, qu\u2019il n\u2019existe pas de droit autochtone \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale en mati\u00e8re de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille. Alors que jusqu\u2019ici peu de cadres l\u00e9gislatifs circonscrivaient les actions de la Couronne \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des peuples autochtones (J. Promislow et N. Metallic, \u00ab Realizing Aboriginal Administrative Law \u00bb, dans C. M. Flood et P. Daly, dir., Administrative Law in Context (4e \u00e9d. 2022), 129, p. 141), le Parlement a maintenant \u00e9tabli une telle contrainte par le biais de cette affirmation de nature l\u00e9gislative qui lie Sa Majest\u00e9.\n[63] Le jeu combin\u00e9 de l\u2019art. 7, de l\u2019al. 8a) et et du par. 18(1) de la Loi pourrait aussi produire d\u2019autres effets juridiques en obligeant la Couronne \u00e0 agir comme si le principe de l\u2019honneur de la Couronne est engag\u00e9. Comme l\u2019a rappel\u00e9 la Cour dans le contexte d\u2019un trait\u00e9, l\u2019honneur de la Couronne est \u00ab toujours en jeu \u00bb lorsque celle-ci transige avec les peuples autochtones (R. c. Badger, [1996] 1 R.C.S. 771, par. 41). Comme son nom le sugg\u00e8re, le principe de l\u2019honneur de la Couronne renvoie \u00e0 cette \u00ab relation particuli\u00e8re, qui exige que la Couronne agisse honorablement envers [les peuples autochtones] \u00bb (Mikisew Cree First Nation c. Canada (Gouverneur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral en conseil), 2018 CSC 40, [2018] 2 R.C.S. 765, par. 21, se r\u00e9f\u00e9rant \u00e0 Manitoba Metis Federation Inc. c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2013 CSC 14, [2013] 1 R.C.S. 623, par. 67, et B. Slattery, \u00ab Aboriginal Rights and the Honour of the Crown \u00bb (2005), 29 S.C.L.R. (2d) 433, p. 436).\n[64] Il est loisible au Parlement d\u2019affirmer, comme il l\u2019a fait au par. 18(1), ce qu\u2019il consid\u00e8re \u00eatre les exigences constitutionnelles de la r\u00e9conciliation, m\u00eame s\u2019il ne peut, ce faisant, modifier unilat\u00e9ralement la Constitution. En reliant l\u2019affirmation du par. 18(1) \u00e0 l\u2019art. 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 , et plus particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 son premier paragraphe, le Parlement s\u2019est tout de m\u00eame intentionnellement engag\u00e9 sur une voie de r\u00e9conciliation particuli\u00e8re. En effet, il a consacr\u00e9 dans une simple loi sa compr\u00e9hension de la port\u00e9e d\u2019une disposition constitutionnelle, et il l\u2019a fait tout en s\u2019assurant que la Couronne est tenue d\u2019agir sur la foi de cette m\u00eame compr\u00e9hension, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019affirmation l\u00e9gislative selon laquelle le droit inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale poss\u00e8de un statut constitutionnel, et \u00e0 l\u2019id\u00e9e que ce droit comprend, sur le plan juridictionnel, la comp\u00e9tence des corps dirigeants autochtones en mati\u00e8re de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille. Ainsi, l\u2019honneur de la Couronne entre en jeu.\n[65] L\u2019affirmation pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019al. 8a) et au par. 18(1) \u00e9clairera le contexte et le contenu des obligations qui en d\u00e9coulent, comme si cette affirmation \u00e9tait ench\u00e2ss\u00e9e dans la Constitution. Comme l\u2019a expliqu\u00e9 notre Cour, \u00ab [l]\u2019honneur de la Couronne prend sa source dans la Constitution \u00bb (Manitoba Metis, par. 70). Aux termes de la Loi , le gouvernement s\u2019engage formellement \u00e0 agir en conformit\u00e9 avec la position selon laquelle ce droit poss\u00e8de un statut constitutionnel (voir Manitoba Metis, par. 69\u201170). L\u2019honneur de la Couronne n\u2019est pas simplement une \u00ab belle formule \u00bb, mais elle \u00ab peut s\u2019appliquer dans des situations concr\u00e8tes \u00bb; elle \u00ab fait na\u00eetre diff\u00e9rentes obligations selon les circonstances \u00bb (Nation ha\u00efda c. Colombie-Britannique (Ministre des For\u00eats), 2004 CSC 73, [2004] 3 R.C.S. 511, par. 16 et 18, cit\u00e9 dans Mikisew Cree, par. 24). Comme l\u2019a dit la Cour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Manitoba Metis, \u00ab le principe de l\u2019honneur de la Couronne oblige la Couronne : (1) \u00e0 adopter une approche lib\u00e9rale et t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique dans l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la promesse; (2) \u00e0 agir avec diligence pour s\u2019acquitter de la promesse \u00bb (par. 75).\n[66] Le fait que l\u2019art. 7 de la Loi oblige la Couronne \u00e0 agir comme si le droit \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale d\u00e9crit au par. 18(1) avait \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9 implique donc que cette derni\u00e8re doit adopter une approche lib\u00e9rale dans l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de ce droit, et agir de mani\u00e8re diligente lorsqu\u2019elle le met en \u0153uvre, et ce, tant que cette affirmation fait partie du droit en vigueur. En effet, l\u2019affirmation l\u00e9gislative concernant la port\u00e9e de l\u2019art. 35 \u00ab promet la reconnaissance de droits, et \u201c[i]l faut toujours pr\u00e9sumer que [la Couronne] entend respecter ses promesses\u201d \u00bb, en l\u2019occurrence celle d\u2019agir comme si le droit des peuples autochtones \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale en mati\u00e8re de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille \u00e9tait reconnu, en attendant que les tribunaux se prononcent formellement sur la question (Nation ha\u00efda, par. 20, citant Badger, par. 41).\n2. Les dispositions \u00e9tablissant des normes nationales\n[67] Les normes et principes nationaux \u00e9nonc\u00e9s aux art. 9 \u00e0 17 de la Loi \u00e9tablissent un cadre normatif applicable, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle du pays, relativement \u00e0 la fourniture de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille culturellement adapt\u00e9s. En vertu de l\u2019art. 7, ce cadre normatif lie les fournisseurs f\u00e9d\u00e9raux et provinciaux assurant de tels services, ainsi que les fournisseurs autochtones dans certains cas (par. 22(1)).\n[68] Certains de ces principes orientent l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la Loi par les tribunaux et r\u00e9gissent son application par les gouvernements. Parmi ces principes, mentionnons l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de l\u2019enfant (par. 9(1)), la continuit\u00e9 culturelle (par. 9(2)) et l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle (par. 9(3)).\n[69] La norme relative au principe de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de l\u2019enfant autochtone, en particulier, est d\u00e9crite de fa\u00e7on tr\u00e8s d\u00e9taill\u00e9e (art. 10). La Loi prescrit certaines circonstances dans lesquelles ce principe doit \u00eatre une consid\u00e9ration primordiale ou la consid\u00e9ration fondamentale dans la prise de d\u00e9cisions ou de mesures \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un enfant autochtone (par. 10(1)). Elle dresse aussi une liste non exhaustive de facteurs pertinents dont il doit \u00eatre tenu compte pour d\u00e9terminer l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat d\u2019un enfant autochtone, notamment \u00ab l\u2019importance pour [l\u2019enfant] de pr\u00e9server son identit\u00e9 culturelle et ses liens avec la langue et le territoire du groupe, de la collectivit\u00e9 ou du peuple autochtones dont il fait partie \u00bb (al. 10(3)d)).\n[70] D\u2019autres dispositions r\u00e9gissent directement la fourniture de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des enfants autochtones, ind\u00e9pendamment de la nature des services fournis (art. 11 \u00e0 15.1). \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, certaines des normes \u00e9tablies ont un caract\u00e8re proc\u00e9dural. Dans certaines circonstances, par exemple, les dispositions exigent des fournisseurs de services qu\u2019ils avisent les parents de l\u2019enfant ainsi que le corps dirigeant autochtone concern\u00e9 (art. 12). Une autre disposition pr\u00e9voit le droit de faire des repr\u00e9sentations dans le cadre de proc\u00e9dures judiciaires de nature civile relatives \u00e0 la fourniture de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un enfant autochtone (art. 13). D\u2019autres normes r\u00e9gissent la nature des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille fournis \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des enfants autochtones. Par exemple, les fournisseurs de services sont tenus d\u2019accorder la priorit\u00e9 aux soins pr\u00e9ventifs dans certaines circonstances (art. 14), et l\u2019enfant ne doit pas \u00eatre pris en charge \u00ab seulement en raison de sa condition socio-\u00e9conomique, notamment la pauvret\u00e9, le manque de logement ou d\u2019infrastructures convenables et l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 de son parent \u2014 m\u00e8re ou p\u00e8re \u2014 ou de son fournisseur de soins \u00bb (art. 15). De plus, avant qu\u2019un enfant autochtone ne puisse \u00eatre pris en charge, le responsable de la fourniture de services \u00e0 cet enfant a l\u2019obligation de d\u00e9montrer que des efforts raisonnables ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits pour que celui-ci continue de r\u00e9sider avec ses parents ou avec un autre membre de sa famille qui est un adulte, sauf si sa prise en charge imm\u00e9diate est compatible avec son int\u00e9r\u00eat (art. 15.1).\n[71] Enfin, la Loi \u00e9tablit l\u2019ordre de priorit\u00e9 ainsi que des normes connexes \u00e0 suivre en cas de placement d\u2019enfants autochtones par des fournisseurs de services f\u00e9d\u00e9raux et provinciaux (art. 16 et 17).\n3. Les dispositions \u00e9non\u00e7ant des mesures concr\u00e8tes de mise en \u0153uvre\n[72] La Loi cr\u00e9e diff\u00e9rents m\u00e9canismes facilitant l\u2019exercice du droit des peuples autochtones \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale (art. 20 \u00e0 24). \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, la Loi pr\u00e9voit la possibilit\u00e9 pour un corps dirigeant autochtone de conclure un accord de coordination avec les gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux (par. 20(2)). Un tel accord peut porter sur toute mesure li\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019exercice du droit \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale par le groupe, la collectivit\u00e9 ou le peuple autochtones pour lequel agit ce corps dirigeant. De plus, lorsqu\u2019un tel accord est conclu \u2014 ou lorsque des efforts raisonnables ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s \u00e0 cette fin \u2014 le texte l\u00e9gislatif li\u00e9 \u00e0 cet accord a force de loi \u00e0 titre de loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (par. 21(1)), et il a pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance sur la vaste majorit\u00e9 des lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales (par. 22(1)).\n[73] La Loi affirme par ailleurs que les textes l\u00e9gislatifs d\u2019un groupe, d\u2019une collectivit\u00e9 ou d\u2019un peuple autochtones ont force normative ind\u00e9pendante en droit canadien. Le paragraphe 21(1) pr\u00e9cise que ces textes l\u00e9gislatifs ont \u00ab \u00e9galement force de loi \u00bb, ind\u00e9pendamment de leur incorporation \u00e0 titre de loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Les paragraphes 20(1) et (2) confirment en outre qu\u2019un groupe, une collectivit\u00e9 ou un peuple autochtones peut exercer sa \u00ab comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative en mati\u00e8re de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance \u00bb sans avoir conclu d\u2019accord de coordination. Tant les gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral que provinciaux sont li\u00e9s par cette reconnaissance l\u00e9gislative (art. 7).\n[74] Enfin, la Loi pr\u00e9voit plusieurs autres m\u00e9canismes accompagnant l\u2019affirmation \u00e9nonc\u00e9e au par. 18(1), dont le processus de r\u00e9solution \u00e0 privil\u00e9gier en cas de conflit entre deux textes l\u00e9gislatifs d\u2019un groupe, d\u2019une collectivit\u00e9 ou d\u2019un peuple autochtones diff\u00e9rents (art. 24). En somme, ces m\u00e9canismes facilitent l\u2019adoption par les groupes, collectivit\u00e9s ou peuples autochtones de mesures l\u00e9gislatives sur les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille.\n(ii) Effets pratiques\n[75] Les effets pratiques sont d\u2019une utilit\u00e9 relative aux fins de qualification de la Loi , puisque celle-ci n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e que r\u00e9cemment et que ses retomb\u00e9es \u00ab r\u00e9el[les] ou pr\u00e9vu[es] \u00bb, pour reprendre les termes utilis\u00e9s dans Morgentaler (\u00e0 la p. 483), ne peuvent \u00eatre \u00e9tablies avec pr\u00e9cision. Toutefois, il est raisonnable de pr\u00e9voir que les enfants et les familles autochtones recevront des services mieux adapt\u00e9s \u00e0 leurs r\u00e9alit\u00e9s culturelles (voir, p. ex., Public Inquiry into the Administration of Justice and Aboriginal People, Report of the Aboriginal Justice Inquiry of Manitoba, vol. 1, The Justice System and Aboriginal People (1991), c. 14). Et il est raisonnablement permis de penser que cela r\u00e9duira la surrepr\u00e9sentation des enfants autochtones dans les \u00e9tablissements de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille et contribuera \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger le bien-\u00eatre des enfants, des jeunes et des familles autochtones.\n[76] Il est raisonnable de penser que la Loi permettra d\u2019\u00e9viter le [traduction] \u00ab gaspillage de temps et de ressources \u00bb qu\u2019impliquent des litiges ou n\u00e9gociations prolong\u00e9es sur la question de savoir si un groupe, une collectivit\u00e9 ou un peuple autochtones donn\u00e9 a comp\u00e9tence en mati\u00e8re de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille, et si oui dans quelle mesure (voir, p. ex., Metallic, p. 14 et 20-22). La Loi peut ainsi s\u2019av\u00e9rer un moyen pratique de favoriser la r\u00e9conciliation avec les peuples autochtones. Il est indubitable que les litiges constitutionnels et les r\u00e8glements n\u00e9goci\u00e9s demeurent eux aussi des outils essentiels pour faire progresser la r\u00e9conciliation. Ils ne constituent toutefois pas la seule voie. Des initiatives l\u00e9gislatives con\u00e7ues de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 favoriser la r\u00e9conciliation sont \u00e9galement possibles et peuvent, \u00e0 certains \u00e9gards, pr\u00e9senter des avantages.\n[77] Certains avantages pratiques du recours \u00e0 la voie l\u00e9gislative plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00e0 la voie judiciaire et aux litiges constitutionnels sont \u00e9vidents. Le fait de ne pas devoir prouver l\u2019existence d\u2019un droit ancestral \u00e0 partir de crit\u00e8res jurisprudentiels permet d\u2019\u00e9viter [traduction] \u00ab des ann\u00e9es, voire des d\u00e9cennies \u00bb de litige pendant lesquelles les enfants et les familles autochtones [traduction] \u00ab continuent \u00e0 p\u00e2tir pendant que perdure le statu quo \u00bb (m.i., Aseniwuche Winewak Nation of Canada, par. 87; m.i., Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada, par. 94; voir aussi m. interv., Indigenous Bar Association in Canada, par. 18; m. interv., Ralliement national des M\u00e9tis et autres, par. 10). \u00c9viter tout un cycle de litiges [traduction] \u00ab permet aux groupes autochtones et \u00e0 la Couronne de consacrer leur temps et leurs ressources \u00e0 ce qui constitue v\u00e9ritablement le fond de l\u2019enjeu : le soin des enfants \u00bb (m. interv., Carrier Sekani Family Services Society et autres, par. 11). Comme l\u2019a reconnu notre Cour, \u00ab [o]n ne parvient que rarement, voire jamais, \u00e0 une v\u00e9ritable r\u00e9conciliation dans une salle d\u2019audience \u00bb (Clyde River (Hameau) c. Petroleum Geo\u2011Services Inc., 2017 CSC 40, [2017] 1 R.C.S. 1069, par. 24). Voil\u00e0 pourquoi notre Cour a encourag\u00e9 la recherche de la r\u00e9conciliation \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur des tribunaux (Delgamuukw c. Colombie-Britannique, [1997] 3 R.C.S. 1010, par. 186).\n[78] De m\u00eame, le processus l\u00e9gislatif qu\u2019a choisi le Parlement peut pr\u00e9senter des avantages par rapport aux r\u00e8glements n\u00e9goci\u00e9s. Comme l\u2019ont reconnu des auteurs de doctrine, [traduction] \u00ab les trait\u00e9s modernes ont habituellement n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 des ann\u00e9es, voire des d\u00e9cennies, de n\u00e9gociations fort co\u00fbteuses \u00bb (voir, p. ex., Wilkins, p. 184). Les initiatives l\u00e9gislatives peuvent aller de l\u2019avant plus rapidement, \u00eatre moins on\u00e9reuses et avoir une port\u00e9e plus large (ibid.; voir aussi Metallic, p. 14).\n[79] En cons\u00e9quence, la Loi a pour effets pratiques attendus d\u2019aider \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger le bien-\u00eatre des enfants, des jeunes et des familles autochtones, et de favoriser la r\u00e9conciliation avec les peuples autochtones. Les effets pratiques des trois cat\u00e9gories interreli\u00e9es de dispositions que nous avons examin\u00e9es ci-dessus vont dans le m\u00eame sens.\n1. Les dispositions affirmant le droit \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale\n[80] L\u2019affirmation r\u00e9alise, en tant qu\u2019effet pratique, ce que des auteurs appellent la \u00ab fonction p\u00e9dagogique, \u00e9ducative \u00bb du droit (J. Carbonnier, Flexible droit : pour une sociologie du droit sans rigueur (10e \u00e9d. 2001), p. 155). \u00c0 travers elle, les lois \u00ab contribue[nt] \u00e0 former les m\u0153urs, lesquelles s\u2019int\u00e9rioriseront, se sublimeront en une \u00e9thique \u00bb (Carbonnier, p. 157). Compte tenu de cette fonction, il est clair qu\u2019une loi ne dresse pas simplement une [traduction] \u00ab liste de prescriptions, d\u2019ordres ou de directives \u00bb; elle \u00e9tablit \u00e9galement \u00ab un ensemble de sujets, un ensemble de termes au moyen desquels ces sujets peuvent \u00eatre discut\u00e9s, ainsi que des orientations g\u00e9n\u00e9rales sur le processus de r\u00e9flexion et de justification au regard duquel elle doit \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e \u00bb (J. B. White, \u00ab Rhetoric and Law : The Arts of Cultural and Communal Life \u00bb, dans J. B. White, Heracles\u2019 Bow : Essays on the Rhetoric and Poetics of the Law (1985), 28, p. 41).\n[81] L\u2019affirmation que contient la Loi peut en partie \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme un pas en vue d\u2019op\u00e9rer un changement, une adaptation de la culture qui anime l\u2019action des gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux (voir Christie, p. 60). Mais par les lois et leurs pr\u00e9ambules, le Parlement [traduction] \u00ab engage [aussi] un dialogue avec les tribunaux et la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00bb, pour reprendre une formule utilis\u00e9e par le professeur Kent Roach \u00e0 propos de l\u2019usage des pr\u00e9ambules (\u00ab The Uses and Audiences of Preambles in Legislation \u00bb (2001), 47 R.D. McGill 129, p. 159). Dans un esprit p\u00e9dagogique, le Parlement a utilis\u00e9 la Loi pour communiquer aux tribunaux et \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 sa position, soit que le droit doit reconna\u00eetre l\u2019importance de l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale des Autochtones en ce qui concerne les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille. En cons\u00e9quence, l\u2019utilisation \u00ab inusit\u00e9e \u00bb d\u2019affirmations du droit \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale s\u2019explique en partie par le fait que le Parlement tente de convaincre d\u2019autres institutions d\u2019adopter la position qu\u2019il a maintenant adopt\u00e9e. Dans les domaines o\u00f9 le Parlement ne peut ordonner, enjoindre ou intimer aux institutions d\u2019adopter sa position, cette fonction p\u00e9dagogique pourrait n\u00e9anmoins, avec le temps, contribuer \u00e0 inculquer de nouvelles attitudes ou approches qui favoriseront davantage une culture de respect envers les peuples autochtones du Canada et de r\u00e9conciliation avec eux.\n[82] La question de savoir si cette initiative se concr\u00e9tisera, et si oui de quelle mani\u00e8re, est une question qui d\u00e9passe la capacit\u00e9 institutionnelle d\u2019\u00e9valuation des tribunaux. Mais il s\u2019agit d\u2019un effet pratique anticip\u00e9 qui aide \u00e0 comprendre l\u2019\u00ab enjeu essentiel \u00bb que la Loi cherche \u00e0 r\u00e9gler.\n2. Les dispositions \u00e9tablissant des normes nationales\n[83] Il est possible que les groupes, collectivit\u00e9s ou peuples autochtones ne souhaitent pas exercer imm\u00e9diatement la comp\u00e9tence affirm\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019art. 18 de la Loi . Sur ce point comme sur d\u2019autres, le Parlement vise \u00e0 \u00ab respecter la diversit\u00e9 de tous les peuples autochtones \u00bb (Loi , pr\u00e9ambule). Comme pour d\u2019autres aspects de la r\u00e9conciliation, la pleine r\u00e9alisation de la comp\u00e9tence reconnue aux Autochtones dans la Loi \u00ab n\u00e9cessitera du temps \u00bb (Honorer la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, r\u00e9concilier pour l\u2019avenir, p. viii). Dans l\u2019intervalle, toutefois, bon nombre des normes nationales \u00e9nonc\u00e9es pourraient avoir pour effet, en pratique, de faire en sorte que les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille fournis \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des enfants autochtones soient culturellement adapt\u00e9s \u00e0 ceux-ci et conformes \u00e0 leur int\u00e9r\u00eat.\n[84] Certaines des normes ont une port\u00e9e pr\u00e9ventive, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire qu\u2019elles interviennent avant toute prise de d\u00e9cision importante ou mesure dans le cadre de la fourniture de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un enfant autochtone. On peut raisonnablement s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce que ces normes diminuent la propension historique des syst\u00e8mes de protection de l\u2019enfance \u00e0 prendre en charge les enfants autochtones et ainsi \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elles contribuent, lorsque cela est possible, \u00e0 leur maintien dans leur milieu d\u2019origine (voir, p. ex., Rapport final de la Commission de v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et r\u00e9conciliation du Canada, vol. 5, Pensionnats du Canada : Les s\u00e9quelles (2015), p. 63). D\u2019autres normes interviennent apr\u00e8s qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision ait \u00e9t\u00e9 prise de placer l\u2019enfant. Celles-ci sont vraisemblablement susceptibles de r\u00e9duire le placement massif et disproportionn\u00e9 des enfants autochtones en dehors de leurs familles et de leurs communaut\u00e9s. Le fait de s\u2019attaquer \u00e0 la surrepr\u00e9sentation prot\u00e8ge le bien-\u00eatre des enfants, des jeunes et des familles autochtones.\n3. Les dispositions \u00e9non\u00e7ant des mesures concr\u00e8tes de mise en \u0153uvre\n[85] Les mesures concr\u00e8tes de mise en \u0153uvre que pr\u00e9voit la Loi doivent s\u2019interpr\u00e9ter \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la DNUDPA. Conform\u00e9ment aux obligations que lui impose le droit positif du pays, le gouvernement canadien, \u00ab en consultation et en collaboration avec les peuples autochtones, prend toutes les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour veiller \u00e0 ce que les lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales soient compatibles avec la D\u00e9claration \u00bb (Loi sur la DNUDPA, art. 5). \u00c0 cette fin, le ministre \u00ab \u00e9labore et met en \u0153uvre [. . .] un plan d\u2019action afin d\u2019atteindre les objectifs de la D\u00e9claration \u00bb (par. 6(1)) et pr\u00e9pare un rapport annuel sur les progr\u00e8s r\u00e9alis\u00e9s en vue de s\u2019acquitter de cette obligation (par. 7(1)). Le premier rapport d\u2019avancement annuel traitant de ces mesures a soulign\u00e9 le lien qui existe entre la Loi et l\u2019engagement plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de mettre en \u0153uvre la DNUDPA (Minist\u00e8re de la Justice du Canada, Rapport d\u2019avancement annuel sur la mise en \u0153uvre de la Loi sur la D\u00e9claration des Nations Unies sur les droits des peuples autochtones (2022), p. 16, 36-38 et 41-43).\n[86] Il ne fait gu\u00e8re de doute que la Loi a pour effet pratique anticip\u00e9 de rendre le droit canadien davantage compatible avec la DNUDPA. Comme l\u2019ont fait remarquer des auteurs, la DNUDPA d\u00e9crit le lien entre les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille et les droits des peuples autochtones (voir, p. ex., S. Grammond, \u00ab Federal Legislation on Indigenous Child Welfare in Canada \u00bb (2018), 28:1 R.L.P.S. 132, p. 133). De fait, le pr\u00e9ambule de la DNUDPA est explicite \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard : l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a reconnu \u00ab le droit des familles et des communaut\u00e9s autochtones de conserver la responsabilit\u00e9 partag\u00e9e de l\u2019\u00e9ducation, de la formation, de l\u2019instruction et du bien-\u00eatre de leurs enfants, conform\u00e9ment aux droits de l\u2019enfant \u00bb. Plusieurs des droits \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la DNUDPA expriment des aspects de ce droit. Par exemple, l\u2019art. 4 \u00e9nonce le droit des peuples autochtones d\u2019\u00eatre autonomes ou de s\u2019administrer eux-m\u00eames pour ce qui touche \u00e0 leurs affaires int\u00e9rieures et locales. L\u2019article 7 affirme, entre autres, le droit des peuples autochtones de ne pas faire l\u2019objet de transfert forc\u00e9 d\u2019enfants \u00e0 un autre groupe. L\u2019article 13 reconna\u00eet aux peuples autochtones le droit de transmettre leur culture aux g\u00e9n\u00e9rations futures, et l\u2019obligation corr\u00e9lative des \u00c9tats de prendre des mesures efficaces pour assurer la protection de ce droit.\n[87] En outre, l\u2019art. 38 d\u00e9clare que \u00ab [l]es \u00c9tats prennent, en consultation et en coop\u00e9ration avec les peuples autochtones, les mesures appropri\u00e9es, y compris l\u00e9gislatives, pour atteindre les buts de la [DNUDPA]. \u00bb Le gouvernement du Canada s\u2019est engag\u00e9 \u00e0 prendre ces mesures (Loi sur la DNUDPA, pr\u00e9ambule). La Loi constitue un pas de plus vers le respect de cet engagement.\n[88] Par ailleurs, soulignons que cette initiative du Parlement est conforme de deux mani\u00e8res \u00e0 l\u2019id\u00e9e d\u00e9j\u00e0 avanc\u00e9e par notre Cour selon laquelle \u00ab [m]\u00eame si les revendications autochtones sont et peuvent \u00eatre r\u00e9gl\u00e9es dans le cadre de litiges, il est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de recourir \u00e0 la n\u00e9gociation pour concilier les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la Couronne et ceux des Autochtones \u00bb (Clyde River, par. 24, citant Nation ha\u00efda, par. 14; voir aussi R. c. Desautel, 2021 CSC 17, par. 87). En effet, non seulement la Loi est-elle le fruit d\u2019un long processus de consultation et de collaboration avec les peuples autochtones, mais elle met \u00e9galement en place des m\u00e9canismes visant \u00e0 faciliter et \u00e0 encourager, dans une perspective d\u2019avenir, la n\u00e9gociation d\u2019ententes entre la Couronne et les communaut\u00e9s autochtones (voir la Loi, art. 20 \u00e0 22 ).\n[89] Il est \u00e9galement permis de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce que les dispositions de la Loi \u00e9non\u00e7ant des mesures concr\u00e8tes de mise en \u0153uvre des aspects de la DNUDPA li\u00e9s aux enfants autochtones favoriseront la r\u00e9conciliation avec les peuples autochtones. Comme le reconna\u00eet le pr\u00e9ambule de la Loi sur la DNUDPA, la \u00ab Commission de v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et r\u00e9conciliation du Canada demande aux gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, provinciaux et territoriaux et aux administrations municipales d\u2019adopter et de mettre en \u0153uvre la D\u00e9claration et d\u2019en faire le cadre de la r\u00e9conciliation \u00bb. L\u2019Enqu\u00eate nationale sur les femmes et les filles autochtones disparues et assassin\u00e9es a repris cet appel (Rapport final, vol. 1b, p. 199, appel \u00e0 la justice 1.2(v)). On peut s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce que, en prenant des mesures concr\u00e8tes en ce sens, le Canada se rapproche de l\u2019objectif \u00ab [d\u2019]\u00e9tablir et [de] maintenir une relation de respect r\u00e9ciproque entre les peuples autochtones et non autochtones dans ce pays \u00bb (Honorer la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, r\u00e9concilier pour l\u2019avenir, p. 7).\n[90] Bien que l\u2019on s\u2019attende \u00e0 ce que la Loi acc\u00e9l\u00e8re certains aspects du processus de r\u00e9conciliation, il faut n\u00e9anmoins reconna\u00eetre que la r\u00e9conciliation constitue un projet \u00e0 long terme. Elle ne se r\u00e9alisera pas \u00e0 l\u2019occasion d\u2019un seul et unique moment sacr\u00e9, mais plut\u00f4t \u00e0 travers une transformation continue des relations et un tressage des diff\u00e9rentes traditions juridiques et sources de pouvoir existantes (voir J. Leclair, \u00ab Zeus, Metis and Athena : The Path Towards the Constitutional Recognition of Full-Blown Indigenous Legal Orders \u00bb (2023), 27:2 R. \u00e9tudes const. 77; cf. H. Cyr, Canadian Federalism and Treaty Powers : Organic Constitutionalism at Work (2009), p. 37\u201138; voir aussi J. Borrows, \u00ab Donner une nouvelle vie \u00e0 la Constitution canadienne, qui est autochtone : deux d\u00e9fis \u00e0 relever \u00bb, dans Mise en application de la DNUDPA : Tisser des liens entre le droit autochtone et les lois internationales et nationales (2017), 22).\nc) Conclusion sur le caract\u00e8re v\u00e9ritable de la Loi\n[91] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, la Loi a pour objet de prot\u00e9ger le bien-\u00eatre des enfants, des jeunes et des familles autochtones de trois fa\u00e7ons interreli\u00e9es : l\u2019affirmation de la comp\u00e9tence des collectivit\u00e9s autochtones en mati\u00e8re de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille; l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de normes nationales applicables dans l\u2019ensemble du Canada; la mise en \u0153uvre des aspects de la DNUDPA en droit canadien. La Loi a pour effet juridique d\u2019instaurer un r\u00e9gime uniforme de protection du bien-\u00eatre des enfants, des jeunes et des familles autochtones par l\u2019affirmation de la comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative autochtone, par des normes nationales et par des mesures concr\u00e8tes de mise en \u0153uvre. En pratique, il est raisonnablement permis de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce que la Loi prot\u00e8ge le bien\u2011\u00eatre des enfants, des jeunes et des familles autochtones et favorise la r\u00e9conciliation avec les peuples autochtones. Le caract\u00e8re v\u00e9ritable de la Loi d\u00e9coule de l\u2019examen de ces objectifs et effets.\n[92] \u00c0 notre avis, ces facteurs impliquent que l\u2019enjeu essentiel auquel s\u2019attaque la Loi consiste \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger le bien-\u00eatre des enfants, des jeunes et des familles autochtones en favorisant la fourniture de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille culturellement adapt\u00e9s et, ce faisant, \u00e0 favoriser le processus de r\u00e9conciliation avec les peuples autochtones. L\u2019affirmation de la comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative autochtone, les normes nationales et les mesures concr\u00e8tes de mise en \u0153uvre des aspects de la DNUDPA constituent autant de parties int\u00e9grantes de ce tout unifi\u00e9.\nB. La classification au regard du par. 91(24) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867\n[93] La Loi rel\u00e8ve nettement du par. 91(24) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 . Lier le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral \u00e0 l\u2019affirmation \u00e9nonc\u00e9e au par. 18(1), \u00e9tablir des normes nationales et faciliter la mise en \u0153uvre des textes l\u00e9gislatifs d\u2019un groupe, d\u2019une collectivit\u00e9 ou d\u2019un peuple autochtones sont autant de mesures qui rel\u00e8vent des pouvoirs du Parlement en vertu du par. 91(24).\n[94] La comp\u00e9tence pr\u00e9vue au par. 91(24) est d\u2019une vaste port\u00e9e et concerne au premier chef ce qu\u2019on appelle la \u00ab quiddit\u00e9 indienne \u00bb, l\u2019indianit\u00e9 ou l\u2019autochtonit\u00e9, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire les Autochtones en tant qu\u2019Autochtones.\n[95] Ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de suffit pour conclure que la Loi est intra vires de la comp\u00e9tence du Parlement sur les \u00ab Indiens \u00bb. Le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Qu\u00e9bec a toutefois oppos\u00e9 d\u2019autres objections \u00e0 la validit\u00e9 constitutionnelle de la Loi , que nous rejetons, et ce, pour les raisons qui suivent.\n(1) Il n\u2019est nul besoin de classer les art. 1 \u00e0 17 de la Loi au regard de l\u2019art. 92 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867\n[96] Le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Qu\u00e9bec soutient que les art. 1 \u00e0 17 de la Loi ont pour caract\u00e8re v\u00e9ritable de d\u00e9terminer, par l\u2019adoption de normes nationales minimales, les modalit\u00e9s d\u2019exercice de la comp\u00e9tence provinciale en mati\u00e8re de protection de la jeunesse \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des enfants autochtones. En outre, ces normes interf\u00e9reraient avec le travail de la fonction publique provinciale, dont l\u2019ind\u00e9pendance est essentielle \u00e0 l\u2019existence de deux ordres de gouvernement coordonn\u00e9s et non subordonn\u00e9s. Essentiellement, les provinces se verraient dicter la fa\u00e7on dont elles doivent fournir les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance aux peuples autochtones se trouvant sur leur territoire. Pour les raisons qui suivent, la th\u00e8se du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Qu\u00e9bec ne saurait \u00eatre retenue.\n[97] Il est de droit constant que le Parlement peut lier la Couronne du chef des provinces (voir, p. ex., Attorney-General for British Columbia c. Canadian Pacific Railway, [1906] A.C. 204 (C.P.); voir aussi Brun, Tremblay et Brouillet, par. IX.95\u2011IX.96; Hogg et Wright, \u00a7 10:21). Cependant, il ne peut le faire qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des domaines de comp\u00e9tence f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[98] Les normes minimales nationales rel\u00e8vent de la comp\u00e9tence du f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et peuvent, en cons\u00e9quence, lier les gouvernements provinciaux. La doctrine du double aspect permet \u00ab l\u2019application concurrente de l\u00e9gislations f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et provinciales \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la \u00ab m\u00eame situation de fait \u00bb (Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la Loi sur les valeurs mobili\u00e8res, 2011 CSC 66, [2011] 3 R.C.S. 837, par. 66 (en italique dans l\u2019original); Renvois sur les gaz \u00e0 effet de serre, par. 129). La protection de la jeunesse en contexte autochtone pr\u00e9sente un double aspect en ce qu\u2019elle peut \u00eatre abord\u00e9e de deux points de vue diff\u00e9rents : soit la protection des liens unissant les familles et les collectivit\u00e9s autochtones, dans un esprit de survie culturelle, suivant le par. 91(24) (Banque canadienne de l\u2019Ouest, par. 61; voir aussi Parents naturels c. Superintendent of Child Welfare, [1976] 2 R.C.S. 751, p. 787, le juge Beetz); soit les services aux enfants et aux familles, ainsi que la protection de la jeunesse, suivant les par. 92(13) et 92(16) (NIL\/TU,O Child and Family Services Society c. B.C. Government and Service Employees\u2019 Union, 2010 CSC 45, [2010] 2 R.C.S. 696, par. 36-40, la juge Abella, et par. 74-78, la juge en chef McLachlin et le juge Fish, motifs concordants; voir aussi J. Woodward, Aboriginal Law in Canada (feuilles mobiles), \u00a7 4:16). Bien que les provinces soient g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00ab charg\u00e9[es] par la Constitution d\u2019assurer les services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance \u00bb (NIL\/TU,O, par. 24), le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral a \u00e9galement comp\u00e9tence pour l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer en mati\u00e8re de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille en ce qui concerne les enfants autochtones. Comme l\u2019ont fait remarquer les professeurs Hogg et Wright, [traduction] \u00ab [s]i le par. 91(24) ne faisait qu\u2019autoriser le Parlement \u00e0 adopter, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des Autochtones, des lois qu\u2019il pourrait par ailleurs adopter \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des non-Autochtones, alors la disposition serait inutile \u00bb (\u00a7 28:2).\n[99] La protection de l\u2019enfance en contexte autochtone constitue un domaine o\u00f9 non seulement le Parlement et les provinces peuvent agir, mais \u00e9galement o\u00f9 leur action concert\u00e9e est requise. L\u2019importance de la collaboration en la mati\u00e8re entre ces deux ordres de gouvernement est notamment illustr\u00e9e par le principe de Jordan, selon lequel les disputes intergouvernementales ne peuvent faire obstacle au droit des enfants autochtones d\u2019acc\u00e9der aux m\u00eames services que les autres enfants au Canada. La Commission de v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et r\u00e9conciliation a soulign\u00e9, \u00e0 propos de ces conflits, que les gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux ont historiquement eu tendance \u00e0 se renvoyer la responsabilit\u00e9 des services de protection de l\u2019enfance pour les Autochtones (Honorer la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, r\u00e9concilier pour l\u2019avenir, p. 145\u2011146). Or, il est aujourd\u2019hui reconnu que la fourniture de ces services est la responsabilit\u00e9 des deux ordres de gouvernement, qui doivent agir de fa\u00e7on concert\u00e9e (D\u00e9bats de la Chambre des communes, vol. 142, no 31, 2e sess., 39e l\u00e9g., 5 d\u00e9cembre 2007, p. 1780 (S. Blaney)). En pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un chevauchement entre les comp\u00e9tences f\u00e9d\u00e9rales et provinciales \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des enfants autochtones, il \u00e9tait tout \u00e0 fait loisible au Parlement de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer comme il l\u2019a fait (voir, p. ex., Grammond (2018), p. 137-138).\n[100] Nous ajoutons que, m\u00eame si les provinces sont validement li\u00e9es par les normes nationales, ces normes ne sont pas pr\u00e9cises et inflexibles au point de r\u00e9glementer tous les aspects de la fourniture des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille en contexte autochtone. Compte tenu du degr\u00e9 de g\u00e9n\u00e9ralit\u00e9 avec lequel ces normes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9es, les fonctionnaires provinciaux conservent une importante discr\u00e9tion dans la prise de d\u00e9cisions relatives aux enfants autochtones. En outre, les normes nationales s\u2019appliquent \u00e0 tous les fournisseurs de services, qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse de fonctionnaires provinciaux ou non. Enfin, loin d\u2019interf\u00e9rer avec les initiatives provinciales, les normes nationales apparaissent largement compl\u00e9mentaires avec celles-ci. L\u2019exemple de la Loi sur la protection de la jeunesse, RLRQ, c. P\u201134.1 (\u00ab LPJ \u00bb), dont bon nombre de dispositions pr\u00e9sentent une similarit\u00e9 frappante avec les normes nationales, est d\u2019ailleurs r\u00e9v\u00e9lateur \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[101] Les propos formul\u00e9s par le sous-ministre du minist\u00e8re des Services aux Autochtones dans le cadre des travaux du Comit\u00e9 permanent des affaires autochtones et du Nord au sujet de la Loi sont particuli\u00e8rement \u00e9clairants. \u00c0 cette occasion, le sous\u2011ministre a mentionn\u00e9 que les initiatives prises par le Qu\u00e9bec en mati\u00e8re de protection de l\u2019enfance \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des enfants autochtones, notamment les modifications apport\u00e9es par l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e nationale du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 la LPJ, ont inspir\u00e9 la d\u00e9marche du Parlement. Il a dit ce qui suit :\nNous utilisons les r\u00e9sultats du travail que le Qu\u00e9bec effectue d\u00e9j\u00e0 avec les Autochtones, notamment sur les principes. Nous pourrions en fait nous retrouver avec des approches tr\u00e8s positives au Qu\u00e9bec, lesquelles ne seraient pas n\u00e9cessairement modifi\u00e9es par la Loi . En effet, cette derni\u00e8re ne remet pas en question ce qui est positif, mais impose plut\u00f4t des normes minimales. Dans bien des cas, d\u2019ailleurs, nous avons l\u2019impression que ces normes sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 respect\u00e9es, voire d\u00e9pass\u00e9es.\n(Chambre des communes, Comit\u00e9 permanent des affaires autochtones et du Nord, T\u00e9moignages, no 146, 1re sess., 42e l\u00e9g., 30 avril 2019, p. 9)\n[102] Les diff\u00e9rents principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s au chapitre V.1 de la LPJ, intitul\u00e9 \u00ab Dispositions particuli\u00e8res aux Autochtones \u00bb, notamment le principe de continuit\u00e9 culturelle, s\u2019inscrivent dans la lign\u00e9e des normes nationales. Tant la Loi que la LPJ envisagent la notion de bien-\u00eatre des enfants autochtones \u00e0 partir de l\u2019id\u00e9e que \u00ab les autochtones sont les mieux plac\u00e9s pour r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de leurs enfants de la mani\u00e8re la plus appropri\u00e9e \u00bb (LPJ, pr\u00e9ambule).\n[103] En cons\u00e9quence de tout ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, les effets des normes nationales sur l\u2019exercice par les provinces de leurs comp\u00e9tences, y compris sur le travail de leurs fonctionnaires, ne sont qu\u2019\u00ab accessoires \u00bb. Comme l\u2019a maintes fois r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 notre Cour, des effets d\u2019une telle nature n\u2019ont aucune incidence sur la validit\u00e9 constitutionnelle de la loi \u00e0 leur origine (Banque canadienne de l\u2019Ouest, par. 28, citant Global Securities Corp. c. Colombie-Britannique (Securities Commission), 2000 CSC 21, [2000] 1 R.C.S. 494, par. 23).\n(2) L\u2019alin\u00e9a 8a), le par. 18(1) et les dispositions connexes n\u2019ont pas pour objet de modifier la Constitution\n[104] Dans le pr\u00e9sent renvoi, le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Qu\u00e9bec soutient aussi que la Loi est ultra vires puisque le Parlement ne peut lui-m\u00eame \u00e9tablir par voie l\u00e9gislative l\u2019existence d\u2019un droit autochtone vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019art. 35, fixer l\u2019\u00e9tendue de ce droit ou en d\u00e9finir le contenu. Le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral pr\u00e9tend que, pour que les affirmations qui figurent \u00e0 divers endroits dans la Loi aient plein effet, elles n\u00e9cessitent soit un amendement \u00e0 la Constitution, soit une reconnaissance judiciaire pr\u00e9alable. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, la Cour d\u2019appel du Qu\u00e9bec est d\u2019avis que la Loi est express\u00e9ment fond\u00e9e sur la pr\u00e9misse que le droit des peuples autochtones \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale est reconnu et confirm\u00e9 par le par. 35(1), et qu\u2019il inclut les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille. Selon la Cour d\u2019appel, puisqu\u2019un tel droit existe bel et bien, la Loi serait donc constitutionnellement valide, sous r\u00e9serve des dispositions relatives \u00e0 l\u2019incorporation au droit f\u00e9d\u00e9ral des textes l\u00e9gislatifs d\u2019un groupe, d\u2019une collectivit\u00e9 ou d\u2019un peuple autochtones et \u00e0 la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[105] Le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Qu\u00e9bec pr\u00e9cise que ce qu\u2019il appelle la \u00ab seconde partie \u00bb de la Loi repr\u00e9sente une tentative de modification unilat\u00e9rale de la Constitution. En particulier, il pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019aux art. 8 et 18 \u00e0 26 de la Loi , le Parlement a tent\u00e9 de cr\u00e9er un troisi\u00e8me ordre de gouvernement, accomplissant ainsi de mani\u00e8re unilat\u00e9rale ce que de nombreuses rondes de n\u00e9gociations constitutionnelles n\u2019ont pas permis de consacrer. Il partage l\u2019avis de la Cour d\u2019appel que les affirmations \u00ab soul\u00e8ve[nt] [. . .] des interrogations, particuli\u00e8rement en regard de la division des pouvoirs entre le l\u00e9gislatif et le judiciaire \u00bb (par. 515).\n[106] Il est bien s\u00fbr exact que le Parlement n\u2019a pas le pouvoir de modifier unilat\u00e9ralement l\u2019art. 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 . Sur ce point, signalons que l\u2019art. 35.1 lie les gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux \u00e0 l\u2019engagement de principe selon lequel, avant toute modification de l\u2019art. 35 (entre autres dispositions), les premiers ministres seront au pr\u00e9alable convoqu\u00e9s \u00e0 une conf\u00e9rence par le premier ministre du Canada (al. 35.1a)). De plus, les repr\u00e9sentants des peuples autochtones du Canada seront invit\u00e9s \u00e0 participer aux travaux sur les points de l\u2019ordre du jour qui ont trait \u00e0 toute modification propos\u00e9e (al. 35.1b)). De fa\u00e7on plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, la partie V de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 \u00e9tablit les formules de modification applicables \u00e0 diff\u00e9rents aspects de la Constitution. Seul l\u2019art. 44 pr\u00e9voit la possibilit\u00e9 de modifications unilat\u00e9rales par le Parlement, modifications qui doivent \u00eatre \u00ab relatives au pouvoir ex\u00e9cutif f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, au S\u00e9nat ou \u00e0 la Chambre des communes \u00bb. Mais m\u00eame \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des organes mentionn\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 44, le pouvoir de modification unilat\u00e9rale conf\u00e9r\u00e9 au Parlement n\u2019est pas illimit\u00e9 (Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la r\u00e9forme du S\u00e9nat, 2014 CSC 32, [2014] 1 R.C.S. 704, par. 48). En outre, comme dans d\u2019autres contextes, le Parlement agissant seul ne saurait soustraire une modification de la Constitution aux exigences de celle-ci en affirmant que la disposition modificatrice est de nature d\u00e9claratoire (Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la Loi sur la Cour supr\u00eame, art. 5 et 6, 2014 CSC 21, [2014] 1 R.C.S. 433, par. 105-106). Il est donc \u00e9vident que le Parlement ne peut modifier unilat\u00e9ralement l\u2019art. 35.\n[107] Toutefois, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le Parlement ne modifie pas unilat\u00e9ralement l\u2019art. 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 . Il \u00e9nonce plut\u00f4t dans la Loi , par le biais d\u2019affirmations liant la Couronne (art. 7), sa position \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du contenu de cette disposition constitutionnelle. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 8a) dispose que la Loi a pour objet d\u2019\u00ab affirmer le droit inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale lequel comprend la comp\u00e9tence en mati\u00e8re de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille \u00bb. De m\u00eame, sous l\u2019intertitre \u00ab Affirmation \u00bb, le par. 18(1) pr\u00e9voit que le \u00ab droit inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale reconnu et confirm\u00e9 par l\u2019article 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 comprend la comp\u00e9tence en mati\u00e8re de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille \u00bb. Les mots \u00ab affirmer \u00bb et \u00ab comprend \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019al. 8a) et au par. 18(1) n\u2019expriment aucune intention de modifier l\u2019art. 35, et ne sauraient non plus avoir cet effet. Plut\u00f4t, ils [traduction] \u00ab pr\u00e9sentent comme un fait \u00bb (Canadian Oxford Dictionary (2e \u00e9d. 2004), \u00e0 l\u2019entr\u00e9e \u00ab affirm \u00bb) la position du Parlement sur la port\u00e9e de l\u2019art. 35. Les affirmations tiennent cette position \u00ab pour vrai[e] \u00bb (Le Grand Robert de la langue fran\u00e7aise (version \u00e9lectronique), \u00e0 l\u2019entr\u00e9e \u00ab affirmer \u00bb), sans qu\u2019aucune modification ne soit n\u00e9cessaire. Ces dispositions ont donc pour effet d\u2019affirmer, et non de modifier.\n[108] Bien que le verbe anglais \u00ab affirmed \u00bb (\u00ab confirm\u00e9 \u00bb en fran\u00e7ais) soit \u00e9galement utilis\u00e9 aux par. 16.1(2) et 35(1) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 , l\u2019analyse qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de ne doit toutefois pas \u00eatre lue comme identifiant le sens de ces deux dispositions ou encore comme modifiant la jurisprudence de la Cour. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019examen porte sur le langage utilis\u00e9 dans la Loi et sur la question de savoir si le Parlement poss\u00e9dait la comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative voulue pour l\u2019adopter.\n[109] Une affirmation n\u2019est pas une modification, et ce, m\u00eame si l\u2019objet de l\u2019affirmation est une disposition de la Constitution. Comme l\u2019a mentionn\u00e9 notre Cour dans diff\u00e9rents contextes, la Constitution \u00ab n\u2019est pas un texte sacr\u00e9 que seuls les initi\u00e9s des cours sup\u00e9rieures peuvent aborder \u00bb (Cooper c. Canada (Commission des droits de la personne), [1996] 3 R.C.S. 854, par. 70, la juge McLachlin, dissidente, cit\u00e9e avec approbation dans Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse (Workers\u2019 Compensation Board) c. Martin, 2003 CSC 54, [2003] 2 R.C.S. 504, par. 29). Pour cette raison, \u00ab [l]es tribunaux n\u2019ont pas le monopole de la protection et de la promotion des droits et libert\u00e9s; le l\u00e9gislateur joue \u00e9galement un r\u00f4le \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard et il est souvent en mesure de faire fonction d\u2019alli\u00e9 important pour les groupes vuln\u00e9rables \u00bb (R. c. Mills, [1999] 3 R.C.S. 668, par. 58).\n[110] Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, le Parlement a affirm\u00e9 sa position \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du contenu de l\u2019art. 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 . Force est de constater qu\u2019en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, cette affirmation n\u2019est pas consacr\u00e9e dans la Constitution, mais dans une simple loi. Le partage des comp\u00e9tences et la s\u00e9paration des pouvoirs pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 la Constitution \u2014 dans le premier cas entre le Parlement et les l\u00e9gislatures, et dans le second entre les organes l\u00e9gislatifs et le judiciaire \u2014 n\u2019emp\u00eachent pas le Parlement d\u2019agir ainsi. Le Parlement, tout comme les l\u00e9gislatures, peut adopter une loi qui affirme sa position sur le sens de la Constitution. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, c\u2019est aux tribunaux qu\u2019il appartient d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter la Constitution lorsqu\u2019une affaire le commande (voir, p. ex., Phillips c. Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse (Commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate sur la trag\u00e9die de la mine Westray), [1995] 2 R.C.S. 97, par. 9\u201111; Renvois sur les gaz \u00e0 effet de serre, par. 220).\n[111] La t\u00e2che qui revient \u00e0 la Cour dans le cadre d\u2019un renvoi incite \u00e0 la prudence : \u00ab . . . il faut prendre garde d\u2019\u00e9viter que l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation d\u2019une question revienne \u00e0 formuler une question nouvelle \u00bb (Renvoi relatif au R\u00e9gime d\u2019assistance publique du Canada (C.-B.), [1991] 2 R.C.S. 525, p. 555). Cette retenue s\u2019impose notamment en mati\u00e8re constitutionnelle : \u00ab Elle repose sur l\u2019id\u00e9e que toute d\u00e9claration inutile sur un point de droit constitutionnel risque de causer \u00e0 des affaires \u00e0 venir un pr\u00e9judice dont les cons\u00e9quences n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vues \u00bb (Phillips, par. 9). Nous estimons que la prudence est particuli\u00e8rement de mise ici : la justesse de la position exprim\u00e9e par le Parlement quant \u00e0 la port\u00e9e de l\u2019art. 35 n\u2019a pas \u00e0 \u00eatre tranch\u00e9e pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la question pos\u00e9e par le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Qu\u00e9bec.\n[112] Il convient de souligner que le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, ainsi que plusieurs intervenants devant la Cour, ont soutenu que le par. 35(1) prot\u00e8ge le droit inh\u00e9rent des peuples autochtones \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale \u00ab en mati\u00e8re de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille \u00bb, comme l\u2019affirme le texte m\u00eame de la Loi . Notre Cour ne s\u2019est pas encore prononc\u00e9e sur la question et il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire qu\u2019elle le fasse en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce afin de formuler l\u2019avis demand\u00e9 sur la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de la Loi . Elle a not\u00e9 que, pour autant qu\u2019ils existent, les droits relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale \u00ab ne peuvent pas \u00eatre exprim\u00e9s en termes excessivement g\u00e9n\u00e9raux \u00bb, ni couvrir une mati\u00e8re \u2014 par exemple la r\u00e8glementation des jeux de hasard \u2014 qui ne fait pas partie int\u00e9grante de la culture distinctive des premi\u00e8res nations en question (voir Delgamuukw, par. 170; voir aussi R. c. Pamajewon, [1996] 2 R.C.S. 821, par. 27-28). Mais la Cour n\u2019a encore jamais eu \u00e0 se prononcer sur une mati\u00e8re aussi fondamentale pour la culture et l\u2019identit\u00e9 des peuples autochtones que le domaine des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille. Bien qu\u2019elle n\u2019ait pas abord\u00e9 la question sous l\u2019angle d\u2019un droit ancestral \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale, la Cour a tout de m\u00eame fait allusion \u00e0 la dimension collective de l\u2019exercice de certains droits des communaut\u00e9s autochtones \u00e0 titre d\u2019exemples : leur droit de conclure des trait\u00e9s (R. c. Sioui, [1990] 1 R.C.S. 1025, p. 1056); leurs droits accessoires au titre ancestral (Delgamuukw, par. 115 et 166; Nation Tsilhqot\u2019in c. Colombie-Britannique, 2014 CSC 44, [2014] 2 R.C.S. 257, par. 75); leurs droits ancestraux, tels le droit de p\u00eacher (R. c. Marshall, [1999] 3 R.C.S. 533, par. 17; R. c. Nikal, [1996] 1 R.C.S. 1013, par. 104) ou celui de r\u00e9colter du bois (R. c. Sappier, 2006 CSC 54, [2006] 2 R.C.S. 686, par. 46). Pour sa part, le Parlement a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u2014 au moyen d\u2019une affirmation l\u00e9gislative \u2014 qu\u2019il consid\u00e8re qu\u2019un tel droit est reconnu en mati\u00e8re de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille. Cette affirmation s\u2019inscrit dans le dialogue continu qu\u2019entretiennent sur la question tant le Parlement et les l\u00e9gislatures que les peuples autochtones et les tribunaux (voir P. W. Hogg et A. A. Bushell, \u00ab The Charter Dialogue Between Courts and Legislatures \u00bb (1997), 35 Osgoode Hall L.J. 75, p. 79\u201180).\n[113] Notre jurisprudence reconna\u00eet le lien \u00e9troit qui existe entre la \u00ab continuit\u00e9 culturelle \u00bb des peuples autochtones, principe dont la Loi fait express\u00e9ment mention au par. 9(2), et le maintien des enfants autochtones au sein de leur communaut\u00e9. Comme l\u2019a exprim\u00e9 notre Cour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Banque canadienne de l\u2019Ouest \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du par. 91(24) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 , \u00ab les relations au sein des familles indiennes et des collectivit\u00e9s vivant dans les r\u00e9serves [peuvent] \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme absolument n\u00e9cessaires et essentielles \u00e0 leur survie culturelle \u00bb (par. 61). Ces relations sont \u00ab au c\u0153ur m\u00eame de leur existence et de leur \u00eatre \u00bb (Delgamuukw, par. 181, citant Dick c. La Reine, [1985] 2 R.C.S. 309, p. 320). D\u2019ailleurs, la Couronne a toujours bien compris la place de la famille dans la survie de la culture autochtone. Ce n\u2019est pas une co\u00efncidence si la Couronne ciblait les enfants autochtones lorsque, \u00e0 l\u2019apog\u00e9e de son imp\u00e9rialisme, elle cherchait \u00e0 d\u00e9truire les cultures autochtones (voir les motifs de la C.A., par. 85).\n[114] Ultimement, c\u2019est aux tribunaux qu\u2019il appartiendra de d\u00e9cider, sur la foi de la preuve administr\u00e9e, si le par. 18(1) de la Loi est conforme aux limites de l\u2019art. 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 . \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, la culture autochtone sera certes un \u00e9l\u00e9ment majeur de l\u2019analyse, puisque le par. 35(1) \u00ab sert \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre l\u2019occupation ant\u00e9rieure du Canada par les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s autochtones, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 concilier leur existence contemporaine avec la souverainet\u00e9 de la Couronne \u00bb (Desautel, par. 31). En effet, comme l\u2019a \u00e9crit la Cour, l\u2019art. 35 reconna\u00eet et confirme \u00ab le cadre constitutionnel r\u00e9gissant la protection des cultures distinctives des peuples autochtones \u00bb (Sappier, par. 22).\n[115] Par ailleurs, le fait que notre Cour n\u2019a pas \u00e0 ce jour reconnu l\u2019existence, au par. 35(1), d\u2019un droit \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale ne signifie pas que le Parlement est sans ressource \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la question des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille autochtones. Il est important de noter que, dans l\u2019exercice de sa comp\u00e9tence en vertu du par. 91(24), le Parlement a choisi d\u2019affirmer que le droit \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale sur cette question est directement li\u00e9 au par. 35(1) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 . La Couronne est elle aussi express\u00e9ment li\u00e9e par cette affirmation, sur la voie vers la r\u00e9conciliation (Loi, art. 7 ). Au cours des derni\u00e8res d\u00e9cennies, comme l\u2019a not\u00e9 la Cour d\u2019appel, le Parlement a re\u00e7u bon nombre d\u2019\u00ab \u00e9tudes, rapports et enqu\u00eates portant sur diff\u00e9rents aspects de la situation des Autochtones \u00bb (par. 108), notamment de la part de la Commission de v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et r\u00e9conciliation et de la Commission royale sur les peuples autochtones. La seconde commission a d\u2019ailleurs consacr\u00e9 304 pages de son rapport \u00e0 la question de l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale (Delgamuukw, par. 171). Le Parlement est ainsi particuli\u00e8rement bien plac\u00e9 pour agir conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 sa compr\u00e9hension du contenu du par. 35(1) et, plus largement, des imp\u00e9ratifs de la r\u00e9conciliation.\n[116] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, soulignons que le processus d\u2019adoption de la Loi a \u00e9t\u00e9 lanc\u00e9 \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une r\u00e9union d\u2019urgence qu\u2019avait convoqu\u00e9e la ministre des Services aux Autochtones et qui avait pour objet de traiter des probl\u00e8mes relatifs \u00e0 la discrimination au sein des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille offerts aux peuples autochtones (voir les motifs de la C.A., par. 173). Ce processus a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 pr\u00e8s de 65 rencontres qui ont permis au gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral de consulter quelque 2 000 organismes communautaires, r\u00e9gionaux et nationaux ainsi que des particuliers (voir le par. 176). Ainsi, la Loi ne se contente pas uniquement de parler aux peuples autochtones, mais cherche aussi \u00e0 exprimer leur voix. La Loi vise en cons\u00e9quence \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre la validit\u00e9 des besoins d\u00e9clar\u00e9s des peuples autochtones et \u00e0 les rassurer sur le fait que la r\u00e9conciliation ne leur sera pas impos\u00e9e, mais qu\u2019elle sera r\u00e9alis\u00e9e de concert avec eux. Comme le d\u00e9clare le chef national de l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e des Premi\u00e8res Nations, Perry Bellegarde, d\u00e9claration reprise par le ministre des Services aux Autochtones de l\u2019\u00e9poque : \u00ab Cette loi viendra reconna\u00eetre la comp\u00e9tence des Premi\u00e8res Nations afin de nous permettre de b\u00e2tir nos propres syst\u00e8mes en fonction de nos propres structures de gouvernance, lois et politiques \u00bb (D\u00e9bats de la Chambre des communes, 19 mars 2019, p. 26137).\n[117] Bien qu\u2019il ne soit pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9terminer les limites du par. 35(1) dans le cadre du pr\u00e9sent renvoi, il convient n\u00e9anmoins de souligner que le Parlement, au terme d\u2019une enqu\u00eate approfondie, a choisi de faire progresser la r\u00e9conciliation en affirmant que le droit \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale en mati\u00e8re de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille est \u00ab inh\u00e9rent \u00bb, ainsi que \u00ab reconnu et confirm\u00e9 par l\u2019article 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 \u00bb. Cette affirmation, inscrite au par. 18(1), est donc un facteur important pour statuer sur le pr\u00e9sent renvoi. L\u2019importance de cette affirmation sera sans doute \u00e9galement un facteur \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer lorsque les tribunaux seront appel\u00e9s \u00e0 trancher formellement la question de la port\u00e9e de l\u2019art. 35.\n[118] Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, la classification de l\u2019affirmation sous l\u2019un des chefs de comp\u00e9tence \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s dans la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 doit, dans le contexte de la question pos\u00e9e dans le renvoi dont notre Cour est saisie, \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par la classification de la Loi dans son ensemble. Il faut n\u00e9anmoins examiner l\u2019effet potentiel de l\u2019affirmation sur les gouvernements provinciaux. Bien qu\u2019une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale valide puisse lier la Couronne provinciale (voir, p. ex., Sa Majest\u00e9 du chef de la province de l\u2019Alberta c. Commission canadienne des transports, [1978] 1 R.C.S. 61, p. 72; The Queen in the Right of the Province of Ontario c. Board of Transport Commissioners, [1968] R.C.S. 118, p. 124; Wilkins, p. 185), la simple lecture de l\u2019art. 7, de l\u2019al. 8a) et du par. 18(1) n\u2019indique pas clairement si l\u2019affirmation vise \u00e0 lier les gouvernements provinciaux. Il est toutefois loisible aux tribunaux d\u2019accorder un sens restreint \u00e0 un texte de loi qui, autrement, outrepasserait la comp\u00e9tence de l\u2019ordre de gouvernement l\u2019ayant adopt\u00e9 (voir, p. ex., Derrickson c. Derrickson, [1986] 1 R.C.S. 285, p. 296). Cette m\u00e9thode d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation peut \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e par la pr\u00e9somption de conformit\u00e9 des lois au partage des comp\u00e9tences (Siemens c. Manitoba (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2003 CSC 3, [2003] 1 R.C.S. 6, par. 33; voir aussi Brun, Tremblay et Brouillet, par. VI\u20112.56; Hogg et Wright, \u00a7 15:13). Dans la mesure o\u00f9 le fait de lier les provinces \u00e0 la position que le Parlement a affirm\u00e9e outrepasse la comp\u00e9tence f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (un point qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9battu directement devant notre Cour), il serait en cons\u00e9quence n\u00e9cessaire de donner une interpr\u00e9tation att\u00e9nu\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019al. 8a) et au par. 18(1).\n(3) Les dispositions d\u2019incorporation figurant \u00e0 l\u2019art. 21 ne modifient pas l\u2019architecture de la Constitution\n[119] Le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Qu\u00e9bec soutient que l\u2019art. 21 et le par. 22(3) de la Loi modifient l\u2019architecture de la Constitution (m.i., par. 26). La Cour d\u2019appel est arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 la m\u00eame conclusion, statuant que ces dispositions visent \u00e0 \u00e9tendre l\u2019application de la doctrine de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance f\u00e9d\u00e9rale aux textes l\u00e9gislatifs d\u2019un groupe, d\u2019une collectivit\u00e9 ou d\u2019un peuple autochtones en mati\u00e8re de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille, et que ces dispositions sont donc ultra vires du par. 91(24) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 (par. 537, 540-542 et 571). La Cour d\u2019appel a affirm\u00e9 que les textes l\u00e9gislatifs d\u2019un groupe, d\u2019une communaut\u00e9 ou d\u2019un peuple autochtones ne sont pas des lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales adopt\u00e9es en vertu du par. 91(24), mais plut\u00f4t des lois autochtones qui r\u00e9pondent \u00e0 des imp\u00e9ratifs autochtones (par. 540).\n[120] \u00c0 notre avis, comme notre Cour ne s\u2019est pas encore prononc\u00e9e sur la question de savoir si le droit d\u00e9crit au par. 18(1) a \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9, ni l\u2019art. 21 ni le par. 22(3) de la Loi ne modifient l\u2019architecture de la Constitution; ces deux dispositions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 validement \u00e9dict\u00e9es en vertu du par. 91(24) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 . Limitant nos observations au contexte particulier du renvoi qui nous occupe, nous traitons dans la pr\u00e9sente section de la validit\u00e9 de l\u2019art. 21, et dans la section suivante de la validit\u00e9 du par. 22(3).\n[121] L\u2019aspect principal de l\u2019art. 21 de la Loi que la Cour d\u2019appel a jug\u00e9 inconstitutionnel est son par. (1), lequel pr\u00e9cise ce qui suit : \u00ab A \u00e9galement force de loi, \u00e0 titre de loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, le texte l\u00e9gislatif, avec ses modifications successives, du groupe, de la collectivit\u00e9 ou du peuple autochtones [. . .] pendant la p\u00e9riode au cours de laquelle ce texte est en vigueur. \u00bb La Cour d\u2019appel a conclu qu\u2019une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale adopt\u00e9e en application du par. 91(24) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 ne saurait donner au texte l\u00e9gislatif d\u2019un groupe, d\u2019une collectivit\u00e9 ou d\u2019un peuple autochtones force de loi, \u00e0 titre de loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (par. 540-541). Nous ne sommes pas de cet avis.\n[122] L\u2019article 21 de la Loi n\u2019est qu\u2019une simple disposition d\u2019incorporation par renvoi. Il incorpore par renvoi les textes l\u00e9gislatifs adopt\u00e9s par un groupe, une collectivit\u00e9 ou un peuple autochtones, et leur donne force de loi \u00e0 titre de lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales. De plus, comme ces textes l\u00e9gislatifs peuvent \u00eatre modifi\u00e9s, l\u2019art. 21 incorpore par anticipation les modifications susceptibles de leur \u00eatre apport\u00e9es ult\u00e9rieurement. Une telle disposition d\u2019incorporation par renvoi anticipatoire est constitutionnelle.\n[123] Les professeurs Hogg et Wright d\u00e9crivent l\u2019incorporation par renvoi comme une [traduction] \u00ab technique utilis\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019occasion par des organes l\u00e9gislatifs, surtout lorsqu\u2019ils d\u00e9sirent adopter la m\u00eame loi qu\u2019un autre ressort \u00bb (\u00a7 14:12; voir aussi Brun, Tremblay et Brouillet, par. VI-1.80; G.\u2011A. Beaudoin, en collaboration avec P. Thibault, La Constitution du Canada : institutions, partage des pouvoirs, Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s (3e \u00e9d. 2004), p. 317\u2011318). Comme le soulignent ces auteurs, [traduction] \u00ab [a]u lieu de r\u00e9p\u00e9ter int\u00e9gralement les r\u00e8gles d\u00e9sir\u00e9es, le r\u00e9dacteur peut simplement incorporer par renvoi, ou adopter, les r\u00e8gles d\u2019un autre ressort \u00bb (\u00a7 14:12). En tant que technique de r\u00e9daction, l\u2019incorporation par renvoi \u00e9vite au l\u00e9gislateur le besoin, dans l\u2019exercice de sa comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative, de reproduire dans une loi distincte des r\u00e8gles d\u00e9j\u00e0 adopt\u00e9es par une autre entit\u00e9.\n[124] Les l\u00e9gislateurs disposent d\u2019un vaste pouvoir d\u2019incorporation par renvoi de dispositions adopt\u00e9es par d\u2019autres entit\u00e9s, notamment d\u2019autres l\u00e9gislateurs ou des organismes non gouvernementaux. Par exemple, le Parlement peut incorporer par renvoi un texte de loi adopt\u00e9 par une province (Coughlin c. Ontario Highway Transport Board, [1968] R.C.S. 569, p. 575; R. c. Smith, [1972] R.C.S. 359, p. 366; Dick, p. 328; Bande indienne Wewaykum c. Canada, 2002 CSC 79, [2002] 4 R.C.S. 245, par. 114 et 136; F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des producteurs de volailles du Qu\u00e9bec c. Pelland, 2005 CSC 20, [2005] 1 R.C.S. 292, par. 53 et 61). Notre Cour a \u00e9galement confirm\u00e9 la validit\u00e9 de l\u2019incorporation par renvoi, par un l\u00e9gislateur provincial, de lois \u00e9dict\u00e9es par le Parlement du Royaume-Uni (Attorney General for Ontario c. Scott, [1956] R.C.S. 137, p. 152). Le Parlement peut aussi incorporer par renvoi des normes \u00e9tablies par un organisme non gouvernemental (Renvoi relatif aux droits linguistiques au Manitoba, [1992] 1 R.C.S. 212, p. 230 et 234). Une fois que le Parlement a incorpor\u00e9 par renvoi des dispositions adopt\u00e9es par une autre entit\u00e9, les \u00ab dispositions pertinentes s\u2019appliquent en tant que r\u00e8gles de droit f\u00e9d\u00e9rales \u00bb (Bande indienne Wewaykum, par. 114). La constitutionnalit\u00e9 de la technique de r\u00e9daction que constitue l\u2019incorporation par renvoi ne fait aucun doute.\n[125] L\u2019incorporation par renvoi peut \u00e9galement avoir un caract\u00e8re anticipatoire : un l\u00e9gislateur peut incorporer des dispositions d\u2019une autre entit\u00e9 ainsi que leurs modifications successives par anticipation. Dans l\u2019affaire Scott, par exemple, il \u00e9tait question d\u2019une loi ontarienne incorporant des r\u00e8gles anglaises \u2014 tant existantes que futures \u2014 li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des ordonnances alimentaires en faveur des \u00e9poux et des enfants. Les professeurs Hogg et Wright mentionnent que dans Scott notre Cour [traduction] \u00ab a reconnu, sans toutefois y attacher une importance particuli\u00e8re, le fait que la loi ontarienne adoptait non seulement les r\u00e8gles anglaises qui existaient au moment de l\u2019\u00e9diction de la loi, mais \u00e9galement les modifications qui y seraient apport\u00e9es dans le futur \u00bb (\u00a7 14:13; voir aussi Beaudoin, p. 318; N. Finkelstein, Laskin\u2019s Canadian Constitutional Law (5e \u00e9d. 1986), p. 43). Il est incontestable qu\u2019une loi peut \u00eatre \u00e9dict\u00e9e [traduction] \u00ab par renvoi \u00e0 la loi et \u00e0 ses modifications futures \u00bb, d\u2019un autre l\u00e9gislateur (Scott, p. 143 (nous soulignons); voir aussi Coughlin, p. 575; Smith, p. 366; Dick, p. 328).\n[126] Le vaste pouvoir d\u2019incorporation par renvoi dont dispose un l\u00e9gislateur est toutefois assorti de limites. Par exemple, le l\u00e9gislateur ne peut abdiquer sa fonction l\u00e9gislative : il ne saurait permettre \u00e0 une autre entit\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab d\u2019adopter des lois g\u00e9n\u00e9rales ou de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00bb \u00e0 sa place (Scott, p. 143; voir aussi Finkelstein, p. 43). Le l\u00e9gislateur doit \u00e9galement poss\u00e9der la comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l\u2019adoption de la loi qu\u2019il veut incorporer par renvoi (voir Scott, p. 143; Hogg et Wright, \u00a7 14:14; Finkelstein, p. 43). De plus, un ordre de gouvernement ne peut d\u00e9l\u00e9guer des pouvoirs l\u00e9gislatifs \u00e0 un autre ordre de gouvernement (voir Attorney General of Nova Scotia c. Attorney General of Canada, [1951] R.C.S. 31, p. 34; Hogg et Wright, \u00a7 14:10; Brun, Tremblay et Brouillet, par. VI-1.78; Beaudoin, p. 314-315; Finkelstein, p. 42; P. J. Monahan, B. Shaw et P. Ryan, Constitutional Law (5e \u00e9d. 2017), p. 402). La d\u00e9l\u00e9gation administrative est toutefois permise : un ordre de gouvernement peut validement d\u00e9l\u00e9guer des pouvoirs \u00e0 un organisme administratif cr\u00e9\u00e9 par un autre ordre de gouvernement (P.E.I. Potato Marketing Board c. H. B. Willis Inc., [1952] 2 R.C.S. 392; Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la Loi sur l\u2019organisation du march\u00e9 des produits agricoles, [1978] 2 R.C.S. 1198, p. 1223\u20111224; Hogg et Wright, \u00a7 14:11; Brun, Tremblay et Brouillet, par. VI-1.78; Beaudoin, p. 315; Finkelstein, p. 45\u201146).\n[127] Un commentateur a exprim\u00e9 des doutes concernant la possibilit\u00e9 que l\u2019incorporation par renvoi des textes l\u00e9gislatifs d\u2019un groupe, d\u2019une collectivit\u00e9 ou d\u2019un peuple autochtones puisse \u00eatre invalide, [traduction] \u00ab \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le Parlement pourrait ais\u00e9ment adopter chacun de ces textes au fur et \u00e0 mesure de leur \u00e9diction, et ce, sans enfreindre le par. 91(24) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 \u00bb (Leclair, p. 98 (note en bas de page omise)). Nous sommes du m\u00eame avis. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le par. 21(1) de la Loi incorpore validement par renvoi les textes l\u00e9gislatifs en mati\u00e8re de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille, avec leurs modifications successives, d\u2019un groupe, d\u2019une collectivit\u00e9 ou d\u2019un peuple autochtones vis\u00e9 au par. 20(3). Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, le Parlement dispose du pouvoir l\u00e9gislatif ind\u00e9pendant d\u2019adopter de tels textes de loi en vertu de la comp\u00e9tence sur les \u00ab Indiens et les terres r\u00e9serv\u00e9es pour les Indiens \u00bb que lui conf\u00e8re le par. 91(24) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 . Pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la question pos\u00e9e dans le cadre du pr\u00e9sent renvoi, il suffit de dire que les textes l\u00e9gislatifs d\u2019un groupe, d\u2019une collectivit\u00e9 ou d\u2019un peuple autochtones ont force de loi du fait du par. 91(24) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 et du respect des exigences formul\u00e9es aux art. 20 et 21 de la Loi . Cela dit, la Cour prend soin de ne pas exclure la possibilit\u00e9 que le droit \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale repose sur une source constitutionnelle distincte. En particulier, notre conclusion n\u2019a certes pas pour effet de nier l\u2019\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 qu\u2019un tel droit \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale puisse \u00eatre reconnu en vertu de l\u2019art. 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 . Cette question demeure enti\u00e8re.\n[128] Le Parlement a en outre utilis\u00e9 un langage appropri\u00e9 pour incorporer par renvoi les textes l\u00e9gislatifs des groupes, collectivit\u00e9s ou peuple autochtones, ainsi que les modifications susceptibles de leur \u00eatre apport\u00e9es au fil du temps. Aux termes du par. 21(1) de la Loi , ces textes l\u00e9gislatifs \u00ab [ont] force de loi, \u00e0 titre de loi[s] f\u00e9d\u00e9rale[s] \u00bb une fois qu\u2019ils sont entr\u00e9s en vigueur. Ils s\u2019appliquent \u00e0 titre de lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales \u00e0 partir du moment o\u00f9 ils sont incorpor\u00e9s (Bande indienne Wewaykum, par. 114). Le paragraphe 21(1) op\u00e8re en tandem avec le par. 20(3), lequel subordonne l\u2019application de l\u2019art. 21 \u00e0 la conclusion par le corps dirigeant autochtone concern\u00e9 d\u2019un accord de coordination ou au d\u00e9ploiement par cet organisme d\u2019efforts raisonnables \u00e0 cette fin. Ces m\u00e9canismes assurent une incorporation anticipatoire par renvoi qui est valide.\n[129] Il se pourrait que des questions relatives \u00e0 la mise en \u0153uvre de lois incorpor\u00e9es par renvoi soient soulev\u00e9es dans le futur et qu\u2019elles doivent \u00eatre r\u00e9gl\u00e9es. Par exemple, il pourrait exister une forme d\u2019incertitude quant \u00e0 la port\u00e9e territoriale de la comp\u00e9tence d\u2019un corps dirigeant autochtone, ou quant \u00e0 savoir si une entit\u00e9 est une nation autochtone ou un \u00ab corps dirigeant autochtone \u00bb aux fins d\u2019application de la Loi. Cependant, les \u00e9ventuelles contestations susceptibles de d\u00e9couler de tels enjeux d\u00e9bordent du cadre du pr\u00e9sent renvoi, lequel soul\u00e8ve une question large et g\u00e9n\u00e9rale au sujet de la validit\u00e9 constitutionnelle de la Loi dans son ensemble. Comme l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 notre Cour dans un r\u00e9cent arr\u00eat, \u00ab [i]l n\u2019appartient pas \u00e0 notre Cour d\u2019exprimer des opinions sur la teneur, les arguments ou le m\u00e9rite de contestations \u00e0 venir \u00bb (Renvois sur les gaz \u00e0 effet de serre, par. 220).\n[130] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, il est constitutionnellement loisible au Parlement de recourir \u00e0 l\u2019incorporation anticipatoire par renvoi comme technique de r\u00e9daction l\u00e9gislative. Par le biais de l\u2019art. 21, le Parlement a validement incorpor\u00e9 par renvoi les textes l\u00e9gislatifs, avec leurs modifications successives, des groupes, collectivit\u00e9s ou peuples autochtones en mati\u00e8re de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille. En cons\u00e9quence, l\u2019art. 21 ne modifie pas l\u2019architecture de la Constitution.\n(4) La disposition relative \u00e0 la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance pr\u00e9vue au par. 22(3) ne modifie pas l\u2019architecture de la Constitution\n[131] Le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Qu\u00e9bec pr\u00e9tend que le par. 22(3) de la Loi , la disposition relative \u00e0 la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance, modifie l\u2019architecture de la Constitution. \u00c0 notre avis, ce n\u2019est pas le cas. Le paragraphe 22(3) pr\u00e9voit ce qui suit : \u00ab Il est entendu que les dispositions relatives aux services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille de tout texte l\u00e9gislatif d\u2019un groupe, d\u2019une collectivit\u00e9 ou d\u2019un peuple autochtones l\u2019emportent sur les dispositions incompatibles relatives aux services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille de toute loi provinciale ou de tout r\u00e8glement pris en vertu d\u2019une telle loi. \u00bb Les textes l\u00e9gislatifs d\u2019un groupe, d\u2019une collectivit\u00e9 ou d\u2019un peuple autochtones qui auront \u00e9t\u00e9 incorpor\u00e9s par renvoi auront force de loi \u00e0 titre de lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales : les r\u00e8gles de droit incorpor\u00e9es au droit f\u00e9d\u00e9ral s\u2019appliquent en tant que r\u00e8gles de droit f\u00e9d\u00e9rales (Bande indienne Wewaykum, par. 114). Le paragraphe 22(3) constitue une simple reformulation l\u00e9gislative de la doctrine de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[132] Suivant la doctrine de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, les dispositions d\u2019une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale valide l\u2019emportent sur les dispositions incompatibles d\u2019une loi provinciale (voir Banque canadienne de l\u2019Ouest, par. 32 et 69; Hogg et Wright, \u00a7 16:1; Brun, Tremblay et Brouillet, par. VI-2.69; Monahan, Shaw et Ryan, p. 133; Beaudoin, p. 354; G. R\u00e9gimbald et D. Newman, The Law of the Canadian Constitution (2e \u00e9d. 2017), \u00a75.73). Bien qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse d\u2019une doctrine d\u2019origine judiciaire dont la port\u00e9e et l\u2019application rel\u00e8vent des tribunaux plut\u00f4t que du Parlement ou des l\u00e9gislatures (Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration des juges de la Cour provinciale de l\u2019\u00cele-du-Prince-\u00c9douard, [1997] 3 R.C.S. 3, par. 98; Toronto (Cit\u00e9) c. Ontario (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2021 CSC 34, par. 56), cela n\u2019emp\u00eache pas un l\u00e9gislateur de d\u00e9clarer ce qu\u2019il entend par la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, comme l\u2019a fait le Parlement au par. 22(3) en faisant pr\u00e9c\u00e9der son explication des mots \u00ab [i]l est entendu que \u00bb. Mais c\u2019est aux tribunaux qu\u2019il appartient ultimement de trancher toute all\u00e9gation d\u2019incompatibilit\u00e9 entre des r\u00e8gles de droit f\u00e9d\u00e9rales et provinciales, et de prononcer toute d\u00e9claration n\u00e9cessaire en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance.\n[133] En cons\u00e9quence, le par. 22(3) de la Loi ne modifie pas l\u2019architecture de la Constitution.\nVIII. Conclusion\n[134] D\u00e9velopp\u00e9e de concert avec les peuples autochtones, la Loi repr\u00e9sente un progr\u00e8s significatif sur le plan de la r\u00e9conciliation. Elle s\u2019inscrit dans la foul\u00e9e de la mise en \u0153uvre par le Parlement de la DNUDPA. Elle r\u00e9pond en outre \u00e0 l\u2019appel \u00e0 l\u2019action no 4 de la Commission de v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et r\u00e9conciliation, qui demande au gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral d\u2019\u00e9tablir des normes nationales et de confirmer le r\u00f4le des gouvernements autochtones dans le domaine des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille. Elle am\u00e9nage un espace \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur duquel les groupes, les collectivit\u00e9s et les peuples autochtones peuvent exercer leur comp\u00e9tence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du soin de leurs enfants. La reconnaissance de cette comp\u00e9tence invite les collectivit\u00e9s autochtones \u00e0 collaborer avec la Couronne afin de concilier les r\u00e8gles de droit autochtones, nationales et internationales en vue de la protection du bien-\u00eatre des enfants, des jeunes et des familles autochtones.\n[135] Consid\u00e9r\u00e9e dans son int\u00e9gralit\u00e9, la Loi a pour caract\u00e8re v\u00e9ritable de prot\u00e9ger le bien-\u00eatre des enfants, des jeunes et des familles autochtones en favorisant la fourniture de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille culturellement adapt\u00e9s et, ce faisant, de contribuer au processus de r\u00e9conciliation avec les peuples autochtones. Cette importante initiative l\u00e9gislative rel\u00e8ve nettement du pouvoir de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer du Parlement en vertu du par. 91(24) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 .\n[136] Pour ces motifs, \u00e0 la question suivante pos\u00e9e par le renvoi :\nLa Loi concernant les enfants, les jeunes et les familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations, des Inuits et des M\u00e9tis est-elle ultra vires de la comp\u00e9tence du Parlement du Canada en vertu de la Constitution du Canada?\nLa r\u00e9ponse est la suivante :\nNon.\n[137] En cons\u00e9quence, nous rejetons l\u2019appel du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Qu\u00e9bec et accueillons l\u2019appel du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada.\nPourvoi du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Qu\u00e9bec rejet\u00e9.

La police a par la suite obtenu une ordonnance de communication obligeant le fournisseur de services Internet (\u00ab FSI \u00bb) \u00e0 r\u00e9v\u00e9ler le nom et l\u2019adresse du client pour chaque adresse IP. La police a utilis\u00e9 ces renseignements relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019abonn\u00e9 pour solliciter et ex\u00e9cuter des mandats de perquisition. B a \u00e9t\u00e9 arr\u00eat\u00e9.\nB a contest\u00e9 la demande de la police \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de traitement en vue d\u2019obtenir les adresses IP, all\u00e9guant que celle\u2011ci avait viol\u00e9 son droit \u00e0 la protection contre les fouilles, les perquisitions et les saisies abusives garanti par l\u2019art. 8 de la Charte . La juge du proc\u00e8s a conclu que la demande faite par la police \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de traitement ne constituait pas une fouille au sens de l\u2019art. 8 de la Charte parce que B n\u2019avait pas une attente raisonnable au respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de son adresse IP; le droit garanti \u00e0 B par l\u2019art. 8 n\u2019entrait donc pas en jeu. B a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable de 14 infractions li\u00e9es aux achats en ligne frauduleux. Les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel ont convenu que B n\u2019avait aucune attente raisonnable au respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ses adresses IP et ont rejet\u00e9 l\u2019appel interjet\u00e9 par B contre ses d\u00e9clarations de culpabilit\u00e9. La juge dissidente aurait accueilli l\u2019appel au motif qu\u2019une attente raisonnable au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e s\u2019appliquait aux adresses IP.\nArr\u00eat (le juge en chef Wagner et les juges C\u00f4t\u00e9, Rowe et O\u2019Bonsawin sont dissidents) : Le pourvoi est accueilli et un nouveau proc\u00e8s est ordonn\u00e9.\nLes juges Karakatsanis, Martin, Kasirer, Jamal et Moreau : S\u2019il doit prot\u00e9ger de mani\u00e8re significative la vie priv\u00e9e en ligne des Canadiens et des Canadiennes dans le monde actuel qui est tr\u00e8s largement num\u00e9rique, l\u2019art. 8 de la Charte doit prot\u00e9ger leurs adresses IP. Une adresse IP est le lien crucial entre un internaute et son activit\u00e9 en ligne. Consid\u00e9r\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re normative, elle est la cl\u00e9 donnant acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019activit\u00e9 Internet d\u2019un utilisateur et, ultimement, \u00e0 son identit\u00e9. Une adresse IP suscite donc une attente raisonnable au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e. Par cons\u00e9quent, une demande d\u2019adresse IP faite par l\u2019\u00c9tat constitue une fouille au sens de l\u2019art. 8 de la Charte .\nL\u2019article 8 de la Charte garantit le droit \u00e0 la protection contre les fouilles, les perquisitions ou les saisies abusives. Il vise principalement \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger la vie priv\u00e9e, y compris l\u2019intimit\u00e9 informationnelle, \u00e0 savoir le droit revendiqu\u00e9 par des particuliers, des groupes ou des institutions de d\u00e9terminer eux\u2011m\u00eames le moment, la mani\u00e8re et la mesure dans lesquels des renseignements les concernant sont communiqu\u00e9s. Le respect de la vie priv\u00e9e d\u2019un individu est essentiel pour assurer la dignit\u00e9, l\u2019autonomie et la croissance personnelle de celui\u2011ci. La protection de la vie priv\u00e9e est une condition pr\u00e9alable essentielle \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9panouissement d\u2019une d\u00e9mocratie libre et en sant\u00e9.\nPour \u00e9tablir une violation de l\u2019art. 8, le demandeur doit d\u00e9montrer premi\u00e8rement qu\u2019il y a eu une fouille, une perquisition ou une saisie. Il y a fouille lorsque l\u2019\u00c9tat frustre une attente raisonnable au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e. Une attente au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e est raisonnable quand le droit du public de ne pas \u00eatre importun\u00e9 par le gouvernement l\u2019emporte sur le droit du gouvernement de s\u2019immiscer dans la vie priv\u00e9e des particuliers afin de r\u00e9aliser ses fins, notamment d\u2019assurer l\u2019application de la loi. Les tribunaux analysent l\u2019attente au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e en examinant de nombreux facteurs interreli\u00e9s, mais souvent concurrents, qui peuvent \u00eatre regroup\u00e9s en quatre cat\u00e9gories : (1) l\u2019objet de la fouille; (2) l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du demandeur \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019objet; (3) l\u2019attente subjective du demandeur au respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e; et (4) la question de savoir si l\u2019attente subjective au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e \u00e9tait objectivement raisonnable. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les parties ont convenu que B avait un int\u00e9r\u00eat direct \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des adresses IP ainsi qu\u2019une attente subjective au respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de leur contenu informationnel.\nEn ce qui concerne l\u2019objet de la fouille, celui\u2011ci est d\u00e9fini sous l\u2019angle non pas seulement des renseignements eux\u2011m\u00eames, mais \u00e9galement de la tendance qui consiste \u00e0 chercher \u00e0 obtenir des renseignements pour permettre d\u2019en tirer des inf\u00e9rences au sujet d\u2019autres renseignements de nature personnelle. Le tribunal doit concevoir cet objet d\u2019un point de vue holistique et doit \u00eatre particuli\u00e8rement prudent lorsqu\u2019il d\u00e9crit l\u2019objet d\u2019une fouille relative \u00e0 des donn\u00e9es \u00e9lectroniques. L\u2019approche ne doit pas \u00eatre m\u00e9canique et doit tenir compte de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 technologique. La fouille en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce avait pour objet les renseignements que les adresses IP pouvaient r\u00e9v\u00e9ler sur des internautes pr\u00e9cis, y compris, ultimement, leur identit\u00e9. Reconna\u00eetre que la police voulait l\u2019adresse IP \u2014 en tant que lien entre un abonn\u00e9 et un endroit donn\u00e9s et une activit\u00e9 Internet particuli\u00e8re \u2014 pour obtenir davantage de renseignements sur l\u2019utilisateur permet au tribunal d\u2019appr\u00e9cier l\u2019attente au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de tous les renseignements que cette adresse IP tend \u00e0 r\u00e9v\u00e9ler.\nPour ce qui est de la question de savoir si une attente subjective au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e est objectivement raisonnable, les tribunaux doivent prendre en consid\u00e9ration l\u2019ensemble des circonstances. Bien qu\u2019il n\u2019existe pas de liste d\u00e9finitive de facteurs, les tribunaux ont souvent examin\u00e9 plus particuli\u00e8rement le contr\u00f4le sur l\u2019objet, le lieu de la fouille et le caract\u00e8re priv\u00e9 de l\u2019objet. Dans le contexte de l\u2019intimit\u00e9 informationnelle, le contr\u00f4le exerc\u00e9 par le demandeur sur l\u2019objet n\u2019est pas d\u00e9terminant. Internet exige que les utilisateurs r\u00e9v\u00e8lent \u00e0 leur FSI les renseignements relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019abonn\u00e9 pour pouvoir prendre part aux activit\u00e9s de cette nouvelle place publique, et les Canadiens et les Canadiennes n\u2019ont pas \u00e0 vivre en reclus du monde num\u00e9rique afin de pouvoir conserver un semblant de vie priv\u00e9e. Le lieu o\u00f9 s\u2019est d\u00e9roul\u00e9e la fouille n\u2019est pas non plus pr\u00e9judiciable \u00e0 une attente raisonnable au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e dans un tel contexte. Les espaces en ligne sont qualitativement diff\u00e9rents des espaces physiques. Les renseignements que renferme Internet peuvent r\u00e9v\u00e9ler beaucoup plus que ce que sont susceptibles de r\u00e9v\u00e9ler des renseignements assujettis aux limites d\u2019un espace physique. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019absence d\u2019intrusion physique r\u00e9v\u00e8le peu sur le caract\u00e8re raisonnable d\u2019une attente au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e.\nQuant au caract\u00e8re priv\u00e9 de l\u2019objet, l\u2019art. 8 vise \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger un ensemble de renseignements biographiques d\u2019ordre personnel que les particuliers pourraient, dans une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 libre et d\u00e9mocratique, vouloir constituer et soustraire \u00e0 la connaissance de l\u2019\u00c9tat. L\u2019ensemble de renseignements biographiques ne touche pas uniquement \u00e0 l\u2019identit\u00e9, mais s\u2019\u00e9tend notamment \u00e0 des renseignements tendant \u00e0 r\u00e9v\u00e9ler des d\u00e9tails intimes sur le mode de vie et les choix personnels de l\u2019individu. L\u2019accent mis par l\u2019art. 8 sur de tels renseignements signifie qu\u2019une attente raisonnable au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e est appr\u00e9ci\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re normative plut\u00f4t que simplement descriptive. Elle ne peut \u00eatre appr\u00e9ci\u00e9e en fonction d\u2019une seule utilisation en particulier de la preuve; sa port\u00e9e ne peut pas non plus \u00eatre \u00e9tablie selon l\u2019intention pr\u00e9cise qu\u2019avait la police en recherchant les renseignements. L\u2019objectif de l\u2019art. 8, appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 normativement, exige plut\u00f4t de se demander quels renseignements tend \u00e0 r\u00e9v\u00e9ler l\u2019objet de la fouille. En tant que lien qui relie une activit\u00e9 Internet pr\u00e9cise \u00e0 un endroit donn\u00e9, l\u2019adresse IP est susceptible de r\u00e9v\u00e9ler des renseignements tr\u00e8s personnels, m\u00eame avant que la police n\u2019essaie de relier l\u2019adresse \u00e0 l\u2019identit\u00e9 de l\u2019utilisateur. De plus, il est possible de mettre en corr\u00e9lation l\u2019activit\u00e9 associ\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019adresse IP avec une autre activit\u00e9 en ligne associ\u00e9e \u00e0 cette adresse \u00e0 laquelle l\u2019\u00c9tat a acc\u00e8s. Une adresse IP peut aussi mettre l\u2019\u00c9tat sur la trace d\u2019une activit\u00e9 Internet qui m\u00e8ne directement \u00e0 l\u2019identit\u00e9 d\u2019un utilisateur, m\u00eame sans un mandat obligeant un FSI \u00e0 r\u00e9v\u00e9ler le nom et l\u2019adresse du client associ\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019adresse IP. L\u2019acc\u00e8s aux adresses IP sans autorisation judiciaire pr\u00e9alable pose de grands risques en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e.\nD\u00e9finir une attente raisonnable au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e est une op\u00e9ration de mise en balance. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la balance penche en faveur de l\u2019extension de l\u2019attente raisonnable au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e aux adresses IP. Le caract\u00e8re \u00e9minemment priv\u00e9 des renseignements que peut r\u00e9v\u00e9ler une adresse IP sugg\u00e8re fortement que le droit du public de ne pas \u00eatre importun\u00e9 devrait l\u2019emporter sur le droit du gouvernement de r\u00e9aliser ses objectifs d\u2019application de la loi. Internet a fait augmenter de mani\u00e8re exponentielle tant la qualit\u00e9 que la quantit\u00e9 de renseignements stock\u00e9s \u00e0 propos des internautes, et il englobe les comportements humains les plus publics comme les plus priv\u00e9s. Internet a permis aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s priv\u00e9es non seulement de suivre leurs utilisateurs, mais aussi de b\u00e2tir des profils de ceux\u2011ci remplis de renseignements que les utilisateurs n\u2019ont jamais su qu\u2019ils r\u00e9v\u00e9laient. En concentrant cette masse de renseignements entre les mains de tiers du secteur priv\u00e9 et en donnant \u00e0 ces derniers les outils n\u00e9cessaires pour agr\u00e9ger et diss\u00e9quer ces donn\u00e9es, Internet a essentiellement modifi\u00e9 la topographie de la vie priv\u00e9e sous le r\u00e9gime de la Charte . Il a ajout\u00e9 un tiers \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cosyst\u00e8me constitutionnel, et a fait de la relation horizontale entre l\u2019individu et l\u2019\u00c9tat une relation tripartite. Bien que l\u2019art. 8 ne s\u2019applique pas aux tiers eux\u2011m\u00eames, ceux\u2011ci jouent le r\u00f4le de m\u00e9diateurs dans une relation directement r\u00e9gie par la Charte \u2014 celle entre le d\u00e9fendeur et la police. Ce changement a accru la capacit\u00e9 informationnelle de l\u2019\u00c9tat.\nCes pr\u00e9occupations importantes relatives \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e entrent en balance avec l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat parfois conflictuel mais l\u00e9gitime de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en ce qui a trait au besoin de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. La police devrait disposer des outils d\u2019enqu\u00eate n\u00e9cessaires pour s\u2019occuper d\u2019un crime commis et facilit\u00e9 en ligne. Toutefois, exiger que la police obtienne une autorisation judiciaire pr\u00e9alable avant d\u2019obtenir une adresse IP ne constitue pas une lourde mesure d\u2019enqu\u00eate. Lorsqu\u2019il existe un lien suffisant entre l\u2019adresse IP, ou les renseignements relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019abonn\u00e9, et la perp\u00e9tration d\u2019un crime, une autorisation judiciaire est facile \u00e0 obtenir. Reconna\u00eetre qu\u2019une adresse IP est prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par l\u2019art. 8 vise \u00e0 faire en sorte que les enqu\u00eates polici\u00e8res refl\u00e8tent mieux ce \u00e0 quoi chaque Canadien et Canadienne raisonnable s\u2019attend du point de vue du respect de la vie priv\u00e9e et de la lutte contre la criminalit\u00e9. La surveillance judiciaire restreint ce qui est accessible \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tat en ligne et enl\u00e8ve aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s priv\u00e9es le pouvoir de d\u00e9cider s\u2019il convient de d\u00e9voiler des renseignements \u2014 et en quelle quantit\u00e9 \u2014 et renvoie la question au champ d\u2019application de la Charte .\nLe juge en chef Wagner et les juges C\u00f4t\u00e9, Rowe et O\u2019Bonsawin (dissidents) : Le pourvoi devrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9. B n\u2019avait pas une attente raisonnable au respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des adresses IP contenues sur les serveurs de l\u2019entreprise de traitement des cartes de cr\u00e9dit, et du FSI qu\u2019elles ont r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9. La police n\u2019avait pas besoin d\u2019une autorisation judiciaire avant de demander les adresses IP \u00e0 l\u2019entreprise afin de d\u00e9terminer le FSI associ\u00e9 \u00e0 celles\u2011ci. Cependant, cette conclusion n\u2019exclut pas la possibilit\u00e9 qu\u2019une personne puisse avoir une attente raisonnable au respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e sur le fondement de faits diff\u00e9rents.\nL\u2019article 8 de la Charte vise \u00e0 assurer une protection contre l\u2019intrusion de l\u2019\u00c9tat dans la vie priv\u00e9e d\u2019une personne et entre en jeu seulement lorsque les attentes raisonnables d\u2019une personne en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e sont affect\u00e9es d\u2019une mani\u00e8re ou d\u2019une autre par une technique d\u2019enqu\u00eate. Le test relatif \u00e0 l\u2019attente raisonnable au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e est tributaire des faits et contextuel, et d\u00e9pend de l\u2019ensemble des circonstances d\u2019un cas particulier. Le test est de nature normative, et non descriptive. Son objectif est de d\u00e9cider quel degr\u00e9 d\u2019intimit\u00e9 une personne devrait avoir, et non pas quel degr\u00e9 d\u2019intimit\u00e9 une personne a effectivement.\nD\u00e9terminer l\u2019objet de la fouille est une question cl\u00e9 dans l\u2019analyse de l\u2019ensemble des circonstances. Pour d\u00e9terminer l\u2019objet de la fouille, le tribunal doit se pencher sur le lien entre la technique d\u2019enqu\u00eate utilis\u00e9e par la police et l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e qui est en jeu. Il doit examiner non seulement la nature des renseignements pr\u00e9cis recherch\u00e9s, mais aussi la nature des renseignements qui sont ainsi r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9s. Le tribunal se pr\u00e9occupe de la capacit\u00e9 des renseignements pr\u00e9cis recherch\u00e9s de donner lieu \u00e0 des inf\u00e9rences ou de r\u00e9v\u00e9ler d\u2019autres renseignements. Ces inf\u00e9rences et ces autres renseignements font partie du v\u00e9ritable objet de la fouille. Une fois avoir d\u00e9termin\u00e9 l\u2019objet de la fouille, il faut alors se demander si une attente subjective au respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019objet de la fouille est objectivement raisonnable. La question de savoir si une attente au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e est raisonnable d\u00e9pend de plusieurs facteurs. Ils peuvent inclure le lieu fouill\u00e9, le contr\u00f4le sur l\u2019objet de la fouille, le caract\u00e8re priv\u00e9 de l\u2019objet, si l\u2019objet \u00e9tait \u00e0 la vue du public, si l\u2019objet a \u00e9t\u00e9 abandonn\u00e9, si des tiers poss\u00e9daient d\u00e9j\u00e0 l\u2019objet, si la m\u00e9thode de fouille a port\u00e9 atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e en cause, si la m\u00e9thode de fouille \u00e9tait elle\u2011m\u00eame d\u00e9raisonnable, et si la fouille a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 des renseignements biographiques. Les facteurs ne seront pas tous pertinents pour l\u2019analyse dans un cas donn\u00e9 et aucun facteur \u00e0 lui seul n\u2019est d\u00e9terminant.\nEn l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les facteurs pertinents pour l\u2019analyse du caract\u00e8re raisonnable sont le caract\u00e8re priv\u00e9 de l\u2019objet, le contr\u00f4le sur l\u2019objet et le lieu fouill\u00e9. Le caract\u00e8re priv\u00e9 de l\u2019objet d\u2019une pr\u00e9tendue fouille peut appuyer une conclusion suivant laquelle une attente au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e est raisonnable. La question est de savoir non seulement si l\u2019objet lui\u2011m\u00eame est priv\u00e9, mais aussi s\u2019il est susceptible de r\u00e9v\u00e9ler d\u2019autres renseignements priv\u00e9s essentiels. Ce facteur rev\u00eat une importance particuli\u00e8re en ce qui a trait aux int\u00e9r\u00eats en mati\u00e8re d\u2019intimit\u00e9 informationnelle. Lorsque seule l\u2019intimit\u00e9 informationnelle est en cause, il peut \u00eatre presque essentiel que les renseignements eux\u2011m\u00eames soient priv\u00e9s pour qu\u2019il existe une attente raisonnable au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e. Le contr\u00f4le sur l\u2019objet de la fouille appuie g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement une conclusion selon laquelle il y avait une attente raisonnable au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e, alors que l\u2019absence de contr\u00f4le peut militer contre une telle conclusion. Le lieu fouill\u00e9 joue sur le caract\u00e8re raisonnable de toute attente au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de celui\u2011ci. L\u2019id\u00e9e du lieu se rapporte essentiellement au concept d\u2019intimit\u00e9 territoriale et prend n\u00e9cessairement moins d\u2019importance dans les cas qui mettent en jeu l\u2019intimit\u00e9 informationnelle.\nIl y a d\u00e9saccord avec l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation que les juges majoritaires font de l\u2019objet de la pr\u00e9tendue fouille en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Les juges majoritaires incluent dans l\u2019objet toute mesure menant \u00e0 l\u2019identification ultime du suspect, malgr\u00e9 le fait que de tels renseignements ne sont pas r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9s par les adresses IP \u00e0 elles seules, suivant la preuve au dossier. La fa\u00e7on correcte de qualifier l\u2019objet de la fouille consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9crire celui\u2011ci comme les adresses IP et le FSI r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 par ces adresses.\nL\u2019attente subjective de B au respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019objet de la fouille n\u2019\u00e9tait pas objectivement raisonnable. Les adresses IP en cause n\u2019\u00e9taient pas priv\u00e9es et, eu \u00e9gard aux faits de l\u2019affaire, ne r\u00e9v\u00e9laient pas de renseignements priv\u00e9s. Sans plus, tout ce qu\u2019une adresse IP r\u00e9v\u00e8le \u00e0 la police est le FSI d\u2019un utilisateur \u2014 ce qui ne constitue gu\u00e8re un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de nature particuli\u00e8rement priv\u00e9e, et encore moins des renseignements biographiques. De plus, le facteur du contr\u00f4le tend \u00e0 exclure une conclusion selon laquelle l\u2019attente de B au respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e \u00e9tait raisonnable. B n\u2019avait gu\u00e8re de contr\u00f4le sur les adresses IP, qu\u2019un FSI peut changer \u00e0 son gr\u00e9 et sans pr\u00e9avis. Un internaute qui laisse derri\u00e8re lui des donn\u00e9es relatives \u00e0 une adresse IP perd compl\u00e8tement le contr\u00f4le de ce qui se passe avec ces chiffres. Enfin, la pr\u00e9tendue fouille n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e au domicile de B. Le lieu de la fouille \u00e9tait la base de donn\u00e9es de l\u2019entreprise de traitement des cartes de cr\u00e9dit. Il n\u2019accro\u00eet pas le caract\u00e8re objectivement raisonnable de l\u2019attente subjective de B au respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e.\nJurisprudence\nCit\u00e9e par la juge Karakatsanis\nArr\u00eats mentionn\u00e9s : R. c.

Introduction\n[1] Internet a grandement modifi\u00e9 l\u2019exp\u00e9rience humaine, qui est pass\u00e9e des espaces physiques au cyberespace. Il en est venu \u00e0 englober des places publiques, des biblioth\u00e8ques, des march\u00e9s, des banques, des cin\u00e9mas et des salles de concert, \u00e9tant devenu l\u2019objet culturel le plus vaste cr\u00e9\u00e9 par notre esp\u00e8ce. Tout comme notre centre commercial et notre h\u00f4tel de ville, Internet est devenu pour bon nombre d\u2019entre nous un fid\u00e8le compagnon, par l\u2019entremise duquel nous confions nos espoirs, nos aspirations et nos craintes. Les gens utilisent Internet non pas seulement pour trouver des recettes, payer des factures ou se faire indiquer le chemin \u00e0 prendre, mais aussi pour explorer leur sexualit\u00e9, planifier leur avenir et trouver l\u2019amour.\n[2] Ces nouvelles r\u00e9alit\u00e9s ont forc\u00e9 les tribunaux \u00e0 se colleter avec \u00ab une multitude de questions in\u00e9dites et \u00e9pineuses \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e \u00bb (R. c. Spencer, 2014 CSC 43, [2014] 2 R.C.S. 212, par. 1). Dans Spencer, notre Cour a jug\u00e9 qu\u2019une attente raisonnable au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e s\u2019applique aux renseignements relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019abonn\u00e9 \u2014 les nom, adresse et coordonn\u00e9es \u2014 associ\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019adresse de protocole Internet (IP) d\u2019une personne. Une demande de l\u2019\u00c9tat en vue d\u2019obtenir ces renseignements constitue une \u00ab fouille \u00bb ou \u00ab perquisition \u00bb au sens de l\u2019art. 8 de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s .\n[3] Le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi porte sur la question de savoir si une adresse IP elle\u2011m\u00eame suscite une attente raisonnable au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e. La r\u00e9ponse doit \u00eatre affirmative.\n[4] Une adresse IP est un num\u00e9ro d\u2019identification unique. De telles adresses identifient une activit\u00e9 connect\u00e9e \u00e0 Internet et permettent le transfert d\u2019information d\u2019une source \u00e0 une autre. Elles sont n\u00e9cessaires pour acc\u00e9der \u00e0 Internet. Une adresse IP identifie la source de toute activit\u00e9 en ligne et relie cette activit\u00e9 (au moyen d\u2019un modem) \u00e0 un endroit donn\u00e9. De plus, le fournisseur de services Internet (FSI) conserve les renseignements relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019abonn\u00e9 qui se rattachent \u00e0 chaque adresse IP.\n[5] Cependant, comme les adresses IP sont compos\u00e9es de chiffres que le FSI peut habituellement changer sans pr\u00e9avis, la Couronne fait valoir \u2014 et les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel sont aussi de cet avis \u2014 qu\u2019une adresse IP ne suscite pas une attente raisonnable au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la Couronne soutient que la police ne recherchait rien de plus que l\u2019ensemble de chiffres qui lui permettrait ultimement d\u2019obtenir l\u2019ordonnance de communication envisag\u00e9e par l\u2019arr\u00eat Spencer. Par cons\u00e9quent, la Couronne estime que l\u2019\u00c9tat n\u2019a pas port\u00e9 atteinte au droit de l\u2019appelant au respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e parce que l\u2019arr\u00eat Spencer prot\u00e9geait suffisamment ses renseignements personnels.\n[6] Soit dit en tout respect, je ne suis pas d\u2019accord. Cette analyse est contraire \u00e0 la jurisprudence de notre Cour concernant l\u2019art. 8 de la Charte . Nous n\u2019avons jamais abord\u00e9 la question du respect de la vie priv\u00e9e fragment par fragment, en fonction de l\u2019intention d\u00e9clar\u00e9e de la police d\u2019utiliser d\u2019une seule fa\u00e7on les renseignements qu\u2019elle recueille. Le droit \u00e0 la protection contre les fouilles, les perquisitions et les saisies abusives, comme tous les droits garantis par la Charte , doit recevoir une interpr\u00e9tation large et t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique, qui refl\u00e8te son origine constitutionnelle. Depuis l\u2019arr\u00eat Hunter c. Southam Inc., [1984] 2 R.C.S. 145, nous avons conclu que l\u2019art. 8 vise \u00e0 emp\u00eacher les violations de la vie priv\u00e9e, plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00e0 condamner ou \u00e0 admettre des violations eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation que fait ultimement l\u2019\u00c9tat de ces renseignements. Le droit \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e, une fois qu\u2019il y a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9 atteinte, ne peut pas \u00eatre r\u00e9tabli.\n[7] \u00c0 cette fin, notre Cour a appliqu\u00e9 un crit\u00e8re normatif aux attentes raisonnables au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e. Nous avons d\u00e9fini l\u2019art. 8 sous l\u2019angle de ce que devrait \u00eatre le droit \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e \u2014 dans une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 libre, d\u00e9mocratique et ouverte \u2014 en mettant en balance le droit d\u2019une personne de ne pas \u00eatre importun\u00e9e et l\u2019insistance que met la collectivit\u00e9 sur la protection. Ce crit\u00e8re normatif exige que nous appliquions une approche large et fonctionnelle \u00e0 l\u2019objet de la fouille, et que nous nous concentrions sur le risque qu\u2019elle r\u00e9v\u00e8le des renseignements d\u2019ordre personnel ou biographique (R. c. Marakah, 2017 CSC 59, [2017] 2 R.C.S. 608, par. 32).\n[8] L\u2019intimit\u00e9 informationnelle est une question particuli\u00e8rement cruciale \u2014 et particuli\u00e8rement difficile. Notre jurisprudence reconna\u00eet que les ordinateurs sont uniques et pr\u00e9sentent des risques en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e qui diff\u00e8rent des risques traditionnellement vis\u00e9s par l\u2019art. 8. La Cour a donc jug\u00e9 que l\u2019art. 8 emp\u00eache g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement la police de saisir un ordinateur sans mandat \u2014 m\u00eame si l\u2019appareil lui\u2011m\u00eame ne fournit aucun renseignement en l\u2019absence d\u2019une autorisation judiciaire de fouiller son contenu \u2014 parce que la saisie de l\u2019ordinateur donne \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tat le moyen d\u2019obtenir acc\u00e8s \u00e0 son contenu (R. c. Reeves, 2018 CSC 56, [2018] 3 R.C.S. 531, par. 34).\n[9] Consid\u00e9rer l\u2019objet de la pr\u00e9sente fouille comme une cha\u00eene abstraite de chiffres utilis\u00e9e uniquement pour obtenir un mandat de type Spencer va \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de ces pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents. Les adresses IP ne sont pas simplement des num\u00e9ros d\u00e9nu\u00e9s de sens. En tant que lien qui relie une activit\u00e9 Internet \u00e0 un endroit donn\u00e9, les adresses IP sont plut\u00f4t susceptibles de r\u00e9v\u00e9ler des renseignements tr\u00e8s personnels \u2014 y compris l\u2019identit\u00e9 de l\u2019utilisateur de l\u2019appareil \u2014 sans jamais faire na\u00eetre l\u2019obligation d\u2019un mandat. L\u2019activit\u00e9 en ligne pr\u00e9cise associ\u00e9e \u00e0 la fouille effectu\u00e9e par l\u2019\u00c9tat peut elle\u2011m\u00eame tendre \u00e0 r\u00e9v\u00e9ler des renseignements tr\u00e8s priv\u00e9s. Lorsqu\u2019elle est mise en corr\u00e9lation avec d\u2019autres renseignements en ligne qui y sont associ\u00e9s, comme ceux que fournissent de leur plein gr\u00e9 des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s priv\u00e9es ou que recueille autrement l\u2019\u00c9tat, une adresse IP peut r\u00e9v\u00e9ler un \u00e9ventail d\u2019activit\u00e9s en ligne tr\u00e8s personnelles. De plus, lorsqu\u2019elle est associ\u00e9e aux profils cr\u00e9\u00e9s et conserv\u00e9s par des tiers du secteur priv\u00e9, les risques en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e li\u00e9s aux adresses IP augmentent de fa\u00e7on exponentielle. L\u2019information que recueillent, agr\u00e8gent et analysent ces tiers leur permet de r\u00e9pertorier nos renseignements biographiques les plus intimes. Consid\u00e9r\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re normative et dans son contexte, une adresse IP est le premier fragment num\u00e9rique qui peut mener l\u2019\u00c9tat sur la trace de l\u2019activit\u00e9 Internet d\u2019une personne. Elle est susceptible de r\u00e9v\u00e9ler des renseignements personnels bien avant qu\u2019un mandat de type Spencer ne soit sollicit\u00e9.\n[10] De plus, Internet a concentr\u00e9 cette masse d\u2019information aupr\u00e8s de tiers du secteur priv\u00e9 dont les activit\u00e9s ne tombent pas sous le coup de la Charte . Ainsi, Internet a fondamentalement modifi\u00e9 la topographie de l\u2019intimit\u00e9 informationnelle sous le r\u00e9gime de la Charte en introduisant des tiers m\u00e9diateurs entre la personne et l\u2019\u00c9tat \u2014 des m\u00e9diateurs qui ne sont pas eux\u2011m\u00eames assujettis \u00e0 la Charte . Des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s priv\u00e9es r\u00e9pondent \u00e0 des demandes fr\u00e9quentes des forces de l\u2019ordre et peuvent fournir de leur plein gr\u00e9 toute l\u2019activit\u00e9 associ\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019adresse IP demand\u00e9e. Des entreprises citoyennes priv\u00e9es peuvent fournir de leur plein gr\u00e9 des profils granulaires de l\u2019activit\u00e9 Internet d\u2019un utilisateur individuel pendant des jours, des semaines ou des mois sans jamais tomber sous le coup de la Charte . Cette information peut toucher au c\u0153ur de l\u2019ensemble des renseignements biographique d\u2019un utilisateur et peut ultimement \u00eatre reli\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019identit\u00e9 d\u2019un utilisateur, avec ou sans un mandat de type Spencer. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une atteinte tr\u00e8s grave \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e.\n[11] L\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat l\u00e9gitime de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e entre en balance avec son int\u00e9r\u00eat l\u00e9gitime dans \u00ab [l]a r\u00e9pression du crime et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00bb (R. c. Tessling, 2004 CSC 67, [2004] 3 R.C.S. 432, par. 17). Bien que le droit de ne pas \u00eatre importun\u00e9 doive suivre l\u2019\u00e9volution technologique, la mani\u00e8re de commettre un crime et d\u2019enqu\u00eater sur celui\u2011ci \u00e9volue \u00e9galement. La facilit\u00e9 d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 Internet et l\u2019anonymat de l\u2019utilisateur se conjuguent pour faciliter la perp\u00e9tration d\u2019un crime et mettent \u00e0 rude \u00e9preuve l\u2019application efficace de la loi. Il est clair que la nature particuli\u00e8rement insidieuse d\u2019un grand nombre de cybercrimes, y compris la pornographie juv\u00e9nile et le leurre d\u2019enfant, pose un pr\u00e9judice social grave et urgent. La police doit disposer des outils n\u00e9cessaires pour enqu\u00eater sur ces crimes. De plus, lorsqu\u2019une adresse IP (ou l\u2019information relative \u00e0 l\u2019abonn\u00e9) est clairement li\u00e9e \u00e0 un crime \u2014 comme elle peut manifestement l\u2019\u00eatre dans le cas de la pornographie juv\u00e9nile ou du leurre d\u2019enfant \u2014, une autorisation judiciaire pr\u00e9alable est facile \u00e0 obtenir. Une ordonnance de communication d\u2019une adresse IP exigerait peu de renseignements de plus que ce que la police doit d\u00e9j\u00e0 fournir pour obtenir un mandat de type Spencer. Tant l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019application efficace de la loi que son int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 la protection des droits \u00e0 l\u2019intimit\u00e9 informationnelle de tous les Canadiens et les Canadiennes doivent \u00eatre respect\u00e9s et mis en balance.\n[12] Tout bien pes\u00e9, le fardeau qu\u2019impose \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tat le fait de reconna\u00eetre une attente raisonnable au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des adresses IP n\u2019est pas lourd. Cette reconnaissance ajoute une autre \u00e9tape aux enqu\u00eates criminelles en exigeant que l\u2019\u00c9tat d\u00e9montre l\u2019existence de motifs pour porter atteinte \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e en ligne. Cependant, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e8re des t\u00e9l\u00e9mandats, cet obstacle est facilement surmont\u00e9 lorsque la police recherche l\u2019adresse IP dans le cadre de l\u2019enqu\u00eate sur une infraction criminelle. La protection conf\u00e9r\u00e9e par l\u2019art. 8 laisserait la police suivre une activit\u00e9 Internet li\u00e9e \u00e0 ses objectifs d\u2019application de la loi tout en l\u2019emp\u00eachant de demander librement l\u2019adresse IP associ\u00e9e \u00e0 une activit\u00e9 en ligne non li\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate. La surveillance judiciaire enl\u00e8verait \u00e9galement aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s priv\u00e9es le pouvoir de d\u00e9cider s\u2019il convient de r\u00e9v\u00e9ler des renseignements \u2014 et en quelle quantit\u00e9 \u2014 et renverrait la question au champ d\u2019application de la Charte .\n[13] En tant qu\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment inh\u00e9rent crucial dans la structure d\u2019Internet, une adresse IP est la cl\u00e9 susceptible de guider l\u2019\u00c9tat dans le labyrinthe de l\u2019activit\u00e9 Internet d\u2019un utilisateur ainsi que le lien par lequel des interm\u00e9diaires peuvent fournir de leur plein gr\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tat des renseignements relatifs \u00e0 cet utilisateur. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019art. 8 devrait prot\u00e9ger les adresses IP. Cela aurait pour effet de pr\u00e9server le premier \u00ab fragment num\u00e9rique \u00bb et d\u2019obscurcir la trace du parcours d\u2019un internaute dans le cyberespace; cela aurait \u00e9galement pour effet de favoriser la r\u00e9alisation de l\u2019objectif de l\u2019art. 8 consistant \u00e0 emp\u00eacher les possibles atteintes \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e plut\u00f4t que de circonscrire sa port\u00e9e suivant les intentions d\u00e9clar\u00e9es de l\u2019\u00c9tat quant \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re dont il utilisera cette cl\u00e9.\n[14] Je suis d\u2019avis d\u2019accueillir le pourvoi. Il existe une attente raisonnable au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une adresse IP. Une demande d\u2019adresse IP faite par l\u2019\u00c9tat constitue une fouille.\nII. Contexte\n[15] L\u2019appelant, Andrei Bykovets, a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable de 14 infractions d\u2019utilisation de donn\u00e9es de carte de cr\u00e9dit non autoris\u00e9es pour l\u2019achat de cartes\u2011cadeaux en ligne, d\u2019utilisation de ces cartes\u2011cadeaux pour des achats effectu\u00e9s en magasin, et de possession de mat\u00e9riel li\u00e9 \u00e0 la fraude par carte de cr\u00e9dit.\n[16] Au cours de l\u2019enqu\u00eate qu\u2019a men\u00e9e le Service de police de Calgary sur les achats en ligne frauduleux effectu\u00e9s aupr\u00e8s d\u2019un magasin de vins et spiritueux, la police a appris que les ventes en ligne du magasin \u00e9taient g\u00e9r\u00e9es par Moneris, une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 tierce de traitement des paiements. La police a communiqu\u00e9 avec Moneris pour obtenir les adresses IP utilis\u00e9es pour les op\u00e9rations, et l\u2019entreprise en a volontairement signal\u00e9 deux. La police a par la suite obtenu une ordonnance de communication obligeant le FSI des adresses \u00e0 r\u00e9v\u00e9ler les renseignements relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019abonn\u00e9 \u2014 le nom et l\u2019adresse du client \u2014 pour chaque adresse IP, comme l\u2019exige l\u2019arr\u00eat Spencer. L\u2019une d\u2019elles \u00e9tait enregistr\u00e9e au nom de l\u2019appelant et l\u2019autre \u00e0 celui de son p\u00e8re.\n[17] La police a ensuite utilis\u00e9 ces renseignements pour solliciter et ex\u00e9cuter des mandats de perquisition visant les adresses r\u00e9sidentielles de l\u2019appelant et de son p\u00e8re. L\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 arr\u00eat\u00e9, a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable apr\u00e8s la tenue d\u2019un proc\u00e8s, et ses d\u00e9clarations de culpabilit\u00e9 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9es en appel.\n[18] Avant le proc\u00e8s, l\u2019appelant a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que la demande faite par la police \u00e0 Moneris avait viol\u00e9 son droit \u00e0 la protection contre les fouilles, les perquisitions et les saisies abusives garanti par l\u2019art. 8 de la Charte . La question cl\u00e9 au voir\u2011dire \u00e9tait celle de savoir si l\u2019appelant avait une attente raisonnable au respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de son adresse IP.\n[19] L\u2019avocat de la d\u00e9fense a soumis le rapport d\u2019un enqu\u00eateur judiciaire contenant un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 technique des adresses IP et de leurs r\u00f4les. Le rapport indique qu\u2019il y a des adresses IP internes et des adresses IP externes. Les adresses IP externes sont utilis\u00e9es pour transf\u00e9rer de l\u2019information d\u2019une source \u00e0 une autre sur Internet au moyen d\u2019un modem lou\u00e9 du FSI. L\u2019adresse IP externe ressemble beaucoup \u00e0 l\u2019adresse municipale de la maison d\u2019une personne. Sans celle\u2011ci, un utilisateur ne peut ni envoyer ni recevoir de donn\u00e9es. Un modem ou un routeur attribue \u00e9galement une adresse IP interne \u00e0 chaque appareil sur un r\u00e9seau local, ce qui correspond \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s aux diff\u00e9rentes pi\u00e8ces d\u2019une maison.\n[20] Les adresses IP peuvent \u00e9galement \u00eatre statiques ou dynamiques. La plupart d\u2019entre elles sont dynamiques, ce qui signifie que le FSI peut changer l\u2019adresse IP externe d\u2019un utilisateur sans pr\u00e9avis et pour diff\u00e9rentes raisons. Le FSI tient un registre indiquant \u00e0 quel abonn\u00e9 chaque adresse IP externe a \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9e et pour quelle p\u00e9riode.\n[21] Il est possible de d\u00e9terminer le FSI d\u2019un utilisateur en entrant son adresse IP dans un site Web de recherche d\u2019adresse IP. La police peut par la suite demander au FSI de lui fournir les renseignements relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019abonn\u00e9 \u00e0 qui l\u2019adresse IP a \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9e, comme le pr\u00e9voit l\u2019arr\u00eat Spencer. Cela dit, l\u2019expert a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il est toujours possible de prendre des mesures pour d\u00e9terminer l\u2019identit\u00e9 d\u2019un utilisateur, sans avoir recours au FSI, au moyen des renseignements enregistr\u00e9s sur le site Web d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 tierce. Des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s tierces, comme Google ou Facebook, peuvent suivre les adresses IP externes de chaque utilisateur qui visite leur site et enregistrer ces renseignements \u00e0 divers degr\u00e9s. Ces soci\u00e9t\u00e9s peuvent d\u00e9terminer l\u2019identit\u00e9 de ces utilisateurs individuels en fonction de leur activit\u00e9 Internet sur leur site (rapport d\u2019expertise, reproduit au d.a., p. 311). L\u2019effet est amplifi\u00e9 lorsque des renseignements de multiples sites sont recueillis (p. 312).\n[22] Par cons\u00e9quent, de l\u2019avis de l\u2019expert, si ceux qui cherchent \u00e0 identifier un internaute particulier ont acc\u00e8s aux renseignements enregistr\u00e9s par des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s tierces, [traduction] \u00ab il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019obtenir les renseignements relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019abonn\u00e9 d\u00e9tenus par le FSI pour identifier correctement un internaute particulier \u00bb (p. 312).\nIII. D\u00e9cisions des juridictions inf\u00e9rieures\nA. Cour du Banc de la Reine de l\u2019Alberta, 2020 ABQB 70, 10 Alta. L.R. (7th) 103 (la juge Ho)\n[23] La juge du proc\u00e8s a conclu que la demande faite par la police \u00e0 Moneris ne constituait pas une fouille au sens de l\u2019art. 8 de la Charte parce que l\u2019appelant n\u2019avait pas une attente raisonnable au respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de son adresse IP. Eu \u00e9gard aux facteurs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s par notre Cour dans Tessling, elle a d\u00e9fini l\u2019objet de la pr\u00e9tendue fouille comme \u00e9tant les adresses IP recherch\u00e9es pour faire avancer l\u2019enqu\u00eate. Elle a examin\u00e9 le rapport d\u2019expertise et a estim\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 elles seules, les adresses IP n\u2019\u00e9tablissent pas un lien avec, ni ne fournissent aucune autre information sur, un internaute (par. 44).\n[24] Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019attente subjective de l\u2019appelant au respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de son adresse IP n\u2019\u00e9tait pas raisonnable parce que l\u2019adresse en question ne r\u00e9v\u00e9lait pas un \u00ab ensemble de renseignements biographiques d\u2019ordre personnel \u00bb sans acc\u00e8s au site Web d\u2019un tiers (par. 56). La juge du proc\u00e8s a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait [traduction] \u00ab gu\u00e8re \u00e0 gagner d\u2019un point de vue normatif \u00bb au fait d\u2019\u00ab exiger de la police qu\u2019elle sollicite une autorisation judiciaire \u00bb lorsqu\u2019elle acc\u00e8de \u00e0 l\u2019adresse IP elle\u2011m\u00eame plut\u00f4t que lorsqu\u2019elle acc\u00e8de aux renseignements relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019abonn\u00e9 li\u00e9s \u00e0 cette adresse IP (par. 64, citant Spencer).\nB. Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Alberta, 2022 ABCA 208, [2023] 5 W.W.R. 51 (les juges Schutz et Crighton, la juge Veldhuis, dissidente)\n[25] Les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel ont rejet\u00e9 l\u2019appel, en grande partie pour les motifs expos\u00e9s par la juge du proc\u00e8s. Les juges Schutz et Crighton ont convenu que l\u2019appelant n\u2019avait aucune attente raisonnable au respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de son adresse IP parce que, prise isol\u00e9ment, cette adresse ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le rien sur le mode de vie ou les renseignements biographiques d\u2019une personne. Le peu d\u2019information qu\u2019a communiqu\u00e9 l\u2019adresse IP a \u00e9t\u00e9 supplant\u00e9 par [traduction] \u00ab des pr\u00e9occupations l\u00e9gitimes tout aussi valables \u00bb : \u00ab . . . la r\u00e9pression du crime et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 . . . \u00bb (par. 22).\n[26] La juge Veldhuis, dissidente, aurait accueilli l\u2019appel au motif que la juge du proc\u00e8s n\u2019a pas [traduction] \u00ab entrepris son analyse en tenant compte de l\u2019approche normative \u00bb (par. 62). Qualifi\u00e9 ad\u00e9quatement, l\u2019objet de la fouille n\u2019\u00e9tait pas l\u2019adresse IP elle\u2011m\u00eame, mais [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019identit\u00e9 d\u2019un internaute qui correspond \u00e0 une adresse IP particuli\u00e8re li\u00e9e \u00e0 une activit\u00e9 Internet particuli\u00e8re sous surveillance \u00bb (par. 77).\n[27] La juge Veldhuis a conclu que l\u2019attente de l\u2019appelant au respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019objet de la fouille \u00e9tait raisonnable. Une personne ayant communiqu\u00e9 des donn\u00e9es financi\u00e8res pour effectuer un achat en ligne s\u2019attendrait \u00e0 ce que l\u2019adresse IP utilis\u00e9e demeure priv\u00e9e, et ce renseignement \u00e9tait de nature priv\u00e9e parce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait susceptible d\u2019identifier un internaute [traduction] \u00ab sans aucune exigence de soup\u00e7ons ou de motifs raisonnables \u00e9tayant une autorisation judiciaire \u00bb (par. 88). Par cons\u00e9quent, une attente raisonnable au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e s\u2019appliquait \u00e0 ces adresses IP parce que [traduction] \u00ab celles\u2011ci \u00e9taient li\u00e9es \u00e0 une activit\u00e9 Internet particuli\u00e8re sous surveillance qui \u00e9tait susceptible de r\u00e9v\u00e9ler des renseignements biographiques \u00bb (par. 94).\nIV. Analyse\n[28] Le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi soul\u00e8ve une seule question : Une attente raisonnable au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e s\u2019applique\u2011t\u2011elle \u00e0 une adresse IP? \u00c0 mon avis, la r\u00e9ponse est affirmative. Comme je vais l\u2019expliquer, une adresse IP est le lien crucial entre un internaute et son activit\u00e9 en ligne. Par cons\u00e9quent, la pr\u00e9sente fouille avait pour objet les renseignements que les adresses IP en cause pouvaient r\u00e9v\u00e9ler sur des internautes pr\u00e9cis, y compris, ultimement, leur identit\u00e9. Conclure que l\u2019art. 8 ne vise pas une adresse IP parce que la police l\u2019a recueillie uniquement pour obtenir un mandat de type Spencer ne tient aucun compte des renseignements qu\u2019elle peut r\u00e9v\u00e9ler sans mandat. Une telle analyse refl\u00e8te un raisonnement fragment par fragment, fond\u00e9 sur la mani\u00e8re dont l\u2019\u00c9tat entend utiliser l\u2019information dans une situation donn\u00e9e, ce qui est contraire \u00e0 l\u2019approche large et t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique que requiert le statut constitutionnel de l\u2019art. 8. L\u2019analyse ne peut pas non plus se limiter aux int\u00e9r\u00eats en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9s touch\u00e9s par ce qu\u2019est susceptible de r\u00e9v\u00e9ler l\u2019adresse IP \u00e0 elle seule, sans qu\u2019il ne soit tenu compte de ce qu\u2019elle est susceptible de r\u00e9v\u00e9ler lorsque combin\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u2019autres renseignements disponibles, en particulier aupr\u00e8s de sites Web de tiers. Consid\u00e9r\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re normative, une adresse IP est la cl\u00e9 donnant acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019activit\u00e9 Internet d\u2019un utilisateur et, ultimement, \u00e0 son identit\u00e9, de sorte qu\u2019elle suscite une attente raisonnable au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e. S\u2019il doit prot\u00e9ger de mani\u00e8re significative la vie priv\u00e9e en ligne des Canadiens et des Canadiennes dans le monde actuel qui est tr\u00e8s largement num\u00e9rique, l\u2019art. 8 doit prot\u00e9ger leurs adresses IP.\nA. Cadre juridique\n[29] L\u2019article 8 de la Charte garantit le \u00ab droit \u00e0 la protection contre les fouilles, les perquisitions ou les saisies abusives \u00bb. Il vise principalement \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger la vie priv\u00e9e ou le droit individuel \u00ab de ne pas \u00eatre importun\u00e9 \u00bb (R. c. Edwards, [1996] 1 R.C.S. 128, par. 67). Le respect de la vie priv\u00e9e d\u2019un individu est essentiel pour assurer la dignit\u00e9, l\u2019autonomie et la croissance personnelle de celui\u2011ci (R. c. Jones, 2017 CSC 60, [2017] 2 R.C.S. 696, par. 38). La protection de sa vie priv\u00e9e est une condition pr\u00e9alable essentielle \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9panouissement d\u2019une d\u00e9mocratie libre et en sant\u00e9.\n[30] Pour \u00e9tablir une violation de l\u2019art. 8, le demandeur doit d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il y a eu une fouille, une perquisition ou une saisie, et que la fouille, la perquisition ou la saisie \u00e9tait abusive. Seule la premi\u00e8re exigence \u2014 si la demande des adresses IP constituait une fouille \u2014 est en cause en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[31] Il y a fouille lorsque l\u2019\u00c9tat frustre une attente raisonnable au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e. Une attente au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e est raisonnable quand le droit du public de ne pas \u00eatre importun\u00e9 par le gouvernement l\u2019emporte sur le droit du gouvernement de s\u2019immiscer dans la vie priv\u00e9e des particuliers afin de r\u00e9aliser ses fins, notamment d\u2019assurer l\u2019application de la loi (Hunter, p. 159\u2011160). Les tribunaux analysent l\u2019attente au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e en examinant de nombreux facteurs interreli\u00e9s, mais souvent concurrents, qui peuvent \u00eatre regroup\u00e9s en quatre cat\u00e9gories : (1) l\u2019objet de la fouille; (2) l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du demandeur \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019objet; (3) l\u2019attente subjective du demandeur au respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e; et (4) la question de savoir si l\u2019attente subjective au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e \u00e9tait objectivement raisonnable (Spencer, par. 18, citant Tessling, par. 32).\n[32] La pr\u00e9sente affaire porte sur l\u2019intimit\u00e9 informationnelle, ou [traduction] \u00ab le droit revendiqu\u00e9 par des particuliers, des groupes ou des institutions de d\u00e9terminer eux\u2011m\u00eames le moment, la mani\u00e8re et la mesure dans lesquels des renseignements les concernant sont communiqu\u00e9s \u00bb (Tessling, par. 23, citant A. F. Westin, Privacy and Freedom (1970), p. 7). Autrement dit, cet aspect du droit \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e concerne \u00ab l\u2019autod\u00e9termination informationnelle \u00bb (Jones, par. 39).\n[33] Les parties conviennent que l\u2019appelant avait un int\u00e9r\u00eat direct \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des adresses IP ainsi qu\u2019une attente subjective au respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de leur contenu informationnel. Dans les sections qui suivent, je me penche sur l\u2019objet de la fouille et sur la question de savoir si l\u2019attente de l\u2019appelant au respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cet objet \u00e9tait raisonnable.\nB. L\u2019objet de la fouille\n[34] Examiner l\u2019objet de la pr\u00e9tendue fouille permet au tribunal de d\u00e9terminer les int\u00e9r\u00eats en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e qui sont en cause (Spencer, par. 22). Une question directrice lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9finir l\u2019objet de la pr\u00e9tendue fouille consiste \u00e0 \u00e9tablir [traduction] \u00ab ce que la police recherchait vraiment \u00bb (Marakah, par. 15, citant R. c. Ward, 2012 ONCA 660, 112 O.R. (3d) 321, par. 67). Le tribunal doit concevoir l\u2019objet de la fouille d\u2019un point de vue holistique. L\u2019approche ne doit pas \u00eatre m\u00e9canique et doit tenir compte de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 technologique (Spencer, par. 26 et 31; Marakah, par. 17).\n[35] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019appelant nous demande d\u2019adopter la fa\u00e7on dont la juge dissidente a qualifi\u00e9 l\u2019objet. Ce que la police recherchait vraiment, affirme\u2011t\u2011il, \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab de relier une activit\u00e9 Internet \u00e0 une personne pr\u00e9cise. Obtenir une adresse IP \u00e9tait une \u00e9tape essentielle pour identifier l\u2019internaute s\u2019\u00e9tant livr\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019activit\u00e9 Internet pr\u00e9cise \u00bb (m.a., par. 37).\n[36] La Couronne intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9conise la qualification donn\u00e9e par la juge du proc\u00e8s et les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel. La police [traduction] \u00ab voulait les adresses IP pour faire progresser son enqu\u00eate \u00bb (m.i., par. 53).\n[37] \u00c0 mon avis, la juge du proc\u00e8s et les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel ont adopt\u00e9 une description artificiellement \u00e9troite de l\u2019objet de cette pr\u00e9tendue fouille. Cette description est incompatible avec l\u2019approche normative suivie dans nos pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents et ne prend pas en compte les int\u00e9r\u00eats en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e qui sont en jeu en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[38] Notre Cour n\u2019a jamais d\u00e9crit le droit constitutionnel \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e en fonction de l\u2019intention d\u00e9clar\u00e9e de l\u2019\u00c9tat, ou d\u2019une utilisation particuli\u00e8re des renseignements. Nous avons plut\u00f4t syst\u00e9matiquement adopt\u00e9 une approche large et fonctionnelle \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019objet de la fouille, \u00ab en examinant le lien entre la technique d\u2019enqu\u00eate utilis\u00e9e par la police et l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e qui est en jeu \u00bb (Spencer, par. 26). L\u2019objet est d\u00e9fini sous l\u2019angle non pas seulement des renseignements eux\u2011m\u00eames, mais \u00e9galement de \u00ab la tendance qui consiste \u00e0 chercher \u00e0 obtenir des renseignements pour permettre d\u2019en tirer des inf\u00e9rences au sujet d\u2019autres renseignements qui, eux, sont de nature personnelle \u00bb (par. 31). Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Marakah, par exemple, la question \u00e9tait de savoir si l\u2019exp\u00e9diteur d\u2019un message texte a une attente raisonnable au respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ce message dans l\u2019appareil du destinataire. S\u2019exprimant au nom des juges majoritaires, la juge en chef McLachlin a statu\u00e9 que l\u2019objet de la fouille n\u2019\u00e9tait pas le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone du destinataire, ni m\u00eame le message texte lui\u2011m\u00eame, mais une \u00ab conversation \u00e9lectronique \u00bb y compris \u00ab toute inf\u00e9rence que l\u2019on peut tirer de ces renseignements quant aux fr\u00e9quentations et aux activit\u00e9s \u00bb (par. 20).\n[39] Les tribunaux doivent \u00eatre particuli\u00e8rement prudents lorsqu\u2019ils d\u00e9crivent l\u2019objet d\u2019une fouille relative \u00e0 des donn\u00e9es \u00e9lectroniques (Marakah, par. 14). Dans R. c. Cole, 2012 CSC 53, [2012] 3 R.C.S. 34, o\u00f9 la police avait examin\u00e9 le contenu d\u2019un ordinateur, notre Cour a d\u00e9crit l\u2019objet de la pr\u00e9tendue fouille comme \u00e9tant \u00ab les donn\u00e9es, ou le contenu informationnel [. . .] de l\u2019ordinateur portatif, [. . .] non pas [l\u2019appareil] lui\u2011m\u00eame \u00bb (par. 41 (en italique dans l\u2019original)).\n[40] De m\u00eame, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Reeves, o\u00f9 la police avait saisi l\u2019ordinateur domestique partag\u00e9 de l\u2019appelant, la fouille ne visait pas uniquement l\u2019ordinateur lui\u2011m\u00eame, mais \u00ab ultimement, les donn\u00e9es qu\u2019il renfermait sur l\u2019utilisation de M. Reeves, y compris les fichiers auxquels il avait acc\u00e9d\u00e9 et ceux qu\u2019il avait sauvegard\u00e9s et supprim\u00e9s \u00bb (par. 30). L\u2019\u00c9tat a fait intervenir l\u2019art. 8 en saisissant l\u2019ordinateur m\u00eame si la police avait besoin d\u2019un mandat pour fouiller son contenu, parce que la saisie a \u00e9t\u00e9 pour la police \u00ab le moyen d\u2019obtenir acc\u00e8s \u00e0 [d]es renseignements [de nature \u00e9minemment personnelle] \u00bb (par. 34).\n[41] C\u2019est la m\u00eame chose en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. La police ne \u00ab recherchait [pas] vraiment \u00bb les adresses IP dans l\u2019abstrait. En tant qu\u2019\u00ab ensemble de chiffres \u00bb, une adresse IP n\u2019est d\u2019aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat pour la police. Cette derni\u00e8re recherchait plut\u00f4t les renseignements qu\u2019une adresse IP tend \u00e0 r\u00e9v\u00e9ler sur un internaute pr\u00e9cis, y compris son activit\u00e9 en ligne et, ultimement, son identit\u00e9 \u00ab en tant que source, possesseur ou utilisateur des renseignements vis\u00e9s \u00bb (Spencer, par. 47). Constituant l\u2019identifiant d\u2019une activit\u00e9 connect\u00e9e \u00e0 Internet provenant d\u2019un endroit donn\u00e9, l\u2019adresse IP est un outil puissant qui permet \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tat \u2014 avec ou sans un autre mandat \u2014 de recueillir l\u2019activit\u00e9 Internet d\u2019un utilisateur pendant la p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 une adresse IP particuli\u00e8re est li\u00e9e \u00e0 cette source. Par cons\u00e9quent, comme dans l\u2019affaire Reeves, l\u2019adresse IP a fourni \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tat le moyen de tirer des inf\u00e9rences imm\u00e9diates et directes sur l\u2019utilisateur derri\u00e8re une activit\u00e9 Internet pr\u00e9cise. Les renseignements inf\u00e9r\u00e9s d\u2019une activit\u00e9 Internet sur un appareil peuvent \u00eatre tr\u00e8s personnels, y compris en liant cette activit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019identit\u00e9 d\u2019un utilisateur particulier (voir Spencer, par. 47).\n[42] Cette description constitue une conception large et fonctionnelle de l\u2019objet. En \u00ab se gard[ant] [. . .] \u00e0 juste titre de toute approche m\u00e9canique qui d\u00e9finirait l\u2019objet en fonction d\u2019actes mat\u00e9riels, de lieux physiques ou de modalit\u00e9s de transmission [informationnelle] \u00bb, elle \u00ab tient [. . .] compte de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 technologique \u00bb (Marakah, par. 17). Cette description n\u2019\u00e9tend pas le bouclier protecteur de la Charte \u00e0 toutes les \u00e9tapes d\u2019une enqu\u00eate. Elle confirme plut\u00f4t que les techniques d\u2019enqu\u00eate qui r\u00e9v\u00e8lent des renseignements qui semblent inoffensifs doivent tout de m\u00eame \u00eatre examin\u00e9es par rapport aux int\u00e9r\u00eats en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e qui sont en jeu (Spencer, par. 26) Reconna\u00eetre que la police voulait l\u2019adresse IP \u2014 en tant que lien entre un abonn\u00e9 et un endroit donn\u00e9s et une activit\u00e9 Internet particuli\u00e8re \u2014 pour obtenir davantage de renseignements sur l\u2019utilisateur permet au tribunal d\u2019appr\u00e9cier l\u2019attente au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de tous les renseignements que cette adresse IP \u00ab ten[d] \u00e0 r\u00e9v\u00e9ler \u00bb (Spencer, par. 27 (soulignement dans l\u2019original), citant R. c. Plant, [1993] 3 R.C.S. 281, p. 293), et donc en [traduction] \u00ab t[enant] compte de la nature des droits en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e auxquels l\u2019action de l\u2019\u00c9tat pourrait porter atteinte \u00bb (Marakah, par. 15, citant Ward, par. 65 (je souligne)).\n[43] Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019objet de la pr\u00e9tendue fouille en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est une adresse IP en tant que cl\u00e9 permettant d\u2019obtenir davantage de renseignements sur un internaute particulier, y compris son activit\u00e9 en ligne et, ultimement, son identit\u00e9 en tant que source de ces renseignements. Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, la police a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 obtenir ces renseignements au moyen d\u2019une ordonnance de communication telle que l\u2019envisage l\u2019arr\u00eat Spencer. Cependant, comme l\u2019indique le rapport d\u2019expertise, un mandat de type Spencer ne constitue pas la seule fa\u00e7on dont une adresse IP peut r\u00e9v\u00e9ler des d\u00e9tails intimes sur le mode de vie et les choix personnels d\u2019un internaute. L\u2019activit\u00e9 en ligne associ\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019adresse IP peut elle\u2011m\u00eame r\u00e9v\u00e9ler des renseignements tr\u00e8s personnels sans les mesures de protection relatives \u00e0 l\u2019autorisation judiciaire pr\u00e9alable. Je passe maintenant \u00e0 cette question.\nC. L\u2019attente au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e \u00e9tait\u2011elle raisonnable?\n[44] L\u2019article 8 est mis en jeu uniquement lorsqu\u2019une attente subjective au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e est objectivement raisonnable. La question, dans tous les cas, est celle de savoir \u00ab si, dans une situation donn\u00e9e, le droit du public de ne pas \u00eatre importun\u00e9 par le gouvernement doit c\u00e9der le pas au droit du gouvernement de s\u2019immiscer dans la vie priv\u00e9e des particuliers afin de r\u00e9aliser ses fins et, notamment, d\u2019assurer l\u2019application de la loi \u00bb (Hunter, p. 159\u2011160).\n[45] Les tribunaux doivent trancher cette question eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble des circonstances. Bien qu\u2019il n\u2019existe pas de liste d\u00e9finitive de facteurs (Cole, par. 45), les tribunaux ont souvent examin\u00e9 plus particuli\u00e8rement le contr\u00f4le sur l\u2019objet exerc\u00e9 par le demandeur, le lieu de la fouille et le caract\u00e8re priv\u00e9 de l\u2019objet (voir, p. ex., Marakah, par. 24).\n(1) Contr\u00f4le sur l\u2019objet\n[46] Dans le contexte de l\u2019intimit\u00e9 informationnelle, le contr\u00f4le exerc\u00e9 par le demandeur sur l\u2019objet n\u2019est pas d\u00e9terminant (Reeves, par. 38). L\u2019autod\u00e9termination au c\u0153ur de l\u2019intimit\u00e9 informationnelle signifie qu\u2019une personne \u00ab peut [. . .] choisir de divulguer certains renseignements soit pour une fin pr\u00e9cise, soit encore \u00e0 une cat\u00e9gorie restreinte de personnes, et n\u00e9anmoins conserver une attente raisonnable au respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e \u00bb (Jones, par. 39). L\u2019anonymat est une conception particuli\u00e8rement importante du droit \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e quand il est question d\u2019Internet (Spencer, par. 45, citant Westin, p. 32).\n[47] Notre approche diff\u00e8re de celle des \u00c9tats\u2011Unis, o\u00f9 ce qu\u2019on appelle la [traduction] \u00ab doctrine du tiers \u00bb exclut l\u2019attente raisonnable au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e \u00ab si les renseignements sont d\u00e9tenus ou connus par des tiers \u00bb (T. Panneck, \u00ab Incognito Mode Is in the Constitution \u00bb (2019), 104 Minn. L. Rev. 511, p. 520, citant D. J. Solove, \u00ab A Taxonomy of Privacy \u00bb (2006), 154 U. Pa. L. Rev. 477, p. 528). Notre Cour a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019approche am\u00e9ricaine tr\u00e8s t\u00f4t dans sa jurisprudence relative \u00e0 l\u2019art. 8 (R. c. Dyment, [1988] 2 R.C.S. 417, p. 429\u2011430, le juge La Forest).\n[48] Le caract\u00e8re non d\u00e9terminant du contr\u00f4le dans notre analyse est particuli\u00e8rement pertinent en ce qui concerne Internet, qui exige que les utilisateurs r\u00e9v\u00e8lent \u00e0 leur FSI les renseignements relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019abonn\u00e9 pour pouvoir prendre part aux activit\u00e9s de cette nouvelle place publique. Comme nous l\u2019avons affirm\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Jones, \u00ab la seule fa\u00e7on qu\u2019avait l\u2019int\u00e9ress\u00e9 de conserver, vis\u2011\u00e0\u2011vis du fournisseur de services, un contr\u00f4le sur l\u2019objet de la fouille, \u00e9tait de s\u2019abstenir compl\u00e8tement d\u2019utiliser ses services. Il ne s\u2019agit \u00e9videmment pas l\u00e0 d\u2019un v\u00e9ritable choix. [. . .] Les Canadiens n\u2019ont pas \u00e0 vivre en reclus du monde num\u00e9rique afin de pouvoir conserver un semblant de vie priv\u00e9e \u00bb (par. 45).\n(2) Lieu fouill\u00e9\n[49] Le lieu o\u00f9 s\u2019est d\u00e9roul\u00e9e la fouille n\u2019est pas non plus pr\u00e9judiciable \u00e0 une attente raisonnable au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Ce facteur a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9labor\u00e9 en grande partie dans le contexte de l\u2019intimit\u00e9 territoriale, et un objet num\u00e9rique \u00ab cadre mal dans les param\u00e8tres \u00e9tablis par la jurisprudence \u00bb (Marakah, par. 27). Comme l\u2019a r\u00e9cemment fait remarquer notre Cour, \u00ab les espaces en ligne sont qualitativement diff\u00e9rents \u00bb des espaces physiques (R. c. Ramelson, 2022 CSC 44, par. 49 (en italique dans l\u2019original)).\n[50] L\u2019architecture d\u2019Internet a men\u00e9 \u00e0 un registre permanent large, pr\u00e9cis et en continuelle expansion qui est [traduction] \u00ab sans pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent dans notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00bb (R. c. Vu, 2013 CSC 60, [2013] 3 R.C.S. 657, par. 40 (soulignement dans l\u2019original), citant A. D. Gold, \u00ab Applying Section 8 in the Digital World : Seizures and Searches \u00bb, document pr\u00e9par\u00e9 pour le 7th Annual Six\u2011Minute Criminal Defence Lawyer (9 juin 2007), par. 3). Les renseignements que renferme Internet peuvent r\u00e9v\u00e9ler beaucoup plus que ce que sont susceptibles de r\u00e9v\u00e9ler des renseignements assujettis aux limites d\u2019un espace physique (voir Vu, par. 44 et 47). Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019absence d\u2019intrusion physique soulign\u00e9e par la juge du proc\u00e8s nous renseigne peu sur le caract\u00e8re raisonnable d\u2019une attente au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e.\n(3) Caract\u00e8re priv\u00e9 de l\u2019objet\n[51] L\u2019article 8 vise \u00e0 \u00ab prot[\u00e9ger] un ensemble de renseignements biographiques d\u2019ordre personnel que les particuliers pourraient, dans une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 libre et d\u00e9mocratique, vouloir constituer et soustraire \u00e0 la connaissance de l\u2019\u00c9tat \u00bb (Plant, p. 293). L\u2019\u00ab ensemble de renseignements biographiques \u00bb ne touche pas uniquement \u00e0 l\u2019identit\u00e9, mais s\u2019\u00e9tend \u00ab notamment [\u00e0] de[s] renseignements tendant \u00e0 r\u00e9v\u00e9ler des d\u00e9tails intimes sur le mode de vie et les choix personnels de l\u2019individu \u00bb (p. 293).\n[52] L\u2019accent mis par l\u2019art. 8 sur les renseignements que les particuliers \u00ab pourraient [. . .] vouloir constituer et soustraire \u00e0 la connaissance de l\u2019\u00c9tat \u00bb signifie qu\u2019une attente raisonnable au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e est appr\u00e9ci\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re normative plut\u00f4t que simplement descriptive (Spencer, par. 27, citant Plant, p. 293). L\u2019approche normative exprime un id\u00e9al. \u00ab La question \u00e0 se poser consiste \u00e0 savoir si le droit \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e revendiqu\u00e9 doit [traduction] \u201c\u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00e0 l\u2019abri de toute intrusion par l\u2019\u00c9tat \u2014 sauf justification constitutionnelle \u2014 pour que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne demeure libre, d\u00e9mocratique et ouverte\u201d \u00bb (Reeves, par. 28, citant Ward, par. 87). Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019art. 8 s\u2019\u00e9tendra aussi loin que devrait s\u2019\u00e9tendre le droit \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e pour prot\u00e9ger la dignit\u00e9, l\u2019autonomie et la croissance personnelle de l\u2019individu, et pas plus. Ou, comme l\u2019a dit le juge d\u2019appel Doherty, reconna\u00eetre une attente raisonnable au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e signifie que [traduction] \u00ab la conduite \u00e9tatique contest\u00e9e a atteint le stade o\u00f9 les valeurs qui sous\u2011tendent la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne contemporaine dictent que l\u2019\u00c9tat doit respecter la vie priv\u00e9e des individus sauf s\u2019il est en mesure de justifier sur le plan constitutionnel toute atteinte \u00e0 cette vie priv\u00e9e personnelle \u00bb (Ward, par. 82). Cette analyse \u00ab abonde [in\u00e9vitablement] en jugements de valeur \u00e9nonc\u00e9s du point de vue ind\u00e9pendant de la personne raisonnable et bien inform\u00e9e, qui se soucie des cons\u00e9quences \u00e0 long terme des actions gouvernementales sur la protection du droit au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e \u00bb (R. c. Patrick, 2009 CSC 17, [2009] 1 R.C.S. 579, par. 14).\n[53] Par cons\u00e9quent, on ne peut appr\u00e9cier une attente raisonnable au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e, en tant que composante cl\u00e9 de l\u2019art. 8, en fonction d\u2019une seule utilisation en particulier de la preuve. Sa port\u00e9e ne peut pas non plus \u00eatre \u00e9tablie selon l\u2019intention pr\u00e9cise qu\u2019avait la police en recherchant les renseignements. L\u2019objectif de l\u2019art. 8, appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 normativement, exige plut\u00f4t que nous nous demandions quels renseignements tend \u00e0 r\u00e9v\u00e9ler l\u2019objet de la fouille. Comme cette analyse vise \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer \u00ab si, d\u2019une mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, les citoyens ont un droit au respect de leur vie priv\u00e9e \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019objet de la fouille effectu\u00e9e par l\u2019\u00c9tat, nous examinons non seulement les renseignements que la police cherche \u00e0 d\u00e9couvrir dans un cas donn\u00e9, mais aussi tous les renseignements que l\u2019objet peut tendre \u00e0 r\u00e9v\u00e9ler (Patrick, par. 32).\n[54] Ce principe est particuli\u00e8rement clair en cas de fouille de renseignements num\u00e9riques. Les ordinateurs sont diff\u00e9rents. Ces appareils stockent d\u2019immenses quantit\u00e9s de renseignements \u2014 dont certains sont g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9s automatiquement et conserv\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019insu de l\u2019utilisateur \u2014 qui peuvent toucher \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble de renseignements biographiques d\u2019ordre personnel (Vu, par. 41). Ces int\u00e9r\u00eats en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e peuvent \u00eatre encore plus manifestes si l\u2019appareil sert \u00e0 se connecter \u00e0 Internet (Cole, par. 47). En effet, \u00ab il est difficile d\u2019imaginer une atteinte plus grave \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e \u00bb que les fouilles relatives \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation d\u2019Internet par une personne (R. c. Morelli, 2010 CSC 8, [2010] 1 R.C.S. 253, par. 105).\n[55] Les int\u00e9r\u00eats uniques et accrus en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des donn\u00e9es d\u2019un ordinateur personnel d\u00e9coulent du risque qu\u2019elles d\u00e9voilent des renseignements tr\u00e8s r\u00e9v\u00e9lateurs. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Vu, notre Cour a estim\u00e9 que la fouille d\u2019un ordinateur doit faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une autorisation expresse pr\u00e9alable parce que les ordinateurs abritent un univers presque illimit\u00e9 d\u2019informations (au par. 41), et que les renseignements li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019activit\u00e9 Internet d\u2019un utilisateur \u00ab peuvent \u00e9galement permettre aux enqu\u00eateurs d\u2019avoir acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des d\u00e9tails intimes concernant les int\u00e9r\u00eats, les habitudes et l\u2019identit\u00e9 de l\u2019utilisateur \u00bb (par. 42). M\u00eame si la police dans cette affaire essayait simplement de savoir qui habitait dans la maison, la Cour a n\u00e9anmoins conclu que la fouille mettait en jeu des int\u00e9r\u00eats s\u00e9rieux en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e.\n[56] De m\u00eame, dans Reeves, l\u2019intention pr\u00e9cise des policiers de fouiller l\u2019ordinateur pour voir s\u2019il contenait de la pornographie juv\u00e9nile n\u2019a eu aucune incidence sur le caract\u00e8re s\u00e9rieux des pr\u00e9occupations en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e qui d\u00e9coulaient de la saisie d\u2019un ordinateur. Au contraire, ces pr\u00e9occupations r\u00e9sultaient du \u00ab caract\u00e8re personnel ou confidentiel des donn\u00e9es conserv\u00e9es gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la saisie de l\u2019ordinateur et auxquelles la police pourrait ainsi avoir acc\u00e8s \u00bb (par. 33 (je souligne), citant Marakah, par. 32). La Constitution devrait assurer une protection contre la saisie d\u2019un ordinateur parce qu\u2019une telle saisie a \u00e9t\u00e9, pour la police, \u00ab le moyen d\u2019obtenir acc\u00e8s \u00e0 [d]es renseignements [de nature \u00e9minemment personnelle] \u00bb (Reeves, par. 34).\n[57] L\u2019intention pr\u00e9cise des policiers de restreindre l\u2019usage de renseignements dans une affaire donn\u00e9e \u2014 si bien intentionn\u00e9s qu\u2019ils soient \u2014 n\u2019est donc pas pertinente en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019art. 8. L\u2019analyse de l\u2019\u00ab attente raisonnable au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e \u00bb est ax\u00e9e sur le risque qu\u2019un objet particulier r\u00e9v\u00e8le \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tat l\u2019ensemble des renseignements biographiques d\u2019une personne, et non pas sur la question de savoir si les adresses IP ont r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 des renseignements sur l\u2019appelant eu \u00e9gard aux faits. La juge en chef McLachlin a \u00e9t\u00e9 explicite \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Marakah, o\u00f9 elle a \u00e9crit que \u00ab le risque de divulgation de renseignements priv\u00e9s est un facteur dont il faut tenir compte pour d\u00e9cider si une conversation \u00e9lectronique suscite des attentes raisonnables en mati\u00e8re de respect de la vie priv\u00e9e \u00bb (par. 31; voir aussi par. 32). Les messages textes suscitaient donc une attente raisonnable au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e, ind\u00e9pendamment de la question de savoir si les messages textes recherch\u00e9s r\u00e9v\u00e9laient ou non des renseignements au vu des faits de cette affaire.\n[58] De plus, en appliquant un crit\u00e8re normatif, il n\u2019est pas utile de mettre l\u2019accent sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation la plus \u00e9troite de la preuve d\u2019expert. Nous devons plut\u00f4t appr\u00e9cier la preuve en tenant compte du contexte plus large dans lequel elle s\u2019inscrit, et notamment des r\u00e9alit\u00e9s sociales actuelles et de l\u2019incidence de notre d\u00e9cision dans d\u2019autres circonstances. Notre Cour a fr\u00e9quemment pris connaissance d\u2019office de ces \u00ab faits sociaux \u00bb plus larges afin d\u2019\u00ab \u00e9tablir le cadre de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence ou le contexte pour trancher des questions factuelles cruciales pour le r\u00e8glement d\u2019un litige [. . .] [;] ils contribuent \u00e0 expliquer certains aspects de la preuve \u00bb (R. c. Spence, 2005 CSC 71, [2005] 3 R.C.S. 458, par. 57; voir aussi P. W. Hogg et W. K. Wright, Constitutional Law of Canada (5e \u00e9d. suppl.), \u00a7 60:8). \u00c0 mon avis, il faut prendre en consid\u00e9ration l\u2019intrusion sans cesse croissante d\u2019Internet dans nos vies priv\u00e9es pour trancher le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi. Il est largement reconnu qu\u2019Internet est omnipr\u00e9sent et qu\u2019un grand nombre d\u2019internautes laissent derri\u00e8re eux une trace de renseignements que d\u2019autres recueillent \u00e0 diff\u00e9rentes fins, des renseignements qui peuvent \u00eatre assembl\u00e9s de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 r\u00e9v\u00e9ler des d\u00e9tails profond\u00e9ment priv\u00e9s. De plus, comme l\u2019indique la preuve d\u2019expert, une adresse IP se rattache \u00e0 toute activit\u00e9 en ligne; il s\u2019agit d\u2019un \u00e9l\u00e9ment constitutif fondamental de toute utilisation d\u2019Internet. Ce contexte social du monde num\u00e9rique est n\u00e9cessaire lorsqu\u2019une approche fonctionnelle est utilis\u00e9e pour d\u00e9finir l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e que conf\u00e8re la Charte aux renseignements qu\u2019est susceptible de r\u00e9v\u00e9ler une adresse IP.\n[59] De m\u00eame, les intervenants jouent un r\u00f4le essentiel dans les d\u00e9cisions de notre Cour \u2014 non seulement en mettant en \u00e9vidence les cons\u00e9quences de d\u00e9cisions juridiques particuli\u00e8res, mais aussi en refl\u00e9tant la diversit\u00e9 de points de vue sur laquelle repose notre approche normative. [traduction] \u00ab L\u2019acceptation des intervenants refl\u00e8te le fait que la d\u00e9cision du tribunal sur une question constitutionnelle aura de vastes ramifications publiques, et reconna\u00eet le fait que ceux qui ont des int\u00e9r\u00eats particuliers qui sont touch\u00e9s et qui peuvent aider le tribunal devraient \u00eatre entendus \u00bb (R. J. Sharpe et K. Roach, The Charter of Rights and Freedoms (7e \u00e9d. 2021), p. 128).\n[60] La Couronne sugg\u00e8re qu\u2019une adresse IP ne sert \u00e0 rien sans un mandat de type Spencer. Soit dit en tout respect, je ne peux souscrire \u00e0 ce point de vue. Premi\u00e8rement, en tant que lien qui relie une activit\u00e9 Internet pr\u00e9cise \u00e0 un endroit donn\u00e9, l\u2019adresse IP est susceptible de r\u00e9v\u00e9ler des renseignements tr\u00e8s personnels, m\u00eame avant que la police n\u2019essaie de relier l\u2019adresse \u00e0 l\u2019identit\u00e9 de l\u2019utilisateur. Deuxi\u00e8mement, il est possible de mettre en corr\u00e9lation l\u2019activit\u00e9 associ\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019adresse IP avec une autre activit\u00e9 en ligne associ\u00e9e \u00e0 cette adresse \u00e0 laquelle l\u2019\u00c9tat a acc\u00e8s \u2014 ce qui a des cons\u00e9quences particuli\u00e8rement pr\u00e9occupantes lorsqu\u2019y est combin\u00e9 l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des renseignements d\u00e9tenus par un tiers. Enfin, une adresse IP peut mettre l\u2019\u00c9tat sur la trace d\u2019une activit\u00e9 Internet qui m\u00e8ne directement \u00e0 l\u2019identit\u00e9 d\u2019un utilisateur, m\u00eame sans un mandat de type Spencer. Les cas o\u00f9 une adresse IP peut r\u00e9v\u00e9ler des renseignements biographiques ne sont pas tous vis\u00e9s par l\u2019arr\u00eat Spencer. \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de ces trois points, que j\u2019explique ci\u2011dessous, l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux adresses IP sans autorisation judiciaire pr\u00e9alable pose de grands risques en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e et les adresses IP suscitent une attente raisonnable au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e.\n[61] Premi\u00e8rement, l\u2019activit\u00e9 associ\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019adresse IP peut elle\u2011m\u00eame \u00eatre tr\u00e8s r\u00e9v\u00e9latrice, m\u00eame avant toute tentative de d\u00e9terminer l\u2019identit\u00e9. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019activit\u00e9 consistait en une s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations financi\u00e8res r\u00e9alis\u00e9e au moyen d\u2019un interm\u00e9diaire en ligne, Moneris. Lorsqu\u2019elle est reli\u00e9e \u00e0 des interm\u00e9diaires financiers tels que Moneris ou PayPal, une adresse IP peut r\u00e9v\u00e9ler toutes les op\u00e9rations qu\u2019a effectu\u00e9es un utilisateur sur cet interm\u00e9diaire pendant la p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 l\u2019adresse IP lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 assign\u00e9e. Par exemple, Moneris a associ\u00e9 cinq op\u00e9rations en ligne diff\u00e9rentes aux adresses IP en question (motifs expos\u00e9s au terme du voir\u2011dire, par. 7\u20118).\n[62] Ces achats peuvent \u00ab diffuser une foule de renseignements personnels susceptibles de r\u00e9v\u00e9ler des informations biographiques d\u2019ordre personnel sur [l\u2019acheteur] \u00bb (Marakah, par. 33), allant des restaurants qu\u2019il fr\u00e9quente, des destinations qu\u2019il visite, de ses passe\u2011temps, aux suppl\u00e9ments alimentaires qu\u2019il utilise. Les internautes peuvent m\u00eame avoir \u00ab un important int\u00e9r\u00eat en mati\u00e8re de respect de la vie priv\u00e9e en ce qui concerne la seule existence de leurs [achats] \u00e9lectroniques \u00bb, d\u2019autant plus que nos march\u00e9s migrent rapidement en ligne (par. 33 (en italique dans l\u2019original)).\n[63] D\u2019autres activit\u00e9s en ligne peuvent r\u00e9v\u00e9ler des renseignements qui touchent directement \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble des renseignements biographiques d\u2019un utilisateur. Les sites Web qui offrent des services de rencontre ou de la pornographie adulte peuvent donner \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tat une description des pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences sexuelles de l\u2019utilisateur. L\u2019historique d\u2019un internaute dans des salons de cyberbavardage m\u00e9dical, politique, ou autre salon de cyberbavardage semblable, peut r\u00e9v\u00e9ler ses pr\u00e9occupations de sant\u00e9 ou ses opinions politiques. Si l\u2019adresse IP n\u2019est pas prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, ces renseignements sont librement accessibles \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tat sans la protection de la Charte , qu\u2019ils aient ou non un rapport avec l\u2019enqu\u00eate sur un crime donn\u00e9.\n[64] Deuxi\u00e8mement, l\u2019activit\u00e9 pr\u00e9cise associ\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019adresse IP par la fouille peut \u00eatre mise en corr\u00e9lation avec une autre activit\u00e9 en ligne associ\u00e9e \u00e0 cette adresse IP.\n[65] Sans la protection de l\u2019art. 8, rien n\u2019emp\u00eache l\u2019\u00c9tat de recueillir de fa\u00e7on pr\u00e9ventive des adresses IP et de comparer l\u2019adresse IP de cet utilisateur avec ce que renferme sa base de donn\u00e9es. De plus, et fait important, l\u2019\u00e9tendue des renseignements que peut r\u00e9v\u00e9ler une adresse IP est \u00e9norme si elle est mise en corr\u00e9lation avec des renseignements d\u00e9tenus par un tiers. Des d\u00e9cisions tendent \u00e0 indiquer que des tiers fournissent ces renseignements sans qu\u2019on le leur demande. \u00c0 titre d\u2019exemple, dans l\u2019affaire State c. Simmons, 190 Vt. 141 (2011), la police, apr\u00e8s avoir identifi\u00e9 un suspect, a contact\u00e9 MySpace, un site de m\u00e9dia social, et lui a demand\u00e9 de lui communiquer les adresses IP qui avaient acc\u00e9d\u00e9 au profil MySpace de celui\u2011ci (par. 3). MySpace a fourni des registres indiquant non seulement les adresses IP elles\u2011m\u00eames, mais aussi toutes les fois que chaque adresse IP s\u2019\u00e9tait connect\u00e9e au compte MySpace de M. Simmons \u2014 notamment le fait qu\u2019une adresse IP s\u2019\u00e9tait connect\u00e9e au compte [traduction] \u00ab plus de 100 fois sur une p\u00e9riode d\u2019une semaine \u00bb (par. 3).\n[66] Comme l\u2019a expliqu\u00e9 l\u2019expert, les sites Web de tiers peuvent suivre l\u2019adresse IP externe de chaque utilisateur qui visite leur site. Certains sites Web, tels que Google, recueillent \u00e9galement d\u2019\u00e9normes quantit\u00e9s d\u2019autres renseignements comme l\u2019historique sur YouTube, les recherches sur Google et l\u2019historique des localisations. Ces renseignements peuvent \u00eatre de nature extr\u00eamement personnelle.\n[67] Beaucoup d\u2019activit\u00e9s en ligne sont exerc\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on anonyme (Spencer, par. 48; Ward, par. 75). Les gens agissent de mani\u00e8re diff\u00e9rente en ligne qu\u2019ils ne le feraient en personne (Ramelson, par. 5). \u00ab Certains lieux en ligne, tels les moteurs de recherche, permettent aux gens d\u2019explorer des notions qu\u2019ils h\u00e9siteraient \u00e0 \u00e9voquer en public; d\u2019autres, comme les m\u00e9dias sociaux, permettent aux utilisateurs de se dissimuler derri\u00e8re la fa\u00e7ade de leur choix \u00bb (par. 46). Nous ne voudrions pas que les profils de m\u00e9dias sociaux auxquels nous nous attardons parviennent \u00e0 la connaissance de l\u2019\u00c9tat. Nous ne voudrions pas non plus que la version intimement priv\u00e9e de nous\u2011m\u00eames r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e par l\u2019ensemble de termes cl\u00e9s que nous avons r\u00e9cemment entr\u00e9s dans un moteur de recherche se r\u00e9pande dans le monde hors ligne. Les internautes devraient pouvoir s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce que l\u2019\u00c9tat n\u2019obtienne pas ces renseignements sans un fondement constitutionnel valable.\n[68] Enfin, lien par lien, une adresse IP peut mettre l\u2019\u00c9tat sur la trace d\u2019une activit\u00e9 Internet anonyme qui m\u00e8ne directement \u00e0 l\u2019identit\u00e9 d\u2019un utilisateur. L\u2019expert utilise l\u2019exemple d\u2019une adresse IP qui se connecte \u00e0 un profil de m\u00e9dia social en particulier ou d\u2019un compte de courriel qui contient des renseignements permettant d\u2019inf\u00e9rer l\u2019identit\u00e9 de l\u2019utilisateur, comme son nom. \u00c0 partir de l\u00e0, une petite inf\u00e9rence suffit pour d\u00e9couvrir l\u2019identit\u00e9 de l\u2019utilisateur. Il ne suffit pas d\u2019affirmer \u2014 comme le fait l\u2019avocate de la Couronne \u2014 qu\u2019un mandat de type Spencer est requis si l\u2019adresse IP est recherch\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de renseignements susceptibles de d\u00e9voiler l\u2019identit\u00e9 de l\u2019internaute. Il ne peut revenir \u00e0 la police ou \u00e0 des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s priv\u00e9es de d\u00e9terminer si les renseignements fournis sur le site Web auront pour effet (peut\u2011\u00eatre s\u2019ils sont combin\u00e9s \u00e0 d\u2019autres renseignements) d\u2019aider \u00e0 identifier la source de l\u2019activit\u00e9 ou l\u2019identit\u00e9 de l\u2019utilisateur, ou encore de compromettre autrement des int\u00e9r\u00eats en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e.\n[69] L\u2019affirmation selon laquelle un mandat de type Spencer assure une protection contre les pr\u00e9occupations en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e que soul\u00e8vent les adresses IP n\u2019est donc tout simplement pas \u00e9tay\u00e9e par les r\u00e9alit\u00e9s technologiques modernes. Les adresses IP jouent un r\u00f4le crucial dans la structure inh\u00e9rente d\u2019Internet. Elles sont le moyen par lequel les appareils connect\u00e9s \u00e0 Internet envoient et re\u00e7oivent des donn\u00e9es. Elles sont donc la cl\u00e9 donnant acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019activit\u00e9 en ligne d\u2019un internaute \u2014 les premiers [traduction] \u00ab fragments num\u00e9riques \u00bb sur la trace cybern\u00e9tique de l\u2019utilisateur (Jones, par. 42, citant S. Magotiaux, \u00ab Out of Sync : Section 8 and Technological Advancement in Supreme Court Jurisprudence \u00bb (2015), 71 S.C.L.R. (2d) 501, p. 502). Ces fragments peuvent \u00e9tablir toute l\u2019activit\u00e9 en ligne quotidienne, hebdomadaire, ou m\u00eame mensuelle, d\u2019un internaute, ce qui permet de dresser l\u2019historique des cyberp\u00e9r\u00e9grinations de ce dernier (Morelli, par. 3). \u00c0 l\u2019instar de l\u2019ordinateur dans l\u2019affaire Reeves, une adresse IP fournit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tat le moyen susceptible de le mener \u00e0 un tr\u00e9sor de renseignements personnels.\n[70] Par cons\u00e9quent, une adresse IP peut r\u00e9v\u00e9ler un \u00e9ventail de renseignements \u00e9minemment priv\u00e9s qui touchent directement aux d\u00e9tails intimes sur le mode de vie et les choix personnels d\u2019un utilisateur individuel (Marakah, par. 32; Spencer, par. 27).\n(4) La balance penche\u2011t\u2011elle en faveur d\u2019une attente raisonnable au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e?\n[71] D\u00e9finir une attente raisonnable au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e est une op\u00e9ration de mise en balance. Les particuliers ont le droit de revendiquer leur droit de ne pas \u00eatre importun\u00e9s par l\u2019\u00c9tat. \u00ab En m\u00eame temps, la vie \u00e9conomique et sociale cr\u00e9e des demandes concurrentes. Les citoyens tiennent \u00e0 leur vie priv\u00e9e, mais ils veulent \u00e9galement \u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9s \u00bb (Tessling, par. 17).\n[72] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le caract\u00e8re \u00e9minemment priv\u00e9 des renseignements que peut r\u00e9v\u00e9ler une adresse IP sugg\u00e8re fortement que le droit du public de ne pas \u00eatre importun\u00e9 devrait l\u2019emporter sur le droit du gouvernement de r\u00e9aliser ses objectifs d\u2019application de la loi. Je m\u2019explique.\n[73] Internet a fait augmenter de mani\u00e8re exponentielle tant la qualit\u00e9 que la quantit\u00e9 de renseignements stock\u00e9s \u00e0 propos des internautes, et il englobe les comportements humains les plus publics comme les plus priv\u00e9s (Ramelson, par. 45). Ces renseignements sont fortement centralis\u00e9s, sont ais\u00e9ment accessibles, et [traduction] \u00ab ne sont pas filtr\u00e9s par la m\u00e9moire et la motivation humaines, mais peuvent \u00eatre produits en tant que copie de leur forme originale \u00bb (L. M. Austin, \u00ab Technological Tattletales and Constitutional Black Holes : Communications Intermediaries and Constitutional Constraints \u00bb (2016), 17 Theoretical Inquiries L. 451, p. 457). Les renseignements, autrefois r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tat fragment par fragment, peuvent maintenant \u00eatre \u00ab compil\u00e9[s], diss\u00e9qu\u00e9[s] et analys\u00e9[s] afin de mieux comprendre qui nous sommes en tant qu\u2019individus ou en tant que populations \u00bb (Ramelson, par. 48). Une adresse IP se rattache \u00e0 chacun de ces fragments. C\u2019est la cl\u00e9 qui les relie l\u2019un \u00e0 l\u2019autre.\n[74] M\u00eame les [traduction] \u00ab renseignements qui peuvent \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue sembler banals et ne pas faire partie de l\u2019ensemble des renseignements biographiques peuvent \u00eatre profond\u00e9ment r\u00e9v\u00e9lateurs lorsqu\u2019on les met en contexte avec d\u2019autres points de donn\u00e9es \u00bb (N. Hasan et autres, Search and Seizure (2021), p. 59). L\u2019agr\u00e9gation [traduction] \u00ab cr\u00e9e des synergies. Analys\u00e9s, les renseignements agr\u00e9g\u00e9s peuvent r\u00e9v\u00e9ler sur une personne de nouveaux faits qu\u2019elle ne s\u2019attendait pas \u00e0 ce qu\u2019on sache \u00e0 son sujet quand les donn\u00e9es originales isol\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 recueillies \u00bb (O. Tene, \u00ab What Google Knows : Privacy and Internet Search Engines \u00bb, [2008] Utah L. Rev. 1433, p. 1458, citant Solove, p. 507). Vu l\u2019omnipr\u00e9sence d\u2019Internet, nous devons examiner de plus en plus [traduction] \u00ab les fa\u00e7ons dont diff\u00e9rents ensembles de donn\u00e9es combin\u00e9s \u00e0 d\u2019autres ensembles de donn\u00e9es portent atteinte aux droits \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e \u00bb (Hasan, p. 60 (en italique dans l\u2019original)).\n[75] Non seulement Internet garde un registre permanent pr\u00e9cis, mais il a concentr\u00e9 cette masse de donn\u00e9es entre les mains de tiers et investi ces derniers d\u2019un immense pouvoir informationnel. Il a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 de grandes soci\u00e9t\u00e9s priv\u00e9es la capacit\u00e9 de recueillir de vastes quantit\u00e9s de renseignements relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019utilisateur et d\u2019agr\u00e9ger ces donn\u00e9es en images claires de l\u2019activit\u00e9 en ligne de leurs utilisateurs afin de savoir ce que veulent ceux\u2011ci et \u00e0 quel moment ils le veulent. En \u00e9change, ces soci\u00e9t\u00e9s [traduction] \u00ab b\u00e2tissent ce qui repr\u00e9sente peut\u2011\u00eatre l\u2019objet culturel le plus durable, le plus lourd et le plus important dans l\u2019histoire de l\u2019humanit\u00e9 \u00bb (Tene, p. 1435, citant J. Battelle, The Search : How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture (2005), p. 6).\n[76] Internet a permis aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s priv\u00e9es non seulement de suivre leurs utilisateurs, mais aussi de b\u00e2tir des profils de ceux\u2011ci remplis de renseignements que les utilisateurs n\u2019ont jamais su qu\u2019ils r\u00e9v\u00e9laient. \u00ab L\u2019historique de navigation, par exemple, permet d\u2019obtenir des renseignements d\u00e9taill\u00e9s sur les int\u00e9r\u00eats des utilisateurs. Les moteurs de recherche peuvent recueillir des renseignements sur les termes recherch\u00e9s par les utilisateurs. Les annonceurs peuvent suivre leurs utilisateurs \u00e0 travers les r\u00e9seaux de sites Web et obtenir un aper\u00e7u de leurs int\u00e9r\u00eats et de leurs pr\u00e9occupations \u00bb (Spencer, par. 46). Des commentateurs ont m\u00eame sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que les entreprises peuvent utiliser les donn\u00e9es qu\u2019elles recueillent pour d\u00e9terminer [traduction] \u00ab ce que vous allez acheter, le genre de personne avec qui vous allez vous mettre en couple, si vous ferez bien un nouveau travail, combien de temps vous resterez \u00e0 ce poste, et si vous tomberez malade \u00bb (H. Matsumi, \u00ab Predictions and Privacy : Should There Be Rules About Using Personal Data to Forecast the Future? \u00bb (2017), 48 Cumb. L. Rev. 149, p. 149).\n[77] C\u2019est loin d\u2019\u00eatre une conjecture. En effet, il est notoire que les plus grandes soci\u00e9t\u00e9s de m\u00e9dias sociaux dans le monde utilisent les adresses IP pour, par exemple, personnaliser les publicit\u00e9s que voient leurs utilisateurs, \u00e9tablir les pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences de ceux\u2011ci et inf\u00e9rer encore plus de renseignements \u00e0 leur sujet, comme leur \u00e2ge, leur sexe et leurs int\u00e9r\u00eats. Quand il s\u2019agit de suivre les utilisateurs sur Internet, pour paraphraser l\u2019auteur de science\u2011fiction William Gibson, [traduction] \u00ab [l]e futur est d\u00e9j\u00e0 l\u00e0 \u00bb (P. Kennedy, \u00ab William Gibson\u2019s Future Is Now \u00bb, The New York Times, 13 janvier 2012 (en ligne)).\n[78] En concentrant cette masse de renseignements entre les mains de tiers du secteur priv\u00e9 et en donnant \u00e0 ces derniers les outils n\u00e9cessaires pour agr\u00e9ger et diss\u00e9quer ces donn\u00e9es, Internet a essentiellement modifi\u00e9 la topographie de la vie priv\u00e9e sous le r\u00e9gime de la Charte . Il a ajout\u00e9 un tiers \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cosyst\u00e8me constitutionnel, et a fait de la relation horizontale entre l\u2019individu et l\u2019\u00c9tat une relation tripartite. Bien que l\u2019art. 8 ne s\u2019applique pas aux tiers eux\u2011m\u00eames, ceux\u2011ci [traduction] \u00ab joue[nt] le r\u00f4le de m\u00e9diateur[s] dans une relation directement r\u00e9gie par la Charte \u2014 celle entre le d\u00e9fendeur et la police \u00bb (A. Slane, \u00ab Privacy and Civic Duty in R v Ward : The Right to Online Anonymity and the Charter \u2011Compliant Scope of Voluntary Cooperation with Police Requests \u00bb (2013), 39 Queen\u2019s L.J. 301, p. 311).\n[79] Ce changement a accru, plut\u00f4t que restreint, la capacit\u00e9 informationnelle de l\u2019\u00c9tat. [traduction] \u00ab [L]es progr\u00e8s technologiques permettent aux acteurs gouvernementaux d\u2019\u00e9tendre consid\u00e9rablement leurs pouvoirs de surveillance, notamment en exploitant des renseignements d\u00e9taill\u00e9s recueillis par le secteur priv\u00e9 \u00bb (A. J. Cockfield, \u00ab Who Watches the Watchers? A Law and Technology Perspective on Government and Private Sector Surveillance \u00bb (2003), 29 Queen\u2019s L.J. 364, p. 406). La professeure Austin d\u00e9crit cette situation comme le [traduction] \u00ab nouveau lien de surveillance public\/priv\u00e9 \u00bb, o\u00f9 des interm\u00e9diaires peuvent \u00ab permet[tre] \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tat d\u2019acc\u00e9der au contenu de nos communications ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 une mine d\u2019autres donn\u00e9es connexes \u00bb (p. 453). Par cons\u00e9quent, [traduction] \u00ab dans le contexte de la collaboration d\u2019interm\u00e9diaires, le pouvoir de l\u2019\u00c9tat s\u2019accro\u00eet \u00bb (p. 458).\n[80] M\u00eame si l\u2019adresse IP ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le pas en soi l\u2019identit\u00e9 de l\u2019utilisateur, la disponibilit\u00e9 et la facilit\u00e9 d\u2019obtention d\u2019un mandat de type Spencer signifient que cette identit\u00e9 peut \u00eatre r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e ult\u00e9rieurement, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard non seulement de l\u2019activit\u00e9 Internet potentiellement criminelle en question, mais aussi de tous les renseignements qui peuvent \u00eatre inf\u00e9r\u00e9s de l\u2019activit\u00e9 Internet de l\u2019utilisateur. Comme le soutient l\u2019appelant, comparer l\u2019adresse IP d\u2019un utilisateur identifi\u00e9 avec d\u2019autres activit\u00e9s en ligne [traduction] \u00ab brise compl\u00e8tement l\u2019anonymat [en ligne] \u00bb (m.a., par. 45).\n[81] Certaines juridictions \u00e9trang\u00e8res ont r\u00e9agi en reconnaissant que les adresses IP constituent des renseignements priv\u00e9s qui m\u00e9ritent d\u2019\u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, m\u00eame s\u2019il est n\u00e9cessaire de recourir \u00e0 des renseignements d\u00e9tenus par des tiers. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Breyer c. Bundesrepublik Deutschland, C\u2011582\/14, EU:C:2016:779, la Cour europ\u00e9enne de justice a conclu qu\u2019une adresse IP \u00e9tait une donn\u00e9e \u00e0 caract\u00e8re personnel concernant une \u00ab personne [. . .] identifiable \u00bb suivant l\u2019art. 2 de la Directive 95\/46\/CE du Parlement europ\u00e9en et du Conseil, [1995] J.O. L. 281\/31. Il \u00e9tait sans importance qu\u2019il faille recourir \u00e0 un tiers pour rendre cette personne \u00ab identifiable \u00bb : l\u2019adresse IP d\u2019un utilisateur est en soi une \u00ab donn\u00e9[e] \u00e0 caract\u00e8re personnel \u00bb parce qu\u2019elle peut raisonnablement tendre \u00e0 r\u00e9v\u00e9ler l\u2019identit\u00e9 de l\u2019utilisateur \u2014 dans cette affaire, au moyen de renseignements d\u00e9tenus par un interm\u00e9diaire du secteur priv\u00e9 (par. 44).\n[82] De m\u00eame, la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Angleterre et du Pays de Galles a conclu que la question de savoir si des [traduction] \u00ab renseignements g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9s par un navigateur \u00bb \u2014 comme une adresse IP \u2014 \u00e9taient des donn\u00e9es \u00e0 caract\u00e8re personnel au sens de la Data Protection Act 1998 (R.\u2011U.), 1998, c. 29, \u00e9tait une question s\u00e9rieuse \u00e0 juger au fond (Vidal\u2011Hall c. Google Inc., [2015] EWCA Civ 311, [2016] Q.B. 1003, par. 107). La cour a estim\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait clairement possible de soutenir que de tels renseignements constituent des donn\u00e9es \u00e0 caract\u00e8re personnel parce qu\u2019ils [traduction] \u00ab \u201cindividualisent\u201d l\u2019individu, en ce sens qu\u2019il est distingu\u00e9 de tous les autres \u00bb (par. 115). Le fait que les renseignements ne nomment pas l\u2019utilisateur n\u2019a eu [traduction] \u00ab aucune incidence \u00bb sur sa conclusion, car, \u00ab dans la plupart des cas \u2014 notamment ceux o\u00f9 une adresse IP dynamique est attribu\u00e9e \u2014, les donn\u00e9es n\u00e9cessaires seront disponibles pour permettre d\u2019identifier le ou les utilisateurs de l\u2019adresse IP \u00bb (par. 117).\n[83] Je conviens avec l\u2019intervenante la British Columbia Civil Liberties Association que ces d\u00e9cisions d\u00e9crivent de fa\u00e7on convaincante l\u2019interaction entre les adresses IP et l\u2019approche normative que notre Cour a syst\u00e9matiquement appliqu\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019art. 8 de la Charte . Elles reconnaissent les adresses IP en tant que renseignements priv\u00e9s parce qu\u2019elles pourraient raisonnablement r\u00e9v\u00e9ler \u2014 c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire qu\u2019elles tendent \u00e0 r\u00e9v\u00e9ler \u2014 l\u2019identit\u00e9 de l\u2019utilisateur, qu\u2019il soit n\u00e9cessaire ou non de faire appel \u00e0 un tiers. Ces d\u00e9cisions \u00ab appu[ient] ou [. . .] confirme[nt] \u00bb la m\u00e9thodologie appliqu\u00e9e par la Cour \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e (Qu\u00e9bec (Procureure g\u00e9n\u00e9rale) c. 9147\u20110732 Qu\u00e9bec inc., 2020 CSC 32, [2020] 3 R.C.S. 426, par. 22 (en italique dans l\u2019original)). Notre Cour a, tout au long de son histoire, examin\u00e9 des d\u00e9cisions comparatives pour leur force convaincante (voir N. Olivetti Rason et S. Pennicino, \u00ab Comparative Law in the Jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of Canada \u00bb, dans G. F. Ferrari, dir., Judicial Cosmopolitanism : The Use of Foreign Law in Contemporary Constitutional Systems (2019), 140, p. 146).\n[84] Ces pr\u00e9occupations importantes relatives \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e entrent en balance avec l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat parfois conflictuel mais l\u00e9gitime de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en ce qui a trait au besoin de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Au fur et \u00e0 mesure qu\u2019\u00e9volue la technologie, la mani\u00e8re de commettre un crime et d\u2019enqu\u00eater sur celui\u2011ci \u00e9volue \u00e9galement (R. c. Mills, 2019 CSC 22, [2019] 2 R.C.S. 320, par. 38\u201139). La facilit\u00e9 d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 Internet et l\u2019anonymat de l\u2019utilisateur se conjuguent pour permettre la perp\u00e9tration d\u2019un large \u00e9ventail de crimes, y compris des infractions et des crimes d\u2019ordre sexuel contre des enfants. L\u2019effet amplifi\u00e9 et la permanence du pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 aux victimes de cybercriminalit\u00e9, en particulier les enfants, doivent \u00eatre pris en compte lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9finir et de calibrer l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat dans l\u2019application de la loi que met en cause le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi (voir R. c. Friesen, 2020 CSC 9, [2020] 1 R.C.S. 424, par. 1, 5 et 50\u201173; Magotiaux, p. 502). La police devrait disposer des outils d\u2019enqu\u00eate n\u00e9cessaires pour s\u2019occuper d\u2019un crime commis et facilit\u00e9 en ligne.\n[85] \u00c0 mon avis, toutefois, exiger que la police obtienne une autorisation judiciaire pr\u00e9alable avant d\u2019obtenir une adresse IP ne constitue pas une lourde mesure d\u2019enqu\u00eate, et ne porterait pas ind\u00fbment atteinte \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 des forces de l\u2019ordre de s\u2019occuper de ce crime. Lorsqu\u2019il existe un lien suffisant entre l\u2019adresse IP, ou les renseignements relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019abonn\u00e9, et la perp\u00e9tration d\u2019un crime, une autorisation judiciaire est facile \u00e0 obtenir et requiert peu de renseignements de plus que ce que la police doit d\u00e9j\u00e0 fournir pour obtenir une ordonnance de communication de type Spencer. \u00c0 titre d\u2019exemple, suivant le par. 487.015(1) du Code criminel , L.R.C. 1985, c. C\u201146 , une ordonnance de communication de renseignements relatifs \u00e0 une transmission donn\u00e9e d\u2019une communication peut \u00eatre obtenue s\u2019il existe des motifs raisonnables de soup\u00e7onner qu\u2019une infraction a \u00e9t\u00e9 ou sera commise. La police sollicite et obtient souvent de multiples autorisations afin de prot\u00e9ger diff\u00e9rents int\u00e9r\u00eats d\u2019ordre territorial en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e. Il en est de m\u00eame lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de prot\u00e9ger l\u2019intimit\u00e9 informationnelle.\n[86] Tout bien pes\u00e9, le fardeau que l\u2019on impose \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tat en reconnaissant une attente raisonnable au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des adresses IP est d\u00e9risoire par comparaison avec les pr\u00e9occupations importantes relatives \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e qui sont en cause en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Les forces de l\u2019ordre devront d\u00e9montrer l\u2019existence de motifs suffisants pour porter atteinte \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e d\u2019une personne, mais \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e8re des t\u00e9l\u00e9mandats et de l\u2019acc\u00e8s 24 h sur 24 \u00e0 des juges de paix, ce fardeau n\u2019est pas lourd. Les policiers qui se livrent \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s d\u2019enqu\u00eate l\u00e9gitimes peuvent facilement \u00e9tablir les motifs constitutionnels requis. Reconna\u00eetre qu\u2019une adresse IP est prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par l\u2019art. 8 ne contrecarrera pas les enqu\u00eates polici\u00e8res faisant intervenir des adresses IP; une telle reconnaissance vise plut\u00f4t \u00e0 faire en sorte que les enqu\u00eates polici\u00e8res refl\u00e8tent mieux ce \u00e0 quoi chaque Canadien et Canadienne raisonnable s\u2019attend du point de vue du respect de la vie priv\u00e9e et de la lutte contre la criminalit\u00e9.\n[87] Une attente raisonnable au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e fait en sorte que l\u2019\u00c9tat ne peut effectuer que des fouilles motiv\u00e9es par des pr\u00e9occupations l\u00e9gitimes d\u2019application de la loi. Les avantages pour le respect de la vie priv\u00e9e sont importants. Une autorisation judiciaire pr\u00e9alable restreint consid\u00e9rablement ce qui est accessible \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tat en ligne, et l\u2019emp\u00eache d\u2019obtenir les d\u00e9tails sur la vie en ligne d\u2019un utilisateur que r\u00e9v\u00e8le l\u2019adresse IP de ce dernier et qui ne sont pas pertinents pour l\u2019enqu\u00eate. Cela r\u00e9duit consid\u00e9rablement la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019exercices [traduction] \u00ab arbitraire[s] et m\u00eame discriminatoire[s] \u00bb du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire qui autoriseraient l\u2019\u00c9tat \u00e0 d\u00e9couvrir des renseignements sur l\u2019internaute qu\u2019il veut pour toute raison qu\u2019il juge indiqu\u00e9e (L. M. Austin, \u00ab Getting Past Privacy? Surveillance, the Charter , and the Rule of Law \u00bb (2012), 27 R.C.D.S. 381, p. 392). Dans une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9mocratique, il est \u00ab inconcevable que l\u2019\u00c9tat ait le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire illimit\u00e9 de soumettre qui il veut \u00e0 une surveillance [num\u00e9rique] effectu\u00e9e subrepticement \u00bb (R. c. Wong, [1990] 3 R.C.S. 36, p. 47).\n[88] La surveillance judiciaire en ce qui a trait \u00e0 une adresse IP est le moyen de r\u00e9aliser l\u2019objectif de l\u2019art. 8 d\u2019emp\u00eacher les atteintes \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e. Depuis l\u2019arr\u00eat Hunter, nous avons statu\u00e9 que cette disposition vise \u00e0 emp\u00eacher les violations de la vie priv\u00e9e, et non \u00e0 condamner ou \u00e0 admettre des violations apr\u00e8s le fait eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation que fait l\u2019\u00c9tat de ces renseignements. Le droit \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e, une fois qu\u2019il y a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9 atteinte, ne peut pas \u00eatre r\u00e9tabli.\n[89] Enfin, la surveillance judiciaire enl\u00e8ve aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s priv\u00e9es le pouvoir de d\u00e9cider s\u2019il convient de d\u00e9voiler des renseignements \u2014 et en quelle quantit\u00e9 \u2014 et renvoie la question au champ d\u2019application de la Charte . L\u2019accroissement du pouvoir de l\u2019\u00c9tat occasionn\u00e9 par Internet est donc compens\u00e9 par une interpr\u00e9tation large et t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique de l\u2019art. 8 qui r\u00e9pond \u00e0 nos \u00ab nouvelles r\u00e9alit\u00e9s sociales, politiques et historiques \u00bb (Hunter, p. 155). Laisser le secteur priv\u00e9 d\u00e9cider de fournir ou non \u00e0 la police des renseignements qui risquent de r\u00e9v\u00e9ler l\u2019aspect le plus intime de notre personne porte un coup inacceptable \u00e0 l\u2019art. 8. Laisser la protection de la Charte s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 la prochaine \u00e9tape envisag\u00e9e de l\u2019enqu\u00eate ne suffit pas. Comme je l\u2019ai expliqu\u00e9, il pourrait alors \u00eatre trop tard.\n[90] Par cons\u00e9quent, consid\u00e9r\u00e9 normativement, l\u2019art. 8 de la Charte devrait \u00e9tendre l\u2019attente raisonnable au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e aux adresses IP. Ces adresses fournissent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tat le moyen d\u2019obtenir des renseignements \u00e0 caract\u00e8re tr\u00e8s personnel au sujet d\u2019un internaute pr\u00e9cis et, ultimement, son identit\u00e9, qu\u2019un autre mandat soit n\u00e9cessaire ou non. Une adresse IP joue un r\u00f4le fondamental dans la sauvegarde de la vie priv\u00e9e sur Internet.

Je suis d\u2019avis d\u2019accueillir le pourvoi, d\u2019annuler la d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 et d\u2019ordonner la tenue d\u2019un nouveau proc\u00e8s.\nVersion fran\u00e7aise des motifs du juge en chef Wagner et des juges C\u00f4t\u00e9, Rowe et O\u2019Bonsawin rendus par\nLa juge C\u00f4t\u00e9 \u2014\nI. Introduction\n[93] En cette \u00e8re num\u00e9rique, tant les pr\u00e9occupations relatives au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e en ligne que celles relatives \u00e0 la cybercriminalit\u00e9 sont r\u00e9pandues.\n[94] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la police de Calgary a enqu\u00eat\u00e9 sur une s\u00e9rie d\u2019achats frauduleux faits en ligne. \u00c0 la suite de cette enqu\u00eate, l\u2019appelant, Andrei Bykovets, a \u00e9t\u00e9 arr\u00eat\u00e9, jug\u00e9 et d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable d\u2019un certain nombre d\u2019infractions li\u00e9es \u00e0 une fraude commise en utilisant Internet. La police a pu l\u2019identifier en prenant plusieurs mesures, notamment en obtenant une ordonnance de communication comme l\u2019exige l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Spencer, 2014 CSC 43, [2014] 2 R.C.S. 212. La premi\u00e8re mesure prise dans l\u2019enqu\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 de r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer aupr\u00e8s d\u2019un interm\u00e9diaire les adresses de protocole Internet (\u00ab IP \u00bb) de l\u2019appelant, ce que la police a fait sans mandat. L\u2019appelant all\u00e8gue qu\u2019il avait une attente raisonnable au respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ses adresses IP, de sorte que les droits que lui garantit l\u2019art. 8 de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9s lorsque la police a obtenu ces adresses de l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire. Selon l\u2019appelant, la police avait besoin d\u2019une autorisation judiciaire pr\u00e9alable pour les obtenir.\n[95] Notre Cour est appel\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si l\u2019appelant avait une attente raisonnable au respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des adresses IP elles\u2011m\u00eames \u2014 sans autre renseignement reliant ces adresses \u00e0 celui\u2011ci en tant qu\u2019internaute \u2014 dans les circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Je conclus que l\u2019appelant n\u2019avait pas d\u2019attente raisonnable au respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e. Je suis donc d\u2019avis de rejeter le pourvoi.\nII. Faits\n[96] Les faits ne sont pas contest\u00e9s par les parties.\n[97] En septembre 2017, la police de Calgary a entrepris une enqu\u00eate li\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019achat de cartes\u2011cadeaux virtuelles au moyen de donn\u00e9es de carte de cr\u00e9dit frauduleuses. Les achats ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits en ligne par l\u2019entremise d\u2019entreprises, dont un magasin de vins et spiritueux appel\u00e9 Co\u2011op Wine Spirits Beer. Les paiements ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9s par une filiale de Moneris, l\u2019entreprise de traitement des cartes de cr\u00e9dit.\n[98] Au cours de son enqu\u00eate sur la fraude, la police a communiqu\u00e9 avec Moneris et lui a demand\u00e9 les adresses IP associ\u00e9es aux achats. Moneris a fourni les adresses IP figurant dans ses journaux des op\u00e9rations. La police a ensuite utilis\u00e9 un site Web de recherche accessible au public et a appris que les adresses IP avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mises par TELUS. Elle a obtenu une ordonnance de communication intimant \u00e0 TELUS de fournir les renseignements relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019abonn\u00e9 associ\u00e9s aux adresses IP. Une adresse \u00e9tait enregistr\u00e9e au nom de l\u2019appelant et l\u2019autre l\u2019\u00e9tait \u00e0 celui de son p\u00e8re. Je souligne qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucune distinction entre ces deux adresses pour les besoins du pr\u00e9sent pourvoi.\n[99] La police a ensuite demand\u00e9 et obtenu des mandats de perquisition des deux r\u00e9sidences associ\u00e9es aux adresses IP. Pendant la perquisition, elle a trouv\u00e9 un lecteur et enregistreur de cartes magn\u00e9tiques, des pi\u00e8ces d\u2019identit\u00e9 gouvernementales portant le nom de tierces personnes, des ordinateurs, des cl\u00e9s USB, des faux documents d\u2019immigration et des armes \u00e0 feu. L\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 arr\u00eat\u00e9 et accus\u00e9 de 33 infractions li\u00e9es \u00e0 la possession et \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation de cartes de cr\u00e9dit et de documents d\u2019identification personnelle de tiers, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 la possession et \u00e0 l\u2019entreposage d\u2019armes \u00e0 feu.\n[100] Avant le proc\u00e8s, l\u2019appelant a demand\u00e9 que soient \u00e9cart\u00e9s les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve d\u00e9couverts gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation par la police de ses adresses IP, all\u00e9guant que la police avait viol\u00e9 les droits que lui garantit l\u2019art. 8 de la Charte . Il a produit le rapport de Matthew Musters, \u00e0 qui la juge du proc\u00e8s a reconnu la qualit\u00e9 d\u2019expert dans l\u2019analyse criminalistique \u00e9lectronique ainsi que dans la nature et le fonctionnement des adresses IP. La Couronne a consenti \u00e0 l\u2019admission du rapport d\u2019expertise de M. Musters et n\u2019a pas cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 contre\u2011interroger ce dernier. Elle a \u00e9galement souscrit au contenu du rapport.\n[101] Les parties pertinentes du rapport peuvent \u00eatre r\u00e9sum\u00e9es bri\u00e8vement.\n[102] Premi\u00e8rement, le rapport explique qu\u2019il existe deux types d\u2019adresses IP : les externes et les internes. Le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi ne concerne que des adresses IP externes. Une adresse IP externe est attribu\u00e9e \u00e0 un abonn\u00e9 par un fournisseur de services Internet (\u00ab FSI \u00bb) et est utilis\u00e9e dans le transfert de l\u2019information d\u2019une source \u00e0 une autre sur Internet. Sans adresse IP externe, un utilisateur ne peut envoyer ni recevoir de donn\u00e9es. Chaque adresse IP externe est clairement associ\u00e9e \u00e0 un abonn\u00e9 durant sa p\u00e9riode de location. Le plus souvent, les abonn\u00e9s r\u00e9sidentiels se voient attribuer des adresses IP externes dynamiques qu\u2019un FSI peut changer \u00e0 son gr\u00e9 et sans pr\u00e9avis. Chaque FSI tient un registre indiquant \u00e0 quel abonn\u00e9 chaque adresse IP externe a \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9e et pour quelle p\u00e9riode.\n[103] Ensuite, le rapport explique que dans une session de navigation Internet typique, l\u2019adresse IP externe d\u2019un utilisateur n\u2019est connue que par le serveur de destination (\u00e0 l\u2019exclusion de tout saut effectu\u00e9 par celle\u2011ci sur son passage). Le rapport d\u00e9crit deux m\u00e9thodes au moyen desquelles l\u2019identit\u00e9 d\u2019un utilisateur ou d\u2019une utilisatrice peut \u00eatre d\u00e9couverte \u00e0 partir de son adresse IP externe. La premi\u00e8re consiste \u00e0 entrer l\u2019adresse IP dans un site Web de recherche de FSI pour d\u00e9terminer \u00e0 quel FSI appartient l\u2019adresse en question, et \u00e0 obtenir par la suite du FSI les renseignements relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019abonn\u00e9. L\u2019autre repose sur l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se selon laquelle on peut avoir acc\u00e8s aux renseignements enregistr\u00e9s par les sites Web de soci\u00e9t\u00e9s tierces. Les sites Web peuvent suivre l\u2019adresse IP de chaque utilisateur qui les visite. Sur la base de ces renseignements, on pourrait essayer de d\u00e9terminer l\u2019identit\u00e9 d\u2019une personne utilisant le service en ligne d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en examinant l\u2019activit\u00e9 de cette utilisatrice sur le site Web en question.\nIII. Historique judiciaire\nA. Cour du Banc de la Reine de l\u2019Alberta, 2020 ABQB 70, 10 Alta. L.R. (7th) 103 (la juge Ho)\n[104] Dans sa d\u00e9cision sur le voir\u2011dire, la juge du proc\u00e8s a affirm\u00e9 que la principale question \u00e0 trancher en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019art. 8 de la Charte est de savoir si une personne a une attente raisonnable au respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une adresse IP. La Couronne a conc\u00e9d\u00e9 que si l\u2019appelant avait une attente raisonnable au respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des adresses IP, ses droits garantis par l\u2019art. 8 avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9s. Pour d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il existe une attente raisonnable au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e, la juge a appliqu\u00e9 le \u00ab test de l\u2019ensemble des circonstances \u00bb \u00e9nonc\u00e9 par notre Cour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Spencer.\n[105] La juge du proc\u00e8s a conclu que la pr\u00e9tendue fouille avait pour objet les adresses IP. Tant \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue qu\u2019\u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de ce qui pouvait en \u00eatre inf\u00e9r\u00e9, les adresses IP ne pouvaient fournir que des renseignements limit\u00e9s sur un internaute. Ce n\u2019est qu\u2019avec d\u2019autres renseignements qu\u2019une adresse IP pouvait mener \u00e0 l\u2019identification d\u2019une personne en particulier. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la police \u00ab recherchait vraiment \u00bb les adresses IP elles\u2011m\u00eames afin de d\u00e9couvrir le FSI de la personne soup\u00e7onn\u00e9e de fraude et d\u2019obtenir par la suite une ordonnance de communication visant \u00e0 identifier cette derni\u00e8re.\n[106] La juge du proc\u00e8s a accept\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant avait un int\u00e9r\u00eat direct et une attente subjective au respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des adresses IP. Elle a toutefois conclu que cette attente n\u2019\u00e9tait pas objectivement raisonnable. Contrairement \u00e0 ce que faisait valoir l\u2019appelant, la fouille avait eu lieu non pas chez lui, mais dans la base de donn\u00e9es de l\u2019entreprise de traitement des cartes de cr\u00e9dit. Constituant des ensembles de chiffres, les adresses IP ne communiquaient pas de renseignements personnels ni ne r\u00e9v\u00e9laient de d\u00e9tails intimes sur le mode de vie de l\u2019appelant. Le FSI \u00e9tait en mesure de contr\u00f4ler l\u2019objet de la fouille gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 sa capacit\u00e9 de changer les adresses IP de l\u2019appelant, bien que ce ne f\u00fbt pas un facteur d\u00e9terminant.\n[107] Prenant en consid\u00e9ration l\u2019ensemble des facteurs, la juge du proc\u00e8s a statu\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant n\u2019avait pas une attente raisonnable au respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des adresses IP. Par cons\u00e9quent, la fouille n\u2019avait pas mis en jeu ses droits garantis par l\u2019art. 8. L\u2019appelant a finalement \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable de 14 des 33 infractions dont il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accus\u00e9.\nB. Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Alberta, 2022 ABCA 208, [2023] 5 W.W.R. 51\n(1) Juges majoritaires (les juges Schutz et Crighton)\n[108] L\u2019appelant a interjet\u00e9 appel et a contest\u00e9 la conclusion de la juge du proc\u00e8s portant que ses droits garantis par l\u2019art. 8 n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9s. Les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel ont rejet\u00e9 l\u2019appel et ont statu\u00e9, d\u2019une part, que la juge du proc\u00e8s avait correctement interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 la port\u00e9e de l\u2019art. 8 et avait appliqu\u00e9 les bons principes, et, d\u2019autre part, que ses conclusions de fait ne comportaient aucune erreur manifeste et dominante. La juge du proc\u00e8s a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019objet de la fouille de mani\u00e8re fonctionnelle, comme elle \u00e9tait tenue de le faire. Elle a compris ce que la police \u00ab recherchait vraiment \u00bb : les adresses IP pour faire avancer l\u2019enqu\u00eate, dans l\u2019espoir que le compl\u00e9ment d\u2019enqu\u00eate autoris\u00e9 r\u00e9v\u00e9lerait les noms et adresses associ\u00e9s aux adresses IP. La juge du proc\u00e8s a conclu que les adresses IP ne r\u00e9v\u00e9laient aucun renseignement priv\u00e9; l\u2019appelant n\u2019avait donc aucune attente raisonnable au respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard. Les juges majoritaires ont donc souscrit \u00e0 l\u2019analyse et aux conclusions de la juge du proc\u00e8s.\n[109] Les juges majoritaires ont \u00e9galement convenu avec la juge du proc\u00e8s qu\u2019il \u00e9tait possible d\u2019\u00e9tablir une distinction avec l\u2019affaire Spencer parce qu\u2019en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la police n\u2019a pas obtenu les donn\u00e9es relatives \u00e0 l\u2019abonn\u00e9 en plus des adresses IP elles\u2011m\u00eames. Sans ces donn\u00e9es, la police a simplement cru qu\u2019un [traduction] \u00ab inconnu qui utilisait une adresse IP connue \u00e9tait en train de commettre une fraude \u00e0 partir d\u2019une adresse inconnue \u00bb, ce qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas suffisant pour donner lieu \u00e0 une attente raisonnable au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e (par. 17). De l\u2019avis des juges majoritaires, une [traduction] \u00ab adresse IP est un num\u00e9ro abstrait qui ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le aucun des renseignements biographiques qu\u2019y rattache son \u00e9metteur. Prise isol\u00e9ment, elle ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le rien \u00bb (par. 21). C\u2019est seulement de pair avec les renseignements relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019abonn\u00e9 qu\u2019une adresse IP est susceptible de r\u00e9v\u00e9ler des renseignements personnels, et ce n\u2019est qu\u2019en se conformant \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat Spencer que la police pouvait obtenir ces renseignements relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019abonn\u00e9.\n(2) Dissidence (la juge Veldhuis)\n[110] La juge Veldhuis, dissidente, aurait conclu que l\u2019appelant avait une attente raisonnable au respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des adresses IP parce que celles\u2011ci \u00e9taient li\u00e9es \u00e0 une activit\u00e9 Internet particuli\u00e8re sous surveillance qui \u00e9tait susceptible de r\u00e9v\u00e9ler des renseignements biographiques. Par cons\u00e9quent, elle aurait conclu \u00e0 la violation des droits que l\u2019art. 8 garantit \u00e0 l\u2019appelant et elle aurait ordonn\u00e9 la tenue d\u2019un nouveau proc\u00e8s.\n[111] La juge Veldhuis \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que la juge du proc\u00e8s n\u2019avait pas appliqu\u00e9 l\u2019approche normative aux attentes raisonnables au respect de la priv\u00e9e. \u00c0 son avis, il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas possible d\u2019\u00e9tablir une distinction entre la pr\u00e9sente esp\u00e8ce et l\u2019affaire Spencer. Tant dans Spencer qu\u2019en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il \u00e9tait question d\u2019une tentative de la police d\u2019identifier un internaute particulier afin de pouvoir [traduction] \u00ab recueillir davantage de renseignements pour tirer des inf\u00e9rences quant aux d\u00e9tails intimes sur le mode de vie et les choix personnels de l\u2019internaute \u00bb (par. 62).\n[112] De l\u2019avis de la juge Veldhuis, l\u2019omission d\u2019appliquer l\u2019approche normative a amen\u00e9 la juge du proc\u00e8s \u00e0 qualifier l\u2019objet de la fouille de fa\u00e7on trop restrictive. La juge Veldhuis a soulign\u00e9 que la preuve d\u2019expert indiquait comment une adresse IP pouvait \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e pour identifier un internaute \u00e0 partir de sites Web de tiers, et que s\u2019il n\u2019y avait aucune attente raisonnable au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e, rien n\u2019obligerait la police \u00e0 obtenir un mandat avant de le faire. Pour la juge Veldhuis, le v\u00e9ritable objet de la fouille, et ce que la police recherchait vraiment, \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019identit\u00e9 d\u2019un internaute qui correspond \u00e0 une adresse IP particuli\u00e8re li\u00e9e \u00e0 une activit\u00e9 Internet particuli\u00e8re sous surveillance \u00bb (par. 77). Cet objet impliquait l\u2019id\u00e9e d\u2019anonymat de la vie priv\u00e9e, ce qui est tr\u00e8s important dans le contexte d\u2019Internet.\n[113] Selon la juge Veldhuis, l\u2019erreur commise par la juge du proc\u00e8s en qualifiant l\u2019objet de la fouille a amen\u00e9 celle\u2011ci \u00e0 commettre une autre erreur en concluant que l\u2019attente subjective de l\u2019appelant au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e n\u2019\u00e9tait pas objectivement raisonnable. En ce qui concerne le lieu fouill\u00e9 en tant que facteur dans l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de ce caract\u00e8re raisonnable, la juge Veldhuis a soulign\u00e9 que l\u2019art. 8 [traduction] \u00ab prot\u00e8ge les personnes et non les lieux \u00bb, et a jug\u00e9 qu\u2019une personne s\u2019attend \u00e0 ce que les donn\u00e9es de carte de cr\u00e9dit et l\u2019adresse IP \u00e0 partir de laquelle elles sont envoy\u00e9es demeurent priv\u00e9es. En ce qui a trait au caract\u00e8re priv\u00e9 de l\u2019objet, elle a r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 ses commentaires ant\u00e9rieurs sur la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019identifier un internaute en utilisant une adresse IP, ce qui fait intervenir des int\u00e9r\u00eats en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e allant au\u2011del\u00e0 du nom et de l\u2019adresse de l\u2019utilisateur. Pour ce qui est du contr\u00f4le sur l\u2019objet, la juge Veldhuis a statu\u00e9 que le contr\u00f4le n\u2019est pas perdu simplement parce qu\u2019une adresse IP est accessible \u00e0 d\u2019autres. Elle a affirm\u00e9 que choisir entre ne pas du tout utiliser Internet et renoncer au contr\u00f4le sur son adresse IP ne constitue pas un v\u00e9ritable choix.\n[114] La juge Veldhuis a conclu que l\u2019appelant avait une attente raisonnable au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des adresses IP [traduction] \u00ab parce que celles\u2011ci \u00e9taient li\u00e9es \u00e0 une activit\u00e9 Internet particuli\u00e8re sous surveillance qui \u00e9tait susceptible de r\u00e9v\u00e9ler des renseignements biographiques \u00bb (par. 94).\n[115] L\u2019appelant se pourvoit maintenant devant notre Cour en se fondant sur la dissidence de la juge Veldhuis.\nIV. Question en litige\n[116] La seule question qui se pose en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est de savoir si une attente raisonnable au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e s\u2019appliquait aux adresses IP. Si tel \u00e9tait le cas, la Couronne conc\u00e8de que les droits que l\u2019art. 8 de la Charte garantit \u00e0 l\u2019appelant ont \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9s.\nV. Analyse\n[117] Le droit relatif aux attentes raisonnables au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e est bien \u00e9tabli. La pr\u00e9sente affaire commande une simple application du droit \u00e0 la situation o\u00f9 une entreprise de traitement de cartes de cr\u00e9dit en ligne fournit une adresse IP \u00e0 la police.\n[118] L\u2019article 8 de la Charte , qui pr\u00e9voit que \u00ab [c]hacun a droit \u00e0 la protection contre les fouilles, les perquisitions ou les saisies abusives \u00bb, vise \u00e0 assurer une protection contre l\u2019intrusion de l\u2019\u00c9tat dans la vie priv\u00e9e d\u2019une personne. Cependant, comme l\u2019a fait observer notre Cour, \u00ab tout type d\u2019enqu\u00eate gouvernementale ne constituera pas forc\u00e9ment, sur le plan constitutionnel, une \u201cfouille ou perquisition\u201d \u00bb (R. c. Evans, [1996] 1 R.C.S. 8, par. 11). L\u2019article 8 entre en jeu seulement \u00ab lorsque les attentes raisonnables d\u2019une personne en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e sont affect\u00e9es d\u2019une mani\u00e8re ou d\u2019une autre par une technique d\u2019enqu\u00eate \u00bb (ibid.).\n[119] Le test relatif \u00e0 l\u2019attente raisonnable au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e est tributaire des faits et contextuel. La question de savoir si une personne a une telle attente d\u00e9pend de \u00ab l\u2019ensemble des circonstances d\u2019un cas particulier \u00bb (R. c. Edwards, [1996] 1 R.C.S. 128, par. 31). Notre Cour a \u00e9tabli une liste non exhaustive de facteurs \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Les facteurs pertinents sont souvent commod\u00e9ment regroup\u00e9s en quatre grandes cat\u00e9gories :\n(1) Quel \u00e9tait l\u2019objet de la pr\u00e9tendue fouille?\n(2) Le demandeur avait\u2011il un int\u00e9r\u00eat direct \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019objet?\n(3) Le demandeur avait\u2011il une attente subjective au respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e relativement \u00e0 l\u2019objet?\n(4) Dans l\u2019affirmative, l\u2019attente subjective du demandeur \u00e9tait\u2011elle objectivement raisonnable?\n[120] Comme on l\u2019a souvent soulign\u00e9, l\u2019analyse est de nature normative, et non descriptive (R. c. Tessling, 2004 CSC 67, [2004] 3 R.C.S. 432, par. 42; R. c. Reeves, 2018 CSC 56, [2018] 3 R.C.S. 531, par. 28). L\u2019objectif est de d\u00e9cider quel degr\u00e9 d\u2019intimit\u00e9 une personne devrait avoir, et non pas quel degr\u00e9 d\u2019intimit\u00e9 une personne a effectivement. Comme l\u2019a affirm\u00e9 le juge Binnie dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Tessling :\n\u00c0 une \u00e9poque o\u00f9 l\u2019on peut facilement se procurer sur le march\u00e9 des dispositifs de furetage de plus en plus diversifi\u00e9s, le simple citoyen peut en venir \u00e0 craindre (\u00e0 tort ou \u00e0 raison) que son t\u00e9l\u00e9phone soit plac\u00e9 sous \u00e9coute ou que son courrier personnel soit lu. [. . .] Il faut donc r\u00e9futer toute affirmation selon laquelle la diminution de l\u2019attente subjective en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e se traduira automatiquement par une diminution correspondante de la protection constitutionnelle. Affirmer qu\u2019un particulier qui laisse ses ordures au ramassage n\u2019a pas d\u2019attente raisonnable en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e \u00e0 leur sujet est une chose. Mais c\u2019en est une toute autre de dire qu\u2019une personne qui craint que son t\u00e9l\u00e9phone soit sur \u00e9coute n\u2019a plus d\u2019attente subjective en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e et qu\u2019elle ne peut plus de ce fait revendiquer la protection de l\u2019art. 8. [En italique dans l\u2019original; par. 42.]\n[121] Gardant \u00e0 l\u2019esprit cette approche normative, je me penche maintenant sur son application aux faits de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. \u00c0 l\u2019instar de la juge du proc\u00e8s, je reconnais que l\u2019appelant avait un int\u00e9r\u00eat direct \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des adresses IP, ainsi qu\u2019une attente subjective au respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e relativement \u00e0 leur contenu informationnel. Les principaux points de d\u00e9saccord devant notre Cour ont trait aux premi\u00e8re et quatri\u00e8me parties de l\u2019analyse : l\u2019objet de la fouille et le caract\u00e8re objectivement raisonnable de l\u2019attente au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment en ce qui a trait au caract\u00e8re priv\u00e9 de l\u2019objet. Je les examine \u00e0 tour de r\u00f4le.\nA. Objet de la fouille\n[122] D\u00e9terminer l\u2019objet de la fouille est une question cl\u00e9 dans l\u2019analyse de l\u2019\u00ab ensemble des circonstances \u00bb. Notre Cour a adopt\u00e9 une \u00ab approche large et fonctionnelle \u00bb en la mati\u00e8re. L\u2019objet de la fouille ne doit pas \u00eatre d\u00e9fini suivant une approche [traduction] \u00ab restrictive portant sur les actes commis ou l\u2019espace envahi, mais [. . .] plut\u00f4t [suivant] une approche qui tient compte de la nature des droits en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e auxquels l\u2019action de l\u2019\u00c9tat pourrait porter atteinte \u00bb (R. c. Marakah, 2017 CSC 59, [2017] 2 R.C.S. 608, par. 15, citant R. c. Ward, 2012 ONCA 660, 112 O.R. (3d) 321, par. 65). Par cons\u00e9quent, pour d\u00e9terminer l\u2019objet de la fouille, le tribunal doit se pencher sur le lien entre la technique d\u2019enqu\u00eate utilis\u00e9e par la police et l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e qui est en jeu (Marakah, par. 15). Il doit examiner \u00ab non seulement la nature des renseignements pr\u00e9cis recherch\u00e9s, mais aussi la nature des renseignements qui sont ainsi r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9s \u00bb (Spencer, par. 26).\n[123] Lorsqu\u2019il appr\u00e9cie l\u2019objet d\u2019une pr\u00e9tendue fouille, le tribunal doit d\u00e9terminer [traduction] \u00ab ce que la police recherchait vraiment \u00bb (Marakah, par. 15, citant Ward, par. 67). Cette question directrice fait ressortir le fait que l\u2019objet de la fouille peut aller au\u2011del\u00e0 de l\u2019objet ou des renseignements pr\u00e9cis qu\u2019obtient la police. Quand il se demande \u00ab ce que la police recherchait vraiment \u00bb, le tribunal ne s\u2019int\u00e9resse pas \u00e0 l\u2019objectif poursuivi par la police dans l\u2019enqu\u00eate criminelle (c.\u2011\u00e0\u2011d. \u00e0 la raison pour laquelle la police recherchait les renseignements). Il ne s\u2019int\u00e9resse pas non plus \u00e0 ses intentions subjectives. Le tribunal se pr\u00e9occupe plut\u00f4t de la capacit\u00e9 des renseignements pr\u00e9cis recherch\u00e9s de donner lieu \u00e0 des inf\u00e9rences ou de r\u00e9v\u00e9ler d\u2019autres renseignements. Ces inf\u00e9rences et ces autres renseignements font partie du v\u00e9ritable objet de la fouille.\n[124] L\u2019arr\u00eat Spencer illustre ces principes. Dans cette affaire, au cours d\u2019une enqu\u00eate en mati\u00e8re de pornographie juv\u00e9nile, la police avait demand\u00e9 au FSI \u00e0 qui appartenait une adresse IP particuli\u00e8re les renseignements relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019abonn\u00e9e (un nom et une adresse physique). La Cour s\u2019est dite en d\u00e9saccord avec la pr\u00e9tention suivant laquelle de tels renseignements constituaient en eux\u2011m\u00eames le v\u00e9ritable objet de la fouille. Cette [traduction] \u00ab qualificatio[n] f[ait] abstraction de l\u2019importance d\u2019une adresse IP et des renseignements que cette adresse, une fois li\u00e9e \u00e0 une personne en particulier, peut r\u00e9v\u00e9ler sur cette personne, notamment les activit\u00e9s en ligne que celle\u2011ci pratique dans sa r\u00e9sidence \u00bb (par. 32 (je souligne), citant R. c. Trapp, 2011 SKCA 143, 377 Sask. R. 246, par. 35). Notre Cour a plut\u00f4t conclu que la fouille avait pour objet \u00ab l\u2019identit\u00e9 de l\u2019abonn\u00e9e dont la connexion \u00e0 Internet correspondait \u00e0 une activit\u00e9 informatique particuli\u00e8re sous surveillance \u00bb (par. 33). Les renseignements pr\u00e9cis recherch\u00e9s \u2014 les renseignements relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019abonn\u00e9e \u2014 \u00e9tablissaient un lien entre une personne pr\u00e9cise et l\u2019activit\u00e9 en ligne particuli\u00e8re associ\u00e9e \u00e0 une adresse IP anonyme. Tout cela constituait l\u2019objet de la fouille.\n[125] De m\u00eame, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Marakah, la juge en chef McLachlin a conclu que la fouille n\u2019avait pas simplement pour objet le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone cellulaire qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi par la police. Elle englobait plut\u00f4t les conversations par messagerie texte contenues dans le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone cellulaire ainsi que toute inf\u00e9rence sur les fr\u00e9quentations et les activit\u00e9s \u00ab que l\u2019on peut tirer [des] renseignements \u00bb \u00e9chang\u00e9s dans ces conversations (par. 20 (je souligne)).\n[126] Enfin, et fait important, bien qu\u2019il ne puisse pas \u00eatre d\u00e9fini de fa\u00e7on trop restrictive, l\u2019objet de la fouille doit tout de m\u00eame \u00eatre ancr\u00e9 dans ce qu\u2019il est possible de tirer de la preuve elle\u2011m\u00eame. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, la capacit\u00e9 des renseignements pr\u00e9cis recherch\u00e9s de donner lieu \u00e0 des inf\u00e9rences ou de r\u00e9v\u00e9ler d\u2019autres renseignements doit \u00eatre \u00e9tay\u00e9e par la preuve; elle ne peut reposer sur de simples conjectures ou hypoth\u00e8ses. On peut retrouver ce principe dans la jurisprudence de la Cour. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Kang\u2011Brown, 2008 CSC 18, [2008] 1 R.C.S. 456, par exemple, la juge Deschamps, dissidente, mais non sur ce point, a expliqu\u00e9 que ce qui importe \u00e0 propos de l\u2019intervention d\u2019un chien renifleur pour v\u00e9rifier le sac de l\u2019accus\u00e9 est que la police se fie aux chiens renifleurs avec un taux de r\u00e9ussite de plus de 92 p. 100 et que ces chiens ne font pas qu\u2019identifier les odeurs qui \u00e9manent d\u2019un sac, mais, ce faisant, ils d\u00e9terminent effectivement le contenu de celui\u2011ci (c.\u2011\u00e0\u2011d. une substance d\u00e9sign\u00e9e) (par. 174). Dans cette affaire, l\u2019intervention d\u2019un chien renifleur a donc \u00ab imm\u00e9diatement et directement permis aux policiers de faire une forte inf\u00e9rence \u00bb sur le contenu du sac de l\u2019accus\u00e9, ce qui faisait vraiment l\u2019objet de leurs recherches (par. 175). La capacit\u00e9 des renseignements pr\u00e9cis recherch\u00e9s \u2014 les odeurs d\u00e9tect\u00e9es par le chien \u2014 de r\u00e9v\u00e9ler d\u2019autres renseignements \u00e9tait \u00e9tay\u00e9e par la preuve au dossier dans cette affaire.\n[127] En revanche, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Gomboc, 2010 CSC 55, [2010] 3 R.C.S. 211, la police soup\u00e7onnait l\u2019accus\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre impliqu\u00e9 dans la production de marijuana. Elle a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 une entreprise de services publics d\u2019installer un appareil pour mesurer le courant \u00e9lectrique consomm\u00e9 par la r\u00e9sidence de l\u2019accus\u00e9. Notre Cour s\u2019est fond\u00e9e sur le dossier de preuve pour d\u00e9terminer ce que les renseignements pr\u00e9cis recherch\u00e9s (dans l\u2019appareil) r\u00e9v\u00e8lent et quelles inf\u00e9rences ils appuient. La Cour d\u2019appel avait conclu que certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments d\u2019information \u00e0 propos de ce qui se passe dans une habitation pouvaient \u00eatre inf\u00e9r\u00e9s de l\u2019appareil. Plusieurs juges de notre Cour n\u2019\u00e9taient pas de cet avis, car cette conclusion ne s\u2019appuyait pas sur la preuve au dossier. Le dossier indiquait plut\u00f4t que l\u2019appareil r\u00e9v\u00e8le seulement la consommation d\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9; il ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le rien \u00e0 propos des activit\u00e9s intimes ou des activit\u00e9s personnelles fondamentales se d\u00e9roulant \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur d\u2019une maison (par. 14). Le dossier de preuve restreignait donc l\u2019objet de la fouille.\n[128] Dans les circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019objet de la fouille comprend les adresses IP et l\u2019identit\u00e9 du FSI qui leur est associ\u00e9. Bien que la police e\u00fbt pour objectif ultime d\u2019identifier la personne \u00e0 qui une fraude \u00e9tait imput\u00e9e, son objectif d\u2019enqu\u00eate n\u2019est pas le point de mire de l\u2019\u00ab approche large et fonctionnelle \u00bb permettant de d\u00e9terminer l\u2019objet de la fouille (Spencer, par. 26). L\u2019objet doit plut\u00f4t refl\u00e9ter l\u2019information r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e par les renseignements pr\u00e9cis recherch\u00e9s (Spencer, par. 26). Je ne suis pas d\u2019accord avec la juge Veldhuis pour dire que la fouille avait pour objet [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019identit\u00e9 d\u2019un internaute qui correspond \u00e0 une adresse IP particuli\u00e8re li\u00e9e \u00e0 une activit\u00e9 Internet particuli\u00e8re sous surveillance \u00bb (par. 77). Bien qu\u2019il puisse s\u2019\u00eatre agi de l\u2019objectif ultime de l\u2019enqu\u00eate, ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas des renseignements r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9s par les adresses IP brutes elles\u2011m\u00eames, de sorte qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agit pas de l\u2019objet de la fouille.\n[129] Je suis parfaitement consciente du fait que les chiffres constituant une adresse IP ne sont pas recherch\u00e9s pour ces chiffres en eux\u2011m\u00eames. Ils le sont en raison des renseignements qu\u2019ils r\u00e9v\u00e8lent. Cependant, le dossier de preuve en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce \u00e9tablit qu\u2019une adresse IP, \u00e0 elle seule, r\u00e9v\u00e8le seulement des renseignements limit\u00e9s. Elle ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le pas un \u00ab ensemble de renseignements biographiques d\u2019ordre personnel que les particuliers pourraient, dans une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 libre et d\u00e9mocratique, vouloir constituer et soustraire \u00e0 la connaissance de l\u2019\u00c9tat \u00bb (R. c. Plant, [1993] 3 R.C.S. 281, p. 293). \u00c0 elle seule, une adresse IP ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le m\u00eame pas les habitudes de navigation. Ce qu\u2019elle r\u00e9v\u00e8le, c\u2019est le FSI d\u2019un utilisateur \u2014 un \u00e9l\u00e9ment d\u2019information qui n\u2019est gu\u00e8re plus priv\u00e9 que la consommation d\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 (Plant) ou les \u00e9missions de chaleur (Tessling).\n[130] Ce n\u2019est que lorsqu\u2019elle est combin\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u2019autres renseignements qu\u2019une adresse IP peut permettre de tirer des inf\u00e9rences sur l\u2019identit\u00e9 d\u2019un utilisateur, ce qui distingue fondamentalement la pr\u00e9sente esp\u00e8ce de l\u2019affaire Spencer. Dans Spencer, les renseignements relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019abonn\u00e9e \u00e9taient la cl\u00e9 qui donnait acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019identit\u00e9 de la personne derri\u00e8re une adresse IP et qui r\u00e9v\u00e9lait ses activit\u00e9s en ligne. Une attente raisonnable au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e s\u2019appliquait aux renseignements relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019abonn\u00e9e parce que ceux\u2011ci \u00e9tablissaient le lien entre l\u2019activit\u00e9 Internet anonyme et une personne pr\u00e9cise. Cependant, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il n\u2019y avait pas un tel lien. La question est donc la suivante : Quels renseignements r\u00e9v\u00e8lent \u00e0 elles seules des adresses IP, et quelles inf\u00e9rences ces adresses permettent\u2011elles de tirer?\n[131] Comme nous l\u2019avons vu, la preuve d\u2019expert non contest\u00e9e pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce a \u00e9tabli qu\u2019il existe deux m\u00e9thodes permettant de d\u00e9couvrir l\u2019identit\u00e9 d\u2019un utilisateur ou d\u2019une utilisatrice \u00e0 partir de son adresse IP externe. La premi\u00e8re m\u00e9thode consiste \u00e0 identifier le FSI \u00e0 qui appartient une adresse IP en utilisant un [traduction] \u00ab site Web de recherche d\u2019adresse IP \u00bb (d.a., p. 311). L\u2019expert a expliqu\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab [qu\u2019u]ne fois que le FSI qui exerce un contr\u00f4le sur une adresse IP particuli\u00e8re a \u00e9t\u00e9 identifi\u00e9, il est possible de d\u00e9terminer qui est l\u2019abonn\u00e9 du compte en demandant au FSI en question ce renseignement \u00bb (d.a., p. 311). C\u2019est ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9 dans Spencer. En r\u00e9ponse, notre Cour a jug\u00e9 que des personnes ont une attente raisonnable au respect de leur vie priv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ces renseignements relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019abonn\u00e9. Compte tenu de l\u2019arr\u00eat Spencer, la police doit maintenant obtenir une ordonnance de communication pour obtenir cette information. Il importe de souligner qu\u2019obtenir une telle ordonnance est exactement ce que la police a fait en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[132] Suivant le rapport d\u2019expertise, la deuxi\u00e8me m\u00e9thode par laquelle une adresse IP peut \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e pour d\u00e9terminer l\u2019identit\u00e9 d\u2019une personne qui utilise Internet consiste \u00e0 acc\u00e9der [traduction] \u00ab aux renseignements enregistr\u00e9s par le site Web d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 tierce \u00bb, lequel \u00ab peu[t] suivre l\u2019adresse IP externe de chaque utilisateur qui visite \u00bb (d.a., p. 311). Selon l\u2019expert, une adresse IP pourrait \u00eatre fournie \u00e0 une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 comme Google, et Google pourrait utiliser cette adresse IP pour d\u00e9terminer l\u2019activit\u00e9 d\u2019un utilisateur que cette soci\u00e9t\u00e9 suit. Cela semble avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 la principale pr\u00e9occupation de la juge Veldhuis, et il semble que ma coll\u00e8gue la juge Karakatsanis ait la m\u00eame pr\u00e9occupation.\n[133] Il y a deux r\u00e9ponses \u00e0 cette pr\u00e9occupation relative aux sites Web de tiers.\n[134] Premi\u00e8rement, eu \u00e9gard aux faits de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la police n\u2019a tout simplement pas utilis\u00e9 le suivi de l\u2019appelant par un site Web de tiers pour identifier celui\u2011ci. Comme l\u2019a conclu la juge du proc\u00e8s, la police recherchait les adresses IP pour pousser l\u2019enqu\u00eate, et plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment pour d\u00e9couvrir le FSI qui y \u00e9tait associ\u00e9. Le t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice principale allait dans ce sens. L\u2019enqu\u00eate qui a suivi a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9e avec une ordonnance de communication, ce qui est conforme \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat rendu par notre Cour dans Spencer. Par cons\u00e9quent, la pr\u00e9occupation ne joue pas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[135] Deuxi\u00e8mement, comme l\u2019a conc\u00e9d\u00e9 la Couronne, un tel sc\u00e9nario (le recours \u00e0 un site Web de tiers) semble ne pas pouvoir \u00eatre distingu\u00e9 de celui de l\u2019affaire Spencer. L\u2019arr\u00eat Spencer a \u00e9tabli qu\u2019il peut exister une attente raisonnable au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du lien entre l\u2019identit\u00e9 d\u2019un utilisateur et une activit\u00e9 Internet pr\u00e9cise. Que l\u2019identit\u00e9 d\u2019un internaute anonyme soit r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e par la combinaison de son adresse IP avec les renseignements relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019abonn\u00e9 d\u00e9tenus par un FSI, ou encore par la combinaison de son adresse IP avec d\u2019autres renseignements d\u00e9tenus par des sites Web de tiers, le r\u00e9sultat est le m\u00eame. L\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e de l\u2019utilisateur \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019anonymat est compromis. Par cons\u00e9quent, comme le reconna\u00eet la Couronne, l\u2019arr\u00eat Spencer oblige la police \u00e0 obtenir une autorisation judiciaire avant de demander des donn\u00e9es de cette nature \u2014 autrement dit, des donn\u00e9es qui d\u00e9voilent l\u2019identit\u00e9 d\u2019une personne dont la connexion Internet est li\u00e9e \u00e0 une activit\u00e9 en ligne particuli\u00e8re sous surveillance. Je souligne en passant que, si le site Web d\u2019un tiers fournissait spontan\u00e9ment des renseignements sans qu\u2019on lui ait demand\u00e9 de le faire, l\u2019analyse de l\u2019attente raisonnable au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e \u2014 qui est toujours guid\u00e9e par \u00ab l\u2019ensemble des circonstances \u00bb \u2014 pourrait fort bien \u00eatre diff\u00e9rente (cf. Reeves, par. 46). Il s\u2019agit l\u00e0, cependant, d\u2019une question dont il convient de remettre l\u2019examen \u00e0 une autre occasion dans une affaire o\u00f9 la situation se pr\u00e9senterait effectivement.\n[136] Enfin, l\u2019appelant invoque l\u2019arr\u00eat Reeves pour soutenir que le simple fait que la police devait prendre d\u2019autres mesures pour l\u2019identifier et le relier \u00e0 une activit\u00e9 Internet particuli\u00e8re ne signifie pas qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas d\u2019attente raisonnable au respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des adresses IP. \u00c0 mon humble avis, c\u2019est \u00e0 tort qu\u2019il invoque cet arr\u00eat. Dans Reeves, la police avait, avec la permission de la conjointe de l\u2019accus\u00e9, saisi un ordinateur que ce dernier partageait avec elle. La saisie de l\u2019ordinateur impliquait n\u00e9cessairement la saisie de ses donn\u00e9es. Notre Cour a jug\u00e9 que l\u2019accus\u00e9 avait une attente raisonnable au respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019ordinateur et de ses donn\u00e9es. Un mandat \u00e9tait certes n\u00e9cessaire pour fouiller l\u2019ordinateur malgr\u00e9 la saisie (voir R. c. Vu, 2013 CSC 60, [2013] 3 R.C.S. 657, par. 49), mais la saisie elle\u2011m\u00eame a priv\u00e9 l\u2019accus\u00e9 de son contr\u00f4le \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des donn\u00e9es de nature priv\u00e9e contenues dans l\u2019ordinateur (Reeves, par. 34). De plus, elle a mis la police en possession des donn\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquelles l\u2019accus\u00e9 avait un int\u00e9r\u00eat. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, cependant, les adresses IP \u00e0 elles seules n\u2019ont mis la police en possession d\u2019aucun renseignement priv\u00e9 \u2014 imm\u00e9diatement accessible ou non \u2014 concernant l\u2019appelant. Ce n\u2019est qu\u2019en obtenant une ordonnance de communication intimant au FSI de fournir les renseignements relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019abonn\u00e9 que la police a d\u00e9couvert des renseignements constitutionnellement prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, \u00e0 savoir le lien entre l\u2019identit\u00e9 de l\u2019appelant et son activit\u00e9 Internet.\n[137] La fa\u00e7on correcte de qualifier l\u2019objet de la fouille consiste donc \u00e0 d\u00e9crire celui\u2011ci comme les adresses IP et le FSI r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 par ces adresses. Une qualification de l\u2019objet qui va bien au\u2011del\u00e0 de l\u2019\u00e9tendue des informations effectivement r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9es par les renseignements pr\u00e9cis recherch\u00e9s par la police consid\u00e8re en fait un objectif important de nombreuses enqu\u00eates polici\u00e8res, c.\u2011\u00e0\u2011d. mener finalement \u00e0 l\u2019identification du suspect, comme concluant quant \u00e0 l\u2019objet de la fouille. Bien entendu, la police cherchait \u00e0 identifier la personne qui avait utilis\u00e9 les adresses IP lors de la perp\u00e9tration des infractions, mais elle le faisait au moyen d\u2019une s\u00e9rie de mesures, et la mesure en cause en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 uniquement le FSI de l\u2019utilisateur.\n[138] Ma coll\u00e8gue reconna\u00eet \u00e0 juste titre que les renseignements r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9s par les adresses IP font partie de l\u2019objet de la pr\u00e9tendue fouille. Cependant, elle inclut dans l\u2019objet toute mesure menant \u00e0 l\u2019identification ultime du suspect, malgr\u00e9 le fait que de tels renseignements ne sont pas r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9s par les adresses IP \u00e0 elles seules, suivant la preuve au dossier. Avec \u00e9gards, je crois qu\u2019il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 de la plus grande diff\u00e9rence entre sa position et la mienne.\n[139] J\u2019ajoute en passant qu\u2019il serait incompatible avec une d\u00e9finition fonctionnelle de l\u2019objet de la fouille d\u2019affirmer en fait que toute mesure prise dans une enqu\u00eate met en jeu une attente raisonnable au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e. Une telle conclusion perturberait le juste \u00e9quilibre que notre Cour a \u00e9tabli entre l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat des Canadiens au respect effectif de leur vie priv\u00e9e et l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de ceux\u2011ci \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il ne soit pas fait obstacle \u00e0 l\u2019application de la loi (voir, p. ex., Tessling, par. 17; Kang\u2011Brown, par. 10; Vu, par. 21; R. c. Stairs, 2022 CSC 11). En rejetant une all\u00e9gation selon laquelle il existait une attente raisonnable au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une conversation en ligne avec un policier qui se faisait passer pour une enfant, ma coll\u00e8gue l\u2019a bien expliqu\u00e9 dans ses motifs concordants dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Mills, 2019 CSC 22, [2019] 2 R.C.S. 320 : \u00ab L\u2019autre conclusion aurait une incidence importante et n\u00e9gative sur les op\u00e9rations polici\u00e8res d\u2019infiltration, y compris celles men\u00e9es \u00e9lectroniquement, [et elle] ne permet tout simplement pas d\u2019\u00e9tablir un \u00e9quilibre appropri\u00e9 entre la vie priv\u00e9e des individus et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de nos enfants \u00bb (par. 52). Je vois de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on les cons\u00e9quences de la conclusion g\u00e9n\u00e9rale tir\u00e9e par ma coll\u00e8gue en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[140] Je conclus donc que la pr\u00e9sente fouille avait pour objet les adresses IP, c.\u2011\u00e0\u2011d. les ensembles de chiffres, et l\u2019identit\u00e9 du FSI qui est r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e par celles\u2011ci. La juge du proc\u00e8s et les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel ont statu\u00e9 correctement sur cette question.\nB. Caract\u00e8re objectivement raisonnable de l\u2019attente au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e\n[141] Il faut alors se demander si l\u2019attente subjective de l\u2019appelant au respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019objet de la fouille \u00e9tait objectivement raisonnable. Je conclus qu\u2019elle ne l\u2019\u00e9tait pas.\n[142] La question de savoir si une attente au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e est raisonnable d\u00e9pend de plusieurs facteurs. Ils peuvent inclure le lieu fouill\u00e9, le contr\u00f4le sur l\u2019objet de la fouille, le caract\u00e8re priv\u00e9 de l\u2019objet, si l\u2019objet \u00e9tait \u00e0 la vue du public, si l\u2019objet a \u00e9t\u00e9 abandonn\u00e9, si des tiers poss\u00e9daient d\u00e9j\u00e0 l\u2019objet, si la m\u00e9thode de fouille a port\u00e9 atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e en cause, si la m\u00e9thode de fouille \u00e9tait elle\u2011m\u00eame d\u00e9raisonnable, et si la fouille a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 des renseignements biographiques (voir, p. ex., Tessling, par. 32). Cette liste n\u2019est pas exhaustive. Aucun facteur \u00e0 lui seul n\u2019est d\u00e9terminant.\n[143] Les facteurs ne seront pas tous pertinents pour l\u2019analyse dans un cas donn\u00e9. Prendre en consid\u00e9ration le type d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e en cause peut parfois \u00eatre utile lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9terminer quels facteurs sont pertinents.\n[144] Les trois types d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e qui ressortent de la jurisprudence sont d\u2019ordre personnel, territorial et informationnel. C\u2019est le dernier type d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat qui est clairement en cause en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. L\u2019intimit\u00e9 informationnelle peut \u00eatre d\u00e9finie comme [traduction] \u00ab le droit revendiqu\u00e9 par des particuliers, des groupes ou des institutions de d\u00e9terminer eux\u2011m\u00eames le moment, la mani\u00e8re et la mesure dans lesquels des renseignements les concernant sont communiqu\u00e9s \u00bb (Tessling, par. 23, citant A. F. Westin, Privacy and Freedom (1970), p. 7).\n[145] Compte tenu des faits de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et en particulier de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat en mati\u00e8re d\u2019intimit\u00e9 informationnelle qui est en jeu, les facteurs pertinents pour l\u2019analyse du caract\u00e8re raisonnable sont le caract\u00e8re priv\u00e9 de l\u2019objet, le contr\u00f4le sur l\u2019objet et le lieu fouill\u00e9 (voir Marakah, par. 24). Il s\u2019agit des facteurs sur lesquels les parties et les cours inf\u00e9rieures ont mis l\u2019accent, et je vais les examiner \u00e0 tour de r\u00f4le.\n[146] Cependant, avant de ce faire, je souhaite examiner la d\u00e9cision de ma coll\u00e8gue de s\u2019appuyer sur des d\u00e9cisions \u00e9trang\u00e8res comme \u00ab d\u00e9criv[ant] de fa\u00e7on convaincante l\u2019interaction entre les adresses IP et l\u2019approche normative que notre Cour a syst\u00e9matiquement appliqu\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019art. 8 \u00bb (par. 83). Avec \u00e9gards, j\u2019estime que ces d\u00e9cisions ne sont pas pertinentes. Tout d\u2019abord, elles portent sur des cadres l\u00e9gislatifs diff\u00e9rents de pays diff\u00e9rents. L\u2019arr\u00eat Breyer c. Bundesrepublik Deutschland, C\u2011582\/14, EU:C:2016:779, traitait de la question de savoir si une personne \u00e9tait identifiable au moyen d\u2019une adresse IP par le site Web consult\u00e9, et non par l\u2019\u00c9tat en tant que tel. L\u2019arr\u00eat Vidal\u2011Hall c. Google Inc., [2015] EWCA Civ 311, [2016] Q.B. 1003, a simplement r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la question de savoir si la signification ex juris aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre autoris\u00e9e dans cette affaire, et la r\u00e9ponse affirmative donn\u00e9e par la Cour d\u2019appel s\u2019apparentait au refus d\u2019une demande visant \u00e0 faire radier un acte de proc\u00e9dure au motif que celui\u2011ci ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le aucune cause d\u2019action raisonnable (Altimo Holdings c. Kyrgyz Mobil Tel Ltd, [2011] UKPC 7, [2012] 1 W.L.R. 1804, par. 84\u201186). Plus fondamentalement, toutefois, ces d\u00e9cisions traitaient de faits diff\u00e9rents et de dossiers diff\u00e9rents.\n(1) Caract\u00e8re priv\u00e9 de l\u2019objet\n[147] Le caract\u00e8re priv\u00e9 de l\u2019objet d\u2019une pr\u00e9tendue fouille peut appuyer une conclusion suivant laquelle une attente au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e est raisonnable. C\u2019est ce qui d\u00e9coule de l\u2019objet de l\u2019art. 8, \u00e0 savoir prot\u00e9ger les gens \u00ab contre les intrusions injustifi\u00e9es de l\u2019\u00c9tat dans leur vie priv\u00e9e \u00bb (Hunter c. Southam Inc., [1984] 2 R.C.S. 145, p. 160). Comme dans le cas de la d\u00e9termination de l\u2019objet, la question est de savoir non seulement si l\u2019objet lui\u2011m\u00eame est priv\u00e9, mais aussi s\u2019il est susceptible de r\u00e9v\u00e9ler d\u2019autres renseignements priv\u00e9s essentiels, tels des renseignements biographiques (Gomboc, par. 14). Ce facteur rev\u00eat une importance particuli\u00e8re en ce qui a trait aux int\u00e9r\u00eats en mati\u00e8re d\u2019intimit\u00e9 informationnelle, comme celui en cause en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Lorsque seule l\u2019intimit\u00e9 informationnelle est en cause, il peut \u00eatre presque essentiel que les renseignements eux\u2011m\u00eames soient priv\u00e9s pour qu\u2019il existe une attente raisonnable au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e.\n[148] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les adresses IP n\u2019\u00e9taient pas priv\u00e9es et, eu \u00e9gard aux faits, ne r\u00e9v\u00e9laient pas de renseignements priv\u00e9s de quelque nature que ce soit, et encore moins des renseignements biographiques. Selon la preuve d\u2019expert, ce n\u2019est que lorsqu\u2019une adresse IP est combin\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u2019autres renseignements qu\u2019elle peut tendre \u00e0 r\u00e9v\u00e9ler des renseignements intimes sur une personne. Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9montr\u00e9, rien dans la preuve ne sugg\u00e8re que la police peut obtenir quelque renseignement priv\u00e9 que ce soit sur une personne en ne disposant que d\u2019une adresse IP. Sans plus, tout ce qu\u2019une adresse IP r\u00e9v\u00e8le \u00e0 la police est le FSI d\u2019un utilisateur \u2014 ce qui ne constitue gu\u00e8re un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de nature particuli\u00e8rement priv\u00e9e, et encore moins des \u00ab renseignements biographiques \u00bb.\n[149] Ma coll\u00e8gue conclut que des adresses IP, sans plus, r\u00e9v\u00e8lent des renseignements tr\u00e8s sensibles et personnels, y compris l\u2019identit\u00e9 de leur utilisateur. Bien que je sois consciente que l\u2019approche normative applicable \u00e0 l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 8 exige un certain degr\u00e9 de souplesse, j\u2019estime que la pr\u00e9sente affaire doit \u00eatre jug\u00e9e sur la base du dossier de preuve actuel et de rien d\u2019autre. La preuve au dossier ne doit pas \u00eatre ignor\u00e9e; elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise au juge du proc\u00e8s et v\u00e9rifi\u00e9e au moyen du processus contradictoire rigoureux.\n[150] En outre, personne en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce n\u2019a soutenu qu\u2019un simple achat constitue un renseignement priv\u00e9, qu\u2019il soit effectu\u00e9 en ligne ou autrement (par. 61\u201162). Personne n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un tel argument, probablement parce que sans identification de l\u2019acheteur, le fait de l\u2019achat ne veut rien dire.\n[151] Tout cela milite fortement contre une conclusion selon laquelle toute attente au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e \u00e9tait raisonnable.\n(2) Contr\u00f4le sur l\u2019objet\n[152] Le contr\u00f4le sur l\u2019objet de la fouille appuie g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement une conclusion selon laquelle il y avait une attente raisonnable au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e, alors que l\u2019absence de contr\u00f4le peut militer contre une telle conclusion (Marakah, par. 38). L\u2019id\u00e9e est simple : lorsque nous contr\u00f4lons quelque chose, nous pouvons nous attendre \u00e0 ce que les autres respectent notre int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cette chose \u2014 et jusqu\u2019\u00e0 un certain point l\u2019exiger. Ce raisonnement ne rend pas le contr\u00f4le n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019une attente raisonnable au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e, mais son existence est un facteur qui peut \u00e9tayer la conclusion qu\u2019il existe une telle attente.\n[153] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de la preuve d\u2019expert, l\u2019appelant semblait n\u2019avoir gu\u00e8re de contr\u00f4le sur les adresses IP. Le FSI peut changer l\u2019adresse IP d\u2019un utilisateur \u00e0 son gr\u00e9 et sans pr\u00e9avis. C\u2019est ce qui distingue nettement les adresses IP des messages textes, tels ceux dans Marakah, o\u00f9 les juges majoritaires de notre Cour ont affirm\u00e9 que les gens \u00ab exercent un v\u00e9ritable contr\u00f4le sur l\u2019information qu\u2019ils envoient par message texte en d\u00e9cidant de la mani\u00e8re dont ils la divulguent ainsi que du moment o\u00f9 ils le font et \u00e0 qui ils la divulguent \u00bb (par. 39).\n[154] Au vu de la preuve, il semble que les adresses IP n\u2019\u00e9taient visibles que pour les sites Web que l\u2019appelant choisissait de visiter, ce qui constitue un contr\u00f4le limit\u00e9. Cela dit, une comparaison utile peut \u00eatre \u00e9tablie entre le fait de laisser des empreintes digitales sur les lieux d\u2019un crime et celui de laisser une adresse IP \u00e0 la vue d\u2019un site Web. Un internaute qui laisse derri\u00e8re lui des donn\u00e9es relatives \u00e0 une adresse IP perd compl\u00e8tement le contr\u00f4le de ce qui se passe avec ces chiffres, tout comme une personne perd le contr\u00f4le de ce qui se passe avec ses empreintes digitales apr\u00e8s avoir touch\u00e9 quelque chose. On ne saurait s\u00e9rieusement faire valoir qu\u2019une enqu\u00eate polici\u00e8re o\u00f9 des empreintes digitales sont relev\u00e9es au moyen de poudres et conserv\u00e9es \u2014 sans plus \u2014 pourrait mettre en jeu une attente raisonnable au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e. Il en va de m\u00eame \u2014 dans ce cas \u00e9galement, sans plus \u2014 de l\u2019obtention d\u2019une adresse IP.\n[155] Le facteur du contr\u00f4le tend donc \u00e0 exclure une conclusion selon laquelle l\u2019attente de l\u2019appelant au respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e \u00e9tait raisonnable.\n(3) Lieu fouill\u00e9\n[156] Le lieu fouill\u00e9 joue sur le caract\u00e8re raisonnable de toute attente au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de celui\u2011ci. L\u2019id\u00e9e du lieu se rapporte essentiellement au concept d\u2019intimit\u00e9 territoriale (Tessling, par. 22). Elle est donc quelque peu \u00e9loign\u00e9e des faits de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, qui, rappelons\u2011le, mettent en jeu l\u2019intimit\u00e9 informationnelle, et elle prend n\u00e9cessairement moins d\u2019importance. La question qui se posait devant les cours inf\u00e9rieures, comme celle qui se pose devant la Cour, est celle de savoir si le lieu fouill\u00e9 pourrait \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant le domicile de l\u2019appelant, ainsi que ce dernier le soutient. Il est reconnu depuis longtemps qu\u2019une personne a une attente accrue au respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e dans son domicile (voir, p. ex., R. c. Feeney, [1997] 2 R.C.S. 13, par. 78). Par cons\u00e9quent, qualifier le lieu fouill\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant le domicile de l\u2019appelant appuierait en quelque sorte son affirmation selon laquelle il avait une attente raisonnable au respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e.\n[157] \u00c0 mon avis, cependant, le lieu, lorsque correctement qualifi\u00e9, est la base de donn\u00e9es de l\u2019entreprise de traitement des cartes de cr\u00e9dit. C\u2019est \u00e0 cet endroit que les adresses IP ont \u00e9t\u00e9 stock\u00e9es et que l\u2019entreprise les a extraites afin de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la demande de la police. Comme l\u2019a reconnu \u00e0 juste titre la juge du proc\u00e8s, la pr\u00e9tendue fouille n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e au domicile de l\u2019appelant, et le lieu o\u00f9 elle s\u2019est d\u00e9roul\u00e9e n\u2019accro\u00eet pas le caract\u00e8re objectivement raisonnable de son attente subjective au respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e.\n(4) Conclusion sur l\u2019attente raisonnable au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e\n[158] Consid\u00e9rant ces facteurs ensemble, je conclus que l\u2019appelant n\u2019avait pas une attente raisonnable au respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des adresses IP contenues sur les serveurs de l\u2019entreprise de traitement des cartes de cr\u00e9dit, et du FSI qu\u2019elles ont r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9. La police n\u2019avait pas besoin d\u2019une autorisation judiciaire avant de demander les adresses IP \u00e0 l\u2019entreprise afin de d\u00e9terminer le FSI associ\u00e9 \u00e0 celles\u2011ci. La police a suivi \u00e0 la lettre les enseignements de l\u2019arr\u00eat Spencer.\n[159] Pour \u00eatre claire, en concluant que l\u2019appelant n\u2019avait pas une attente raisonnable au respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des adresses IP dans les circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, je n\u2019exclus pas du tout la possibilit\u00e9 qu\u2019une personne puisse avoir une telle attente sur le fondement de faits diff\u00e9rents. Il en est ainsi parce que, rappelons\u2011le, \u00ab [l]\u2019existence d\u2019une attente raisonnable en mati\u00e8re de protection de la vie priv\u00e9e [. . .] exig[e] toujours une analyse contextuelle qui repose sur des faits \u00bb (R. c. McNeil, 2009 CSC 3, [2009] 1 R.C.S. 66, par. 12). En effet, l\u2019analyse doit \u00eatre effectu\u00e9e eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 \u00ab l\u2019ensemble des circonstances d\u2019un cas particulier \u00bb (Edwards, par. 31 (je souligne)). N\u00e9anmoins, bien que la pr\u00e9sente affaire porte sur l\u2019infraction de fraude, il convient de noter que des enqu\u00eates polici\u00e8res faisant intervenir des adresses IP ont \u00e9galement lieu dans le contexte d\u2019autres infractions criminelles. De fait, la jurisprudence regorge d\u2019exemples o\u00f9 la police fait enqu\u00eate sur des infractions contre des enfants, y compris la pornographie juv\u00e9nile et le leurre d\u2019enfant, au moyen d\u2019adresses IP (voir, p. ex., R. c. O\u2019Brien, 2023 ONCA 197, 166 O.R. (3d) 114; R. c. Ilia, 2023 ONCA 75, 523 C.R.R. (2d) 128; R. c. Allen, 2020 ONCA 664, 396 C.C.C. (3d) 1; R. c. West, 2020 ONCA 473, 392 C.C.C. (3d) 271; R. c. Caza, 2015 BCCA 374, 376 B.C.A.C. 258; Ward; Trapp; R. c. Smith, 2005 BCCA 334, 199 C.C.C. (3d) 404).\n[160] Le r\u00e9sultat auquel arrive ma coll\u00e8gue selon lequel toutes les adresses IP, et non pas seulement certaines d\u2019entre elles, cr\u00e9ent une attente raisonnable au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e (voir les par. 12 et 87\u201188) compromettrait s\u00e9rieusement la capacit\u00e9 de la police d\u2019enqu\u00eater sur ces infractions graves contre des enfants. \u00c9tant \u00ab partie des membres les plus vuln\u00e9rables de notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00bb (R. c. Friesen, 2020 CSC 9, [2020] 1 R.C.S. 424, par. 1), les enfants doivent recevoir \u00ab une protection accrue afin [de ne pas \u00eatre] victimes d\u2019infractions sexuelles \u00bb (Mills, par. 23, le juge Brown). Comme l\u2019a \u00e9crit ma coll\u00e8gue dans ses motifs concordants dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Mills, une affaire de leurre d\u2019enfant, \u00ab au fur et \u00e0 mesure qu\u2019\u00e9volue la technologie, les moyens de commettre des crimes \u2014 et d\u2019enqu\u00eater sur ceux\u2011ci \u2014 \u00e9voluent \u00e9galement \u00bb (par. 39). Vu cette \u00e9volution de la cybercriminalit\u00e9, exiger que la police demande l\u2019autorisation d\u2019obtenir une adresse IP dans tous les cas aurait pour effet d\u2019exacerber les difficult\u00e9s existantes auxquelles est confront\u00e9 le syst\u00e8me de justice p\u00e9nale. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, je citerais les propos du juge Moldaver (dissident, bien que sur une question diff\u00e9rente relative \u00e0 l\u2019art. 8) dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Marakah, par. 185, en ce qui a trait au fonctionnement du syst\u00e8me de justice :\nLa n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 accrue d\u2019obtenir cette autorisation judiciaire pourrait grever les ressources polici\u00e8res et judiciaires d\u2019un syst\u00e8me de justice p\u00e9nale d\u00e9j\u00e0 surcharg\u00e9. Les enqu\u00eates seraient ralenties, il faudrait plus de fonctionnaires judiciaires et l\u2019administration de la justice p\u00e9nale tout enti\u00e8re en souffrira.\n[161] Je souligne que, pour parvenir au m\u00eame r\u00e9sultat que celui auquel arrive ma coll\u00e8gue en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il me faudrait, d\u2019une part, examiner diff\u00e9rents sc\u00e9narios factuels pour tirer de nouvelles conclusions sur les renseignements qu\u2019une adresse IP est susceptible de r\u00e9v\u00e9ler et, d\u2019autre part, expliquer ce que des tiers pourraient faire volontairement avec les donn\u00e9es qu\u2019ils recueillent. Je ne le peux pas, parce cela reviendrait \u00e0 ne tenir aucun compte des limites de la comp\u00e9tence de notre Cour, de la norme de contr\u00f4le applicable aux conclusions de fait, de la preuve particuli\u00e8re au dossier, et \u00e9galement de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale. Un tribunal doit examiner les faits tels qu\u2019ils sont, et non tels qu\u2019ils pourraient \u00eatre, que ce soit en raison d\u2019un changement technologique (Tessling, par. 28\u201129 et 55) ou d\u2019un dossier de preuve diff\u00e9rent. Si les faits sont chang\u00e9s, [traduction] \u00ab la cause est modifi\u00e9e \u00bb pour reprendre les propos tr\u00e8s anciens de Plowden. Mais ce ne serait pas la pr\u00e9sente cause.\n[162] Expos\u00e9e bri\u00e8vement, la comp\u00e9tence de notre Cour dans les appels en mati\u00e8re criminelle se limite aux questions de droit (Code criminel , L.R.C. 1985, c. C\u201146, art. 691 \u00e0 693 ; Loi sur la Cour supr\u00eame , L.R.C. 1985, c. S\u201126, par. 40(3) ), ce qui signifie qu\u2019annuler les conclusions de fait des cours inf\u00e9rieures ne constitue pas une option. M\u00eame s\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une option, personne n\u2019a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que la norme de contr\u00f4le applicable pour annuler des conclusions de fait est respect\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Personne ne l\u2019a fait parce qu\u2019en premi\u00e8re instance, les parties ont souscrit \u00e0 la preuve de l\u2019expert de la d\u00e9fense sur laquelle reposaient les conclusions de fait qui sous\u2011tendent l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 8.\n[163] Annuler les conclusions de fait des cours inf\u00e9rieures reviendrait aussi essentiellement \u00e0 prendre connaissance d\u2019office de divers faits contestables concernant les adresses IP et les renseignements qui peuvent en \u00eatre d\u00e9gag\u00e9s, ce qui serait, \u00e0 mon avis, incompatible avec la jurisprudence de notre Cour sur la connaissance d\u2019office (R. c. Find, 2001 CSC 32, [2001] 1 R.C.S. 863, par. 48). Sur ce, j\u2019aimerais \u00e9galement aborder le fait que l\u2019une des parties intervenantes invoque dans son m\u00e9moire des documents gouvernementaux et autres documents (p. ex., Commissariat \u00e0 la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e du Canada, Ce qu\u2019une adresse IP peut r\u00e9v\u00e9ler \u00e0 votre sujet : Rapport pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par la Direction de l\u2019analyse des technologies du Commissariat \u00e0 la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e du Canada (2013)). Bien que je convienne avec ma coll\u00e8gue que les intervenants jouent un r\u00f4le important, ce r\u00f4le est circonscrit. Des arr\u00eats r\u00e9cents de la Cour ont indiqu\u00e9 clairement que des intervenants ne peuvent pas compl\u00e9ter le dossier de preuve en appel et ont expliqu\u00e9 pourquoi cette r\u00e8gle existe (R. c. McGregor, 2023 CSC 4, par. 24, citant R. c. Sharma, 2022 CSC 39, par. 75). Le point de vue g\u00e9n\u00e9ral selon lequel il convient de recourir \u00e0 une preuve v\u00e9rifi\u00e9e au moyen du processus contradictoire, plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00e0 la connaissance d\u2019office, pour \u00e9tablir les faits en contexte constitutionnel est \u00e9galement bien \u00e9tabli (R. c. Spence, 2005 CSC 71, [2005] 3 R.C.S. 458, par. 68; In re The Board of Commerce Act, 1919, and The Combines and Fair Prices Act, 1919, [1922] 1 A.C. 191 (C.P.), p. 201).\n[164] Avec le plus grand respect, j\u2019estime que l\u2019effet du raisonnement de ma coll\u00e8gue est de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une question qui n\u2019est pas pos\u00e9e, sur le fondement de sc\u00e9narios factuels diff\u00e9rents de celui en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, afin de r\u00e9gler un probl\u00e8me social qui n\u2019est pas en cause ici. Je ne dirai rien de plus sur le sujet, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ne pas pr\u00e9juger la question si jamais elle est soulev\u00e9e.\nVI. Conclusion\n[165] Je conclus que les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel ont confirm\u00e9 \u00e0 juste titre la d\u00e9cision de la juge du proc\u00e8s selon laquelle l\u2019appelant n\u2019avait pas une attente raisonnable au respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des adresses IP dans les circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.

Dans les deux affaires, la Cour d\u2019appel a infirm\u00e9 les d\u00e9clarations de culpabilit\u00e9 sur la base d\u2019erreurs de droit all\u00e9gu\u00e9es dans les appr\u00e9ciations de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et de la fiabilit\u00e9 par les juges du proc\u00e8s. Se fondant sur la r\u00e8gle interdisant le recours \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques infond\u00e9es, qui tire son origine d\u2019une s\u00e9rie d\u2019arr\u00eats des juridictions d\u2019appel, la Cour d\u2019appel a conclu que les juges du proc\u00e8s avaient commis des erreurs de droit en formulant des hypoth\u00e8ses sur le comportement humain qui ne reposaient pas sur la preuve. Dans le cadre de l\u2019appel de K, la cour a statu\u00e9 que la conclusion du juge du proc\u00e8s qu\u2019il \u00e9tait improbable qu\u2019une femme se trompe au sujet de la sensation d\u2019une p\u00e9n\u00e9tration p\u00e9no\u2011vaginale \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur un raisonnement conjectural et ne relevait pas de la connaissance d\u2019office. Dans le cadre de l\u2019appel de T, la cour a statu\u00e9 que la juge du proc\u00e8s avait formul\u00e9 trois hypoth\u00e8ses concernant le comportement humain qui ont eu une incidence sur son appr\u00e9ciation de la preuve : 1) une personne ne demanderait pas de but en blanc \u00e0 recevoir une fess\u00e9e pendant des pr\u00e9liminaires sexuels; 2) une personne contr\u00f4lante ne s\u2019abstiendrait pas de se livrer \u00e0 des rapports sexuels vaginaux parce qu\u2019elle ne pouvait pas trouver de condom; et 3) une personne ne quitterait pas abruptement et cavali\u00e8rement la personne avec laquelle elle vient d\u2019avoir des rapports sexuels consensuels. La cour a conclu que ces g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisations n\u2019\u00e9taient pas \u00e9tay\u00e9es par la preuve et faisaient appel \u00e0 un raisonnement conjectural, et que ces erreurs \u00e9taient importantes.

Une telle erreur de droit constituerait un changement radical par rapport \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont les juridictions d\u2019appel ont en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral abord\u00e9 l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et de la fiabilit\u00e9, surtout dans le contexte d\u2019une agression sexuelle. La r\u00e8gle propos\u00e9e n\u2019est aucunement analogue \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble des r\u00e8gles de droit qui prot\u00e8gent les plaignantes, dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle, contre les mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes, et ne peut pas non plus se justifier comme \u00e9tant n\u00e9cessaire pour assurer l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 envers l\u2019accus\u00e9. De plus, elle traite toute hypoth\u00e8se de fait tir\u00e9e lors de l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation des t\u00e9moignages comme une erreur de droit, et repr\u00e9sente donc une rupture injustifi\u00e9e avec les principes bien \u00e9tablis r\u00e9gissant l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation des t\u00e9moignages et les normes de contr\u00f4le en appel. Les normes de contr\u00f4le et les r\u00e8gles de preuve actuelles devraient continuer de s\u2019appliquer au contr\u00f4le du recours fautif \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques dans les proc\u00e8s criminels. Dans certains cas, le recours au bon sens par le juge du proc\u00e8s sera susceptible de contr\u00f4le en appel parce qu\u2019il r\u00e9v\u00e8le des erreurs de droit reconnues. Autrement, comme toute autre conclusion de fait, l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et de la fiabilit\u00e9 \u2014 et tout recours aux hypoth\u00e8ses logiques qui y sont inh\u00e9rentes \u2014 sera susceptible de r\u00e9vision seulement en cas d\u2019erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, selon une appr\u00e9ciation des conclusions des juges du proc\u00e8s sur la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et la fiabilit\u00e9 en fonction de la norme de l\u2019erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante, aucune erreur de ce genre n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 commise.\nPremi\u00e8rement, la r\u00e8gle propos\u00e9e interdisant le recours \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques infond\u00e9es n\u2019est pas un prolongement logique de l\u2019interdiction visant le recours aux mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00e0 l\u2019endroit des personnes plaignantes dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle. Une telle r\u00e8gle t\u00e9moigne d\u2019une mauvaise compr\u00e9hension de l\u2019ensemble distinct de r\u00e8gles de droit associ\u00e9 aux mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle, qui a un historique unique et un objectif r\u00e9parateur pr\u00e9cis : \u00e9carter les r\u00e8gles de droit discriminatoires qui ont contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la perception que les femmes, en tant que groupe, \u00e9taient peu cr\u00e9dibles et ne m\u00e9ritaient pas une protection juridique contre la violence sexuelle. Plusieurs mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes sont condamn\u00e9s par la jurisprudence, qui a qualifi\u00e9 le recours \u00e0 ceux\u2011ci d\u2019erreur de droit et des changements l\u00e9gislatifs importants ont \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9s dans le but de prot\u00e9ger les droits des femmes et des enfants en raison de leur vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 particuli\u00e8re \u00e0 la violence sexuelle. Cet historique met en perspective les raisons distinctes pour lesquelles le fait de recourir aux mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes afin de discr\u00e9diter les personnes plaignantes dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle constitue une erreur de droit, au lieu d\u2019\u00eatre une conclusion de fait ordinaire assujettie \u00e0 la norme de l\u2019erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante. Inversement, la r\u00e8gle propos\u00e9e ne porte pas sur des g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisations pr\u00e9cises, d\u00e9termin\u00e9es et erron\u00e9es concernant une certaine cat\u00e9gorie de t\u00e9moins, et elle n\u2019emp\u00eache pas non plus que le sens des \u00e9l\u00e9ments d\u2019une infraction soit d\u00e9natur\u00e9. Elle regroupe plut\u00f4t les types de st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes pernicieux et discriminatoires que les tribunaux et le Parlement ont voulu condamner et corriger avec des g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisations inoffensives qui, quoique peut\u2011\u00eatre erron\u00e9es sur le plan des faits, n\u2019ont rien \u00e0 avoir avec l\u2019in\u00e9galit\u00e9 de traitement.\nLa r\u00e8gle \u00e9largirait \u00e9galement consid\u00e9rablement la port\u00e9e des questions permises au sujet du comportement sexuel ant\u00e9rieur de la plaignante, exigeant dans les faits que les deux parties demandent l\u2019autorisation pour pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve concernant d\u2019autres comportements sexuels qui ne seraient peut\u2011\u00eatre pas pertinents ou permis, permettant de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9tourn\u00e9e le raisonnement interdit fond\u00e9 sur les deux mythes. Bien que formul\u00e9e sous l\u2019angle du traitement \u00e9gal pour l\u2019accus\u00e9, cette approche risque en fait de ressusciter le pr\u00e9jug\u00e9 m\u00eame \u00e0 l\u2019endroit des plaignantes dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle que la r\u00e8gle de droit sur les mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes visait \u00e0 \u00e9liminer. La reconnaissance d\u2019une r\u00e8gle identique appliquant aux accus\u00e9s le m\u00eame traitement relatif aux mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes que celui qui s\u2019applique aux plaignantes n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire et ne serait pas judicieuse. Les droits de l\u2019accus\u00e9 demeurent pr\u00e9serv\u00e9s par des protections juridiques fondamentales express\u00e9ment con\u00e7ues pour assurer l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 envers l\u2019accus\u00e9, lesquelles prennent leur source dans leur propre ensemble solide de r\u00e8gles de droit d\u00e9coulant de principes tels la pr\u00e9somption d\u2019innocence, le droit de garder le silence et le doute raisonnable. De telles mesures de protection assurent l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 envers l\u2019accus\u00e9 et doivent guider le juge du proc\u00e8s lorsqu\u2019il appr\u00e9cie les t\u00e9moignages.\nEn outre, la r\u00e8gle propos\u00e9e nuit \u00e0 l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation ad\u00e9quate des t\u00e9moignages et est incompatible avec le r\u00f4le souvent inextricable que jouent les hypoth\u00e8ses logiques dans les appr\u00e9ciations de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et de la fiabilit\u00e9. En interdisant le recours \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques infond\u00e9es, la r\u00e8gle g\u00eane le recours n\u00e9cessaire au bon sens dans le cadre de l\u2019analyse des t\u00e9moignages. Il est impossible dans les faits de tracer une ligne de d\u00e9marcation claire entre le recours \u00e0 l\u2019exp\u00e9rience humaine pour interpr\u00e9ter la preuve ou tirer des inf\u00e9rences (ce que permet la r\u00e8gle) et l\u2019introduction de nouvelles consid\u00e9rations dans la preuve (ce qu\u2019elle ne permet pas). La r\u00e8gle invite les juridictions d\u2019appel \u00e0 substituer leurs opinions sur les g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisations qui sont appropri\u00e9es ou utiles \u00e0 celles du juge du proc\u00e8s, ce qui transforme irr\u00e9guli\u00e8rement leur forte opposition aux inf\u00e9rences factuelles d\u2019un juge du proc\u00e8s en de pr\u00e9tendues erreurs de droit, cr\u00e9ant ainsi une source d\u2019incertitude et d\u2019injustice en appel.\nLa r\u00e8gle va \u00e9galement \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des normes de contr\u00f4le bien \u00e9tablies et \u00e9largirait ind\u00fbment la port\u00e9e de l\u2019intervention en appel aux appr\u00e9ciations de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et de la fiabilit\u00e9 par le juge du proc\u00e8s. Ces appr\u00e9ciations peuvent \u00eatre les d\u00e9cisions judiciaires les plus importantes et les plus difficiles \u00e0 prendre dans un proc\u00e8s criminel, particuli\u00e8rement dans les cas d\u2019agression sexuelle, lesquels comportent souvent des actes qui auraient eu lieu en priv\u00e9 et qui reposent sur les d\u00e9positions contradictoires de deux t\u00e9moins. Bien que les conclusions sur la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et la fiabilit\u00e9 puissent \u00eatre infirm\u00e9es selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte si des erreurs de droit sont r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9es, il est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable dans la plupart des cas de les examiner selon la norme nuanc\u00e9e et holistique de l\u2019erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante \u2014 laquelle commande la d\u00e9f\u00e9rence envers les conclusions du juge du proc\u00e8s, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 en contact direct avec les t\u00e9moins et poss\u00e8de l\u2019expertise pour appr\u00e9cier et soupeser les faits. Les raisons pour lesquelles la d\u00e9f\u00e9rence s\u2019impose \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des conclusions du juge du proc\u00e8s sur la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et les faits comprennent notamment les suivantes : 1) limiter le co\u00fbt, le nombre et la dur\u00e9e des appels; 2) promouvoir l\u2019autonomie et l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du proc\u00e8s; et 3) reconna\u00eetre l\u2019expertise et la position avantageuse du juge du proc\u00e8s. Les juridictions d\u2019appel sont comparativement mal outill\u00e9es pour effectuer l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et de la fiabilit\u00e9, car elles n\u2019examinent que les transcriptions des t\u00e9moignages et s\u2019attachent souvent particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 des questions pr\u00e9cises plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019ensemble de l\u2019affaire et de la preuve. Sur la base de la r\u00e8gle propos\u00e9e, les juridictions d\u2019appel ont \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9es \u00e0 d\u00e9cortiquer les motifs de premi\u00e8re instance, \u00e0 attaquer les d\u00e9clarations g\u00e9n\u00e9riques faites dans le cadre des appr\u00e9ciations de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et \u00e0 qualifier toute conclusion sur la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 qui repose sur le comportement humain de st\u00e9r\u00e9otype inadmissible ou d\u2019hypoth\u00e8se logique non fond\u00e9e sur la preuve. La jurisprudence dans ce domaine est variable, m\u00eame volatile, et illustre la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019une m\u00e9thode de r\u00e9vision en appel plus uniforme.\n\u00c9tant donn\u00e9 le rejet de la r\u00e8gle propos\u00e9e, les juridictions d\u2019appel devraient continuer de s\u2019en remettre au droit existant et bien \u00e9tabli pour \u00e9valuer les appr\u00e9ciations par le juge du proc\u00e8s de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 ou de la fiabilit\u00e9. En premier lieu, lorsqu\u2019un appelant soutient que le juge du proc\u00e8s a eu recours \u00e0 tort \u00e0 une hypoth\u00e8se logique lors de l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de son t\u00e9moignage, la cour charg\u00e9e de la r\u00e9vision devrait se demander si l\u2019affirmation contest\u00e9e est v\u00e9ritablement une hypoth\u00e8se. Ce qui semble \u00eatre une hypoth\u00e8se peut en fait \u00eatre une conclusion particuli\u00e8re sur le t\u00e9moin que le juge a tir\u00e9e \u00e0 partir de la preuve. En second lieu, si le juge du proc\u00e8s s\u2019est fond\u00e9 sur une hypoth\u00e8se qui va au\u2011del\u00e0 des limites de ce qu\u2019appuient le bon sens et la fonction judiciaire, la cour charg\u00e9e de la r\u00e9vision devrait \u00e9tablir la norme de contr\u00f4le qu\u2019il convient d\u2019appliquer \u00e0 la portion contest\u00e9e de l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation par le juge du proc\u00e8s de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 ou de la fiabilit\u00e9. La norme de contr\u00f4le applicable sera celle de la d\u00e9cision correcte si l\u2019erreur all\u00e9gu\u00e9e est une erreur de droit reconnue, notamment le recours aux mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00e0 l\u2019endroit des plaignantes dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle, ou \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses d\u00e9plac\u00e9es et erron\u00e9es au sujet des personnes accus\u00e9es qui sont contraires aux principes fondamentaux comme le droit de garder le silence et la pr\u00e9somption d\u2019innocence. Le recours \u00e0 des st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes reposant sur d\u2019autres formes d\u2019in\u00e9galit\u00e9 de traitement qui sont semblables aux mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00e0 l\u2019endroit des personnes plaignantes dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle peut aussi constituer une erreur de droit dans des affaires futures. Les appr\u00e9ciations des t\u00e9moignages peuvent aussi \u00eatre susceptibles de r\u00e9vision selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte en raison d\u2019une crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9, au motif qu\u2019une conclusion de fait qui n\u2019est fond\u00e9e sur aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve a \u00e9t\u00e9 tir\u00e9e et au motif qu\u2019il y a eu prise de connaissance d\u2019office de mani\u00e8re inappropri\u00e9e.\nEn l\u2019absence d\u2019une erreur de droit, la norme de contr\u00f4le sera celle de l\u2019erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante. La cour charg\u00e9e de la r\u00e9vision doit d\u2019abord d\u00e9terminer si le recours erron\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se est manifeste, comme dans les cas o\u00f9 il est \u00e9vident que l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se en question est fausse \u00e0 sa face m\u00eame, ou les cas o\u00f9 elle est fausse ou inapplicable \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve retenus ou des conclusions de fait. Une fois qu\u2019une erreur manifeste a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cel\u00e9e, la cour charg\u00e9e de la r\u00e9vision doit aussi conclure que le recours erron\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se \u00e9tait d\u00e9terminant, lorsqu\u2019il a influ\u00e9 sur le r\u00e9sultat ou qu\u2019il touche directement \u00e0 l\u2019issue de l\u2019affaire. S\u2019il ne peut \u00eatre d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que l\u2019erreur \u00e9tait manifeste et d\u00e9terminante, l\u2019\u00e9valuation par le juge du proc\u00e8s de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 ou de la fiabilit\u00e9 commandera la d\u00e9f\u00e9rence et il n\u2019y aura aucune raison justifiant une intervention en appel.\nDans les cas de K et T, la Cour d\u2019appel a commis une erreur en ayant recours \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle interdisant le recours \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques infond\u00e9es et en proc\u00e9dant \u00e0 la r\u00e9vision des g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisations erron\u00e9es all\u00e9gu\u00e9es selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte. Les d\u00e9cisions de premi\u00e8re instance dans les deux cas auraient d\u00fb \u00eatre r\u00e9vis\u00e9es selon la norme de l\u2019erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante. Dans le cas de K, la Cour d\u2019appel a eu tort de conclure que le juge du proc\u00e8s avait eu recours \u00e0 un raisonnement conjectural lorsqu\u2019il a retenu le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante sur la base de son observation selon laquelle il est extr\u00eamement improbable qu\u2019une femme se trompe \u00e0 propos de la sensation d\u2019une p\u00e9n\u00e9tration p\u00e9no\u2011vaginale. En consid\u00e9rant les motifs dans leur ensemble et en contexte, le juge du proc\u00e8s n\u2019a pas rejet\u00e9 la th\u00e8se de la d\u00e9fense en raison de l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se selon laquelle aucune femme ne se tromperait, mais plut\u00f4t parce qu\u2019il a retenu le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante selon lequel la plaignante en question ne se trompait pas. La conclusion du juge du proc\u00e8s reposait sur son appr\u00e9ciation du t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante et aucune erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 commise. Dans le cas de T, la Cour d\u2019appel a fait erreur en concluant que l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation par la juge du proc\u00e8s de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de l\u2019accus\u00e9 et de la plaignante \u00e9tait irr\u00e9m\u00e9diablement vici\u00e9e par trois hypoth\u00e8ses infond\u00e9es importantes au sujet d\u2019un comportement normal. Les deux premi\u00e8res hypoth\u00e8ses \u00e9taient non pas des hypoth\u00e8ses, mais des \u00e9nonc\u00e9s qui refl\u00e9taient le raisonnement et les conclusions de fait de la juge du proc\u00e8s. La troisi\u00e8me hypoth\u00e8se \u00e9tait v\u00e9ritablement une hypoth\u00e8se qui \u00e9tait manifestement incorrecte. Toutefois, elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u00e9terminante, parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas eu d\u2019incidence sur le fond du constat de culpabilit\u00e9 auquel est arriv\u00e9e la juge du proc\u00e8s.\nLe juge Rowe : Les attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es fond\u00e9es sur le bon sens et l\u2019exp\u00e9rience humaine jouent un r\u00f4le indispensable dans le processus d\u2019appr\u00e9ciation des faits par les juges. Toutefois, le recours \u00e0 des attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es en mati\u00e8re criminelle n\u2019est pas illimit\u00e9, puisque certaines attentes ne sont pas n\u00e9cessairement des pr\u00e9dicteurs exacts ou fiables du comportement humain en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. La prolif\u00e9ration de d\u00e9cisions rendues par des cours d\u2019appel s\u2019interrogeant sur les limites de cette m\u00e9thode t\u00e9moigne de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019offrir certains rep\u00e8res en proposant un cadre d\u2019analyse clair et coh\u00e9rent en mati\u00e8re d\u2019examen en appel. Ce cadre se pr\u00e9sente sous forme de trois questions que devrait se poser une juridiction d\u2019appel lorsqu\u2019il est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que le juge du proc\u00e8s aurait commis une erreur de droit dans son raisonnement en se fondant sur des attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es dans le processus de recherche des faits : 1) Le juge du proc\u00e8s s\u2019est\u2011il appuy\u00e9 sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e dans son raisonnement? 2) Si le juge du proc\u00e8s s\u2019est appuy\u00e9 sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e, cette attente \u00e9tait\u2011elle raisonnable? 3) Le juge du proc\u00e8s s\u2019est\u2011il fond\u00e9 sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e comme s\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un fait d\u00e9terminant et incontestable?\nLa premi\u00e8re question est de savoir si le juge du proc\u00e8s s\u2019est appuy\u00e9 sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e dans son raisonnement. Si la juridiction d\u2019appel estime qu\u2019il s\u2019est bel et bien fond\u00e9 sur une telle attente, elle doit poursuivre l\u2019analyse en passant \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me question. Si le juge ne s\u2019est pas fond\u00e9 sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e \u2014 par exemple, lorsque sa conclusion reposait sur les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ou les faits qu\u2019il a retenus au proc\u00e8s \u2014, la recherche d\u2019une \u00e9ventuelle erreur dans le cadre de l\u2019analyse s\u2019arr\u00eate l\u00e0. \u00c0 ce stade de l\u2019analyse, la juridiction d\u2019appel ne cherche pas \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si une erreur a \u00e9t\u00e9 commise. En principe, le juge qui s\u2019appuie sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e comme point de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence logique pour appr\u00e9cier la preuve ne commet pas en soi d\u2019erreur de droit; il s\u2019agit plut\u00f4t d\u2019un aspect bien reconnu et n\u00e9cessaire du processus de recherche des faits par le juge. Pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re question, la juridiction d\u2019appel cherche simplement \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer ce que le juge du proc\u00e8s a r\u00e9ellement d\u00e9cid\u00e9, les raisons pour lesquelles il a rendu cette d\u00e9cision et s\u2019il y a lieu de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 un examen plus approfondi. Dans le cadre de cette analyse, chaque cas est un cas d\u2019esp\u00e8ce \u2014 la juridiction d\u2019appel doit se demander si les motifs, situ\u00e9s dans le contexte des questions en litige au proc\u00e8s et pris dans leur ensemble, permettent d\u2019expliquer ce qu\u2019a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 le juge du proc\u00e8s et les raisons pour lesquelles il l\u2019a fait, d\u2019une fa\u00e7on qui permet un examen efficace en appel. Les juridictions d\u2019appel ne doivent pas d\u00e9cortiquer avec finesse les motifs du juge du proc\u00e8s \u00e0 la recherche d\u2019une erreur.\nSi le juge du proc\u00e8s s\u2019est appuy\u00e9 sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e, la deuxi\u00e8me question est de savoir si cette attente \u00e9tait raisonnable. Le juge qui se fonde sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e d\u00e9raisonnable pour appr\u00e9cier la preuve commet une erreur de droit. Dans un proc\u00e8s criminel, on ne peut l\u00e9gitimement \u00e9valuer et interpr\u00e9ter la preuve en se fondant sur des attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es d\u00e9raisonnables sous pr\u00e9texte qu\u2019elles reposent sur le bon sens ou l\u2019exp\u00e9rience humaine collective. Une norme fond\u00e9e sur le caract\u00e8re raisonnable suppose une part d\u2019objectivit\u00e9 et de consensus social lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de pr\u00e9ciser la mesure dans laquelle un juge peut recourir au bon sens et \u00e0 l\u2019exp\u00e9rience humaine pour rendre sa d\u00e9cision, ce qui garantit que le juge des faits ne s\u2019appuie pas sur des attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es inexactes ou peu fiables. Une telle norme reconna\u00eet aussi qu\u2019\u00e0 mesure que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9volue, sa conception de ce qui est raisonnable peut changer. La confiance du public dans l\u2019administration de la justice et dans le processus d\u2019appr\u00e9ciation des faits exige que les juridictions d\u2019appel soient en mesure d\u2019intervenir lorsque le juge du proc\u00e8s a eu recours \u00e0 des attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es qui ne correspondent pas raisonnablement \u00e0 ce qu\u2019on consid\u00e8re comme vrai dans la plupart des circonstances et qui ne constituent pas un point de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence fiable pour \u00e9valuer la preuve. Toutefois, lorsque le juge du proc\u00e8s s\u2019est fond\u00e9 sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e raisonnable, la juridiction d\u2019appel ne doit pas intervenir pour modifier l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de la preuve par le juge faite en fonction de l\u2019attente en question simplement parce qu\u2019elle aurait tir\u00e9 une conclusion diff\u00e9rente.\nL\u2019examen en appel d\u2019une erreur de droit devrait aussi porter sur le caract\u00e8re raisonnable de toute attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e sur laquelle s\u2019est appuy\u00e9 le juge du proc\u00e8s. Les cat\u00e9gories d\u2019attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es sur lesquelles on ne peut, en droit, se fonder ne devraient pas se limiter \u00e0 celles qu\u2019on pourrait consid\u00e9rer comme des mythes ou des st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes ou au contexte des proc\u00e8s pour agressions sexuelles. Une d\u00e9marche aussi restrictive cr\u00e9erait des distinctions artificielles en droit, limiterait ind\u00fbment le r\u00f4le important que jouent les juridictions d\u2019appel dans le syst\u00e8me de justice p\u00e9nale et risquerait de miner la confiance du public dans l\u2019administration de la justice. Sur le plan conceptuel, la raison invoqu\u00e9e pour justifier le recours \u00e0 une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e est la m\u00eame, et ce, peu importe que l\u2019on consid\u00e8re l\u2019attente en cause comme un mythe, un st\u00e9r\u00e9otype ou comme autre chose. Il n\u2019existe aucune raison de principe justifiant de traiter s\u00e9par\u00e9ment diverses cat\u00e9gories d\u2019attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es. Proc\u00e9der ainsi risquerait de cr\u00e9er en droit des distinctions artificielles sans que la ligne de d\u00e9marcation entre elles soit clairement d\u00e9finie et ne tiendrait pas compte d\u2019attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es que l\u2019on ne peut qualifier \u00e0 juste titre de mythes ou de st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes concernant les plaignants dans les affaires d\u2019agressions sexuelles, mais que l\u2019on ne pourrait n\u00e9anmoins pas invoquer dans un proc\u00e8s criminel.\nTout recours \u00e0 des attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es d\u00e9raisonnables devrait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une erreur de droit. Ce point de vue est \u00e9tay\u00e9, d\u2019une part, par les raisons de principe pour lesquelles la juridiction d\u2019appel fait preuve de d\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des conclusions factuelles tir\u00e9es par le juge du proc\u00e8s et, d\u2019autre part, par le vaste pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire qui permet aux juridictions d\u2019appel d\u2019intervenir sur des questions de droit. La juridiction d\u2019appel fait preuve de retenue \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des conclusions tir\u00e9es par le juge du proc\u00e8s sur des questions de fait pour au moins les trois grandes raisons de principe suivantes : 1) r\u00e9duire le nombre, la dur\u00e9e et le co\u00fbt des appels; 2) favoriser l\u2019autonomie du proc\u00e8s et son int\u00e9grit\u00e9; 3) reconna\u00eetre l\u2019expertise du juge du proc\u00e8s et sa position avantageuse pour \u00e9valuer la preuve. Le fait d\u2019appliquer la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte \u00e0 l\u2019examen d\u2019attentes d\u00e9raisonnables aurait peu d\u2019incidence sur ces raisons de principe. Le souci de pr\u00e9server les ressources publiques et de favoriser l\u2019autonomie et l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 des proc\u00e8s est secondaire par rapport aux droits de l\u2019accus\u00e9 dans une proc\u00e9dure p\u00e9nale, compte tenu des int\u00e9r\u00eats en jeu et de la d\u00e9cision du l\u00e9gislateur d\u2019accorder un droit d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e9largi \u00e0 un premier niveau d\u2019appel. C\u2019est la reconnaissance de l\u2019expertise et de la position avantageuse du juge du proc\u00e8s qui constitue la principale raison \u00e0 la base de la d\u00e9f\u00e9rence dont les cours d\u2019appel doivent faire preuve \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des questions de fait dans le contexte des proc\u00e9dures p\u00e9nales; les juges du proc\u00e8s ne sont cependant pas plus exp\u00e9riment\u00e9s ou dans une position plus avantageuse que les juges d\u2019appel pour d\u00e9terminer s\u2019ils ont affaire \u00e0 une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e raisonnable fond\u00e9e sur le bon sens ou l\u2019exp\u00e9rience humaine, car la raison pour laquelle ces attentes sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement cens\u00e9es \u00eatre fiables est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment parce qu\u2019elles sont r\u00e9pandues ou qu\u2019elles correspondent aux exp\u00e9riences communes de toute la collectivit\u00e9.\nLe r\u00f4le premier des cours d\u2019appel est de pr\u00e9ciser et de raffiner les r\u00e8gles de droit et de veiller \u00e0 leur application universelle. Elles disposent donc d\u2019un vaste pouvoir d\u2019examen sur les questions de droit, qui exigent des r\u00e9ponses claires et coh\u00e9rentes afin de maintenir la confiance du public dans l\u2019administration de la justice. Toute conception de l\u2019examen en appel qui minimise l\u2019importance du r\u00f4le des juridictions d\u2019appel compromettrait s\u00e9rieusement le syst\u00e8me de justice p\u00e9nale. Le fait de qualifier une question de question de droit rev\u00eat \u00e9galement de l\u2019importance pour fonder la comp\u00e9tence de la cour d\u2019appel en mati\u00e8re criminelle, sp\u00e9cialement en ce qui concerne les moyens limit\u00e9s permettant \u00e0 la Couronne d\u2019interjeter appel d\u2019un verdict d\u2019acquittement. Si le caract\u00e8re raisonnable d\u2019une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e \u00e9tait consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une question de fait, la Couronne ne pourrait jamais interjeter appel d\u2019un verdict d\u2019acquittement fond\u00e9 sur des attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es qui ne constituent pas des mythes ou des st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes, et ce, peu importe \u00e0 quel point ces attentes seraient d\u00e9raisonnables ou contraires aux attentes collectives de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. L\u2019importance de pr\u00e9server la confiance du public dans l\u2019administration de la justice exige que, dans les affaires criminelles, les verdicts ne soient pas fond\u00e9s sur des hypoth\u00e8ses qui ne refl\u00e8tent pas raisonnablement la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 dans la plupart des cas. La norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte exige d\u2019\u00e9noncer express\u00e9ment un raisonnement diff\u00e9rent et de d\u00e9montrer pourquoi il devrait \u00eatre suivi. Appliqu\u00e9e comme il se doit, la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte demande une clart\u00e9 conceptuelle et une rigueur analytique accrues. En revanche, la norme de contr\u00f4le de l\u2019erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante peut servir \u00e0 mauvais escient pour g\u00e9n\u00e9rer une bo\u00eete noire d\u00e9cisionnelle qui facilite la prise de d\u00e9cisions ad hoc, par laquelle, si la Cour d\u2019appel consent \u00e0 ce qu\u2019a fait le juge du proc\u00e8s, elle fait preuve de d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, mais si elle pr\u00e9f\u00e8re une autre issue, elle conclut que la d\u00e9cision du juge du proc\u00e8s est entach\u00e9e d\u2019une erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante et y substitue son issue pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e.\nEnfin, la troisi\u00e8me question est de savoir si le juge du proc\u00e8s s\u2019est fond\u00e9 sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e comme s\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un fait d\u00e9terminant et incontestable. Les juges du proc\u00e8s disposent d\u2019une latitude consid\u00e9rable pour recourir \u00e0 des attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es raisonnables comme point de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence logique pour appr\u00e9cier la preuve, et une juridiction d\u2019appel ne doit pas intervenir pour modifier l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de la preuve du juge simplement parce qu\u2019elle aurait tir\u00e9 une conclusion diff\u00e9rente. Le recours \u00e0 une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e, m\u00eame raisonnable, est toutefois assujetti \u00e0 d\u2019importantes limites : le juge du proc\u00e8s ne peut pas consid\u00e9rer l\u2019attente en question comme constituant en soi un fait d\u00e9terminant et incontestable, au point de ne pas tenir compte de la preuve ou d\u2019en faire abstraction. Cela s\u2019explique par le fait qu\u2019il est toujours possible que les gens agissent contrairement \u00e0 ce \u00e0 quoi l\u2019on s\u2019attendrait normalement d\u2019eux selon le bon sens ou l\u2019exp\u00e9rience humaine. Il est donc du devoir du juge du proc\u00e8s de d\u00e9terminer ce qui s\u2019est r\u00e9ellement pass\u00e9, et de le faire en se fondant sur la preuve. Les attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019exp\u00e9rience humaine et le bon sens ne sont qu\u2019un des \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui aident le juge \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter la preuve; l\u2019analyse doit toutefois demeurer ax\u00e9e sur la preuve. Commet une erreur de droit le juge qui ne tient pas compte de l\u2019ensemble de la preuve pour trancher la question fondamentale de la culpabilit\u00e9 ou de l\u2019innocence de l\u2019accus\u00e9 ou qui tire une conclusion de fait en l\u2019absence de preuve. En r\u00e9alit\u00e9, le juge du proc\u00e8s qui s\u2019appuie sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e comme s\u2019il s\u2019agissait en soi d\u2019une conclusion de fait en prend connaissance d\u2019office, ce qui commande l\u2019application d\u2019un test rigoureux \u2014 auquel on ne peut que rarement, voire jamais, satisfaire en s\u2019appuyant sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e sur les gens, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9e la grande diversit\u00e9 d\u2019exp\u00e9riences et de comportements humains. Et la conclusion factuelle qui n\u2019est fond\u00e9e ni sur la preuve ni sur la connaissance d\u2019office rel\u00e8ve de la conjecture, ce qui constitue une erreur de droit.\nAppliquant ces principes aux pr\u00e9sentes causes, les pourvois devraient \u00eatre accueillis et les verdicts de culpabilit\u00e9 r\u00e9tablis. Dans l\u2019affaire de K, en ce qui concerne la premi\u00e8re question du cadre d\u2019analyse, le juge du proc\u00e8s s\u2019est appuy\u00e9 sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e concernant la probabilit\u00e9 qu\u2019une femme se m\u00e9prenne au sujet de la sensation d\u2019une p\u00e9n\u00e9tration vaginale. Au regard de la deuxi\u00e8me question du cadre d\u2019analyse, il s\u2019agit d\u2019une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e raisonnable concernant la perception g\u00e9n\u00e9rale chez les \u00eatres humains qu\u2019une femme soit peu susceptible de se m\u00e9prendre sur la sensation d\u2019une p\u00e9n\u00e9tration vaginale, puisqu\u2019un acte sexuel de cette nature aurait un impact profond et traumatisant sur l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 corporelle d\u2019une personne, et les gens ordinaires n\u2019auraient g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas besoin de connaissances particuli\u00e8res de cet aspect de la perception humaine pour \u00eatre en mesure d\u2019\u00e9valuer ce type de t\u00e9moignage. Pour ce qui est de la troisi\u00e8me question du cadre d\u2019analyse, le juge du proc\u00e8s n\u2019a pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 cette perception comme un fait incontestable. Il s\u2019en est plut\u00f4t servi comme point de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour appr\u00e9cier le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de l\u2019ensemble de la preuve. Il n\u2019y avait donc aucun motif justifiant l\u2019intervention de la Cour d\u2019appel.\nDans le cas de T, la Cour d\u2019appel a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 tort que la juge du proc\u00e8s s\u2019\u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des deux premi\u00e8res hypoth\u00e8ses, alors que, en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, elle \u00e9valuait l\u2019ensemble de la preuve. Cela a men\u00e9 la Cour d\u2019appel \u00e0 sortir du cadre de ses attributions pour proc\u00e9der \u00e0 un r\u00e9examen de la preuve. Au regard de la troisi\u00e8me hypoth\u00e8se, la juge du proc\u00e8s s\u2019\u00e9tait effectivement tromp\u00e9e en se fondant sur une attente d\u00e9raisonnable concernant la fa\u00e7on dont les gens se comportent habituellement apr\u00e8s avoir eu des rapports sexuels consensuels. En ce qui concerne la deuxi\u00e8me question du cadre d\u2019analyse, il est d\u00e9raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 voir un lien logique entre le fait pour une personne d\u2019attendre que son partenaire sexuel soit rentr\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur et le caract\u00e8re consensuel ou non de la rencontre qu\u2019ils viennent d\u2019avoir. N\u00e9anmoins, cette erreur de droit \u00e9tait \u00e0 ce point inoffensive ou n\u00e9gligeable qu\u2019elle ne pouvait avoir d\u2019incidence sur le verdict, puisque celui qu\u2019a rendu la juge du proc\u00e8s reposait clairement sur son \u00e9valuation favorable de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de la plaignante, ainsi que sur son rejet complet du t\u00e9moignage de T au motif qu\u2019il \u00e9tait incompatible avec le d\u00e9roulement de la soir\u00e9e et avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9 de toutes pi\u00e8ces pour expliquer les blessures de la plaignante.\nJurisprudence\nCit\u00e9e par la juge Martin\nArr\u00eats rejet\u00e9s : R. c.

Introduction\n[1] Les pr\u00e9sents pourvois dans deux affaires relatives \u00e0 des agressions sexuelles concernent la norme d\u2019intervention en appel applicable aux conclusions tir\u00e9es par le juge du proc\u00e8s sur la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et la fiabilit\u00e9 dans un proc\u00e8s criminel et le r\u00f4le que doit jouer le bon sens lors de l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de la d\u00e9position de t\u00e9moins. Les intim\u00e9s demandent \u00e0 la Cour de reconna\u00eetre une nouvelle r\u00e8gle appel\u00e9e la \u00ab r\u00e8gle interdisant le recours \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques infond\u00e9es \u00bb. La violation de cette r\u00e8gle propos\u00e9e fournirait un nouveau fondement justifiant \u00e0 lui seul l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et de la fiabilit\u00e9 selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte, chaque fois qu\u2019une juridiction d\u2019appel d\u00e9termine qu\u2019un juge du proc\u00e8s a eu recours \u00e0 une hypoth\u00e8se logique qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas fond\u00e9e sur la preuve. Cette rupture importante avec les normes de contr\u00f4le \u00e9tablies concernant l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et de la fiabilit\u00e9 dans les affaires criminelles a \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9e par certaines juridictions d\u2019appel \u2014 souvent dans des affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle qui reposent sur les versions contradictoires de l\u2019accus\u00e9 et de la personne plaignante.\n[2] Pour les motifs qui suivent, un tel changement au droit n\u2019est pas justifi\u00e9 et je refuse de reconna\u00eetre la r\u00e8gle interdisant le recours \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques infond\u00e9es comme donnant lieu \u00e0 une erreur de droit. Les normes actuelles selon lesquelles les juridictions d\u2019appel r\u00e9visent les jugements de premi\u00e8re instance sont bien con\u00e7ues, \u00e9tablies depuis longtemps et favorisent une juste appr\u00e9ciation des t\u00e9moignages. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019\u00e9laborer une nouvelle r\u00e8gle de droit interdisant le recours \u00e0 toute hypoth\u00e8se non fond\u00e9e sur des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9cis dans le dossier afin de tenter d\u2019obtenir le r\u00e9sultat auquel parviennent d\u00e9j\u00e0 les r\u00e8gles existantes. De plus, la r\u00e8gle propos\u00e9e n\u2019est pas un prolongement coh\u00e9rent des erreurs de droit existantes se rapportant aux mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00e0 l\u2019endroit des personnes qui portent plainte pour agression sexuelle. L\u2019adoption de cette r\u00e8gle minerait l\u2019approche flexible et fonctionnelle \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019intervention en appel et causerait des pr\u00e9judices dans l\u2019ensemble du droit criminel.\n[3] Les normes de contr\u00f4le et les r\u00e8gles de preuve actuelles continueront de s\u2019appliquer au contr\u00f4le du recours fautif \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques dans les proc\u00e8s criminels. Dans certains cas, le recours au bon sens par le juge du proc\u00e8s sera susceptible de contr\u00f4le en appel parce qu\u2019il r\u00e9v\u00e8le des erreurs de droit reconnues. Autrement, comme toute autre conclusion de fait, l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et de la fiabilit\u00e9 \u2014 et tout recours aux hypoth\u00e8ses logiques qui y sont inh\u00e9rentes \u2014 sera susceptible de r\u00e9vision seulement en cas d\u2019erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante. Cette norme est mieux adapt\u00e9e \u00e0 la t\u00e2che que la nouvelle erreur de droit que proposent les intim\u00e9s.\n[4] Dans les deux affaires dont nous sommes saisis, la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie\u2011Britannique a infirm\u00e9 les d\u00e9clarations de culpabilit\u00e9 pour agression sexuelle sur la base d\u2019erreurs de droit all\u00e9gu\u00e9es dans les appr\u00e9ciations de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et de la fiabilit\u00e9 par les juges du proc\u00e8s. Se fondant sur la r\u00e8gle interdisant le recours \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques infond\u00e9es, la Cour d\u2019appel a conclu que les juges du proc\u00e8s avaient commis des erreurs de droit en formulant des hypoth\u00e8ses sur le comportement humain qui ne reposaient pas sur la preuve. Puisque je rejette cette nouvelle erreur de droit, j\u2019appr\u00e9cierais les conclusions des juges du proc\u00e8s selon la norme de l\u2019erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante. Je conclus que leurs conclusions sur la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et la fiabilit\u00e9 ne comportaient aucune erreur de ce genre. Par cons\u00e9quent, je suis d\u2019avis d\u2019accueillir les deux pourvois et de r\u00e9tablir les d\u00e9clarations de culpabilit\u00e9.\nII. Contexte\nA. Monsieur Kruk\n[5] L\u2019intim\u00e9 Christopher James Kruk a \u00e9t\u00e9 accus\u00e9 d\u2019agression sexuelle sur la base d\u2019une all\u00e9gation de p\u00e9n\u00e9tration p\u00e9no\u2011vaginale non consensuelle. La principale question au proc\u00e8s \u00e9tait celle de savoir si l\u2019activit\u00e9 sexuelle avait eu lieu, et la r\u00e9ponse reposait presque enti\u00e8rement sur l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation par le juge du proc\u00e8s de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de M. Kruk et de la fiabilit\u00e9 de la plaignante.\n[6] Monsieur Kruk a trouv\u00e9 la plaignante alors qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait en \u00e9tat d\u2019\u00e9bri\u00e9t\u00e9, perdue et boulevers\u00e9e un soir au centre\u2011ville de Vancouver. Il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de l\u2019emmener chez lui et a communiqu\u00e9 avec les parents de celle\u2011ci par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. La plaignante ne se souvient pas beaucoup de ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9 ensuite, mais elle a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que lorsqu\u2019elle s\u2019est r\u00e9veill\u00e9e, elle ne portait plus de pantalon et M. Kruk \u00e9tait sur elle, son p\u00e9nis dans son vagin. Monsieur Kruk a ni\u00e9 ces faits; il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la plaignante, apr\u00e8s avoir renvers\u00e9 un verre d\u2019eau sur elle, est all\u00e9e dans sa chambre pour se changer et il l\u2019a trouv\u00e9e \u00e9vanouie sur son lit avec son pantalon autour des chevilles. Il a affirm\u00e9 que lorsqu\u2019il a tent\u00e9 de la r\u00e9veiller, elle a sursaut\u00e9 et a d\u00fb supposer le pire, parce qu\u2019elle s\u2019est d\u00e9barrass\u00e9 de son pantalon et s\u2019est mise \u00e0 courir en panique dans la maison.\n(1) D\u00e9cision de premi\u00e8re instance, 2020 BCSC 1480\n[7] Le juge du proc\u00e8s a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 M. Kruk coupable d\u2019agression sexuelle. Il n\u2019a pas cru M. Kruk et a rejet\u00e9 son t\u00e9moignage sur de multiples points en raison d\u2019importantes incoh\u00e9rences. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, le juge du proc\u00e8s a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019explication de M. Kruk concernant la nudit\u00e9 partielle de la plaignante \u00e0 son r\u00e9veil et a \u00ab cat\u00e9goriquement rejet\u00e9 \u00bb sa pr\u00e9tention selon laquelle il avait communiqu\u00e9 avec la famille de la plaignante pour qu\u2019elle se rende chez elle en toute s\u00e9curit\u00e9. En revanche, le juge du proc\u00e8s a estim\u00e9 que le r\u00e9cit de la plaignante \u00e9tait en grande partie peu fiable \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 son \u00e9tat d\u2019\u00e9bri\u00e9t\u00e9 et ses [traduction] \u00ab blancs de m\u00e9moire consid\u00e9rables \u00bb (par. 48 (CanLII)). Toutefois, le juge du proc\u00e8s a accept\u00e9 son t\u00e9moignage concernant l\u2019essentiel de l\u2019all\u00e9gation d\u2019agression sexuelle \u2014 soit qu\u2019elle a senti le p\u00e9nis de M. Kruk dans son vagin :\n[traduction] Le t\u00e9moignage [de la plaignante] est d\u00e9pourvu de d\u00e9tail, mais elle soutient \u00eatre certaine de ne pas se tromper. Elle a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait senti le p\u00e9nis de [M. Kruk] en elle et qu\u2019elle savait ce qu\u2019elle ressentait. Bref, son sens du toucher \u00e9tait sollicit\u00e9. Il est extr\u00eamement improbable qu\u2019une femme se trompe sur cette sensation. [Je souligne; par. 68.]\n[8] Le juge du proc\u00e8s a aussi conclu qu\u2019il y avait des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve circonstancielle importants compatibles avec un rapport sexuel, ce qui constituait une autre raison d\u2019accepter la version de la plaignante et de rejeter celle de M. Kruk. \u00c0 un certain moment, pendant que la plaignante se trouvait dans la chambre \u00e0 coucher de M. Kruk, ce dernier a enlev\u00e9 ses propres v\u00eatements et a rev\u00eatu un maillot de bain. Le pantalon de la plaignante avait \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e8tement enlev\u00e9, et le juge du proc\u00e8s a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que l\u2019id\u00e9e qu\u2019elle l\u2019ait fait elle\u2011m\u00eame \u00e9tait \u00ab absurde \u00bb compte tenu de son \u00e9tat d\u2019\u00e9bri\u00e9t\u00e9. Enfin, les relev\u00e9s t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques admis au proc\u00e8s r\u00e9v\u00e9laient qu\u2019apr\u00e8s leur conversation initiale avec M. Kruk, les parents de la plaignante ont appel\u00e9 et text\u00e9 ce dernier \u00e0 maintes reprises et il n\u2019a pas r\u00e9pondu. Eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble des circonstances, le juge du proc\u00e8s a estim\u00e9 que le d\u00e9faut de M. Kruk de communiquer avec les parents de la plaignante \u00e9tait compatible avec une intention de profiter d\u2019elle sexuellement alors qu\u2019elle se trouvait dans un \u00e9tat d\u2019extr\u00eame vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9.\n(2) D\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie\u2011Britannique, 2022 BCCA 18\n[9] La Cour d\u2019appel a annul\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019unanimit\u00e9 la d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 de M. Kruk et ordonn\u00e9 la tenue d\u2019un nouveau proc\u00e8s. Elle a not\u00e9 que, m\u00eame si le juge du proc\u00e8s peut se fonder sur des exp\u00e9riences de vie personnelles pour appr\u00e9cier la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moins, il [traduction] \u00ab doit prendre soin [. . .] \u201cd\u2019\u00e9viter les raisonnements conjecturaux qui font appel \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses \u02bblogiques\u02bc non \u00e9tay\u00e9es par la preuve\u201d \u00bb (par. 41 (CanLII), citant R. c. Roth, 2020 BCCA 240, 66 C.R. (7th) 107, par. 65). La conclusion du juge du proc\u00e8s sur l\u2019improbabilit\u00e9 qu\u2019une personne plaignante (\u00ab une femme \u00bb) se m\u00e9prenne quant \u00e0 la sensation de la p\u00e9n\u00e9tration p\u00e9no-vaginale \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur un raisonnement conjectural et ne relevait pas de la connaissance d\u2019office, faisant appel \u00e0 [traduction] \u00ab des questions de neurologie (le fonctionnement du syst\u00e8me sensoriel du corps humain), de physiologie (l\u2019effet de l\u2019alcool sur la perception, la m\u00e9moire et le syst\u00e8me sensoriel du corps humain) et de psychiatrie (l\u2019effet de l\u2019alcool et\/ou d\u2019un traumatisme sur la perception et la m\u00e9moire) \u00bb (par. 65 et 67). Puisque la conclusion du juge du proc\u00e8s concernant la p\u00e9n\u00e9tration \u00e9tait consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant la raison principale pour laquelle il avait donn\u00e9 foi au t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante, la cour a conclu que le raisonnement du juge du proc\u00e8s avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fatalement entach\u00e9 d\u2019une erreur de droit.\nB. Monsieur Tsang\n[10] L\u2019intim\u00e9 Edwin Tsang a \u00e9t\u00e9 accus\u00e9 d\u2019agression sexuelle sur la base d\u2019une all\u00e9gation de fellation non consensuelle, de p\u00e9n\u00e9tration vaginale et anale avec les doigts et de p\u00e9n\u00e9tration p\u00e9no\u2011vaginale. Bien que les versions des parties sur les activit\u00e9s sexuelles qui avaient eu lieu divergeaient aussi, la question principale \u00e9tait le consentement, qui reposait essentiellement sur la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 autant de la plaignante que de l\u2019accus\u00e9.\n[11] La plaignante et M. Tsang se sont rencontr\u00e9s lors d\u2019un festival de musique auquel celle\u2011ci assistait en compagnie d\u2019une amie, et les trois se sont ensuite rendus \u00e0 une apr\u00e8s\u2011soir\u00e9e dans une bo\u00eete de nuit au centre\u2011ville de Vancouver, o\u00f9 ils ont dans\u00e9 et bu. Monsieur Tsang a ensuite offert \u00e0 la plaignante de la reconduire chez elle en voiture, et en chemin, ils se sont arr\u00eat\u00e9s dans un stationnement. Ils ont pris place sur la banquette arri\u00e8re et la plaignante a consenti \u00e0 embrasser M. Tsang. Les t\u00e9moignages de la plaignante et de M. Tsang divergent consid\u00e9rablement quant \u00e0 la suite des \u00e9v\u00e9nements. La plaignante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que M. Tsang, sans qu\u2019elle y consente, l\u2019a forc\u00e9e \u00e0 lui faire une fellation, a ins\u00e9r\u00e9 ses doigts dans son vagin et son anus et l\u2019a contrainte \u00e0 avoir une relation sexuelle vaginale. Monsieur Tsang a plut\u00f4t affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019ils se sont livr\u00e9s \u00e0 une fellation et \u00e0 une p\u00e9n\u00e9tration avec les doigts consensuelles et brutales, et que la plaignante avait \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019instigatrice du rapport sexuel et avait particip\u00e9 activement \u00e0 celui\u2011ci. Il a \u00e9galement ni\u00e9 avoir eu un rapport sexuel vaginal ou s\u2019\u00eatre livr\u00e9 \u00e0 une p\u00e9n\u00e9tration anale.\n[12] Le lendemain de l\u2019agression all\u00e9gu\u00e9e, la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e par une m\u00e9decin sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e dans les examens apr\u00e8s une agression sexuelle, qui a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 comme experte lors du proc\u00e8s. La m\u00e9decin a not\u00e9 des l\u00e9sions consid\u00e9rables dans la r\u00e9gion g\u00e9nitale de la plaignante, notamment une d\u00e9chirure dans l\u2019ouverture de ses organes g\u00e9nitaux que l\u2019on ne voit habituellement qu\u2019apr\u00e8s un accouchement.\n(1) D\u00e9cision de premi\u00e8re instance, 2020 BCPC 306\n[13] La juge du proc\u00e8s a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 M. Tsang coupable d\u2019agression sexuelle. Elle a reconnu que la plaignante avait consenti \u00e0 prendre place sur la banquette arri\u00e8re de la voiture et \u00e0 embrasser M. Tsang, mais elle a rejet\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage de celui\u2011ci selon lequel les actes sexuels ult\u00e9rieurs avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 consensuels, qu\u2019elle a jug\u00e9 contraire aux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve auxquels elle avait donn\u00e9 foi. \u00c0 son avis, le t\u00e9moignage de M. Tsang semblait invent\u00e9 de toutes pi\u00e8ces, comme s\u2019il d\u00e9crivait la fa\u00e7on dont une telle rencontre aurait pu se d\u00e9rouler selon lui plut\u00f4t que ce qui s\u2019\u00e9tait r\u00e9ellement pass\u00e9. Elle n\u2019a pas cru non plus M. Tsang lorsqu\u2019il a affirm\u00e9 que la plaignante avait \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019instigatrice de chaque \u00e9tape du rapport sexuel, concluant plut\u00f4t que celui\u2011ci avait domin\u00e9 et contr\u00f4l\u00e9 la plaignante et \u00ab organis\u00e9 \u00bb ce qui s\u2019\u00e9tait pass\u00e9. En revanche, la juge a conclu que la plaignante \u00e9tait cr\u00e9dible et fiable et a jug\u00e9 que la preuve de la Couronne, qui reposait en grande partie sur son t\u00e9moignage, ne soulevait aucun doute raisonnable. La juge a conclu que M. Tsang savait que la plaignante n\u2019\u00e9tait pas consentante d\u00e8s qu\u2019il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 la forcer \u00e0 lui faire une fellation, et l\u2019a donc d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable d\u2019agression sexuelle.\n[14] La juge du proc\u00e8s a tir\u00e9 trois conclusions de fait qui sont devenues cruciales en appel. Premi\u00e8rement, il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas cr\u00e9dible que la plaignante ait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Tsang de lui donner une fess\u00e9e et qu\u2019elle [traduction] \u00ab se pr\u00e9parait \u00e0 se livrer \u00e0 des actes sexuels brutaux \u00bb (par. 126 (CanLII)). Deuxi\u00e8mement, l\u2019explication de M. Tsang selon laquelle ils n\u2019avaient pas eu de rapports sexuels vaginaux parce qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas trouv\u00e9 de condom \u00e9tait fallacieuse et incompatible avec le degr\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le qu\u2019il avait exerc\u00e9 sur toutes leurs interactions ce soir\u2011l\u00e0 et en cour. Troisi\u00e8mement, le d\u00e9part pr\u00e9cipit\u00e9 de M. Tsang une fois qu\u2019il eut d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la plaignante chez son amie \u00e9tait compatible avec la perp\u00e9tration d\u2019une agression sexuelle.\n(2) D\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie\u2011Britannique, 2022 BCCA 345, 419 C.C.C. (3d) 187\n[15] La Cour d\u2019appel a annul\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019unanimit\u00e9 la d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 de M. Tsang et ordonn\u00e9 la tenue d\u2019un nouveau proc\u00e8s. La cour a conclu que la juge du proc\u00e8s avait formul\u00e9 trois hypoth\u00e8ses concernant le comportement humain qui ont eu une incidence sur son appr\u00e9ciation de la preuve : (1) une personne ne demanderait pas \u00ab de but en blanc \u00bb \u00e0 recevoir une fess\u00e9e pendant des pr\u00e9liminaires sexuels; (2) une personne contr\u00f4lante ne s\u2019abstiendrait pas de se livrer \u00e0 des rapports sexuels vaginaux parce qu\u2019elle ne pouvait pas trouver de condom; et (3) une personne ne quitterait pas abruptement et cavali\u00e8rement la personne avec laquelle elle vient d\u2019avoir des rapports sexuels consensuels. Se fondant sur la r\u00e8gle interdisant le recours \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques infond\u00e9es, la cour a conclu que ces g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisations n\u2019\u00e9taient pas \u00e9tay\u00e9es par la preuve et faisaient appel \u00e0 un raisonnement conjectural, et constituaient donc des erreurs de droit susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre r\u00e9vis\u00e9es en appel. La cour a aussi conclu que ces erreurs \u00e9taient importantes, puisque la juge n\u2019aurait pas n\u00e9cessairement rejet\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage de M. Tsang sans commettre d\u2019erreur de droit.\nIII. Analyse\n[16] \u00c0 la fois dans le cas de M. Kruk et de M. Tsang, la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie\u2011Britannique a examin\u00e9 les conclusions des juges du proc\u00e8s sur la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et la fiabilit\u00e9 selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 cette approche, les intim\u00e9s demandent maintenant \u00e0 la Cour de reconna\u00eetre que la r\u00e8gle propos\u00e9e interdisant le recours \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques infond\u00e9es donne lieu \u00e0 une erreur de droit.\n[17] Les pr\u00e9sents pourvois font partie d\u2019un ensemble plus large de causes o\u00f9 des r\u00e8gles sp\u00e9ciales ont \u00e9t\u00e9 propos\u00e9es pour l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et de la fiabilit\u00e9 dans les cas d\u2019agressions sexuelles[1]. La Cour est saisie de la r\u00e8gle interdisant le recours \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques infond\u00e9es pour la premi\u00e8re fois, et la question de savoir s\u2019il convient de l\u2019adopter devrait \u00eatre abord\u00e9e en fonction des principes de base concernant l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et de la fiabilit\u00e9 et des normes actuelles de contr\u00f4le. Lorsque la r\u00e8gle entre en jeu dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle en particulier, des imp\u00e9ratifs constitutionnels commandent la prise en consid\u00e9ration des droits garantis par la Charte des personnes accus\u00e9es et des personnes plaignantes, ainsi que des int\u00e9r\u00eats de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral (R. c. Mills, [1999] 3 R.C.S. 668; R. c. Darrach, 2000 CSC 46, [2000] 2 R.C.S. 443; R. c. J.J., 2022 CSC 28). Cette approche fait partie de l\u2019obligation de viser [traduction] \u00ab le jugement \u00e9quitable, \u00e9thique et non discriminatoire des affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle \u00bb (D. M. Tanovich, \u00ab Regulating Inductive Reasoning in Sexual Assault Cases \u00bb, dans B. L. Berger, E. Cunliffe et J. Stribopoulos, dir., To Ensure that Justice is Done : Essays in Memory of Marc Rosenberg (2017), 73, p. 95).\n[18] Les pr\u00e9sents motifs sont r\u00e9dig\u00e9s de la fa\u00e7on suivante. D\u2019abord, j\u2019explore les origines et le traitement de la r\u00e8gle propos\u00e9e. Ensuite, j\u2019explique pourquoi celle\u2011ci ne devrait pas \u00eatre reconnue comme donnant lieu \u00e0 une erreur de droit. Enfin, en appliquant les bons principes juridiques aux deux affaires en appel, je conclus que le juge du proc\u00e8s dans le cas de M. Kruk n\u2019a commis aucune erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante et que, m\u00eame si la juge du proc\u00e8s dans le cas de M. Tsang s\u2019est fond\u00e9e sur une g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisation manifestement erron\u00e9e, l\u2019erreur n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u00e9terminante.\nA. La r\u00e8gle propos\u00e9e interdisant le recours \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques infond\u00e9es\n[19] La r\u00e8gle propos\u00e9e interdisant le recours \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques infond\u00e9es tire son origine d\u2019une trilogie de causes cl\u00e9s \u2014 R. c. Perkins, 2007 ONCA 585, 223 C.C.C. (3d) 289; R. c. Cepic, 2019 ONCA 541, 376 C.C.C. (3d) 286; et Roth \u2014 et a \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9e plus clairement et r\u00e9cemment dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. J.C., 2021 ONCA 131, 401 C.C.C. (3d) 433. Dans le cas de M. Kruk, la Cour d\u2019appel a mentionn\u00e9 la trilogie de causes et a express\u00e9ment cit\u00e9 la r\u00e8gle telle qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9e par la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie\u2011Britannique dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Roth, alors que dans le cas de M. Tsang, la Cour d\u2019appel s\u2019est appuy\u00e9e sur la r\u00e8gle telle qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat J.C.\n[20] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Perkins, la Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Ontario s\u2019est dite d\u2019avis que la conclusion du juge du proc\u00e8s selon laquelle un [traduction] \u00ab jeune homme viril avec une \u00e9rection compl\u00e8te en voie d\u2019avoir un orgasme ne perdrait pas son \u00e9rection \u00bb ne constituait pas une utilisation acceptable du bon sens, mais \u00e9tait plut\u00f4t une conclusion non fond\u00e9e sur la preuve qui allait au\u2011del\u00e0 de la connaissance d\u2019office (par. 35\u201136; voir aussi le par. 40). Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Cepic, la Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Ontario a conclu que la qualification par la juge du proc\u00e8s du t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019accus\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant [traduction] \u00ab peu plausible \u00bb et \u00ab d\u00e9nu\u00e9 de sens \u00bb n\u2019\u00e9tait pas fond\u00e9e sur la preuve et t\u00e9moignait du recours \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses erron\u00e9es concernant ce que ferait une jeune femme et \u00e0 des st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019agressivit\u00e9 masculine (par. 19\u201127). Tant l\u2019arr\u00eat Perkins que l\u2019arr\u00eat Cepic ont \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9s par la suite dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Roth, au par. 65, o\u00f9 la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie\u2011Britannique a formul\u00e9 la r\u00e8gle suivante : [traduction] \u00ab . . . bien que les juges soient autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 s\u2019appuyer sur leur exp\u00e9rience humaine pour juger de la plausibilit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9position d\u2019un t\u00e9moin, ils doivent s\u2019abstenir d\u2019adopter un raisonnement conjectural qui fait appel \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses \u201clogiques\u201d non fond\u00e9es sur la preuve . . . \u00bb La cour a ensuite conclu que la juge du proc\u00e8s avait commis une erreur en se fondant sur l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se selon laquelle l\u2019accus\u00e9, [traduction] \u00ab un jeune homme en forme et en sant\u00e9 qui faisait r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement de l\u2019exercice et s\u2019entra\u00eenait comme dynamophile \u00bb (par. 56), ne se serait pas endormi pendant un trajet en taxi, ce qui a erron\u00e9ment men\u00e9 la juge du proc\u00e8s \u00e0 rejeter le r\u00e9cit de l\u2019accus\u00e9.\n[21] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat J.C., le juge du proc\u00e8s avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 l\u2019accus\u00e9 coupable d\u2019agression sexuelle et d\u2019extorsion, et avait accept\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante selon lequel l\u2019accus\u00e9 avait menac\u00e9 de publier en ligne un enregistrement vid\u00e9o d\u2019elle \u00e0 caract\u00e8re sexuel si elle ne poursuivait pas sa relation \u00e0 caract\u00e8re sexuel avec lui. En appel, l\u2019accus\u00e9 a soutenu que le juge du proc\u00e8s avait commis deux erreurs dans son appr\u00e9ciation de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9. Premi\u00e8rement, selon l\u2019accus\u00e9, le juge du proc\u00e8s s\u2019\u00e9tait fond\u00e9 \u00e0 tort sur un st\u00e9r\u00e9otype pour rejeter son t\u00e9moignage selon lequel il avait express\u00e9ment demand\u00e9 le consentement de la plaignante avant de se livrer \u00e0 des actes sexuels pr\u00e9cis \u2014 le juge du proc\u00e8s avait conclu que le t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019accus\u00e9 \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab trop parfait, trop m\u00e9canique, trop r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 et trop politiquement correct pour \u00eatre cru \u00bb (par. 4). Deuxi\u00e8mement, l\u2019accus\u00e9 a soutenu que le juge du proc\u00e8s s\u2019\u00e9tait m\u00e9pris en consid\u00e9rant la th\u00e9orie de la d\u00e9fense selon laquelle la plaignante avait invent\u00e9 les all\u00e9gations pour cacher qu\u2019elle trompait son petit ami comme \u00e9tant fond\u00e9e sur un st\u00e9r\u00e9otype, alors que, dans les faits, elle \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur la preuve.\n[22] La Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Ontario, \u00e0 l\u2019unanimit\u00e9, a accueilli l\u2019appel, annul\u00e9 les d\u00e9clarations de culpabilit\u00e9 et ordonn\u00e9 la tenue d\u2019un nouveau proc\u00e8s. Elle a \u00e9labor\u00e9 une nouvelle fa\u00e7on d\u2019aborder les appr\u00e9ciations de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et de la fiabilit\u00e9 dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle, qui consiste en deux r\u00e8gles distinctes, mais interreli\u00e9es : la nouvelle \u00ab r\u00e8gle interdisant le recours \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques infond\u00e9es \u00bb et la modification d\u2019une [traduction] \u00ab r\u00e8gle interdisant le recours \u00e0 des inf\u00e9rences fond\u00e9es sur des st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00bb existante, cette derni\u00e8re emp\u00eachant les juges, lors de l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9, de se fonder sur des st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes quant \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont les personnes plaignantes ou les personnes accus\u00e9es dans des affaires d\u2019agressions sexuelles devraient agir (J.C., par. 63, citant Roth, par. 129; R. c. A. (A.B.), 2019 ONCA 124, 145 O.R. (3d) 634, par. 5; Cepic, par. 14 et 24). La cour a jug\u00e9 que le fait de ne pas se conformer \u00e0 l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des r\u00e8gles donnait lieu \u00e0 une erreur de droit susceptible de r\u00e9vision selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte lorsque l\u2019erreur a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le important dans la conclusion contest\u00e9e.\n[23] Les pourvois devant notre Cour font donc partie de la jurisprudence r\u00e9cente qui cherche \u00e0 transformer la fa\u00e7on dont les conclusions sur la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et la fiabilit\u00e9 dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle sont contr\u00f4l\u00e9es en appel. Cette jurisprudence met en place trois innovations juridiques significatives. Premi\u00e8rement, elle introduit une nouvelle r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale interdisant le recours \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques infond\u00e9es. Deuxi\u00e8mement, elle cat\u00e9gorise toute violation de cette r\u00e8gle comme une erreur de droit. Troisi\u00e8mement, elle cherche \u00e0 transposer l\u2019erreur de droit existante interdisant le recours aux mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes concernant les personnes plaignantes dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle dans une erreur de droit distincte et parall\u00e8le relative \u00e0 toutes les hypoth\u00e8ses factuelles au sujet de tous les t\u00e9moins, y compris l\u2019accus\u00e9.\n[24] En gardant \u00e0 l\u2019esprit le contexte dans lequel bon nombre de ces affaires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 plaid\u00e9es, on constate qu\u2019au c\u0153ur de cette nouvelle approche se trouve une analogie explicite entre le traitement historique des mythes et des st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes qui minent la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 des personnes plaignantes dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle et les principes devant \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9s lors de l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation du t\u00e9moignage des personnes accus\u00e9es dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat J.C., la cour a jug\u00e9 que, parce que le recours aux mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00e0 l\u2019endroit des personnes plaignantes dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle est une erreur de droit, il serait [traduction] \u00ab tout aussi fautif de tirer des inf\u00e9rences \u00e0 partir de st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes quant \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont on s\u2019attend \u00e0 ce que les personnes accus\u00e9es agissent \u00bb (par. 63; voir les par. 72\u201174, citant R. c. A.R.J.D., 2018 CSC 6, [2018] 1 R.C.S. 218; A. (A.B.)). Adoptant la r\u00e8gle propos\u00e9e, d\u2019autres tribunaux ont convenu que cette erreur de droit \u00e9tablie concernant les mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00e0 l\u2019endroit des personnes plaignantes dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle doit aussi s\u2019\u00e9tendre \u00e0 d\u2019autres types de st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes ou d\u2019hypoth\u00e8ses factuelles qui peuvent avoir pour effet de miner le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019une personne accus\u00e9e. Il se d\u00e9gage de ces affaires, collectivement, que m\u00eame si les mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes ont traditionnellement \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9judiciables aux personnes plaignantes, ces m\u00eames mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes peuvent simultan\u00e9ment \u00eatre pr\u00e9judiciables aux accus\u00e9s (R. c. C.M.M., 2020 BCCA 56, par. 139 (CanLII); R. c. Kodwat, 2017 YKCA 11, par. 41 (CanLII); R. c. Thompson, 2019 BCCA 1, 370 C.C.C. (3d) 354, par. 56\u201157; R. c. T.L., 2020 NUCA 10, 393 C.C.C. (3d) 195, par. 35).\n[25] Le traitement parall\u00e8le dont il est question dans ce courant jurisprudentiel est au premier plan des causes en appel. Au paragraphe 25, la Cour d\u2019appel dans le cas de M. Tsang s\u2019est fond\u00e9e sur un long extrait de l\u2019arr\u00eat J.C. qui exprimait notamment l\u2019id\u00e9e qu\u2019il est \u00ab tout aussi fautif \u00bb d\u2019invoquer cet ensemble historique de mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00e0 l\u2019endroit des personnes plaignantes lors de l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation du t\u00e9moignage des personnes accus\u00e9es. Poussant le raisonnement plus loin, dans le cas de M. Kruk, la Cour d\u2019appel a express\u00e9ment \u00e9tabli un parall\u00e8le entre le recours historique aux mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00e0 l\u2019endroit des personnes plaignantes dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle et le recours aux hypoth\u00e8ses erron\u00e9es plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement :\n[traduction] Historiquement, la question des hypoth\u00e8ses erron\u00e9es se posait habituellement dans le contexte o\u00f9 le juge du proc\u00e8s tirait des inf\u00e9rences d\u00e9favorables quant \u00e0 la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une personne plaignante dans une affaire d\u2019agression sexuelle sur le fondement de mythes et de st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes discr\u00e9dit\u00e9s. La jurisprudence exprime toutefois clairement que le juge du proc\u00e8s ne doit pas se fonder sur des hypoth\u00e8ses et des st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes dans son appr\u00e9ciation du t\u00e9moignage rendu tant par la personne plaignante que par la personne accus\u00e9e dans le contexte d\u2019une agression sexuelle. [Je souligne; par. 42.]\n[26] La r\u00e8gle propos\u00e9e interdisant le recours \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques infond\u00e9es constitue donc un changement radical par rapport \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont les juridictions d\u2019appel ont en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral abord\u00e9 l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et de la fiabilit\u00e9, surtout dans le contexte d\u2019une agression sexuelle. Fait crucial, la r\u00e8gle transforme toutes les conclusions de fait pouvant constituer des \u00ab hypoth\u00e8ses \u00bb \u2014 qui, en temps normal, \u00e9taient auparavant susceptibles de contr\u00f4le selon la norme de l\u2019erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante \u2014 en erreurs de droit susceptibles de contr\u00f4le selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte. La r\u00e8gle \u00e9tend en outre l\u2019interdiction bien \u00e9tablie de recourir aux mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00e0 l\u2019endroit des personnes plaignantes \u2014 donnant lieu \u00e0 une erreur de droit relativement limit\u00e9e ax\u00e9e sur l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation \u00e9quitable d\u2019une cat\u00e9gorie distincte de d\u00e9positions de t\u00e9moins dans un sous\u2011ensemble pr\u00e9cis de proc\u00e8s criminels \u2014 nettement au\u2011del\u00e0 de sa port\u00e9e initiale, la pr\u00e9sentant comme le fondement doctrinal de la cr\u00e9ation d\u2019une erreur beaucoup plus \u00e9tendue qui s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de tout t\u00e9moin dans tous les proc\u00e8s criminels.\nB. Il n\u2019y a pas lieu d\u2019adopter la r\u00e8gle propos\u00e9e interdisant le recours \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques infond\u00e9es\n[27] Pour les motifs qui suivent, la r\u00e8gle propos\u00e9e interdisant le recours \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques infond\u00e9es ne devrait pas \u00eatre reconnue comme donnant lieu \u00e0 une erreur de droit.\n[28] Premi\u00e8rement, dans le contexte d\u2019une agression sexuelle, la r\u00e8gle ne tient pas compte du caract\u00e8re distinct des mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes concernant les plaignantes, transformant toutes les g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisations de fait peu importe leur nature en erreurs de droit et imposant une fausse sym\u00e9trie aux situations des personnes accus\u00e9es. Deuxi\u00e8mement, la r\u00e8gle va \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du droit \u00e9tabli depuis longtemps sur les appr\u00e9ciations de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et de la fiabilit\u00e9 et des normes de contr\u00f4le actuelles, ce qui entra\u00eene des cons\u00e9quences sans pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent et ind\u00e9sirables.\n(1) La r\u00e8gle propos\u00e9e n\u2019est pas un prolongement logique de l\u2019interdiction visant le recours aux mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00e0 l\u2019endroit des personnes plaignantes dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle\n[29] Comme nous l\u2019avons vu, la r\u00e8gle propos\u00e9e interdisant le recours \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques infond\u00e9es s\u2019appuie sur l\u2019interdiction bien \u00e9tablie visant le recours aux mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes pour l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation du t\u00e9moignage d\u2019une personne qui porte plainte pour agression sexuelle. Normalement, les appr\u00e9ciations de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et de la fiabilit\u00e9 sont susceptibles de r\u00e9vision selon la norme de l\u2019erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante et commandent par ailleurs la d\u00e9f\u00e9rence. Toutefois, lorsque le juge du proc\u00e8s s\u2019appuie dans ses motifs sur des mythes ou st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00e0 l\u2019endroit des personnes plaignantes dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle, cela constitue une erreur de droit. Les partisans de la r\u00e8gle interdisant le recours \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques infond\u00e9es soutiennent que si le recours aux mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00e0 l\u2019endroit des personnes plaignantes est une erreur de droit, alors toutes les hypoth\u00e8ses infond\u00e9es concernant tous les t\u00e9moins, y compris l\u2019accus\u00e9, devraient \u00eatre trait\u00e9es de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re.\n[30] Avec \u00e9gards, j\u2019estime que ce r\u00e9flexe d\u2019appliquer un traitement sym\u00e9trique et formellement identique est injustifi\u00e9. Il t\u00e9moigne d\u2019une mauvaise compr\u00e9hension de l\u2019ensemble distinct de r\u00e8gles de droit associ\u00e9 aux mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9labor\u00e9 dans un contexte historique particulier afin de prot\u00e9ger les plaignantes seulement.\na) L\u2019historique des mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00e0 l\u2019endroit des plaignantes\n[31] L\u2019interdiction visant les mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes qui minent la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 des plaignantes dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle a un historique unique et un objectif r\u00e9parateur pr\u00e9cis : \u00e9carter les r\u00e8gles de droit discriminatoires qui ont contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la perception que les femmes, en tant que groupe, \u00e9taient peu cr\u00e9dibles et ne m\u00e9ritaient pas une protection juridique contre la violence sexuelle.\n[32] Dans le pass\u00e9, de multiples obstacles juridiques faisaient en sorte que le t\u00e9moignage des personnes portant plainte pour agression sexuelle \u2014 qui, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, \u00e9taient presque exclusivement des femmes \u2014 \u00e9tait trait\u00e9 comme un r\u00e9cit intrins\u00e8quement peu fiable. L\u2019expression \u00ab mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00bb a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e pour d\u00e9crire la fa\u00e7on dont les protections proc\u00e9durales exceptionnelles dont b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaient historiquement ceux qui \u00e9taient accus\u00e9s d\u2019une agression sexuelle \u00e9taient discriminatoires \u00e0 l\u2019endroit des plaignantes et ont fait de l\u2019agression sexuelle non seulement le crime le moins signal\u00e9, mais \u00e9galement un crime exceptionnellement difficile \u00e0 prouver en cour. Ces mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes, autrefois int\u00e9gr\u00e9s dans le droit, se posaient autant quant \u00e0 la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 qu\u2019au consentement, et faisaient de l\u2019agression sexuelle un crime intrins\u00e8quement diff\u00e9rent des autres.\n[33] Avant 1983, le \u00ab viol \u00bb \u00e9tait le principal type d\u2019infraction sexuelle : il criminalisait la p\u00e9n\u00e9tration non consensuelle d\u2019un p\u00e9nis dans un vagin et \u00e9tait donc per\u00e7u comme un crime genr\u00e9 commis par un homme contre une femme. Selon les termes m\u00eames de l\u2019interdiction, une femme mari\u00e9e ne pouvait pas \u00eatre viol\u00e9e par son mari, puisqu\u2019elle \u00e9tait consid\u00e9r\u00e9e, en raison de son statut d\u2019\u00e9pouse, avoir renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 sa capacit\u00e9 juridique de refuser une activit\u00e9 sexuelle non d\u00e9sir\u00e9e. La loi appliquait de ce fait la notion selon laquelle certaines relations conf\u00e9raient aux hommes un droit sur la disponibilit\u00e9 sexuelle des femmes (voir, p. ex., J. Koshan, \u00ab Marriage and Advance Consent to Sex : A Feminist Judgment in R v JA \u00bb (2016), 6 O\u00f1ati Socio\u2011legal Series 1377, p. 1387).\n[34] En outre, des r\u00e8gles de preuve particuli\u00e8res r\u00e9gissaient le t\u00e9moignage des plaignantes dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle. Selon l\u2019exigence de corroboration qui \u00e9tait pr\u00e9vue par la loi, le juge devait donner l\u2019instruction au jury qu\u2019il \u00e9tait dangereux de d\u00e9clarer l\u2019accus\u00e9 coupable d\u2019une agression sexuelle sur le seul fondement du t\u00e9moignage d\u2019une plaignante (Code criminel, S.C. 1953\u201154, c. 51, par. 131(1); les exigences de corroboration ont \u00e9t\u00e9 abolies par la Loi modifiant le Code criminel en mati\u00e8re d\u2019infractions sexuelles et d\u2019autres infractions contre la personne et apportant des modifications corr\u00e9latives \u00e0 d\u2019autres lois, S.C. 1980\u201181\u201182\u201183, c. 125, art. 5 et 19; voir aussi le Code criminel , L.R.C. 1985, c. C\u201146 (\u00ab Code \u00bb), art. 274; R. c. Seaboyer, [1991] 2 R.C.S. 577, p. 676). La doctrine de la plainte spontan\u00e9e exigeait la divulgation imm\u00e9diate d\u2019une agression sexuelle pour \u00e9viter toute inf\u00e9rence d\u00e9favorable quant \u00e0 la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9, ce qui signifie que le silence initial d\u2019une plaignante pouvait \u00eatre per\u00e7u comme une \u00ab contradiction implicite de sa version \u00bb (R. c. D.D., 2000 CSC 43, [2000] 2 R.C.S. 275, par. 60\u201161, citant Kribs c. The Queen, [1960] R.C.S. 400, p. 405; voir aussi Timm c. La Reine, [1981] 2 R.C.S. 315).\n[35] Selon ces r\u00e8gles, non seulement les femmes, en tant que groupe, \u00e9taient consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme manquant de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9, mais il y avait une th\u00e9orie concernant le sous\u2011ensemble sp\u00e9cifique de femmes qui pouvaient \u00eatre crues. Des attitudes sociales n\u00e9gatives \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des femmes servaient souvent \u00e0 diff\u00e9rencier les \u00ab vraies \u00bb victimes de viol des femmes que l\u2019on soup\u00e7onnait d\u2019inventer de fausses all\u00e9gations par int\u00e9r\u00eat personnel ou m\u00eame par vengeance. Les pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s contre les femmes qui \u00e9taient autochtones ou racialis\u00e9es et contre les personnes en situation de handicap ou membres de la communaut\u00e9 2ELGBTQI+ avaient aussi pour effet de prescrire socialement des id\u00e9aux et des normes concernant les victimes d\u2019agression sexuelle. Dans la mesure o\u00f9 une plaignante donn\u00e9e s\u2019\u00e9cartait des caract\u00e9ristiques de la vraie victime de viol id\u00e9alis\u00e9e, sa cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et son droit \u00e0 la protection de la loi \u00e9taient r\u00e9duits, parfois \u00e0 n\u00e9ant (voir, p. ex., J. Benedet, \u00ab Judicial Misconduct in the Sexual Assault Trial \u00bb (2019), 52 U.B.C. L. Rev. 1; S. Ehrlich, \u00ab Perpetuating \u2014 and Resisting \u2014 Rape Myths in Trial Discourse \u00bb, dans E. A.

Grant, \u00ab Hearing the Sexual Assault Complaints of Women with Mental Disabilities : Evidentiary and Procedural Issues \u00bb (2007), 52 R.D. McGill 515).\n[36] \u00c0 maintes reprises, notre Cour a reconnu la pr\u00e9dominance des mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00e0 l\u2019endroit des plaignantes dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle, notamment les suivants :\n\u2022 Les v\u00e9ritables agressions sexuelles sont perp\u00e9tr\u00e9es par des individus qui ne connaissent pas la victime (Seaboyer, p. 659, la juge L\u2019Heureux\u2011Dub\u00e9, dissidente en partie; R. c. Friesen, 2020 CSC 9, [2020] 1 R.C.S. 424, par. 130, le juge en chef Wagner et le juge Rowe).\n\u2022 Les fausses all\u00e9gations d\u2019agression sexuelle fond\u00e9es sur des motifs inavou\u00e9s sont plus fr\u00e9quentes que les fausses all\u00e9gations relatives aux autres infractions (Seaboyer, p. 669, la juge L\u2019Heureux\u2011Dub\u00e9, dissidente en partie; R. c. Osolin, [1993] 4 R.C.S. 595, p. 625, la juge L\u2019Heureux\u2011Dub\u00e9, dissidente; R. c.

McCraw, [1991] 3 R.C.S. 72, p. 83\u201184, le juge Cory au nom de la Cour).\n\u2022 Une plaignante qui a dit \u00ab non \u00bb ne voulait pas n\u00e9cessairement dire \u00ab non \u00bb et peut avoir voulu dire \u00ab oui \u00bb (Seaboyer, p. 659, la juge L\u2019Heureux\u2011Dub\u00e9, dissidente en partie; R. c.

Goldfinch, 2019 CSC 38, [2019] 3 R.C.S. 3, par. 44 et 74, la juge Karakatsanis pour les juges majoritaires).\n\u2022 Si la plaignante est rest\u00e9e passive ou n\u2019a pas r\u00e9sist\u00e9 aux avances de l\u2019accus\u00e9, que ce soit physiquement ou verbalement en disant \u00ab non \u00bb, elle \u00e9tait forc\u00e9ment consentante \u2014 un mythe qui a historiquement d\u00e9form\u00e9 la d\u00e9finition du consentement et fait du viol [traduction] \u00ab le seul crime qui exige que la victime ait r\u00e9sist\u00e9 physiquement comme preuve de l\u2019absence de consentement \u00bb (Ewanchuk, par. 93, 97 et 99, la juge L\u2019Heureux\u2011Dub\u00e9, motifs concordants, citant S. Estrich, \u00ab Rape \u00bb (1986), 95 Yale L.J. 1087, p. 1090; voir aussi le par. 103, la juge McLachlin, motifs concordants, et le par. 51, le juge Major pour les juges majoritaires; voir en outre R. c. M. (M.L.), [1994] 2 R.C.S. 3, p. 4, le juge Sopinka au nom de la Cour; R. c.

Barton, 2019 CSC 33, [2019] 2 R.C.S. 579, par. 98, 105, 107, 109 et 118, le juge Moldaver pour les juges majoritaires; Friesen, par. 151, le juge en chef Wagner et le juge Rowe au nom de la Cour).\n\u2022 Une femme active sexuellement (1) est plus susceptible d\u2019avoir consenti \u00e0 l\u2019activit\u00e9 sexuelle qui fait l\u2019objet de l\u2019accusation et (2) est moins cr\u00e9dible \u2014 aussi appel\u00e9s les \u00ab deux mythes \u00bb, qui permettaient que le comportement sexuel ant\u00e9rieur de la plaignante soit analys\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on approfondie lors du proc\u00e8s, sans \u00e9gard pour sa pertinence, ce qui \u00e9cartait le d\u00e9bat de la conduite all\u00e9gu\u00e9e de l\u2019accus\u00e9 et le dirigeait vers la valeur morale per\u00e7ue de la plaignante (Seaboyer; Ewanchuk).\n[37] Les mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00e0 l\u2019endroit des plaignantes dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle englobent des id\u00e9es et des croyances tr\u00e8s r\u00e9pandues qui ne sont pas vraies empiriquement \u2014 comme les notions d\u00e9sormais discr\u00e9dit\u00e9es que les infractions sexuelles sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement commises par des personnes que la victime ne conna\u00eet pas, ou que les crimes de ce type sont plus susceptibles que les autres infractions de faire l\u2019objet de fausses all\u00e9gations. Les mythes, en particulier, v\u00e9hiculent des histoires et des visions du monde traditionnelles concernant ce qui, aux yeux de certains, constitue de la \u00ab v\u00e9ritable \u00bb violence sexuelle et ce qui n\u2019en constitue pas. Certains mythes impliquent le discr\u00e9dit en bloc de la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 des propos des femmes et de leur fiabilit\u00e9, tandis que d\u2019autres conceptualisent une victime id\u00e9alis\u00e9e ainsi que ses caract\u00e9ristiques et ses actions avant, pendant et apr\u00e8s l\u2019agression. Par le pass\u00e9, tous les mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes de ce genre se refl\u00e9taient dans les r\u00e8gles de preuve qui ne r\u00e9gissaient que le t\u00e9moignage des plaignantes dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle et avaient invariablement pour effet de d\u00e9valuer et de rabaisser leur statut en cour.\n[38] Dans l\u2019ensemble, ce contexte juridique t\u00e9moignait d\u2019une \u00e9poque o\u00f9 le caract\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9 de la violence sexuelle et les dommages qu\u2019elle cause pour la vie \u00e9taient moins connus. \u00c0 un certain moment, le Parlement, les tribunaux, les universitaires et le public en sont venus \u00e0 comprendre que les r\u00e8gles de droit qui pr\u00e9valaient, ainsi que les attitudes sociales incorrectes, d\u00e9pass\u00e9es et in\u00e9quitables dont elles t\u00e9moignaient, nuisaient au traitement \u00e9gal des plaignantes dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle et, par cons\u00e9quent, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des proc\u00e8s.\n[39] De nouvelles dispositions du Code criminel ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9es pour remplacer l\u2019ancienne infraction de viol par une nouvelle infraction d\u2019agression sexuelle et l\u2019exemption pour le viol commis par un conjoint a \u00e9t\u00e9 abrog\u00e9e \u2014 ce qui refl\u00e8te la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 que m\u00eame si les femmes continuent de repr\u00e9senter la vaste majorit\u00e9 des personnes qui portent plainte pour agression sexuelle, l\u2019infraction d\u2019agression sexuelle peut \u00eatre perp\u00e9tr\u00e9e par et contre les personnes de tous genres. Le consentement a \u00e9t\u00e9 express\u00e9ment d\u00e9fini au par. 273.1(1) du Code comme l\u2019accord volontaire de la plaignante \u00e0 l\u2019activit\u00e9 sexuelle, et le par. 273.1(2) et l\u2019art. 273.2 circonscrivent clairement les circonstances o\u00f9 le consentement n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenu ainsi que la port\u00e9e de la croyance erron\u00e9e au consentement. L\u2019exigence de corroboration a \u00e9t\u00e9 abolie et la doctrine de la plainte spontan\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 abrog\u00e9e, comme le pr\u00e9voient respectivement les art. 274 et 275 du Code . Enfin, les art. 276 et 278.1 \u00e0 278.91 r\u00e9gissent maintenant l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 en preuve du comportement sexuel ant\u00e9rieur de la plaignante ainsi que la production et l\u2019admission de dossiers contenant des renseignements personnels tr\u00e8s sensibles de la plaignante qui sont d\u00e9tenus par un tiers ou qui se retrouvent en la possession de l\u2019accus\u00e9.\n[40] Les changements l\u00e9gislatifs importants dans ce domaine du droit ont \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9s dans le but de prot\u00e9ger les droits des femmes et des enfants en raison de leur vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 particuli\u00e8re \u00e0 la violence sexuelle. Dans le pr\u00e9ambule de la Loi qui a modifi\u00e9 l\u2019art. 276 du Code apr\u00e8s l\u2019arr\u00eat Seaboyer et r\u00e9form\u00e9 la d\u00e9finition du consentement \u00e0 une activit\u00e9 sexuelle, le Parlement a express\u00e9ment mis l\u2019accent sur la lutte contre \u00ab la fr\u00e9quence des agressions sexuelles contre les femmes et les enfants \u00bb, et a exprim\u00e9 l\u2019intention pr\u00e9cise d\u2019\u00ab assurer la pleine protection des droits garantis par les articles 7 et 15 de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s \u00bb (Loi modifiant le Code criminel (agression sexuelle), L.C. 1992, c. 38). Le Parlement a aussi exprim\u00e9 l\u2019intention d\u2019\u00ab encourager la d\u00e9nonciation des cas de violence sexuelle \u00bb et a soulign\u00e9 que l\u2019admission en preuve du comportement sexuel ant\u00e9rieur de la plaignante est \u00ab \u00e9minemment pr\u00e9judiciable \u00bb et \u00ab devrait \u00eatre examin[\u00e9] avec pr\u00e9caution \u00bb (ibid.). Lorsqu\u2019il a modifi\u00e9 les art. 278.1 \u00e0 278.91 du Code , le Parlement a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger les int\u00e9r\u00eats en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e des plaignantes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des renseignements personnels tr\u00e8s sensibles et \u00e0 pr\u00e9server leur dignit\u00e9. De telles modifications mettent en balance comme il se doit le respect de la dignit\u00e9, de la vie priv\u00e9e et de l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 de la plaignante, d\u2019une part, et le droit fondamental de l\u2019accus\u00e9 \u00e0 la pr\u00e9somption d\u2019innocence et \u00e0 un proc\u00e8s \u00e9quitable. Elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9es constitutionnelles par la Cour (voir Mills; Darrach; J.J.).\n[41] En outre, plusieurs des mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes d\u00e9crits pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment sont maintenant condamn\u00e9s par la jurisprudence, qui a qualifi\u00e9 le recours \u00e0 ceux\u2011ci d\u2019erreur de droit. Par exemple, il est interdit au juge du proc\u00e8s de se fonder sur des id\u00e9es comme les suivantes : le fait que la plaignante ait tard\u00e9 \u00e0 rapporter une agression sexuelle, \u00e0 lui seul, mine la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de la r\u00e9v\u00e9lation (D.D.; R. c. Lacombe, 2019 ONCA 938, 383 C.C.C. (3d) 114); le \u00ab d\u00e9faut \u00bb de la plaignante de s\u2019habiller modestement indique qu\u2019elle est plus susceptible d\u2019avoir consenti (Ewanchuk, par. 103); le \u00ab d\u00e9faut \u00bb de la plaignante de r\u00e9sister ou d\u2019appeler \u00e0 l\u2019aide laisse entendre qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait consentante (par. 93); le simple fait que la plaignante ait eu recours \u00e0 des consultations th\u00e9rapeutiques ou psychiatriques est pertinent pour juger de sa cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 ou de la fiabilit\u00e9 de son t\u00e9moignage (par. 278.3(4) du Code ); ou le fait qu\u2019une plaignante revoit l\u2019accus\u00e9 ou ne cherche pas \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9viter apr\u00e8s l\u2019agression sexuelle all\u00e9gu\u00e9e tend \u00e0 indiquer qu\u2019il y avait consentement et qu\u2019aucune agression n\u2019est survenue (A. (A.B.), par. 6\u201112).\n[42] Le traitement l\u00e9gislatif et jurisprudentiel de ces questions refl\u00e8te l\u2019id\u00e9e collective que les tribunaux devraient s\u2019efforcer d\u2019\u00e9radiquer les mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes de leurs d\u00e9cisions parce qu\u2019ils menacent les droits des plaignantes et minent la fonction de recherche de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 des proc\u00e8s. Aujourd\u2019hui, les infractions d\u2019ordre sexuel demeurent peu signal\u00e9es et ce sont les femmes et les enfants qui continuent d\u2019en \u00eatre principalement victimes. Il existe toujours une \u00ab n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019affirmer les principes d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 et de dignit\u00e9 humaine dans notre droit criminel, en s\u2019attaquant au probl\u00e8me des mythes et des st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes dont font l\u2019objet les plaignants en mati\u00e8re d\u2019agression sexuelle \u00bb (A.G., par. 1, la juge L\u2019Heureux\u2011Dub\u00e9, motifs concordants; voir R. c. O\u2019Connor, [1995] 4 R.C.S. 411).\n[43] La Cour a statu\u00e9 \u00e0 maintes reprises que \u00ab les mythes et les st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes n\u2019ont pas leur place dans un syst\u00e8me juridique rationnel et juste, du fait qu\u2019ils compromettent la fonction judiciaire de recherche de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 \u00bb (A.G., par. 2). Un proc\u00e8s est un processus de recherche de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, et le recours \u00e0 des mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes d\u00e9forme la v\u00e9rit\u00e9. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Mills, la Cour a expliqu\u00e9 que les mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes concernant les victimes d\u2019agression sexuelle entravent la recherche de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et imposent \u00ab un fardeau lourd et inutile aux plaignants dans des poursuites relatives \u00e0 une infraction d\u2019ordre sexuel \u00bb (par. 119). Bien que les droits constitutionnels de l\u2019accus\u00e9 doivent demeurer au premier plan de tout proc\u00e8s criminel, la Cour a aussi reconnu que des mesures peuvent \u00eatre prises pour \u00e9viter le recours aux mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes sans que ces droits soient compromis. Les mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes minent en fait la tenue d\u2019un proc\u00e8s \u00e9quitable \u2014 ce qui veut dire un proc\u00e8s qui est juste non seulement pour l\u2019accus\u00e9, mais aussi pour la plaignante et le public (voir J.J., par. 1-2).\n[44] L\u2019ensemble de cet historique met en perspective les raisons distinctes pour lesquelles le fait de recourir aux mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes afin de discr\u00e9diter les personnes plaignantes dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle constitue une erreur de droit \u2014 au lieu d\u2019\u00eatre une conclusion de fait ordinaire assujettie \u00e0 la norme de l\u2019erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante. La v\u00e9ritable raison pour laquelle cette erreur de droit a vu le jour \u00e9tait d\u2019emp\u00eacher que les accus\u00e9s discr\u00e9ditent le t\u00e9moignage des plaignantes pour des motifs injustifi\u00e9s et discriminatoires, et donc de corriger l\u2019avantage particulier dont jouissaient historiquement les personnes accus\u00e9es dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle en comparaison aux personnes accus\u00e9es dans d\u2019autres affaires : les mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes ne devraient plus jouer quelque r\u00f4le que ce soit lors de la pr\u00e9paration d\u2019une d\u00e9fense. Les changements l\u00e9gislatifs et jurisprudentiels con\u00e7us pour \u00e9radiquer le discr\u00e9dit cat\u00e9gorique des femmes en tant que t\u00e9moins ne conf\u00e8rent pas d\u2019avantages particuliers en droit aux plaignantes dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle. Ils ont simplement \u00e9cart\u00e9 les obstacles discriminatoires, mis les plaignantes dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle et les personnes plaignantes dans d\u2019autres affaires sur un pied d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 pour ce qui est de leur t\u00e9moignage et fait en sorte que la fonction de recherche de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 du proc\u00e8s ne soit pas d\u00e9natur\u00e9e.\nb) La r\u00e8gle propos\u00e9e ne devrait pas \u00eatre adopt\u00e9e en tant que corollaire de l\u2019interdiction visant les mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes\n[45] En somme, l\u2019interdiction visant les mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00e0 l\u2019endroit des plaignantes dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle poss\u00e8de ses propres historique, objectif et caract\u00e8re. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e dans le but pr\u00e9cis de prot\u00e9ger les plaignantes contre le raisonnement pr\u00e9judiciable ou discriminatoire dans les proc\u00e8s criminels. La r\u00e8gle propos\u00e9e interdisant le recours \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques infond\u00e9es devrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e parce qu\u2019elle \u00e9largit ce contexte particulier au\u2011del\u00e0 de sa port\u00e9e l\u00e9gitime.\n(i) La r\u00e8gle propos\u00e9e ne tient pas compte du caract\u00e8re distinct des mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes\n[46] Les types d\u2019hypoth\u00e8ses que vise la r\u00e8gle propos\u00e9e ne partagent pas le caract\u00e8re discriminatoire distinct des mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00e0 l\u2019endroit des plaignantes dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle, lesquels forment une cat\u00e9gorie particuli\u00e8re d\u2019erreur de droit cr\u00e9\u00e9e \u00e0 une fin explicitement r\u00e9paratrice. Comme il est indiqu\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Find, notre Cour s\u2019est montr\u00e9e dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 accepter l\u2019existence des mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des plaignantes dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle sur le fondement d\u2019une \u00ab preuve convaincante \u00bb tir\u00e9e d\u2019une abondante litt\u00e9rature relevant des sciences sociales (par. 101). On ne trouve dans la l\u00e9gislation aucune reconnaissance comparable d\u2019une tendance \u00e0 recourir \u00e0 tort \u00e0 un ensemble pr\u00e9cis et circonscrit de g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisations pour appr\u00e9cier incorrectement le t\u00e9moignage des personnes accus\u00e9es dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle. Les mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00e0 l\u2019endroit des plaignantes dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle sont r\u00e9gis par un ensemble restreint de principes juridiques cr\u00e9\u00e9s pour rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 des pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s syst\u00e9miques r\u00e9pandus, qui \u00e9taient int\u00e9gr\u00e9s dans la loi et visaient une cat\u00e9gorie distincte de t\u00e9moins \u2014 un parall\u00e8le ne peut pas \u00eatre \u00e9tabli de fa\u00e7on coh\u00e9rente pour justifier l\u2019adoption d\u2019une r\u00e8gle interdisant toute g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisation concernant tout t\u00e9moin, y compris l\u2019accus\u00e9.\n[47] Contrairement \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle propos\u00e9e, la jurisprudence qui s\u2019attaque aux mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes relatifs aux agressions sexuelles retire du droit certaines hypoth\u00e8ses et id\u00e9es erron\u00e9es qui faussaient auparavant le raisonnement du tribunal et la recherche des faits de mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e. Ces mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes minent injustement la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 per\u00e7ue de t\u00e9moins faisant partie d\u2019une cat\u00e9gorie pr\u00e9cise avant m\u00eame que le t\u00e9moignage n\u2019ait \u00e9t\u00e9 entendu, ce qui impr\u00e8gne dans les faits le t\u00e9moignage des plaignantes d\u2019un jugement de faiblesse \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue. Ils d\u00e9naturent en outre la signification juridique du consentement. Les principes juridiques qui interdisent au juge de se fonder sur certains st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes lorsqu\u2019il appr\u00e9cie le t\u00e9moignage de plaignantes font donc partie d\u2019une cat\u00e9gorie distincte et sont fondamentalement diff\u00e9rents d\u2019une interdiction globale relative aux g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisations dans l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de l\u2019ensemble des t\u00e9moignages. Inversement, la r\u00e8gle propos\u00e9e ne porte pas sur des g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisations pr\u00e9cises, d\u00e9termin\u00e9es et erron\u00e9es concernant une certaine cat\u00e9gorie de t\u00e9moins, dont un grand nombre ont d\u2019abord \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9es par la loi, et elle n\u2019emp\u00eache pas non plus que le sens des \u00e9l\u00e9ments d\u2019une infraction soit d\u00e9natur\u00e9. En revanche, la r\u00e8gle ratisse large, transformant tous les types de g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisations de fait, peu importe leur nature, en erreurs de droit. Ce faisant, la r\u00e8gle \u00e9tend d\u2019une mani\u00e8re inacceptable les limites des erreurs de droit existantes \u00e0 toute conclusion de fait dont on peut dire qu\u2019elle constitue une hypoth\u00e8se concernant le comportement humain.\n[48] Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, il y a un important chevauchement entre la r\u00e8gle interdisant le recours \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques et la r\u00e8gle connexe interdisant le raisonnement st\u00e9r\u00e9otyp\u00e9 formul\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat J.C. : les deux r\u00e8gles emp\u00eachent le juge du proc\u00e8s de se servir de \u00ab st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00bb dans son appr\u00e9ciation de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9. Toutefois, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat J.C. et tel qu\u2019adopt\u00e9 par la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie\u2011Britannique, le terme \u00ab st\u00e9r\u00e9otype \u00bb d\u00e9limitait non seulement une erreur de droit, mais a \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9 d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui englobait dans les faits toutes les g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisations concernant le comportement humain. Soit dit en tout respect, il ne s\u2019agit pas de la bonne approche : une g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisation n\u2019\u00e9quivaut pas n\u00e9cessairement \u00e0 un st\u00e9r\u00e9otype pouvant \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une erreur de droit.\n[49] En g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, toutes les hypoth\u00e8ses infond\u00e9es concernant le comportement humain, y compris les st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes, ont deux caract\u00e9ristiques en commun. D\u2019abord, elles prennent une proposition g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et l\u2019appliquent \u00e0 une personne pr\u00e9cise, passant outre \u00e0 toute appr\u00e9ciation des caract\u00e9ristiques ou circonstances uniques de cette personne. Ensuite, cette proposition g\u00e9n\u00e9rale est inexacte ou fausse, que ce soit dans tous les cas ou dans le cas de cette personne pr\u00e9cise (voir, p. ex., R. c. G. (C.M.), 2016 ABQB 368, 41 Alta. L.R. (6th) 374, par. 60). Toutefois, les st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes vont un peu plus loin et \u00e9voquent un sens juridique particulier que la simple g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisation n\u2019\u00e9voque pas : plus particuli\u00e8rement, un sens tirant sa source dans la discrimination et l\u2019in\u00e9galit\u00e9 de traitement.\n[50] Le caract\u00e8re discriminatoire des st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes ressort clairement de la fa\u00e7on dont notre Cour a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9, dans sa jurisprudence, les st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes concernant les plaignantes dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle. Le recours \u00e0 de tels st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu comme une erreur de droit dans le but expr\u00e8s d\u2019\u00e9liminer la discrimination contre les femmes et de promouvoir leur dignit\u00e9 et leur \u00e9galit\u00e9 dans le syst\u00e8me de justice. Par exemple, l\u2019exigence qu\u2019une femme \u00ab crie haro \u00bb reposait sur l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se maintenant discr\u00e9dit\u00e9e selon laquelle, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le viol \u00e9tait la pire chose qui puisse arriver \u00e0 une femme, toute victime cr\u00e9dible r\u00e9v\u00e9lerait sur\u2011le\u2011champ ce qui est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re personne qu\u2019elle croiserait. Par cons\u00e9quent, c\u2019est maintenant une erreur de droit que de tirer une conclusion d\u00e9favorable du simple fait que la plaignante n\u2019a pas rapport\u00e9 imm\u00e9diatement l\u2019agression (D.D., par. 65). L\u2019exigence historique visant la corroboration du t\u00e9moignage d\u2019une plaignante, maintenant abolie, reposait sur l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se discriminatoire suivant laquelle le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019une femme n\u2019\u00e9tait pas, en droit, \u00e9gal \u00e0 celui d\u2019un homme. Les deux mythes, maintenant interdits par l\u2019art. 276 du Code , \u00e9taient encore une fois fond\u00e9s sur l\u2019id\u00e9e discriminatoire que les femmes ayant eu des rapports sexuels \u00e9taient peu dignes de confiance et ne m\u00e9ritaient pas l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 de traitement devant la loi et le respect \u00e9gal (Seaboyer). Les st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes n\u00e9gatifs \u00e0 l\u2019endroit des plaignantes dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle ont \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnus comme donnant lieu \u00e0 des erreurs de droit parce qu\u2019ils tiraient souvent leur origine du droit, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consign\u00e9s dans la loi et reposaient sur une mauvaise interpr\u00e9tation de la d\u00e9finition maintenant claire du consentement, soit l\u2019accord volontaire et communiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019activit\u00e9 sexuelle en question \u2014 une mauvaise interpr\u00e9tation qui minait le principe au c\u0153ur de la m\u00eame justice pour tous.\n[51] Le probl\u00e8me que pose la r\u00e8gle propos\u00e9e interdisant le recours \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques infond\u00e9es est qu\u2019elle ne tient pas compte de cette dimension cruciale. Elle regroupe plut\u00f4t les types de st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes pernicieux et discriminatoires que les tribunaux et le Parlement ont voulu condamner et corriger avec des g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisations inoffensives qui, quoique peut\u2011\u00eatre erron\u00e9es sur le plan des faits, n\u2019ont rien \u00e0 avoir avec l\u2019in\u00e9galit\u00e9 de traitement.\n[52] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat J.C., par exemple, la Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Ontario a conclu que la qualification par le juge du proc\u00e8s du t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019accus\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant m\u00e9canique, r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 et politiquement correct \u00e9tait fond\u00e9 sur un \u00ab st\u00e9r\u00e9otype \u00bb et constituait donc une erreur de droit. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Roth, bien que la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie\u2011Britannique ait rejet\u00e9 l\u2019argument portant que la juge du proc\u00e8s se soit fond\u00e9e sur des st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes concernant le comportement masculin, elle a tout de m\u00eame conclu que la g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisation erron\u00e9e de la juge du proc\u00e8s concernant le fait que l\u2019accus\u00e9 \u00e9tait un dynamophile constituait une erreur de droit. Peu importe si ces hypoth\u00e8ses factuelles \u00e9taient fausses ou non, il ne fait aucun doute qu\u2019elles ont un caract\u00e8re fondamentalement diff\u00e9rent des st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes fond\u00e9s sur l\u2019in\u00e9galit\u00e9. Un t\u00e9moin qui est discr\u00e9dit\u00e9 parce qu\u2019il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 d\u2019une fa\u00e7on que le juge du proc\u00e8s consid\u00e8re comme peu vraisemblable, ou en raison de ses habitudes li\u00e9es \u00e0 sa forme physique, ce n\u2019est tout simplement pas la m\u00eame chose qu\u2019une plaignante qui est discr\u00e9dit\u00e9e en raison de son pass\u00e9 sexuel et donc de son caract\u00e8re \u00ab non chaste \u00bb, parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas r\u00e9sist\u00e9 \u00e0 son agresseur ou qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas signal\u00e9 l\u2019agression sur-le-champ. Cela ne veut d\u2019aucune fa\u00e7on dire que le recours \u00e0 des g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisations fautives lors de l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 devrait \u00eatre tol\u00e9r\u00e9. Ces propos illustrent plut\u00f4t que les g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisations de fait ordinaires \u2014 qui sont d\u2019une nature diff\u00e9rente de celles qui se rapportent aux mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00e0 l\u2019endroit des plaignantes dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle, et ne r\u00e9v\u00e8lent pas d\u2019autres erreurs de droit reconnues \u2014 devraient \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9es selon la norme de l\u2019erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante.\n[53] Le changement l\u00e9gislatif vers une compr\u00e9hension moins genr\u00e9e de la violence sexuelle oblige \u00e9galement les tribunaux \u00e0 \u00eatre sensibles au fait que les personnes plaignantes dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle proviennent de tous les horizons. En \u00e9liminant le crime intrins\u00e8quement genr\u00e9 de viol, le Parlement a indiqu\u00e9 que l\u2019agression sexuelle ne se limitait plus au paradigme homme accus\u00e9\/femme plaignante. Les st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes au sujet des personnes plaignantes qui visaient auparavant les femmes seulement sont maintenant susceptibles de compromettre l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation du t\u00e9moignage de tous les types de personnes plaignantes \u2014 par exemple, bien qu\u2019il soit encore vrai que la majorit\u00e9 des personnes plaignantes dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle soient des femmes, c\u2019est une erreur de droit que d\u2019avoir recours \u00e0 la doctrine de la plainte spontan\u00e9e ou \u00e0 des st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes au sujet des activit\u00e9s sexuelles ant\u00e9rieures de la personne plaignante peu importe le genre de celle\u2011ci. Le discr\u00e9dit en bloc des personnes plaignantes en tant que cat\u00e9gorie particuli\u00e8re de t\u00e9moins, essentiellement, prend aussi sa source dans l\u2019in\u00e9galit\u00e9 de traitement, comme l\u2019a reconnu la Cour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat O\u2019Connor (par. 123) :\n. . . un syst\u00e8me judiciaire qui d\u00e9value le t\u00e9moignage des plaignantes victimes d\u2019agression sexuelle en pr\u00e9sumant de facto de leur manque de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 soul\u00e8verait des pr\u00e9occupations similaires. Ce ne serait pas refl\u00e9ter, encore moins favoriser, \u00ab l\u2019existence d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 o\u00f9 tous ont la certitude que la loi les reconna\u00eet comme des \u00eatres humains qui m\u00e9ritent le m\u00eame respect, la m\u00eame d\u00e9f\u00e9rence et la m\u00eame consid\u00e9ration \u00bb (Andrews c. Law Society of British Columbia, [1989] 1 R.C.S. 143, \u00e0 la p. 171). [Soulignement omis.]\n(Voir aussi Seaboyer, p. 654.)\n[54] De fait, toutes les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle sont susceptibles de mettre en jeu un vaste \u00e9ventail de st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes allant au\u2011del\u00e0 de ceux \u00e0 l\u2019endroit des femmes plaignantes. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Barton, par exemple, notre Cour a reconnu les mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes pr\u00e9cis dont sont victimes les femmes autochtones, qui peuvent entraver l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation ad\u00e9quate de leur cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et de leur fiabilit\u00e9. Les tribunaux ont aussi cess\u00e9 de traiter avec une m\u00e9fiance inh\u00e9rente le t\u00e9moignage des personnes plaignantes tr\u00e8s jeunes, reconnaissant que la fa\u00e7on dont les attitudes du pass\u00e9 ne prenaient pas en compte la vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 propre \u00e0 l\u2019enfant et des probl\u00e8mes particuliers auxquels il peut faire face lorsqu\u2019il t\u00e9moigne (voir R. c. F. (W.J.), [1999] 3 R.C.S. 569). Je veux \u00e9galement souligner \u00e0 ce stade\u2011ci que le recours aux st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes, prenant leur source dans une in\u00e9galit\u00e9 de traitement, n\u2019est certainement pas juste un probl\u00e8me pour les personnes plaignantes dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle. Le raisonnement st\u00e9r\u00e9otyp\u00e9 fond\u00e9 sur le type d\u2019in\u00e9galit\u00e9 de traitement qui est au c\u0153ur des mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00e0 l\u2019endroit des personnes plaignantes dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle est susceptible d\u2019avoir une incidence sur le t\u00e9moignage de tous les t\u00e9moins dans tous les proc\u00e8s. Toutes les parties dans les affaires futures, y compris l\u2019accus\u00e9, peuvent faire valoir que le juge du proc\u00e8s a eu recours \u00e0 des st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes reposant sur d\u2019autres formes analogues d\u2019in\u00e9galit\u00e9 de traitement, et qu\u2019il a donc commis une erreur de droit.\n[55] En plus de ses fondements inad\u00e9quats, la r\u00e8gle propos\u00e9e interagit particuli\u00e8rement mal avec les cas d\u2019infraction d\u2019ordre sexuel \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 les r\u00e8gles soigneusement r\u00e9dig\u00e9es qui r\u00e9gissent maintenant l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation du t\u00e9moignage d\u2019une personne plaignante. La Cour d\u2019appel dans le cas de M. Tsang a reconnu qu\u2019afin que certaines hypoth\u00e8ses logiques concernant une activit\u00e9 sexuelle soient [traduction] \u00ab fond\u00e9es \u00bb sur la preuve, il faudrait une preuve des \u00ab propres penchants de la plaignante \u00bb (par. 19). Dans cette affaire, afin de \u00ab fonder \u00bb la conclusion de la juge du proc\u00e8s selon laquelle il \u00e9tait invraisemblable que la plaignante demande des relations sexuelles brutales, celle\u2011ci aurait d\u2019abord d\u00fb faire l\u2019objet de questions extr\u00eamement indiscr\u00e8tes \u00e0 propos de ses pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences sexuelles ou de ses pratiques ant\u00e9rieures. Dans le cas de M. Kruk, afin de \u00ab fonder \u00bb sur la preuve le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante portant qu\u2019elle ne se trompait pas au sujet de la sensation physique d\u2019une p\u00e9n\u00e9tration p\u00e9no\u2011vaginale, la plaignante aurait d\u00fb t\u00e9moigner sur le fait d\u2019avoir d\u00e9j\u00e0 ressenti cette sensation.\n[56] De cette fa\u00e7on, la r\u00e8gle propos\u00e9e \u00e9largit consid\u00e9rablement la port\u00e9e des questions permises au sujet du comportement sexuel ant\u00e9rieur de la plaignante, exigeant dans les faits que les deux parties demandent l\u2019autorisation, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat Seaboyer (p. 619) ou \u00e0 l\u2019art. 276 du Code , pour pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve concernant \u00ab d\u2019autres comportements sexuels \u00bb qui ne seraient peut\u2011\u00eatre pas pertinents en ce qui a trait aux questions principales de l\u2019affaire ou qui ne seraient pas permis du tout dans le cadre du proc\u00e8s. Elle permet de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9tourn\u00e9e le raisonnement interdit fond\u00e9 sur les deux mythes dans la mesure o\u00f9, dans le cadre du processus consistant \u00e0 \u00ab fonder \u00bb les conclusions du juge du proc\u00e8s concernant le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante, la preuve des comportements sexuels ant\u00e9rieurs de celle\u2011ci peut \u00eatre trait\u00e9e comme logiquement probante quant \u00e0 sa cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 ou \u00e0 son consentement. Bien que formul\u00e9e sous l\u2019angle du traitement \u00ab \u00e9gal \u00bb pour les accus\u00e9s dans de telles affaires, cette approche risque en fait de ressusciter le pr\u00e9jug\u00e9 m\u00eame \u00e0 l\u2019endroit des plaignantes dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle que la r\u00e8gle de droit sur les mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes visait \u00e0 \u00e9liminer.\n[57] En somme, la r\u00e8gle propos\u00e9e interdisant le recours \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques infond\u00e9es ne saurait \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme un prolongement logique des r\u00e8gles de droit interdisant le recours aux st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes. Dans la mesure o\u00f9 elle confond les st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes avec toutes les hypoth\u00e8ses au sujet du comportement humain, elle fait fausse route. Le concept de st\u00e9r\u00e9otype n\u2019est pas ferm\u00e9 et continuera sans doute d\u2019\u00e9voluer dans les affaires futures : plus une erreur se rapproche des types de mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes concernant les personnes plaignantes dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnus dans la jurisprudence, plus elle est susceptible de constituer une erreur de droit. Toutefois, toutes les autres simples hypoth\u00e8ses formul\u00e9es dans le cadre des appr\u00e9ciations de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et de la fiabilit\u00e9, comme les autres conclusions de fait, doivent demeurer assujetties \u00e0 la norme de l\u2019erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante.\n(ii) Les droits de l\u2019accus\u00e9 demeurent prot\u00e9g\u00e9s\n[58] Les intim\u00e9s soutiennent que la r\u00e8gle propos\u00e9e interdisant le recours \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques infond\u00e9es devrait \u00eatre adopt\u00e9e dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle pour des raisons d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 envers l\u2019accus\u00e9. Cet argument doit lui aussi \u00eatre rejet\u00e9. Il existe des protections juridiques fondamentales express\u00e9ment con\u00e7ues pour assurer l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 envers l\u2019accus\u00e9, lesquelles prennent leur source dans leur propre ensemble solide de r\u00e8gles de droit. Il est essentiel que ces protections juridiques soient prises au s\u00e9rieux et qu\u2019on leur donne plein effet pour que les droits constitutionnels de l\u2019accus\u00e9 demeurent pr\u00e9serv\u00e9s. Toutefois, l\u2019id\u00e9e qu\u2019une r\u00e8gle identique appliquant aux accus\u00e9s le m\u00eame traitement relatif aux mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes que celui qui s\u2019applique aux plaignantes s\u2019impose pour atteindre cet objectif n\u2019est pas judicieuse.\n[59] Le principe dominant de la pr\u00e9somption d\u2019innocence, consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019al. 11d) de la Charte , et le principe corr\u00e9latif du fardeau de la preuve qui incombe \u00e0 la Couronne, doivent toujours r\u00e9gir le processus de recherche des faits. La pr\u00e9somption d\u2019innocence \u2014 un \u00ab principe consacr\u00e9 qui se trouve au c\u0153ur m\u00eame du droit criminel \u00bb (R. c. Oakes, [1986] 1 R.C.S. 103, p. 119) \u2014 impose \u00e0 la Couronne le fardeau de prouver tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments essentiels de l\u2019infraction reproch\u00e9e, hors de tout doute raisonnable, avant qu\u2019une d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 puisse \u00eatre inscrite (Osolin). \u00c9troitement li\u00e9 \u00e0 la pr\u00e9somption d\u2019innocence, le droit de l\u2019accus\u00e9 de garder le silence consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019al. 11c) de la Charte prot\u00e8ge la dignit\u00e9 humaine et la vie priv\u00e9e contre les proc\u00e9dures ou le raisonnement qui contraindraient une personne accus\u00e9e \u00e0 s\u2019incriminer par leurs propres mots (R. c. Noble, [1997] 1 R.C.S. 874, par. 69\u201178).\n[60] Diff\u00e9rentes mesures de protection relatives \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9valuation et \u00e0 l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de la preuve d\u00e9coulent de la pr\u00e9somption d\u2019innocence et du droit de garder le silence. Il faut souligner que le silence d\u2019un accus\u00e9 au proc\u00e8s ne peut pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une preuve de culpabilit\u00e9, car un tel raisonnement violerait les deux principes (Noble, par. 72). De plus, il ne convient pas d\u2019\u00e9carter la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de personnes accus\u00e9es au motif que, puisqu\u2019elles sont passibles de sanctions p\u00e9nales, elles diront n\u2019importe quoi pour se prot\u00e9ger. Bien qu\u2019envisager la possibilit\u00e9 que la personne accus\u00e9e ait une raison de mentir n\u2019enfreint pas forc\u00e9ment cette r\u00e8gle, les tribunaux doivent se garder d\u2019aller plus loin et de \u00ab ten[ir] pour acquis, ce qu\u2019il[s] n\u2019[ont] pas le droit de faire \u00bb, qu\u2019elle le fera dans tous les cas (R. c. Laboucan, 2010 CSC 12, [2010] 1 R.C.S. 397, par. 14). Un tel raisonnement repose sur une hypoth\u00e8se de culpabilit\u00e9 et contrevient donc \u00e0 la pr\u00e9somption d\u2019innocence (par. 12).\n[61] La pr\u00e9somption d\u2019innocence restreint \u00e9galement la fa\u00e7on dont la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 est appr\u00e9ci\u00e9e dans les cas o\u00f9 les t\u00e9moins de la d\u00e9fense et ceux de la Couronne pr\u00e9sentent des t\u00e9moignages contradictoires. L\u2019analyse des t\u00e9moignages ne doit jamais \u00eatre trait\u00e9e comme un concours de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9, et le juge des faits n\u2019a pas \u00e0 accepter la preuve de la d\u00e9fense ou sa version des faits pour prononcer un acquittement (R. c. Van, 2009 CSC 22, [2009] 1 R.C.S. 716, par. 23; R. c. W. (D.), [1991] 1 R.C.S. 742, p. 757). L\u2019accus\u00e9 n\u2019a jamais le fardeau d\u2019\u00e9tablir sa propre innocence, et il incombe toujours \u00e0 la Couronne de prouver chaque \u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel de l\u2019infraction (R. c. J.H.S., 2008 CSC 30, [2008] 2 R.C.S. 152, par. 13).\n[62] Le doute raisonnable s\u2019applique aux appr\u00e9ciations de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de sorte que si la preuve produite par la Couronne n\u2019atteint pas le niveau requis pour l\u2019obtention d\u2019une d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9, l\u2019accus\u00e9 ne peut \u00eatre reconnu coupable du seul fait qu\u2019on ne le croit pas (voir W. (D.)). Certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de l\u2019ensemble de la preuve peuvent soulever un doute raisonnable, m\u00eame si on n\u2019ajoute pas foi \u00e0 une grande partie \u2014 ou \u00e0 la totalit\u00e9 \u2014 du t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019accus\u00e9. Tout aspect de la preuve retenue, ou l\u2019absence de preuve, peut fonder un doute raisonnable. De plus, lorsque le juge des faits ne sait pas s\u2019il doit ajouter foi au t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019accus\u00e9, ou ne sait pas qui croire, l\u2019accus\u00e9 a droit \u00e0 l\u2019acquittement (J.H.S., par. 9\u201113; R. c. H. (C.W.) (1991), 68 C.C.C. (3d) 146 (C.A. C.\u2011B.); R. c. S. (W.D.), [1994] 3 R.C.S. 521, p. 533; R. c. Avetysan, 2000 CSC 56, [2000] 2 R.C.S. 745, par. 19). Enfin, lorsque la Couronne s\u2019appuie sur des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve circonstancielle pour \u00e9tablir la culpabilit\u00e9, le juge des faits ne peut d\u00e9clarer l\u2019accus\u00e9 coupable que si la culpabilit\u00e9 est la seule inf\u00e9rence raisonnable pouvant \u00eatre tir\u00e9e de la preuve (R. c. Villaroman, 2016 CSC 33, [2016] 1 R.C.S. 1000, par. 30).\n[63] De telles mesures de protection assurent l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 envers l\u2019accus\u00e9 et doivent guider le juge du proc\u00e8s lorsqu\u2019il appr\u00e9cie les t\u00e9moignages. Elles imposent des interdictions pr\u00e9cises \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de formes reconnaissables de raisonnement inadmissible. Ce faisant, elles pr\u00e9servent les droits fondamentaux de l\u2019accus\u00e9 garantis par la Charte . Lorsqu\u2019on leur donne d\u00fbment plein effet, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019imposer d\u2019autres restrictions sur la fa\u00e7on dont le juge du proc\u00e8s peut appr\u00e9cier la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et la fiabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019accus\u00e9 et de la plaignante qui vont au\u2011del\u00e0 des erreurs de droit existantes et de la norme de l\u2019erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante. M\u00eame lorsque des erreurs de droit reconnues concernant les droits de l\u2019accus\u00e9 ne sont pas en jeu, lorsque l\u2019accus\u00e9 choisit de t\u00e9moigner ou de pr\u00e9senter d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, la juridiction d\u2019appel doit s\u2019assurer que le juge du proc\u00e8s a appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 correctement et en d\u00e9tail la version des faits de l\u2019accus\u00e9. Le recours \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses illogiques, fausses ou autrement inappropri\u00e9es lors de l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation du t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019accus\u00e9 est fautif et peut justifier l\u2019annulation en appel s\u2019il constitue une erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante. Le fait est que de telles hypoth\u00e8ses factuelles ordinaires ne peuvent \u00eatre reconnues, en bloc, comme des erreurs de droit \u00e0 elles seules.\n[64] Il y a \u00e9galement lieu de souligner que le concept des mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes concernant les plaignantes dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle n\u2019est pas sans limites. Il est \u00e0 l\u2019origine d\u2019un ensemble circonscrit de r\u00e8gles juridiques qui doivent \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9es avec prudence, une grande attention au contexte et une compr\u00e9hension nuanc\u00e9e de la fin pour laquelle un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve donn\u00e9 est produit. Selon certains auteurs, la r\u00e8gle de droit relative aux mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes est actuellement surutilis\u00e9e dans des contextes o\u00f9 elle est inapplicable, ou est appliqu\u00e9e sans rigueur (voir, p. ex., L. Dufraimont, \u00ab Current Complications in the Law on Myths and Stereotypes \u00bb (2021), 99 R. du B. can. 536). Si ce probl\u00e8me existe, la solution appropri\u00e9e n\u2019est pas d\u2019\u00e9largir la port\u00e9e des erreurs de droit parall\u00e8les qui s\u2019appliquent tant aux personnes accus\u00e9es qu\u2019aux plaignantes. Les juges doivent plut\u00f4t, en gardant \u00e0 l\u2019esprit que le recours aux mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00e0 l\u2019endroit des plaignantes dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle donne lieu \u00e0 une erreur de droit, s\u2019assurer que ces mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes ne sont pas \u00e9largis au\u2011del\u00e0 de leur port\u00e9e l\u00e9gitime.\n[65] Par exemple, le simple fait que la preuve se trouve \u00e0 correspondre \u00e0 un mythe ou st\u00e9r\u00e9otype ne veut pas n\u00e9cessairement dire que toute inf\u00e9rence pouvant \u00eatre tir\u00e9e de cette preuve sera pr\u00e9judiciable. Bien que ce soit un mythe de pr\u00e9tendre que les femmes inventent couramment des all\u00e9gations d\u2019agression sexuelle, il n\u2019est pas erron\u00e9 de se demander si les circonstances d\u2019une affaire donn\u00e9e \u00e9tayent l\u2019existence d\u2019un motif d\u2019inventer (voir, p. ex., R. c. Esquivel\u2011Benitez, 2020 ONCA 160, 61 C.R. (7th) 326, par. 9\u201115) \u2014 en effet, lorsque la d\u00e9fense pr\u00e9sente des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve sur ce point, le juge du proc\u00e8s est tenu de les prendre en consid\u00e9ration pour donner plein effet \u00e0 la pr\u00e9somption d\u2019innocence, et un d\u00e9faut de le faire constitue une erreur justifiant l\u2019annulation de la d\u00e9cision. De plus, bien que l\u2019art. 276 du Code interdise le recours au comportement sexuel ant\u00e9rieur de la plaignante pour \u00e9tayer l\u2019un des deux mythes, il n\u2019interdit manifestement pas une telle preuve de mani\u00e8re absolue et \u00e0 tous \u00e9gards. Tant qu\u2019elle est ad\u00e9quatement \u00e9valu\u00e9e au regard de l\u2019art. 276, cette preuve peut \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e, par exemple, pour r\u00e9soudre les incoh\u00e9rences entre le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante et celui de l\u2019accus\u00e9 au sujet de leur relation.\n[66] Notre cadre juridique actuel suffit pour faire en sorte que les droits de l\u2019accus\u00e9 demeurent prot\u00e9g\u00e9s dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle. Il est essentiel que les droits de l\u2019accus\u00e9 garantis par la Charte soient soigneusement respect\u00e9s, que tout t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il rend soit d\u00fbment appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 et que le concept des mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes demeure d\u00fbment limit\u00e9 \u00e0 sa juste port\u00e9e. Toutefois, il n\u2019y a pas lieu d\u2019adopter la r\u00e8gle propos\u00e9e interdisant le recours \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques infond\u00e9es afin de corriger toute injustice possible.\n(iii) La diff\u00e9rence entre la conjecture factuelle et la conjecture juridique\n[67] Le glissement conceptuel entre le st\u00e9r\u00e9otype et la g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisation dans la jurisprudence des juridictions inf\u00e9rieures illustre l\u2019importance de d\u00e9finir avec pr\u00e9cision les erreurs de droit et de les diff\u00e9rencier des autres conclusions de fait, m\u00eame celles qui sont erron\u00e9es. Dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, une br\u00e8ve remarque s\u2019impose aussi en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019argument de l\u2019intim\u00e9 M. Tsang portant que la r\u00e8gle propos\u00e9e interdisant le recours \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques infond\u00e9es est une cons\u00e9quence logique de l\u2019erreur de droit qu\u2019est la \u00ab conjecture \u00bb. Soit dit en tout respect, cet argument confond le sens familier de conjecture \u2014 soit tirer des conclusions d\u00e9nu\u00e9es de fondement factuel \u2014 et la forme plus pr\u00e9cise de conjecture consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une erreur de droit.\n[68] La conjecture en tant qu\u2019erreur de droit survient lorsque le juge du proc\u00e8s a conclu qu\u2019un certain \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve \u00ab cr\u00e9e un doute raisonnable sur la culpabilit\u00e9 du pr\u00e9venu alors que, selon une interpr\u00e9tation correcte du droit, cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve ne peut cr\u00e9er un doute raisonnable sur sa culpabilit\u00e9 \u00bb (Wild c. La Reine, [1971] R.C.S. 101, p. 111-112). Autrement dit, c\u2019est une erreur de droit que de ne pas faire de distinction entre une conclusion rationnelle quant au doute raisonnable fond\u00e9e sur la preuve, et une conclusion non \u00e9tay\u00e9e fond\u00e9e sur une conjecture (voir Wild; Rousseau c. La Reine, [1985] 2 R.C.S. 38; R. c. B. (G.), [1990] 2 R.C.S. 57; R. c. Clark, 2015 BCCA 488, 407 D.L.R. (4th) 610, par. 43, conf. par. 2017 CSC 3, [2017] 1 R.C.S. 86). Le terme \u00ab conjecture \u00bb, tel qu\u2019il est employ\u00e9 par les juridictions inf\u00e9rieures, ne renvoie pas \u00e0 cette erreur de droit, mais est plut\u00f4t utilis\u00e9, comme il l\u2019est dans la langue courante, pour d\u00e9signer le fait de tirer toute inf\u00e9rence qui ne s\u2019appuierait pas sur la preuve[2]. Dans la mesure o\u00f9, lorsqu\u2019elles reconnaissent la r\u00e8gle propos\u00e9e, les juridictions inf\u00e9rieures s\u2019appuient sur l\u2019erreur de droit qu\u2019est la conjecture \u2014 ce qui se produit le plus souvent lorsque le juge du proc\u00e8s commet une erreur en acquittant l\u2019accus\u00e9 sur la base d\u2019autres explications conjecturales \u2014, elles \u00e9tirent la jurisprudence au\u2011del\u00e0 de ses cons\u00e9quences logiques.\n(2) La r\u00e8gle propos\u00e9e va \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des normes de contr\u00f4le \u00e9tablies et nuit \u00e0 l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation ad\u00e9quate des t\u00e9moignages\n[69] Bien que la r\u00e8gle propos\u00e9e interdisant le recours \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques infond\u00e9es ait souvent \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9e dans le contexte d\u2019agressions sexuelles, ses applications s\u2019\u00e9tendent \u00e0 toutes les affaires criminelles. Les pr\u00e9sents motifs sont articul\u00e9s principalement dans le contexte de l\u2019agression sexuelle \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019agit de l\u2019infraction dont la Cour est saisie, mais rien dans ceux\u2011ci ne devrait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une approbation de la r\u00e8gle propos\u00e9e dans tout autre cas. Le rejet de la r\u00e8gle dans le contexte des pr\u00e9sents pourvois est fond\u00e9 en partie sur l\u2019ensemble des r\u00e8gles de droit relatives aux mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes eu \u00e9gard aux agressions sexuelles. Toutefois, puisque la r\u00e8gle a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9e dans d\u2019autres contextes[3], ses faiblesses fondamentales s\u2019\u00e9tendent \u00e0 tous les appels en mati\u00e8re criminelle.\n[70] Compte tenu de cela, une autre raison pour laquelle la r\u00e8gle propos\u00e9e ne devrait pas \u00eatre adopt\u00e9e est qu\u2019elle est profond\u00e9ment incompatible avec le droit \u00e9tabli relatif aux conclusions sur la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et la fiabilit\u00e9. La r\u00e8gle n\u2019est pas un prolongement prudent ou progressif des principes existants \u2014 elle repr\u00e9sente plut\u00f4t un \u00e9cart injustifi\u00e9 par rapport \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont les juridictions d\u2019appel traitent habituellement les conclusions des juges du proc\u00e8s sur la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9. En exposant les conclusions des juges du proc\u00e8s \u00e0 un contr\u00f4le en appel abusif, elle cr\u00e9e un s\u00e9rieux obstacle \u00e0 l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation valable des t\u00e9moignages, ce qui cause un pr\u00e9judice qui s\u2019\u00e9tendra \u00e0 tout le droit criminel.\na) Le r\u00f4le du bon sens dans l\u2019\u00e9valuation de la d\u00e9position d\u2019un t\u00e9moin\n[71] D\u2019abord, la r\u00e8gle propos\u00e9e est incompatible avec le r\u00f4le souvent inextricable que jouent les hypoth\u00e8ses logiques dans les appr\u00e9ciations de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et de la fiabilit\u00e9. L\u2019appr\u00e9ciation des t\u00e9moignages s\u2019appuie en grande partie sur le raisonnement par induction et sur les circonstances particuli\u00e8res de l\u2019affaire : le juge des faits doit effectuer les appr\u00e9ciations sur le fondement d\u2019interpr\u00e9tations probables de la preuve (R. c. Calnen, 2019 CSC 6, [2019] 1 R.C.S. 301, par. 111; R. c. Munoz (2006), 86 O.R. (3d) 134 (C.S.J.), par. 23). L\u2019appr\u00e9ciation des t\u00e9moignages d\u00e9pend donc n\u00e9cessairement de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience personnelle que le juge du proc\u00e8s met \u00e0 contribution lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019acquitte de ses fonctions, laquelle influence \u00e0 son tour les inf\u00e9rences logiques qu\u2019il tire de ce qui lui est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9.\n[72] Il est largement reconnu que l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation des t\u00e9moignages exige que le juge des faits se fonde sur des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques concernant la preuve. Dans la d\u00e9cision R. c. Delmas, 2020 ABCA 152, 452 D.L.R. (4th) 375, par. 31, conf. par 2020 CSC 39, [2020] 3 R.C.S. 780, la Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Alberta a not\u00e9 que le juge des faits peut s\u2019appuyer sur la raison et le bon sens, sur son exp\u00e9rience personnelle ainsi que sur la logique lorsqu\u2019il appr\u00e9cie la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9. Dans la d\u00e9cision R. c. R.R., 2018 ABCA 287, 366 C.C.C. (3d) 293, la m\u00eame cour a conclu que le juge des faits [traduction] \u00ab doit invariablement faire appel \u00e0 son bon sens et \u00e0 sa connaissance acquise du comportement humain pour appr\u00e9cier la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et la fiabilit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moins \u00bb (par. 6). Enfin, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. S. (R.D.), [1997] 3 R.C.S. 484, notre Cour a jug\u00e9 que l\u2019exp\u00e9rience personnelle du juge du proc\u00e8s \u2014 bien qu\u2019elle ne constitue \u00e9videmment pas un substitut pour la preuve, et sous r\u00e9serve de limites d\u00fbment fix\u00e9es \u2014 \u00ab est un \u00e9l\u00e9ment important de son aptitude \u00e0 comprendre le comportement humain, \u00e0 soupeser la preuve et \u00e0 appr\u00e9cier la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 \u00bb, et intervient dans une \u00ab myriade de d\u00e9cisions qui doivent \u00eatre prises dans le cours de la plupart des proc\u00e8s \u00bb (par. 13). Le raisonnement quant \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont les gens tendent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00e0 se comporter, et \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont les \u00e9v\u00e9nements tendent \u00e0 se d\u00e9rouler, est non seulement permis, il s\u2019agit souvent d\u2019une composante n\u00e9cessaire de l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation compl\u00e8te d\u2019un t\u00e9moignage.\n[73] Pour leur part, les hypoth\u00e8ses logiques sous\u2011tendent n\u00e9cessairement toutes les appr\u00e9ciations de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et de la fiabilit\u00e9. La cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 ne peut \u00eatre appr\u00e9ci\u00e9e qu\u2019en fonction d\u2019une compr\u00e9hension g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de [traduction] \u00ab la fa\u00e7on dont les choses peuvent se d\u00e9rouler et se d\u00e9roulent effectivement \u00bb; c\u2019est en appliquant le bon sens et en utilisant des g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisations fond\u00e9es sur ses connaissances acquises \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du comportement humain que le juge du proc\u00e8s d\u00e9termine si un r\u00e9cit est plausible ou \u00ab intrins\u00e8quement improbable \u00bb (R. c. Kiss, 2018 ONCA 184, par. 31 (CanLII); R. c. Adebogun, 2021 SKCA 136, [2022] 1 W.W.R. 187, par. 24; R. c. Kontzamanis, 2011 BCCA 184, par. 38 (CanLII)). Le bon sens sous\u2011tend les principes bien \u00e9tablis guidant l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 \u2014 y compris l\u2019id\u00e9e maintenant universelle que les t\u00e9moins qui font des d\u00e9clarations contradictoires sont moins susceptibles de dire la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 \u2014 et contribue \u00e0 \u00e9valuer la port\u00e9e et l\u2019incidence de certaines contradictions. La fiabilit\u00e9 exige aussi le recours \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques concernant la fa\u00e7on dont les t\u00e9moins per\u00e7oivent les renseignements, s\u2019en souviennent, et rapportent l\u2019information, ce qui suppose des g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisations au sujet de la fa\u00e7on dont les individus tendent \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter les renseignements dont ils ont un souvenir exact et complet, par opposition aux questions \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquelles ils n\u2019ont pas de certitude ou se trompent. Le juge du proc\u00e8s peut, par exemple, inf\u00e9rer qu\u2019un t\u00e9moin \u00e9tait cr\u00e9dible, mais non fiable, parce qu\u2019il semblait sinc\u00e8re mais a donn\u00e9 des indices indiquant que ses souvenirs \u00e9taient flous ou incertains (p. ex., des propos ambigus, des expressions comme \u00ab hmm [. . .] voyons voir \u00bb, de longues pauses ou le fait de ne pas donner beaucoup de d\u00e9tails).\n[74] M\u00eame les partisans de la r\u00e8gle interdisant le recours \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques infond\u00e9es acceptent qu\u2019il est n\u00e9cessaire et, dans une certaine mesure, in\u00e9vitable, de se fonder sur le bon sens pour appr\u00e9cier les t\u00e9moignages. Dans le cas de M. Kruk, la Cour d\u2019appel a reconnu qu\u2019en [traduction] \u00ab naviguant dans le terrain min\u00e9 des questions de droit et de preuve, le juge du proc\u00e8s fait appel \u00e0 son bon sens pour appr\u00e9cier la preuve afin d\u2019obtenir des verdicts valables \u00bb (par. 2), et de fait, \u00ab [a]ppr\u00e9cier la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moins en ayant recours \u00e0 son exp\u00e9rience personnelle est une op\u00e9ration quotidienne et indiqu\u00e9e pour le juge du proc\u00e8s \u00bb (par. 41). Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat J.C., la cour a conclu qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de limite au recours au bon sens et \u00e0 l\u2019exp\u00e9rience humaine pour rep\u00e9rer les inf\u00e9rences d\u00e9coulant de la preuve \u2014 sinon, la preuve circonstancielle, qui consiste \u00e0 combler les lacunes entre la preuve et l\u2019inf\u00e9rence tir\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019aide de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience humaine, ne serait pas admissible du tout. La cour a aussi observ\u00e9 \u00e0 juste titre qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucune limite au recours \u00e0 l\u2019exp\u00e9rience humaine pour tirer des inf\u00e9rences de la preuve. Autrement, de nombreux autres principes bien \u00e9tablis en mati\u00e8re de preuve \u2014 comme celui voulant que le fait de fuir les lieux ou de d\u00e9truire la preuve apr\u00e8s une infraction criminelle indique g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement que la culpabilit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 dissimul\u00e9e \u2014 seraient \u00e9galement mis en p\u00e9ril.\n[75] En interdisant le recours \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques infond\u00e9es, la r\u00e8gle propos\u00e9e g\u00eane le recours n\u00e9cessaire au bon sens dans le cadre de l\u2019analyse des t\u00e9moignages. Le juge du proc\u00e8s a la t\u00e2che particuli\u00e8re d\u2019appr\u00e9cier les t\u00e9moignages qu\u2019il entend et d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019\u00e9ventail des inf\u00e9rences possibles d\u00e9coulant de la preuve. Il doit \u00eatre capable de se fonder non seulement sur son exp\u00e9rience judiciaire en tant que juge des faits, mais aussi sur son bon sens et sur les attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es auxquelles celui\u2011ci donne lieu concernant le comportement humain. Le juge du proc\u00e8s s\u2019appuiera naturellement sur des hypoth\u00e8ses \u00ab infond\u00e9es \u00bb concernant le comportement humain lors de l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation des t\u00e9moignages et se sert donc d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments qui ne se trouvent pas dans le dossier dont il est saisi. La fonction judiciaire lui permet de le faire sans que des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve extrins\u00e8ques soient n\u00e9cessaires pour justifier chacune de ses conclusions.\n[76] La raison d\u2019\u00eatre de la r\u00e8gle propos\u00e9e est d\u00e9mentie par une contradiction inh\u00e9rente \u00e0 sa propre logique. Elle interdit le recours au bon sens pour introduire de nouvelles consid\u00e9rations qui ne d\u00e9coulent pas de la preuve \u2014 tout en reconnaissant que le bon sens peut servir d\u2019outil d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation, ce qui suppose n\u00e9cessairement d\u2019incorporer des consid\u00e9rations qui ne d\u00e9coulent pas de la preuve elle\u2011m\u00eame, mais de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience personnelle acquise par le juge. Il est impossible dans les faits de tracer une ligne de d\u00e9marcation claire entre le recours \u00e0 l\u2019exp\u00e9rience humaine pour interpr\u00e9ter la preuve ou tirer des inf\u00e9rences (ce que permet la r\u00e8gle) et l\u2019introduction de nouvelles consid\u00e9rations dans la preuve (ce qu\u2019elle ne permet pas).\n[77] Selon la r\u00e8gle telle qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9e par les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel dans le cas de M. Tsang, un raisonnement inadmissible est d\u00e9crit de la fa\u00e7on suivante : [traduction] \u00ab entach\u00e9 par des hypoth\u00e8ses implicites et infond\u00e9es \u00e0 propos d\u2019un \u201ccomportement normal\u201d \u00bb (par. 53); \u00ab sans fondement, d\u00e9nu\u00e9 de lien avec la preuve et un st\u00e9r\u00e9otype pr\u00e9judiciable \u00bb (par. 65); \u00ab des hypoth\u00e8ses au sujet du comportement humain \u00bb (par. 73); \u00ab des g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisations \u00e0 propos d\u2019un comportement normatif [qui] ne reposaient pas sur la preuve \u00bb (par. 74); des hypoth\u00e8ses ou des \u00ab g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisations \u00bb \u00ab infond\u00e9es \u00bb (par. 84 et 112); et \u00ab des inf\u00e9rences non \u00e9tay\u00e9es \u00bb (par. 115). \u00c0 l\u2019inverse, le raisonnement permis comprend ce qui suit : [traduction] \u00ab . . . une conclusion au sujet de ce que cette plaignante est susceptible d\u2019avoir fait dans ces circonstances \u00bb (par. 39 (en italique dans l\u2019original)); \u00ab la cat\u00e9gorie d\u2019inf\u00e9rences li\u00e9es au comportement que l\u2019on peut tirer \u00e0 juste titre \u00bb et un raisonnement qui \u00ab ne sert pas \u00e0 tirer une inf\u00e9rence \u201cinjuste et inexacte\u201d \u00bb (par. 40). Curieusement, la Cour d\u2019appel dans le cas de M. Tsang a estim\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait permis d\u2019inf\u00e9rer que des gens qui viennent de se rencontrer sont peu susceptibles de vouloir partager le m\u00eame verre, parce qu\u2019une telle inf\u00e9rence est [traduction] \u00ab fond\u00e9e sur le bon sens et [n\u2019est] pas pr\u00e9judiciable \u00bb (par. 40). Pourtant, cette inf\u00e9rence est ind\u00e9niablement une g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisation \u00e0 propos du comportement humain qui ne reposait sur aucune preuve.\n[78] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que le juge du proc\u00e8s va in\u00e9vitablement se fonder sur une hypoth\u00e8se logique \u00e0 un certain moment lorsqu\u2019il appr\u00e9cie la d\u00e9position d\u2019un t\u00e9moin, l\u2019exigence mal d\u00e9finie selon laquelle de telles hypoth\u00e8ses doivent \u00eatre \u00ab fond\u00e9es sur la preuve \u00bb obligerait aussi les avocats dans les affaires criminelles \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve directs pour \u00e9tablir une multitude d\u2019id\u00e9es qui sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement vraies. Revenons \u00e0 l\u2019exemple tir\u00e9 du cas de M. Tsang : pour pouvoir conclure \u00e0 bon droit que des gens qui viennent de se rencontrer sont peu susceptibles de partager le m\u00eame verre dans un bar \u2014 laissant de c\u00f4t\u00e9 la question de savoir si c\u2019est r\u00e9ellement le cas \u2014, la cour aurait besoin d\u2019une preuve directe, provenant vraisemblablement des t\u00e9moins eux\u2011m\u00eames. Cette preuve pourrait notamment comprendre la fa\u00e7on dont les t\u00e9moins interagissent habituellement avec des \u00e9trangers dans un bar, leurs habitudes d\u2019hygi\u00e8ne personnelle et toute inclination ou aversion qu\u2019ils peuvent avoir \u00e0 partager le m\u00eame verre que des gens qu\u2019ils ne connaissent pas ainsi que, vraisemblablement, les raisons sous\u2011jacentes \u00e0 toutes ces propositions. De telles questions sont anodines, prennent \u00e9norm\u00e9ment de temps au proc\u00e8s et n\u2019ont souvent qu\u2019une pertinence minime, voire aucune, pour l\u2019infraction reproch\u00e9e. Particuli\u00e8rement dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle, qui sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 complexes, les complications incroyables qu\u2019occasionnerait ce type d\u2019obligation en mati\u00e8re de preuve ne sauraient \u00eatre sous\u2011estim\u00e9es.\n[79] En somme, la r\u00e8gle propos\u00e9e d\u00e9roge fondamentalement \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation n\u00e9cessaire et appropri\u00e9e du bon sens lors de l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation des d\u00e9positions des t\u00e9moins. Qui pis est, la r\u00e8gle ne cr\u00e9e pas non plus de limites discernables entre l\u2019utilisation permise et l\u2019utilisation non permise des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques. Il n\u2019y a aucun moyen coh\u00e9rent de d\u00e9terminer les hypoth\u00e8ses qui sont suffisamment non controvers\u00e9es pour \u00eatre \u00ab fond\u00e9es sur la preuve \u00bb, ni la quantit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui est n\u00e9cessaire pour les \u00ab fonder \u00bb. Comme il est expliqu\u00e9 plus loin, la r\u00e8gle semble plut\u00f4t r\u00e9duire cette question \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une cour d\u2019appel si\u00e9geant en r\u00e9vision jugerait juste, exact ou non controvers\u00e9. La r\u00e8gle invite donc les juridictions d\u2019appel \u00e0 substituer leurs opinions sur les g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisations qui sont appropri\u00e9es ou utiles dans une situation donn\u00e9e \u00e0 celles du juge du proc\u00e8s, ce qui transforme irr\u00e9guli\u00e8rement leur \u00ab forte opposition aux inf\u00e9rences factuelles [d\u2019un] juge du proc\u00e8s [. . .] [en] de pr\u00e9tendues erreurs de droit \u00bb (R. c. George, 2017 CSC 38, [2017] 1 R.C.S. 1021, par. 17; m.a. (Tsang), par. 74). Cette dynamique est source d\u2019incertitude et d\u2019injustice en appel.\nb) Normes de contr\u00f4le \u00e9tablies \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des appr\u00e9ciations de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et de la fiabilit\u00e9\n[80] La r\u00e8gle propos\u00e9e va \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des normes de contr\u00f4le bien \u00e9tablies et \u00e9largirait ind\u00fbment la port\u00e9e de l\u2019intervention en appel aux appr\u00e9ciations de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et de la fiabilit\u00e9 par le juge du proc\u00e8s. L\u2019adoption de la r\u00e8gle compromettrait la t\u00e2che d\u00e9licate qu\u2019entreprend celui\u2011ci lorsqu\u2019il \u00e9value la d\u00e9position d\u2019un t\u00e9moin car elle soumettrait ses motifs \u00e0 un examen en appel ind\u00fbment intrusif.\n[81] Les appr\u00e9ciations de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et de la fiabilit\u00e9 peuvent \u00eatre les d\u00e9cisions judiciaires les plus importantes dans un proc\u00e8s criminel, et comptent certainement parmi les plus difficiles \u00e0 prendre. Cela est particuli\u00e8rement vrai dans les cas d\u2019agression sexuelle, lesquels comportent souvent des actes qui auraient eu lieu en priv\u00e9 et qui reposent sur les d\u00e9positions contradictoires de deux t\u00e9moins. En ayant recours \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble de la preuve, le juge du proc\u00e8s est tenu d\u2019\u00e9valuer la d\u00e9position de chaque t\u00e9moin et de tirer des conclusions qui sont enti\u00e8rement personnelles et propres \u00e0 cet individu. Les appr\u00e9ciations de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et de la fiabilit\u00e9 sont aussi tributaires du contexte et multifactorielles : elles ne se font pas selon une m\u00e9thode pr\u00e9\u00e9tablie et sont \u00ab plus \u201cun art qu\u2019une science\u201d \u00bb (S. (R.D.), par. 128; R. c. Gagnon, 2006 CSC 17, [2006] 1 R.C.S. 621)[4]. Pour ce qui est de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 en particulier, alors qu\u2019il est essentiel que les motifs soient coh\u00e9rents, il est souvent difficile pour le juge du proc\u00e8s d\u2019exprimer pourquoi il a cru ou non un t\u00e9moin \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 \u00ab l\u2019enchev\u00eatrement complexe des impressions qui se d\u00e9gagent de l\u2019observation et de l\u2019audition des t\u00e9moins, ainsi que des efforts de conciliation des diff\u00e9rentes versions des faits \u00bb (Gagnon, par. 20; voir aussi R. c.

La t\u00e2che s\u2019av\u00e8re encore plus compliqu\u00e9e du fait que le juge du proc\u00e8s peut accepter certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de la d\u00e9position d\u2019un t\u00e9moin, tous ses \u00e9l\u00e9ments ou aucun d\u2019entre eux.\n[82] La norme de contr\u00f4le applicable aux conclusions sur la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et la fiabilit\u00e9 est bien \u00e9tablie : \u00e0 d\u00e9faut d\u2019une erreur de droit reconnue, il y a lieu de faire preuve de d\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de telles conclusions, sauf si une erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante peut \u00eatre d\u00e9montr\u00e9e (Gagnon, par. 10, citant Schwartz c. Canada, [1996] 1 R.C.S. 254, par. 32\u201133; H.L. c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2005 CSC 25, [2005] 1 R.C.S. 401, par. 74). Les conclusions relatives \u00e0 la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et \u00e0 la fiabilit\u00e9 ne mettent habituellement pas en jeu des erreurs de droit, car elles se rapportent essentiellement \u00e0 la mesure dans laquelle un juge s\u2019est fond\u00e9 sur un facteur en particulier et \u00e0 la mesure dans laquelle ce facteur est \u00e9troitement li\u00e9 \u00e0 la preuve. Bien que de telles conclusions puissent \u00eatre infirm\u00e9es selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte si des erreurs de droit sont r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9es, il est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable dans la plupart des cas de les examiner selon la norme nuanc\u00e9e et holistique de l\u2019erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante \u2014 laquelle commande la d\u00e9f\u00e9rence envers les conclusions du juge du proc\u00e8s, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 en contact direct avec les t\u00e9moins.\n[83] Le juge du proc\u00e8s poss\u00e8de l\u2019expertise pour appr\u00e9cier et soupeser les faits, et ses d\u00e9cisions refl\u00e8tent une familiarit\u00e9 qui ne vient qu\u2019avec le fait d\u2019avoir si\u00e9g\u00e9 tout au long de l\u2019affaire. Les raisons pour lesquelles la d\u00e9f\u00e9rence s\u2019impose \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des conclusions du juge du proc\u00e8s sur la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et les faits comprennent notamment les suivantes : (1) limiter le co\u00fbt, le nombre et la dur\u00e9e des appels; (2) promouvoir l\u2019autonomie et l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du proc\u00e8s; et (3) reconna\u00eetre l\u2019expertise et la position avantageuse du juge du proc\u00e8s (Housen c. Nikolaisen, 2002 CSC 33, [2002] 2 R.C.S. 235, par. 12\u201118). Puisqu\u2019il est difficile en pratique d\u2019expliquer la constellation d\u2019impressions qui a men\u00e9 \u00e0 de telles conclusions, il est bien \u00e9tabli qu\u2019une \u00ab d\u00e9f\u00e9rence particuli\u00e8re \u00bb devrait \u00eatre accord\u00e9e aux conclusions sur la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 (G.F., par. 81). Les juridictions d\u2019appel sont comparativement mal outill\u00e9es pour appr\u00e9cier la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et la fiabilit\u00e9, car elles n\u2019examinent que les transcriptions des t\u00e9moignages et s\u2019attachent souvent particuli\u00e8rement, voire de fa\u00e7on focalisatrice, \u00e0 des questions pr\u00e9cises plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019ensemble de l\u2019affaire et de la preuve (Housen, par. 14, citant R. D. Gibbens, \u00ab Appellate Review of Findings of Fact \u00bb (1991\u201192), 13 Advocates\u2019 Q. 445, p. 446).\n[84] La nature particuli\u00e8re de l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation des t\u00e9moignages guide \u00e9galement la fa\u00e7on dont les tribunaux charg\u00e9s de la r\u00e9vision abordent leur t\u00e2che en appel. La juridiction d\u2019appel doit \u00eatre consciente des difficult\u00e9s pratiques consid\u00e9rables auxquelles fait face le juge du proc\u00e8s lorsqu\u2019il exprime pourquoi il a cru ou non un t\u00e9moin en particulier, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il est charg\u00e9 d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter les diverses impressions et inf\u00e9rences qui d\u00e9coulent de la preuve (Gagnon, par. 20; voir aussi R.E.M., par. 28; G.F., par. 81). La juridiction d\u2019appel doit examiner les motifs du juge du proc\u00e8s dans leur ensemble et s\u2019abstenir de se livrer \u00e0 l\u2019analyse de leurs \u00ab composantes linguistiques individuelles \u00bb, puisqu\u2019une approche aussi intrusive \u00ab sap[erait] le r\u00f4le du juge du proc\u00e8s dans l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de l\u2019ensemble de la preuve \u00bb (Gagnon, par. 19; voir aussi Housen, par. 72; G.F., par. 69; R. c. Chung, 2020 CSC 8, [2020] 1 R.C.S. 405, par. 33; R.E.M., par. 35 et 54). La n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019examiner tout le dossier et d\u2019adopter une approche compl\u00e8te, souple et fonctionnelle lors de l\u2019examen des conclusions d\u2019un juge du proc\u00e8s est li\u00e9e \u00e0 la nature du processus d\u00e9cisionnel au proc\u00e8s : les motifs de jugement [traduction] \u00ab ne sont pas cens\u00e9s exprimer int\u00e9gralement le raisonnement qui a men\u00e9 le juge \u00e0 un verdict et ne doivent pas \u00eatre per\u00e7us comme tels \u00bb (R. c. Morrissey (1995), 22 O.R. (3d) 514 (C.A.), p. 525).\n[85] La norme de l\u2019erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante \u00e9tablit un juste \u00e9quilibre entre la d\u00e9f\u00e9rence applicable aux conclusions de fait du juge du proc\u00e8s et la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 que les affaires criminelles fassent l\u2019objet d\u2019une r\u00e9vision valable en appel. Bien que cette norme accorde comme il se doit la d\u00e9f\u00e9rence au point de vue et \u00e0 l\u2019expertise unique du juge du proc\u00e8s, m\u00eame selon cette norme plus d\u00e9f\u00e9rente, les juridictions d\u2019appel doivent \u00e9tablir si les conclusions du juge du proc\u00e8s sur la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et la fiabilit\u00e9 sont [traduction] \u00ab le produit d\u2019une appr\u00e9ciation fond\u00e9e sur la preuve et propre au contexte \u00bb de la d\u00e9position du t\u00e9moin (R. c. Pastro, 2021 BCCA 149, 71 C.R. (7th) 296, par. 67). Le juge du proc\u00e8s doit [traduction] \u00ab formuler clairement \u00bb le fondement de son appr\u00e9ciation et indiquer \u00ab un lien avec les faits de l\u2019affaire \u00bb plut\u00f4t que de se fonder sur \u00ab des hypoth\u00e8ses concernant la conduite ou les r\u00e9ponses attendues \u00bb (Tanovich, p. 92). Pourtant, la r\u00e8gle propos\u00e9e interdisant le recours \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques infond\u00e9es mine la raison d\u2019\u00eatre de la norme de l\u2019erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante en invitant les juridictions d\u2019appel \u00e0 se pencher sur le langage pr\u00e9cis d\u2019un raisonnement donn\u00e9 fond\u00e9 sur le bon sens et \u00e0 l\u2019examiner minutieusement selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte. L\u2019examen en appel qui suit devient rapidement tr\u00e8s interventionniste, lourd et presque enti\u00e8rement impr\u00e9visible.\n[86] Sur la base de la r\u00e8gle propos\u00e9e, les juridictions d\u2019appel ont \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9es \u00e0 d\u00e9cortiquer les motifs de premi\u00e8re instance, \u00e0 attaquer les d\u00e9clarations g\u00e9n\u00e9riques faites dans le cadre des appr\u00e9ciations de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et \u00e0 qualifier toute conclusion sur la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 qui repose sur le comportement humain de st\u00e9r\u00e9otype inadmissible ou d\u2019hypoth\u00e8se logique non fond\u00e9e sur la preuve. Dans les d\u00e9cisions Perkins, Cepic, Roth et J.C., les cours d\u2019appel ont annul\u00e9 les d\u00e9clarations de culpabilit\u00e9 en raison d\u2019erreurs commises par les juges du proc\u00e8s dans les appr\u00e9ciations de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9, concluant que ces derniers \u00e9taient all\u00e9s au\u2011del\u00e0 des inf\u00e9rences logiques permises et s\u2019\u00e9taient livr\u00e9s \u00e0 un raisonnement non fond\u00e9 sur la preuve. Dans d\u2019autres cas, un examen des conclusions dans leur ensemble d\u00e9montrait que les juges du proc\u00e8s n\u2019avaient eu recours \u00e0 aucune hypoth\u00e8se infond\u00e9e, et que les appr\u00e9ciations de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 avaient plut\u00f4t \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9es en fonction des parties et des circonstances devant la cour. La jurisprudence dans ce domaine est variable, m\u00eame volatile, et illustre la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019une m\u00e9thode de r\u00e9vision en appel plus uniforme (voir Perkins; Roth; Cepic; J.C.; voir, contra, Pastro, par. 68\u201169; R. c. Greif, 2021 BCCA 187, par. 68\u201169 (CanLII); Adebogun; R. c. Al\u2011Rawi, 2021 NSCA 86, 410 C.C.C. (3d) 385; R. c. K.B.W., 2022 SKCA 8; R. c. L.L., 2022 ONCA 50; R. c. Lapierre, 2022 NSCA 12; Kritik\u2011Langer c. R., 2022 QCCA 657; R. c. Kavanagh, 2022 BCCA 225; R. c. D.B., 2022 SKCA 76, 415 C.C.C. (3d) 455; R. c. S.A., 2022 ONCA 642; R. c. S.M., 2023 ONCA 417).\n[87] Soit dit en tout respect, la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019appel dans le cas de M. Tsang illustre la forme d\u2019examen microscopique en appel contre laquelle notre Cour a formul\u00e9 une mise en garde. La Cour d\u2019appel a cibl\u00e9 des choix de mots pr\u00e9cis, approuvant certaines formulations des conclusions de la juge du proc\u00e8s sur la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 tout en laissant entendre que des choix de mots m\u00eame l\u00e9g\u00e8rement diff\u00e9rents auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 erron\u00e9s. Par exemple, en statuant que la juge du proc\u00e8s ne s\u2019est pas fond\u00e9e sur une g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisation pr\u00e9judiciable lorsqu\u2019elle a refus\u00e9 de croire que la plaignante avait exprim\u00e9 physiquement son int\u00e9r\u00eat envers l\u2019accus\u00e9 sur la piste de danse, la cour a soulign\u00e9 que la [traduction] \u00ab juge du proc\u00e8s n\u2019a pas simplement conclu qu\u2019on \u201cne pouvait ajouter foi\u201d \u00bb \u00e0 cette id\u00e9e mais \u00ab qu\u2019on ne pouvait y ajouter foi dans les circonstances \u00bb (par. 33 (en italique dans l\u2019original)). De m\u00eame, en approuvant la conclusion de la juge du proc\u00e8s selon laquelle il \u00e9tait peu probable que les parties aient partag\u00e9 le m\u00eame verre parce qu\u2019elles ne se connaissaient pas, la cour a conclu : [traduction] \u00ab Il importe de souligner [. . .] que la juge du proc\u00e8s n\u2019a pas affirm\u00e9 que le t\u00e9moignage de [M. Tsang] voulant qu\u2019ils aient partag\u00e9 le m\u00eame verre \u00e9tait \u201cnon digne de foi\u201d, il \u00e9tait simplement \u201cpeu probable\u201d que cela se soit produit \u00bb (par. 40).\n[88] La r\u00e8gle propos\u00e9e risque \u00e9galement de d\u00e9placer l\u2019accent que mettent les motifs du juge du proc\u00e8s sur la vraisemblance pour le faire passer \u00e0 des questions de forme plut\u00f4t que de fond, ce qui aurait un effet paralysant sur la r\u00e9daction de motifs exhaustifs et francs. Selon la r\u00e8gle, un juge du proc\u00e8s serait autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer invraisemblable que x, y, ou z soit arriv\u00e9 dans les circonstances de l\u2019affaire \u2014 mais il ne serait pas autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 simplement \u00e9noncer la pr\u00e9misse logique qui sous\u2011tend cette conclusion d\u2019invraisemblance, de crainte qu\u2019une juridiction d\u2019appel juge cette pr\u00e9misse \u00ab non fond\u00e9e \u00bb sur la preuve au proc\u00e8s. Le barom\u00e8tre inexprim\u00e9 \u00e0 la base de la vraisemblance est une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e quant \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re dont les \u00e9v\u00e9nements tendent \u00e0 se d\u00e9rouler et dont les gens tendent \u00e0 se comporter dans des situations pr\u00e9cises, ce qui veut dire que les hypoth\u00e8ses logiques repr\u00e9sentent un \u00e9talon n\u00e9cessaire en fonction duquel la vraisemblance d\u2019un r\u00e9cit peut \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9e. Toutefois, la r\u00e8gle propos\u00e9e m\u00e8ne les juges \u00e0 une impasse, car les motifs de ceux\u2011ci (interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s de mani\u00e8re fonctionnelle et contextuelle) doivent indiquer \u00e0 la fois le \u00ab r\u00e9sultat \u00bb et le \u00ab pourquoi \u00bb (G.F., par. 68\u201170).\n[89] Cette forme de r\u00e9vision en appel va directement \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des principes \u00e9tablis et m\u00e8ne \u00e0 des r\u00e9sultats arbitraires. \u00c0 mon avis, elle ne sert pas les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la justice. Dans la mesure o\u00f9 le juge du proc\u00e8s est celui qui a entendu les t\u00e9moignages, il est le mieux plac\u00e9 pour tirer les conclusions de fait complexes et \u00e0 multiples facettes qui aboutissent \u00e0 une appr\u00e9ciation juste et nuanc\u00e9e de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9. Il convient de faire preuve de d\u00e9f\u00e9rence envers les appr\u00e9ciations faites par le juge du proc\u00e8s de cette preuve et des mots qu\u2019il a choisis pour les d\u00e9crire.\n[90] En g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, l\u2019introduction de nouvelles erreurs de droit risque de rompre l\u2019\u00e9quilibre \u00e9tabli en ce qui concerne les conclusions relatives \u00e0 la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et \u00e0 la fiabilit\u00e9. La r\u00e9vision fond\u00e9e sur une erreur de droit peut appeler une r\u00e9ponse du genre \u00ab oui\u2011non \u00bb mesur\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019aune de la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte, qui ouvre la porte \u00e0 un examen ind\u00fbment approfondi des questions dont le juge du proc\u00e8s est r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement saisi. Dans une certaine mesure, l\u2019analyse de l\u2019importance associ\u00e9e \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle interdisant le recours \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques infond\u00e9es \u2014 selon laquelle l\u2019appelant doit d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019un tel raisonnement [traduction] \u00ab a compt\u00e9 dans la conclusion de fait attaqu\u00e9e \u00bb (J.C., par. 100) \u2014 att\u00e9nue le caract\u00e8re cat\u00e9gorique d\u2019une erreur de droit. J\u2019estime toutefois qu\u2019il demeure pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de d\u00e9terminer si une erreur a m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 commise selon la norme de l\u2019erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante. Une erreur d\u00e9terminante est forc\u00e9ment importante, car il faut d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019elle a influ\u00e9 sur la d\u00e9cision du juge du proc\u00e8s \u2014 mais il importe de souligner qu\u2019une erreur d\u00e9terminante influe non seulement sur une conclusion de fait isol\u00e9e, qui peut avoir ou non jou\u00e9 sur le r\u00e9sultat, mais aussi sur la d\u00e9cision du juge du proc\u00e8s dans son ensemble. Il ne suffit pas que l\u2019appelant qui invoque une erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante tire sur les feuilles et les branches et laisse l\u2019arbre debout; l\u2019arbre tout entier doit tomber (South Yukon Forest Corp. c. Canada, 2012 CAF 165, par. 46 (CanLII), cit\u00e9 dans Benhaim c. St\u2011Germain, 2016 CSC 48, [2016] 2 R.C.S. 352, par. 38, et Salomon c. Matte\u2011Thompson, 2019 CSC 14, [2019] 1 R.C.S. 729, par. 116).\n[91] Dans l\u2019ensemble, la norme de l\u2019erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante favorise une conception d\u00fbment holistique de la r\u00e9vision en appel. En comparaison \u00e0 la d\u00e9marche intrusive associ\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019erreur de droit propos\u00e9e, la norme de l\u2019erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante est beaucoup mieux adapt\u00e9e \u00e0 la d\u00e9f\u00e9rence dont il convient de faire preuve envers les conclusions de fait du juge du proc\u00e8s, y compris les conclusions relatives \u00e0 la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et la fiabilit\u00e9. Il est tout simplement inutile que la Cour approuve une d\u00e9rogation \u00e0 cette approche \u00e9tablie \u2014 et \u00e0 plus forte raison une d\u00e9rogation \u00e0 ce point importante \u2014 en reconnaissant une nouvelle erreur dont les r\u00e9percussions profondes se propageraient dans tout le droit criminel.\n(3) R\u00e9sum\u00e9\n[92] Pour les motifs expos\u00e9s pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, la r\u00e8gle propos\u00e9e interdisant le recours \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques infond\u00e9es ne devrait pas \u00eatre reconnue comme donnant lieu \u00e0 une erreur de droit. La r\u00e8gle n\u2019est aucunement analogue \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble des r\u00e8gles de droit qui prot\u00e8gent les plaignantes dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle contre les mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes, et ne peut pas non plus se justifier comme \u00e9tant n\u00e9cessaire pour assurer l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 envers l\u2019accus\u00e9. De plus, elle traite toute hypoth\u00e8se de fait tir\u00e9e lors de l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation des t\u00e9moignages comme une erreur de droit, et repr\u00e9sente donc une rupture injustifi\u00e9e avec les principes bien \u00e9tablis r\u00e9gissant l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation des t\u00e9moignages et les normes de contr\u00f4le en appel.\n[93] Sans la r\u00e8gle dont il est question, les juridictions d\u2019appel doivent s\u2019en remettre au droit existant et bien \u00e9tabli pour \u00e9valuer les appr\u00e9ciations par le juge du proc\u00e8s de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 ou de la fiabilit\u00e9. Pour \u00eatre le plus clair possible, on peut r\u00e9sumer le cadre d\u2019analyse applicable de la fa\u00e7on suivante.\n[94] En premier lieu, lorsqu\u2019un appelant soutient que le juge du proc\u00e8s a eu recours \u00e0 tort \u00e0 une hypoth\u00e8se \u00ab logique \u00bb lors de son appr\u00e9ciation des t\u00e9moignages, la cour charg\u00e9e de la r\u00e9vision devrait d\u2019abord se demander si l\u2019affirmation contest\u00e9e est v\u00e9ritablement une hypoth\u00e8se. Compte tenu de la fa\u00e7on dont les t\u00e9moins d\u00e9posent et de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de lire les motifs du juge du proc\u00e8s dans leur ensemble, ce qui semble \u00eatre une hypoth\u00e8se \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue peut en fait \u00eatre une conclusion particuli\u00e8re sur le t\u00e9moin que le juge a tir\u00e9e \u00e0 partir de la preuve.\n[95] En second lieu, une fois convaincue que le juge du proc\u00e8s s\u2019est, dans les faits, fond\u00e9 sur une hypoth\u00e8se qui va au\u2011del\u00e0 des limites de ce qu\u2019appuient le bon sens et la fonction judiciaire, la cour charg\u00e9e de la r\u00e9vision devrait \u00e9tablir la norme de contr\u00f4le qu\u2019il convient d\u2019appliquer \u00e0 la portion contest\u00e9e de l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation par le juge du proc\u00e8s de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 ou de la fiabilit\u00e9.\n[96] La norme de contr\u00f4le applicable sera celle de la d\u00e9cision correcte si l\u2019erreur all\u00e9gu\u00e9e est une erreur de droit reconnue. Rien dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs ne doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme limitant la port\u00e9e des erreurs de droit existantes concernant les appr\u00e9ciations des t\u00e9moignages que notre Cour a d\u00e9j\u00e0 approuv\u00e9es. De telles erreurs peuvent comprendre le recours aux mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00e0 l\u2019endroit des plaignantes dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses d\u00e9plac\u00e9es et erron\u00e9es au sujet des personnes accus\u00e9es qui sont contraires aux principes fondamentaux comme le droit de garder le silence et la pr\u00e9somption d\u2019innocence. Les appr\u00e9ciations des t\u00e9moignages peuvent aussi \u00eatre susceptibles de r\u00e9vision selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte en raison d\u2019une crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9 (S. (R.D.), par. 91\u2011141), au motif qu\u2019une conclusion de fait qui n\u2019est fond\u00e9e sur aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve a \u00e9t\u00e9 tir\u00e9e (R. c. J.M.H., 2011 CSC 45, [2011] 3 R.C.S. 197, par. 25; Schuldt c. La Reine, [1985] 2 R.C.S. 592, p. 604) et au motif qu\u2019il y a eu prise de connaissance d\u2019office de mani\u00e8re inappropri\u00e9e (voir, p. ex., R. c. Poperechny, 2020 MBCA 81, 396 C.C.C. (3d) 478). Comme nous l\u2019avons vu, le recours \u00e0 des st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes autres que les mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00e0 l\u2019endroit des personnes plaignantes dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle, mais qui reposent de fa\u00e7on similaire sur des in\u00e9galit\u00e9s de traitement, peuvent aussi constituer des erreurs de droit, et toutes les parties peuvent faire valoir de tels arguments dans des affaires futures. La liste d\u2019erreurs de droit n\u2019est pas exhaustive \u2014 mais la r\u00e8gle interdisant les hypoth\u00e8ses logiques infond\u00e9es ne figure pas sur celle\u2011ci.\n[97] En l\u2019absence d\u2019une erreur de droit, la norme de contr\u00f4le sera celle de l\u2019erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante. La cour charg\u00e9e de la r\u00e9vision doit d\u2019abord d\u00e9terminer si le recours erron\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se est manifeste, en ce que cette erreur est \u00ab tout \u00e0 fait \u00e9vidente \u00bb, \u00ab clairement relev\u00e9e \u00bb ou \u00ab \u00e9vidente \u00bb (voir Housen, par. 5\u20116; R. c. Clark, 2005 CSC 2, [2005] 1 R.C.S. 6, par. 9; Benhaim, par. 38, citant South Yukon Forest Corp., par. 46). Les erreurs manifestes dans ce contexte comprendront, par exemple, les cas o\u00f9 il est \u00e9vident que l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se en question est fausse \u00e0 sa face m\u00eame, ou les cas o\u00f9 elle est fausse ou inapplicable \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve retenus ou des conclusions de fait. Bien que le juge du proc\u00e8s soit manifestement le mieux plac\u00e9 pour tirer des conclusions de fait et pour \u00e9valuer l\u2019exactitude des g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisations, la cour d\u2019appel peut mettre en balance l\u2019obligation de faire preuve de d\u00e9f\u00e9rence envers ces conclusions et l\u2019emploi de son propre bon sens pour \u00e9tablir si la pr\u00e9somption \u00e9tait manifestement illogique ou non justifi\u00e9e de sorte qu\u2019elle constitue une erreur manifeste. Les cours d\u2019appel doivent r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement se pencher, par exemple, sur la question de savoir si, \u00ab selon la logique et l\u2019exp\u00e9rience humaine \u00bb, un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve en particulier \u00e9tait pertinent ou si la conduite apr\u00e8s le fait de l\u2019accus\u00e9 concordait avec celle d\u2019une personne coupable (R. c. Corbett, [1988] 1 R.C.S. 670, p. 715; voir R. c. White, 2011 CSC 13, [2011] 1 R.C.S. 433, par. 17). Dans le contexte des g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisations de fait, tant que l\u2019\u00e9valuation demeure ax\u00e9e sur la question de savoir s\u2019il y avait une erreur manifeste, une telle op\u00e9ration demeure une partie int\u00e9grante de la fonction judiciaire d\u2019une cour charg\u00e9e de la r\u00e9vision.\n[98] Une fois qu\u2019une erreur manifeste a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cel\u00e9e, la cour charg\u00e9e de la r\u00e9vision doit aussi conclure que le recours erron\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se \u00e9tait d\u00e9terminant, en ce sens qu\u2019il est \u00ab d\u00e9montr[\u00e9] qu\u2019[il] a influ\u00e9 sur le r\u00e9sultat \u00bb ou qu\u2019il \u00ab touche directement \u00e0 l\u2019issue de l\u2019affaire \u00bb (Clark (2005), par. 9; Benhaim, par. 38, citant South Yukon Forest Corp., par. 46). S\u2019il ne peut \u00eatre d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que l\u2019erreur \u00e9tait manifeste et d\u00e9terminante, l\u2019\u00e9valuation par le juge du proc\u00e8s de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 ou de la fiabilit\u00e9 commandera la d\u00e9f\u00e9rence et il n\u2019y aura aucune raison justifiant une intervention en appel.\n[99] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que j\u2019ai conclu que la violation de la r\u00e8gle propos\u00e9e interdisant le recours \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques infond\u00e9es ne devrait pas \u00eatre reconnue comme une erreur de droit, bon nombre des hypoth\u00e8ses relev\u00e9es dans les d\u00e9cisions rendues par les juridictions inf\u00e9rieures, y compris celles dans les affaires dont notre Cour est saisie, auraient d\u00fb en fait \u00eatre r\u00e9vis\u00e9es selon la norme de l\u2019erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante. Une telle approche accorde la d\u00e9f\u00e9rence qui s\u2019impose aux conclusions de fait du juge du proc\u00e8s et au r\u00f4le que joue le bon sens dans son appr\u00e9ciation des t\u00e9moignages. Par ailleurs, il convient \u00e9galement de souligner que le bon sens n\u2019est pas une expression fourre\u2011tout qui autorise toute forme de raisonnement, peu importe \u00e0 quel point il est erron\u00e9. Le bon sens n\u2019est pas toujours \u00ab bon \u00bb, n\u2019a pas toujours de \u00ab sens \u00bb et, pis encore, il peut \u00eatre fond\u00e9 sur des fausset\u00e9s ou des croyances discriminatoires. Cependant, tant et aussi longtemps que le recours au bon sens par le juge du proc\u00e8s est limit\u00e9 comme il se doit par les principes juridiques applicables \u00e0 la r\u00e9vision en appel en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, il n\u2019y a rien de fondamentalement r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible dans son utilisation pour l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation des t\u00e9moignages. Dans les cas o\u00f9 les limites permises du bon sens ont \u00e9t\u00e9 outrepass\u00e9es, une juridiction d\u2019appel peut intervenir. Comme l\u2019a exprim\u00e9 succinctement le juge d\u2019appel Fitch, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Pastro (par. 41) :\n[traduction] Les juges sont autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 se fonder sur leur exp\u00e9rience personnelle pour tirer des conclusions relatives \u00e0 la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9, et il est attendu qu\u2019ils le fassent. Cela comprend n\u00e9cessairement le fait de tirer des inf\u00e9rences fond\u00e9es sur le bon sens \u00e0 partir des faits \u00e9tablis. Les jur\u00e9s re\u00e7oivent r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement des directives en ce sens \u2014 soit d\u2019en arriver \u00e0 des conclusions fond\u00e9es sur le bon sens en fonction des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve auxquels ils donnent foi. Lorsqu\u2019il ressort d\u2019un examen de l\u2019ensemble des motifs qu\u2019une appr\u00e9ciation de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 repose sur la preuve, et est le fruit d\u2019une d\u00e9cision propre aux faits de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce quant \u00e0 ce que la personne plaignante et la personne accus\u00e9e ont fait ou n\u2019ont pas fait, rien ne justifie une intervention en appel, en l\u2019absence d\u2019une erreur de fait manifeste et d\u00e9terminante . . . [Je souligne; r\u00e9f\u00e9rences omises.]\nIV. Application\n[100] Ayant rejet\u00e9 la r\u00e8gle propos\u00e9e, je suis d\u2019avis de faire droit aux deux pourvois et de r\u00e9tablir les d\u00e9clarations de culpabilit\u00e9. Dans les deux cas, la Cour d\u2019appel a commis une erreur en ayant recours \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle interdisant le recours \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques infond\u00e9es et en proc\u00e9dant \u00e0 la r\u00e9vision des g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisations erron\u00e9es all\u00e9gu\u00e9es selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte. Par cons\u00e9quent, la cour n\u2019a pas proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019analyse contextuelle et fonctionnelle requise, ce qui l\u2019a amen\u00e9e \u00e0 infirmer les d\u00e9cisions des juges du proc\u00e8s sans raison valable.\n[101] Soit dit avec \u00e9gards, l\u2019approche de la Cour d\u2019appel dans les deux affaires t\u00e9moigne des probl\u00e8mes fondamentaux concernant la r\u00e8gle interdisant le recours \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques infond\u00e9es. La r\u00e8gle invitait la cour \u00e0 d\u00e9cortiquer les motifs des juges du proc\u00e8s afin de d\u00e9celer toute hypoth\u00e8se formul\u00e9e dans leurs appr\u00e9ciations de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et de la fiabilit\u00e9, ce qui a eu l\u2019effet malencontreux que des phrases pr\u00e9cises utilis\u00e9es par les juges du proc\u00e8s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 identifi\u00e9es \u00e0 tort comme des \u00ab hypoth\u00e8ses \u00bb, et ces conclusions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 dissoci\u00e9es de leur contexte et des motifs dans leur ensemble. En allant encore plus loin et en \u00e9levant les hypoth\u00e8ses all\u00e9gu\u00e9es au rang d\u2019erreurs de droit, la cour a appliqu\u00e9 la mauvaise norme de contr\u00f4le. Par cons\u00e9quent, dans les deux cas, bon nombre des hypoth\u00e8ses cern\u00e9es par la cour n\u2019en \u00e9taient pas du tout, ou \u00e9taient des conclusions de fait ordinaires susceptibles de r\u00e9vision selon la norme de l\u2019erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante.\nA. Monsieur Kruk\n[102] Dans le cas de M. Kruk, la Cour d\u2019appel a eu tort de conclure que le juge du proc\u00e8s avait eu recours \u00e0 un raisonnement conjectural lorsqu\u2019il a retenu le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante sur la base de son observation selon laquelle il \u00ab est extr\u00eamement improbable qu\u2019une femme se trompe sur [la] sensation [d\u2019avoir un p\u00e9nis en elle] \u00bb (motifs de premi\u00e8re instance, par. 68 (je souligne)). Dans ce contexte, il est clair que l\u2019affirmation contest\u00e9e, quoique peut\u2011\u00eatre formul\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on maladroite, n\u2019\u00e9tait en fait pas une g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisation du tout, mais l\u2019expression pr\u00e9cise de la r\u00e9ponse du juge \u00e0 une th\u00e9orie de la d\u00e9fense.\n[103] Premi\u00e8rement, dans son analyse de l\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 en cause, la Cour d\u2019appel a commis une erreur en ne tenant pas compte de l\u2019ensemble des conclusions du juge. La cour a fait remarquer que le juge du proc\u00e8s avait [traduction] \u00ab rejet\u00e9 d\u2019importantes parties du t\u00e9moignage de M. Kruk \u00bb \u2014 notamment ses affirmations portant qu\u2019il avait donn\u00e9 son adresse aux parents de la plaignante, que la plaignante s\u2019\u00e9tait d\u00e9barrass\u00e9 de son pantalon et qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas joint la m\u00e8re de la plaignante par la suite seulement parce que son t\u00e9l\u00e9phone \u00e9tait d\u00e9charg\u00e9 \u2014, et que le juge avait relev\u00e9 des incoh\u00e9rences entre le t\u00e9moignage de M. Kruk et sa d\u00e9claration ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la police (par. 28\u201129). La cour a aussi reconnu que malgr\u00e9 les pr\u00e9occupations du juge du proc\u00e8s concernant la fiabilit\u00e9 de la plaignante en raison de son \u00e9tat d\u2019\u00e9bri\u00e9t\u00e9, celui-ci avait accept\u00e9 sa [traduction] \u00ab d\u00e9claration principale \u00bb selon laquelle elle s\u2019\u00e9tait r\u00e9veill\u00e9e avec le p\u00e9nis de M. Kruk en elle, ainsi que la preuve circonstancielle \u00e0 l\u2019appui de cette d\u00e9claration (par. 30\u201132). Toutefois, ces m\u00eames conclusions semblent n\u2019avoir jou\u00e9 aucun r\u00f4le dans l\u2019analyse de la cour. Malgr\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ait not\u00e9 d\u2019embl\u00e9e que, en plus de la fiabilit\u00e9 de la plaignante, la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de M. Kruk \u00e9tait une question fondamentale de l\u2019affaire, l\u2019analyse de la cour s\u2019est attach\u00e9e uniquement \u00e0 la question de la fiabilit\u00e9 de la plaignante, \u00e0 l\u2019acceptation par le juge de l\u2019all\u00e9gation d\u2019agression sexuelle de celle-ci et \u00e0 l\u2019unique affirmation contest\u00e9e figurant au par. 68 des motifs de premi\u00e8re instance : \u00ab Il est extr\u00eamement improbable qu\u2019une femme se trompe sur cette sensation. \u00bb La Cour d\u2019appel a qualifi\u00e9 cette affirmation de [traduction] \u00ab raison principale \u00bb pour laquelle le juge du proc\u00e8s a retenu le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante \u2014 le \u00ab pourquoi \u00bb du jugement (par. 63 et 65 (italique omis)) \u2014 alors que c\u2019\u00e9tait le par. 68 des motifs de premi\u00e8re instance dans leur ensemble, conjointement aux conclusions d\u00e9favorables tir\u00e9es par le juge sur la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de M. Kruk et aux observations qu\u2019il a faites aux par. 69\u201170 des motifs de premi\u00e8re instance suivant lesquelles la preuve circonstancielle concordait avec le fait qu\u2019un rapport sexuel avait eu lieu, qui expliquait en fait \u00ab pourquoi \u00bb M. Kruk devrait \u00eatre reconnu coupable.\n[104] Dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, la Cour d\u2019appel a aussi omis de tenir d\u00fbment compte des conclusions pr\u00e9cises tir\u00e9es par le juge sur la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de M. Kruk. Bien que ces conclusions aient \u00e9t\u00e9 bri\u00e8vement reconnues ailleurs, l\u2019analyse par la cour des erreurs du juge du proc\u00e8s ne comporte aucune mention du fait que celui-ci a qualifi\u00e9 de [traduction] \u00ab fort improbable \u00bb l\u2019explication de M. Kruk suivant laquelle la plaignante s\u2019est d\u00e9barrass\u00e9 de son pantalon, ni de la conclusion que M. Kruk a menti \u00e0 la police \u00e0 propos d\u2019un fait extr\u00eamement important : il portait un maillot de bain, et aucun chandail, lorsque le p\u00e8re de la plaignante est arriv\u00e9 pour venir la chercher (motifs de premi\u00e8re instance, par. 60 et 63). La cour ne tient pas non plus compte du fait que l\u2019omission de M. Kruk de communiquer avec la m\u00e8re de la plaignante [traduction] \u00ab ne cadrait pas avec [son] d\u00e9sir [exprim\u00e9] de se d\u00e9barrasser de la plaignante mais cadrait peut\u2011\u00eatre avec une autre motivation de sa part \u00bb (motifs de premi\u00e8re instance, par. 67). Ces conclusions importantes font partie int\u00e9grante du constat de culpabilit\u00e9 auquel est arriv\u00e9 le juge et servaient \u00e0 contextualiser la d\u00e9claration contest\u00e9e sur le fait que la plaignante \u2014 \u00ab une femme \u00bb \u2014 ne se trompait pas au sujet de la sensation de la p\u00e9n\u00e9tration. \u00c0 mon humble avis, cette d\u00e9claration n\u2019\u00e9tait qu\u2019une simple expression du raisonnement du juge du proc\u00e8s plut\u00f4t qu\u2019un recours \u00e0 une g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisation erron\u00e9e.\n[105] Si l\u2019on consid\u00e8re la question dans son ensemble et en contexte, le juge du proc\u00e8s n\u2019a pas rejet\u00e9 la th\u00e8se de la d\u00e9fense en raison de l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se selon laquelle aucune femme ne se tromperait, mais plut\u00f4t parce qu\u2019il a retenu le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante selon lequel elle ne se trompait pas. Malgr\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9tat d\u2019\u00e9bri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la plaignante, il a conclu que son t\u00e9moignage sur la question importante de savoir s\u2019il y avait eu p\u00e9n\u00e9tration p\u00e9no\u2011vaginale \u00e9tait fiable et donc suffisant pour justifier une d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9. Le juge du proc\u00e8s a abord\u00e9 cette th\u00e8se au par. 68 de ses motifs, reconnaissant que la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la question de savoir si l\u2019infraction avait \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9e hors de tout doute raisonnable reposait sur la d\u00e9claration principale de la plaignante selon laquelle elle a senti le p\u00e9nis de M. Kruk dans son vagin. Il a ajout\u00e9 (au par. 68) :\nLe t\u00e9moignage [de la plaignante] est d\u00e9pourvu de d\u00e9tail, mais elle soutient \u00eatre certaine de ne pas se tromper. Elle a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait senti le p\u00e9nis de [M. Kruk] en elle et qu\u2019elle savait ce qu\u2019elle ressentait. Bref, son sens du toucher \u00e9tait sollicit\u00e9. Il est extr\u00eamement improbable qu\u2019une femme se trompe sur cette sensation.\n[106] Une lecture fonctionnelle et contextuelle de ce passage des motifs de premi\u00e8re instance d\u00e9montre que l\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 contest\u00e9 \u00e9tait non pas une hypoth\u00e8se ou une \u00ab conjecture \u00bb inappropri\u00e9e, comme l\u2019a qualifi\u00e9 la Cour d\u2019appel, mais une r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la th\u00e8se avanc\u00e9e par la d\u00e9fense dans sa plaidoirie finale : soit celle voulant que la plaignante, quoique sinc\u00e8re, se soit tromp\u00e9e au sujet de la sensation physique d\u2019une p\u00e9n\u00e9tration p\u00e9no-vaginale en raison de son \u00e9tat d\u2019\u00e9bri\u00e9t\u00e9 et de son \u00e9tat de panique \u00e0 son r\u00e9veil, qui l\u2019ont amen\u00e9e \u00e0 supposer le pire.\n[107] M\u00eame en acceptant la possibilit\u00e9 que le juge du proc\u00e8s se soit fond\u00e9 sur une hypoth\u00e8se pour tirer cette conclusion, la Cour d\u2019appel a commis une erreur en examinant cette hypoth\u00e8se selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte en s\u2019appuyant sur la r\u00e8gle propos\u00e9e interdisant le recours \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques infond\u00e9es. La norme de contr\u00f4le qu\u2019il convenait d\u2019appliquer \u00e9tait celle de l\u2019erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, le juge du proc\u00e8s a gard\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019esprit que, selon le bon sens, il est extr\u00eamement improbable qu\u2019une personne se trompe au sujet de la sensation d\u2019une p\u00e9n\u00e9tration p\u00e9no-vaginale. Cette hypoth\u00e8se n\u2019est pas erron\u00e9e en ce sens qu\u2019elle est fausse ou inexacte. Il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une hypoth\u00e8se admissible \u00e0 l\u2019aune de laquelle il convenait d\u2019examiner le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante suivant lequel elle \u00e9tait certaine de ce qu\u2019elle ressentait. Elle ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le aucune erreur manifeste ou d\u00e9terminante.\n[108] La Cour d\u2019appel a aussi estim\u00e9 que la conclusion du juge du proc\u00e8s concernant la perception de la plaignante quant \u00e0 la p\u00e9n\u00e9tration p\u00e9no-vaginale ne relevait pas de la connaissance d\u2019office, puisqu\u2019elle faisait intervenir des questions \u00ab de neurologie (le fonctionnement du syst\u00e8me sensoriel du corps humain), de physiologie (l\u2019effet de l\u2019alcool sur la perception, la m\u00e9moire et le syst\u00e8me sensoriel du corps humain) et de psychiatrie (l\u2019effet de l\u2019alcool ou d\u2019un traumatisme sur la perception et la m\u00e9moire) \u00bb (par. 67). Soit dit en tout respect, l\u2019analyse de la cour sur ce point illustre les cons\u00e9quences potentiellement absurdes de la r\u00e8gle interdisant le recours \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques infond\u00e9es. Il est impensable que des questions de neurologie, de physiologie ou de psychiatrie seraient soulev\u00e9es lorsqu\u2019un t\u00e9moin en \u00e9tat d\u2019\u00e9bri\u00e9t\u00e9 au moment des faits affirme \u00eatre certain d\u2019avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 agress\u00e9 physiquement d\u2019une autre mani\u00e8re, comme un coup de poing au visage ou un coup de pied aux tibias, de sorte qu\u2019une preuve d\u2019expert serait n\u00e9cessaire pour \u00e9tayer ce t\u00e9moignage \u2014 pourtant, c\u2019est justement le type de preuve qui, selon ce qu\u2019a laiss\u00e9 entendre la cour, \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour que le juge du proc\u00e8s tire la conclusion qu\u2019il a tir\u00e9e dans le contexte d\u2019une p\u00e9n\u00e9tration p\u00e9no\u2011vaginale. M\u00eame si l\u2019on fait abstraction des difficult\u00e9s pratiques qu\u2019il y a \u00e0 trouver des experts dispos\u00e9s et aptes \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner sur de telles questions, de tels t\u00e9moignages ne sont tout simplement pas n\u00e9cessaires pour \u00e9tablir ce que le juge du proc\u00e8s a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait produit, apr\u00e8s avoir entendu la d\u00e9position de la plaignante et l\u2019avoir consid\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de tous les autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve.\n[109] Lorsqu\u2019une personne ayant un vagin t\u00e9moigne de mani\u00e8re cr\u00e9dible et avec certitude avoir ressenti une p\u00e9n\u00e9tration p\u00e9no-vaginale, le juge du proc\u00e8s doit pouvoir conclure qu\u2019il est peu probable qu\u2019elle se trompe. Bien que le choix du juge du proc\u00e8s d\u2019utiliser les mots \u00ab une femme \u00bb puisse avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 regrettable et caus\u00e9 de la confusion, dans le contexte, il est clair que le juge estimait qu\u2019il \u00e9tait extr\u00eamement improbable que la plaignante se trompe \u00e0 propos de la sensation d\u2019une p\u00e9n\u00e9tration p\u00e9no-vaginale parce que les gens, m\u00eame en \u00e9tat d\u2019\u00e9bri\u00e9t\u00e9, ne se trompent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas au sujet de cette sensation. Autrement dit, la conclusion du juge reposait sur son appr\u00e9ciation du t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante. La Cour d\u2019appel a commis une erreur en concluant autrement.\nB. Monsieur Tsang\n[110] Dans le cas de M. Tsang, la Cour d\u2019appel a fait erreur en concluant que l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation par la juge de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de l\u2019accus\u00e9 et de la plaignante \u00e9tait irr\u00e9m\u00e9diablement vici\u00e9e par trois hypoth\u00e8ses infond\u00e9es importantes au sujet d\u2019un comportement normal : une personne ne demanderait pas \u00ab de but en blanc \u00bb \u00e0 recevoir une fess\u00e9e; une personne contr\u00f4lante ne s\u2019abstiendrait pas de se livrer \u00e0 des rapports sexuels vaginaux parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas pu trouver de condom; et une personne ne quitterait pas abruptement quelqu\u2019un avec qui elle vient d\u2019avoir des rapports sexuels consensuels. Encore une fois, les deux premi\u00e8res hypoth\u00e8ses \u00e9taient, en fait, non pas des hypoth\u00e8ses mais des \u00e9nonc\u00e9s qui refl\u00e9taient le raisonnement et les conclusions de fait de la juge du proc\u00e8s. La troisi\u00e8me hypoth\u00e8se, quoique v\u00e9ritablement une hypoth\u00e8se qui \u00e9tait manifestement incorrecte, n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u00e9terminante parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas eu d\u2019incidence sur le fond du constat de culpabilit\u00e9 auquel est arriv\u00e9e la juge du proc\u00e8s.\n[111] \u00c0 titre d\u2019observation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, tout comme c\u2019\u00e9tait le cas dans le pourvoi de M. Kruk, la Cour d\u2019appel a fait erreur en ne tenant pas compte de l\u2019ensemble des motifs de la juge du proc\u00e8s lorsqu\u2019elle a effectu\u00e9 son examen. Au d\u00e9but de son analyse, la cour a affirm\u00e9 au par. 29 avoir [traduction] \u00ab port\u00e9 toute [son] attention \u00bb sur l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation par la juge du proc\u00e8s de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de la plaignante et de celle de M. Tsang, aux par. 117-158 de ses motifs. Si les paragraphes identifi\u00e9s comprennent toute l\u2019analyse de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e par la juge du proc\u00e8s, l\u2019\u00e9valuation qu\u2019a faite la cour de chaque erreur reproch\u00e9e avait une port\u00e9e plus limit\u00e9e. En particulier, la cour a segment\u00e9 artificiellement ce qui s\u2019\u00e9tait produit dans la voiture de ce qui \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t dans la soir\u00e9e et n\u2019a donc pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 l\u2019analyse de la juge dans son ensemble.\n[112] Cela ressort particuli\u00e8rement de la conclusion de la cour selon laquelle la juge du proc\u00e8s a rejet\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage de M. Tsang concernant ce qui s\u2019\u00e9tait pass\u00e9 dans la voiture, le lieu de l\u2019agression reproch\u00e9e, sur la base d\u2019hypoth\u00e8ses infond\u00e9es. La cour a explicitement statu\u00e9 que la conclusion ant\u00e9rieure de la juge du proc\u00e8s, selon laquelle M. Tsang n\u2019avait pas dit la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de ce qui s\u2019\u00e9tait pass\u00e9 lors de l\u2019apr\u00e8s\u2011f\u00eate \u00e0 la bo\u00eete de nuit, avait [traduction] \u00ab in\u00e9vitablement influenc\u00e9 son appr\u00e9ciation du t\u00e9moignage de [M. Tsang] au sujet de qui est arriv\u00e9 par la suite \u00bb, mais la cour n\u2019\u00e9tait pas dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 conclure que la rebuffade de M. Tsang ayant eu lieu plus t\u00f4t \u00ab avait pes\u00e9 lourd dans le rejet par la juge du proc\u00e8s \u00bb du t\u00e9moignage de celui\u2011ci sur ce qui s\u2019\u00e9tait pass\u00e9 dans la voiture (par. 45). Autrement dit, la cour a fait abstraction des conclusions d\u00e9favorables sur la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de M. Tsang tir\u00e9es par la juge du proc\u00e8s (motifs de premi\u00e8re instance, par. 118\u2011123).\n[113] La cour a \u00e9galement segment\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante. Elle a pris acte de la conclusion de la juge selon laquelle la plaignante n\u2019avait aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat envers M. Tsang lorsqu\u2019ils \u00e9taient \u00e0 la bo\u00eete de nuit, mais elle a ensuite qualifi\u00e9 les [traduction] \u00ab pr\u00e9liminaires sexuels \u00bb qui ont eu lieu dans la voiture d\u2019\u00ab \u00e9cart marqu\u00e9 par rapport \u00e0 son comportement ant\u00e9rieur \u00bb, faisant remarquer que la \u00ab r\u00e9sistance de la plaignante aux avances de [M. Tsang] a manifestement diminu\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019ils se sont rendus au terrain de stationnement \u00bb (par. 52). Par cons\u00e9quent, la cour a conclu que [traduction] \u00ab la conduite de la plaignante plus t\u00f4t dans la soir\u00e9e ne saurait fournir une assise fiable pour tirer des conclusions au sujet d\u2019un comportement d\u00e9notant un consentement dans la voiture gar\u00e9e \u00bb (par. 52). Bien que ce ne soit pas la principale question du pr\u00e9sent pourvoi, je souligne que ce faisant, la cour a irr\u00e9guli\u00e8rement soupes\u00e9 \u00e0 nouveau la preuve pour arriver \u00e0 sa propre conclusion concernant la preuve qui pourrait fournir une \u00ab assise fiable \u00bb pour les conclusions subs\u00e9quentes de la juge.\n[114] Cette description du comportement de la plaignante dans la voiture comme un \u00ab \u00e9cart marqu\u00e9 \u00bb n\u00e9glige l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment central de son t\u00e9moignage : [traduction] \u00ab . . . elle faisait de la gestion de risque \u00bb et a choisi de rester dans la voiture parce qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait \u00ab l\u00e9g\u00e8rement v\u00eatue \u00bb et ne se sentait pas \u00e0 l\u2019aise de marcher jusque chez elle dans un quartier \u00e0 probl\u00e8mes o\u00f9 se fait le commerce du sexe (motifs de premi\u00e8re instance, par. 53). Elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de prendre place sur le si\u00e8ge arri\u00e8re de la voiture pour embrasser M. Tsang, m\u00eame si le bout de son p\u00e9nis \u00e9tait expos\u00e9, parce que : [traduction] \u00ab . . . ils avaient des amis en commun et elle croyait avoir une id\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de qui il \u00e9tait. Elle a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019un homme pourrait simplement l\u2019enlever dans la rue, ou qu\u2019elle pouvait rester avec un gars qu\u2019elle croyait conna\u00eetre. Elle pensait que ce serait peut\u2011\u00eatre l\u00e9g\u00e8rement plus s\u00fbr de donner \u00e0 M. Tsang un peu de ce qu\u2019il voulait en l\u2019embrassant \u00bb (par. 54 (je souligne)).\n[115] L\u2019analyse de la juge du proc\u00e8s tenait compte de cet aspect du t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante. En examinant le t\u00e9moignage selon lequel la plaignante s\u2019\u00e9tait assise sur les genoux de M. Tsang \u00e0 la bo\u00eete de nuit, la juge a cit\u00e9 l\u2019affirmation de celle\u2011ci portant qu\u2019il [traduction] \u00ab faut choisir ses batailles \u00bb (par. 141). Puis, en consid\u00e9rant le fait que la plaignante a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Tsang d\u2019entrer dans un terrain de stationnement, la juge a fait remarquer que la plaignante [traduction] \u00ab a \u00e9valu\u00e9 les possibilit\u00e9s qui s\u2019offraient \u00e0 elle dans son \u00e9tat d\u2019ivresse et a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de rester avec un homme qu\u2019elle ne percevait pas comme une menace pour elle ce soir\u2011l\u00e0, plut\u00f4t que de retourner chez elle \u00e0 pied v\u00eatue comme elle l\u2019\u00e9tait dans un quartier qui lui paraissait dangereux \u00bb (par. 143). En estimant que le comportement de la plaignante \u00e9tait un \u00ab \u00e9cart marqu\u00e9 \u00bb, la Cour d\u2019appel n\u2019a pas fait preuve de la d\u00e9f\u00e9rence qui s\u2019imposait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des conclusions de la juge du proc\u00e8s \u00e0 propos de ce qui s\u2019\u00e9tait pass\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t dans la soir\u00e9e, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du recours par celle-ci \u00e0 ces conclusions pour appr\u00e9cier le t\u00e9moignage au sujet de ce qui s\u2019\u00e9tait pass\u00e9 dans la voiture, et elle a ind\u00fbment appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 \u00e0 nouveau la preuve.\n[116] Tout comme dans le cas de M. Kruk, l\u2019approche qu\u2019a adopt\u00e9e la cour pour examiner les motifs l\u2019a d\u00e9tourn\u00e9e du droit chemin. Lorsque je prends les motifs de la juge du proc\u00e8s globalement et dans leur contexte, j\u2019estime que les deux premi\u00e8res \u00ab hypoth\u00e8ses \u00bb identifi\u00e9es par la Cour d\u2019appel n\u2019\u00e9taient pas du tout des hypoth\u00e8ses, et que la troisi\u00e8me hypoth\u00e8se ne constituait pas une erreur d\u00e9terminante.\n[117] Pour ce qui est de la premi\u00e8re hypoth\u00e8se all\u00e9gu\u00e9e, la Cour d\u2019appel a jug\u00e9 que deux paragraphes en particulier \u00e9taient probl\u00e9matiques :\n[traduction] Bien que j\u2019accepte le t\u00e9moignage de M. Tsang suivant lequel [la plaignante] a pris place sur le si\u00e8ge arri\u00e8re avec lui et a consenti \u00e0 se livrer \u00e0 des pr\u00e9liminaires sexuels, il n\u2019est pas cr\u00e9dible que [la plaignante] lui ait demand\u00e9 de lui administrer une fess\u00e9e. En outre, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 le d\u00e9roulement du rapport jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0 sur le si\u00e8ge arri\u00e8re, il serait fantaisiste et infond\u00e9 de la part de M. Tsang de croire que [la plaignante] se pr\u00e9parait \u00e0 se livrer \u00e0 des actes sexuels brutaux avec lui. Les commentaires qu\u2019il a \u00e9nonc\u00e9s semblaient invent\u00e9s, comme s\u2019il d\u00e9crivait la mani\u00e8re dont pareil rapport pourrait se d\u00e9rouler selon lui, au lieu de dire ce qui s\u2019\u00e9tait r\u00e9ellement pass\u00e9 dans le terrain de stationnement cette nuit\u2011l\u00e0.\n. . .\n. . . le t\u00e9moignage de M. Tsang selon lequel il s\u2019agissait de rapports consensuels sonne creux de l\u2019avis de la Cour. Son t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 propos des choses qu\u2019il a dites \u00e0 [la plaignante] et de ce qu\u2019elle lui a dit semblait tir\u00e9 d\u2019un sc\u00e9nario pornographique qui n\u2019avait rien \u00e0 voir avec le d\u00e9roulement de leur rapport jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0.\n(motifs de premi\u00e8re instance, par. 126 et 148)\n[118] La Cour d\u2019appel a d\u00e9crit la conclusion de la juge du proc\u00e8s selon laquelle il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas cr\u00e9dible que la plaignante ait demand\u00e9 de recevoir une fess\u00e9e comme [traduction] \u00ab une simple affirmation non fond\u00e9e sur quelque preuve que ce soit \u00bb, jugeant que la \u00ab raison premi\u00e8re \u00bb de la juge du proc\u00e8s pour rejeter la conclusion semblait \u00eatre \u00ab simplement qu\u2019elle n\u2019est \u201cpas cr\u00e9dible\u201d \u00bb (par. 48\u201149). La cour a ensuite soulign\u00e9 que, en l\u2019absence d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve extrins\u00e8ques \u00e0 l\u2019appui, la conclusion de la juge du proc\u00e8s au sujet de la fess\u00e9e ne pouvait [traduction] \u00ab qu\u2019\u00eatre fond\u00e9e sur une hypoth\u00e8se au sujet de l\u2019activit\u00e9 \u00e0 laquelle [la plaignante] se serait livr\u00e9e de son plein gr\u00e9 apr\u00e8s avoir particip\u00e9 de son plein gr\u00e9 \u00e0 des pr\u00e9liminaires sexuels \u00bb, et que \u00ab des hypoth\u00e8ses implicites et infond\u00e9es \u00e0 propos d\u2019un \u201ccomportement normal\u201d \u00bb avaient donc influ\u00e9 sur l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation par la juge du proc\u00e8s de la preuve \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard (par. 53).\n[119] Bien que la Cour d\u2019appel ait sembl\u00e9 se soucier de trouver des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve dans le dossier \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la conclusion de la juge du proc\u00e8s, elle a simultan\u00e9ment fait abstraction du fait que l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation par cette derni\u00e8re de la d\u00e9position de la plaignante \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur un dossier qui, lorsqu\u2019\u00e9valu\u00e9 dans son ensemble, contenait la preuve m\u00eame qui \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour contextualiser cette conclusion. M\u00eame s\u2019il n\u2019y avait manifestement aucune preuve concernant les activit\u00e9s auxquelles la plaignante se serait livr\u00e9e de son plein gr\u00e9 apr\u00e8s des pr\u00e9liminaires sexuels, cette derni\u00e8re a express\u00e9ment affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas accept\u00e9 de recevoir une fess\u00e9e et n\u2019avait pas demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019accus\u00e9 d\u2019avoir avec elle des rapports sexuels brutaux. Cette preuve constituait la toile de fond des conclusions relatives \u00e0 la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9, qui figurent aux par. 117-158 des motifs de la juge du proc\u00e8s, ainsi que de sa d\u00e9cision finale de rejeter la version de l\u2019accus\u00e9 au motif qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait invent\u00e9e de toutes pi\u00e8ces. Tout comme dans le pourvoi de M. Kruk, le raisonnement de la Cour d\u2019appel dans ce contexte t\u00e9moigne des probl\u00e8mes fondamentaux concernant la r\u00e8gle propos\u00e9e interdisant les hypoth\u00e8ses logiques infond\u00e9es : en cherchant des sources extrins\u00e8ques \u00e0 l\u2019appui des g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisations, les juridictions d\u2019appel risquent de ne pas remarquer les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui se trouvent vraiment dans le dossier.\n[120] La conclusion de la juge du proc\u00e8s portant qu\u2019il \u00e9tait peu cr\u00e9dible que la plaignante demande de recevoir une fess\u00e9e ou d\u2019avoir des rapports sexuels brutaux doit aussi \u00eatre comprise dans le contexte plus large de l\u2019ensemble de la preuve, selon lequel la plaignante ne s\u2019int\u00e9ressait pas \u00e0 M. Tsang, mais a effectu\u00e9 une analyse du risque et a consenti \u00e0 une activit\u00e9 sexuelle limit\u00e9e dans la voiture \u2014 soit des baisers, mais rien de plus. La conclusion de la juge du proc\u00e8s \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur son appr\u00e9ciation du t\u00e9moignage de M. Tsang, qu\u2019elle a jug\u00e9 invent\u00e9 de toutes pi\u00e8ces : sa remarque selon laquelle celui\u2011ci donnait l\u2019impression \u00ab qu\u2019il d\u00e9crivait la mani\u00e8re dont pareil rapport pourrait se d\u00e9rouler selon lui \u00bb explique pourquoi elle a conclu que le t\u00e9moignage de M. Tsang portant que la plaignante lui avait demand\u00e9 de lui donner une fess\u00e9e n\u2019\u00e9tait pas cr\u00e9dible (par. 126). Bref, la juge a accept\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante selon lequel elle n\u2019avait pas formul\u00e9 une telle demande ou consenti \u00e0 des actes sexuels \u2014 brutaux ou autres \u2014 et a rejet\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage de M. Tsang. Sa conclusion ne reposait pas sur une hypoth\u00e8se; elle \u00e9tait plut\u00f4t le reflet de son appr\u00e9ciation du t\u00e9moignage direct des deux t\u00e9moins cl\u00e9s.\n[121] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me hypoth\u00e8se all\u00e9gu\u00e9e, la Cour d\u2019appel a statu\u00e9 que la juge du proc\u00e8s avait commis une erreur en concluant que l\u2019affirmation de M. Tsang selon laquelle [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019absence de condom dans sa voiture avait eu raison de sa motivation \u00e0 avoir des relations sexuelles vaginales, alors qu\u2019il avait un condom \u00e0 sa disposition, a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e de toutes pi\u00e8ces [et] contredit le degr\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le qu\u2019il a exerc\u00e9 tant ce soir\u2011l\u00e0 qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019audience \u00bb (motifs de premi\u00e8re instance, par. 129). La Cour d\u2019appel a jug\u00e9 que cette conclusion \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab probl\u00e8matique \u00bb et fond\u00e9e sur une hypoth\u00e8se selon laquelle une personne contr\u00f4lante ne s\u2019abstiendrait pas d\u2019avoir des relations sexuelles non prot\u00e9g\u00e9es (par. 64\u201165).\n[122] Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Tsang n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 en fonction de l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se quant \u00e0 savoir si les personnes contr\u00f4lantes s\u2019abstiendraient d\u2019avoir des relations sexuelles sans condom \u2014 son t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 ce sujet \u00e9tait plut\u00f4t incompatible avec les autres conclusions de la juge, et n\u2019a donc pas \u00e9t\u00e9 cru. Interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e correctement, la conclusion de la juge \u00e9tait que l\u2019accus\u00e9 lui\u2011m\u00eame \u00e9tait contr\u00f4lant et n\u2019avait pas respect\u00e9 les souhaits de la plaignante, une conclusion qu\u2019elle pouvait tirer selon la Cour d\u2019appel. Plus particuli\u00e8rement, la juge a conclu que M. Tsang avait, \u00e0 divers moments, exerc\u00e9 un contr\u00f4le en ne tenant pas compte des souhaits de la plaignante et de son amie, notamment en insistant pour que les femmes boivent \u00e0 la bo\u00eete de nuit et laissent leurs sacs dans sa voiture. \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de ces conclusions, la juge a estim\u00e9 que le t\u00e9moignage de M. Tsang selon lequel il n\u2019avait pas eu de rapports sexuels, parce que la plaignante lui avait demand\u00e9 s\u2019il avait un condom et qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas pu en trouver un, n\u2019\u00e9tait pas digne de foi. Comme la Cour d\u2019appel a isol\u00e9 artificiellement les conclusions relatives \u00e0 ce qui s\u2019\u00e9tait pass\u00e9 dans la voiture de celles relatives \u00e0 ce qui s\u2019\u00e9tait pass\u00e9 dans la bo\u00eete de nuit, elle n\u2019a pas pris correctement en compte ces autres conclusions et a donc tir\u00e9 la conclusion erron\u00e9e que la juge avait formul\u00e9 une hypoth\u00e8se.\n[123] La troisi\u00e8me hypoth\u00e8se recens\u00e9e par la Cour d\u2019appel porte sur l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation par la juge du fait que M. Tsang a quitt\u00e9 rapidement les lieux apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la plaignante. La juge a formul\u00e9 les remarques suivantes :\n[traduction] Son manque d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat [. . .] face \u00e0 l\u2019invitation de [la plaignante] \u00e0 se revoir contredit son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019ils avaient simplement pass\u00e9 un bon moment, mais est plut\u00f4t compatible avec une rencontre non consensuelle o\u00f9 il avait obtenu ce qu\u2019il voulait sans \u00e9gard pour elle et avait ensuite d\u00e9tal\u00e9.\n. . .\nLe t\u00e9moignage de M. Tsang concorde avec celui de [la plaignante] et de [l\u2019amie de celle\u2011ci] selon lequel il est parti en trombe d\u00e8s que [la plaignante] est sortie de sa voiture et qu\u2019il ne l\u2019a pas regard\u00e9e entrer dans la maison. J\u2019estime que ce fait s\u2019accorde davantage avec l\u2019affirmation de [la plaignante] selon laquelle il s\u2019agissait de relations sexuelles non consensuelles qu\u2019avec la version de M. Tsang de ce qui venait de se passer. Il est parti en trombe \u00e0 cause de ce qu\u2019il venait de lui faire vivre et parce qu\u2019elle ne repr\u00e9sentait rien pour lui. Ses agissements ne concordent pas avec son t\u00e9moignage selon lequel il voulait lui donner du plaisir ce soir\u2011l\u00e0. [par. 131 et 153]\n[124] Je reconnais que la juge a commis une erreur ici en se fondant sur une hypoth\u00e8se portant que les gens ne partent pas rapidement apr\u00e8s avoir eu des rapports sexuels consensuels. Toutefois, sans la r\u00e8gle interdisant les hypoth\u00e8ses logiques infond\u00e9es en jeu, cette hypoth\u00e8se doit encore une fois \u00eatre appr\u00e9ci\u00e9e selon la norme de l\u2019erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante. Il s\u2019agit de la norme que la Cour d\u2019appel aurait d\u00fb appliquer, et si elle l\u2019avait fait, elle n\u2019aurait trouv\u00e9 aucune erreur susceptible de r\u00e9vision.\n[125] J\u2019accepte que l\u2019inexactitude de cette hypoth\u00e8se est manifeste, car elle est de toute \u00e9vidence fausse et facilement observable. La d\u00e9cision apr\u00e8s le fait de M. Tsang de quitter les lieux rapidement n\u2019est ni compatible ni incompatible avec le fait qu\u2019une agression sexuelle a eu lieu. Logiquement, la vitesse \u00e0 laquelle une personne quitte les lieux apr\u00e8s une activit\u00e9 sexuelle n\u2019a g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement aucune incidence que ce soit sur la question de savoir si l\u2019activit\u00e9 \u00e9tait consensuelle ou non. On pourrait penser \u00e0 une foule de raisons pour lesquelles une personne comme M. Tsang pourrait vouloir ou devoir quitter rapidement les lieux apr\u00e8s un rapport sexuel consensuel \u2014 notamment des raisons qui n\u2019ont absolument rien \u00e0 voir avec l\u2019activit\u00e9 sexuelle en tant que telle, comme la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de rentrer \u00e0 la maison en raison de l\u2019heure avanc\u00e9e de la nuit. Il y a aussi de nombreuses raisons pour lesquelles une personne qui commet une agression sexuelle pourrait insister pour rester sur les lieux plus longtemps une fois l\u2019agression termin\u00e9e \u2014 par exemple, afin de s\u2019assurer que la plaignante ne dise rien \u00e0 d\u2019autres personnes au sujet de ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9. Dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, le fait que M. Tsang soit parti en trombe d\u00e8s que la plaignante est sortie de sa voiture et \u00ab ne l\u2019a pas regard\u00e9e entrer dans la maison \u00bb (par. 153) n\u2019a rien \u00e0 avoir avec la question de savoir si la plaignante avait consenti \u00e0 l\u2019activit\u00e9 sexuelle plus t\u00f4t ce soir\u2011l\u00e0. Je reconnais que le recours de la juge du proc\u00e8s \u00e0 cette g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisation \u00e9tait une erreur manifeste.\n[126] Toutefois, l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se n\u2019est pas d\u00e9terminante. M\u00eame si elle a fait partie de l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation par la juge du t\u00e9moignage de M. Tsang et qu\u2019elle a contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 sa conclusion que ce dernier \u00e9tait un t\u00e9moin non\u2011cr\u00e9dible qui [traduction] \u00ab a livr\u00e9 un r\u00e9cit invent\u00e9 de toutes pi\u00e8ces et invraisemblable \u00bb (par. 156), l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se elle\u2011m\u00eame n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un \u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel de la d\u00e9cision de la juge du proc\u00e8s de d\u00e9clarer M. Tsang coupable. Compte tenu de toutes les autres conclusions d\u00e9favorables quant \u00e0 la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de M. Tsang, je n\u2019ai absolument aucun doute que la juge ne l\u2019aurait pas cru m\u00eame sans cette hypoth\u00e8se. En outre, puisque la juge a conclu \u00e0 la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et \u00e0 la fiabilit\u00e9 de la plaignante, je n\u2019ai aucun doute qu\u2019elle aurait tout de m\u00eame d\u00e9clar\u00e9 M. Tsang coupable d\u2019agression sexuelle.\nV.

Dispositif\n249\nAnnexe\nI. Aper\u00e7u\n[128] Les deux pr\u00e9sents pourvois posent la question de savoir comment les juridictions d\u2019appel devraient examiner le recours par les juges de premi\u00e8re instance \u00e0 des attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es fond\u00e9es sur le bon sens et l\u2019exp\u00e9rience humaine dans le cadre du processus d\u2019appr\u00e9ciation des faits. Dans les deux affaires, l\u2019accus\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu coupable, \u00e0 l\u2019issue de son proc\u00e8s devant juge seul, d\u2019un chef d\u2019agression sexuelle. Cependant, dans chaque cas, la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie\u2011Britannique a ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019unanimit\u00e9 la tenue d\u2019un nouveau proc\u00e8s au motif que le ou la juge du proc\u00e8s avait commis une erreur en se fondant sur des attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es concernant les perceptions ou les comportements humains. La Couronne se pourvoit devant notre Cour, cherchant \u00e0 faire r\u00e9tablir les verdicts de culpabilit\u00e9.\n[129] Les attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es fond\u00e9es sur le bon sens et l\u2019exp\u00e9rience humaine jouent un r\u00f4le indispensable dans le processus d\u2019appr\u00e9ciation des faits par les juges. Elles servent de point de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence logique pour comparer les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve afin de tirer des conclusions de la preuve circonstancielle ou de juger de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 d\u2019un t\u00e9moin. Or, les cours d\u2019appel interm\u00e9diaires s\u2019interrogent de plus en plus sur les limites de cette m\u00e9thode. Dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs, je propose trois questions que devrait se poser une juridiction d\u2019appel lorsqu\u2019il est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que le juge du proc\u00e8s aurait commis une erreur de droit dans son raisonnement en se fondant sur des attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es dans le processus de recherche des faits.\n[130] Premi\u00e8rement, le juge du proc\u00e8s s\u2019est\u2011il appuy\u00e9 sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e dans son raisonnement? Souvent, une conclusion factuelle peut sembler refl\u00e9ter une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e, alors que, en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, le juge ne s\u2019est pas appuy\u00e9 sur une telle attente, ayant plut\u00f4t fond\u00e9 sa conclusion sur les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ou sur les faits qu\u2019il a retenus au proc\u00e8s. Cela dit, m\u00eame si la juridiction d\u2019appel estime que le juge du proc\u00e8s s\u2019est bel et bien fond\u00e9 sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e, cela ne signifie pas qu\u2019une erreur de droit a \u00e9t\u00e9 commise, et elle doit poursuivre l\u2019analyse en passant \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me question. En revanche, si la juridiction d\u2019appel conclut que le juge ne s\u2019est pas fond\u00e9 sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e, sa recherche d\u2019une \u00e9ventuelle erreur dans le cadre de cette analyse s\u2019arr\u00eate l\u00e0.\n[131] Deuxi\u00e8mement, si le juge du proc\u00e8s s\u2019est appuy\u00e9 sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e, cette attente \u00e9tait\u2011elle raisonnable? Selon moi, le juge qui se fonde sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e d\u00e9raisonnable pour appr\u00e9cier la preuve commet une erreur de droit. Dans un proc\u00e8s criminel, on ne peut l\u00e9gitimement \u00e9valuer et interpr\u00e9ter la preuve en se fondant sur des attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es d\u00e9raisonnables sous pr\u00e9texte qu\u2019elles sont fond\u00e9es sur le bon sens ou l\u2019exp\u00e9rience humaine collective. Les attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es d\u00e9raisonnables ne se limitent pas \u00e0 ce qu\u2019on pourrait consid\u00e9rer comme des \u00ab mythes \u00bb ou des \u00ab st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00bb ou au contexte des proc\u00e8s pour agressions sexuelles, mais peuvent survenir tout au long du processus de recherche des faits dans n\u2019importe quel proc\u00e8s p\u00e9nal. La confiance du public dans l\u2019administration de la justice et dans le processus d\u2019appr\u00e9ciation des faits par le juge de premi\u00e8re instance exige que les juridictions d\u2019appel soient en mesure d\u2019intervenir lorsque ce dernier a eu recours \u00e0 des attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es qui ne correspondent pas raisonnablement \u00e0 ce qu\u2019on consid\u00e8re comme vrai dans la plupart des circonstances et qui ne constituent pas un point de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence fiable pour \u00e9valuer la preuve.\n[132] Troisi\u00e8mement, le juge du proc\u00e8s s\u2019est\u2011il fond\u00e9 sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e comme s\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un fait d\u00e9terminant et incontestable? Bien que le juge du proc\u00e8s dispose d\u2019une latitude consid\u00e9rable pour se servir d\u2019attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es raisonnables comme points de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence lorsqu\u2019il appr\u00e9cie la preuve, de telles attentes ne sauraient remplacer la preuve. Commet une erreur de droit le juge qui ne tient pas compte de l\u2019ensemble de la preuve pour trancher la question fondamentale de la culpabilit\u00e9 ou de l\u2019innocence de l\u2019accus\u00e9 ou qui tire une conclusion de fait en l\u2019absence de preuve. En r\u00e9alit\u00e9, le juge du proc\u00e8s qui s\u2019appuie sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e comme s\u2019il s\u2019agissait en soi d\u2019une conclusion de fait en prend connaissance d\u2019office, ce qui commande l\u2019application d\u2019un test rigoureux.\n[133] Appliquant ces principes aux pr\u00e9sents pourvois, je suis d\u2019avis d\u2019accueillir les pourvois et de r\u00e9tablir les verdicts de culpabilit\u00e9. Dans la cause de M. Kruk, le juge du proc\u00e8s s\u2019est appuy\u00e9 sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e concernant la probabilit\u00e9 qu\u2019une femme se m\u00e9prenne au sujet d\u2019un \u00e9pisode de contacts physiques envahissants (2020 BCSC 1480). Il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une attente raisonnable concernant la perception g\u00e9n\u00e9rale chez les \u00eatres humains. Le juge du proc\u00e8s n\u2019a pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 cette perception comme un fait incontestable. Il s\u2019en est plut\u00f4t servi comme point de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour appr\u00e9cier le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de l\u2019ensemble de la preuve. Il n\u2019y avait donc aucun motif justifiant l\u2019intervention de la Cour d\u2019appel. Dans la cause de M. Tsang, la Cour d\u2019appel a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 tort que la juge du proc\u00e8s s\u2019\u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e \u00e0 deux reprises alors que, en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, elle \u00e9valuait l\u2019ensemble de la preuve. La Cour d\u2019appel s\u2019est par cons\u00e9quent estim\u00e9e autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 sortir du cadre de ses attributions pour proc\u00e9der \u00e0 un r\u00e9examen de la preuve. Dans un cas, la juge du proc\u00e8s s\u2019\u00e9tait effectivement tromp\u00e9e en se fondant sur une attente d\u00e9raisonnable concernant la fa\u00e7on dont les gens se comportent habituellement apr\u00e8s avoir eu des rapports sexuels consensuels. Toutefois, puisque cette erreur a pu n\u2019avoir aucune incidence sur le verdict, j\u2019aurais \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019avis de confirmer le verdict de culpabilit\u00e9 en vertu de la disposition r\u00e9paratrice du sous\u2011al. 686(1)b)(iii) du Code criminel , L.R.C. 1985, c. C\u201146 .\nII. Contexte jurisprudentiel\n[134] Les deux d\u00e9cisions vis\u00e9es par les pr\u00e9sents pourvois font partie d\u2019une s\u00e9rie de d\u00e9cisions r\u00e9centes rendues par des cours d\u2019appel interm\u00e9diaires sur le recours par les juges du proc\u00e8s, dans le processus de recherche des faits, \u00e0 des concepts comme \u00ab le bon sens \u00bb, \u00ab l\u2019exp\u00e9rience humaine \u00bb, \u00ab la logique \u00bb, \u00ab les g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisations \u00bb, \u00ab les hypoth\u00e8ses \u00bb, \u00ab les mythes \u00bb et \u00ab les st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00bb. Ces questions sont devenues de plus en plus fr\u00e9quentes dans les appels de verdicts en mati\u00e8re d\u2019agression sexuelle, qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse d\u2019acquittements ou de d\u00e9clarations de culpabilit\u00e9 (voir, p. ex., R. c. Kodwat, 2017 YKCA 11; R. c. A.R.D., 2017 ABCA 237, 422 D.L.R. (4th) 471, (\u00ab A.R.D. \u00bb), conf. par R. c. A.R.J.D., 2018 CSC 6, [2018] 1 R.C.S. 218 (\u00ab A.R.J.D. \u00bb); R. c. Quartey, 2018 ABCA 12, 430 D.L.R. (4th) 381, conf. par 2018 CSC 59, [2018] 3 R.C.S. 687; R. c. Kiss, 2018 ONCA 184; R. c. L. (J.), 2018 ONCA 756, 143 O.R. (3d) 170; R. c.

(4th) 375, conf. par 2020 CSC 39, [2020] 3 R.C.S. 780; R. c. Pastro, 2021 BCCA 149, 71 C.R. (7th) 296). Diverses tentatives ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites pour d\u00e9finir les principes que les juridictions d\u2019appel devraient appliquer pour aborder ces questions. Or, aucune solution coh\u00e9rente n\u2019a encore \u00e9t\u00e9 propos\u00e9e.\n[135] Les parties et les intervenants attirent l\u2019attention sur les tentatives faites par la Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Ontario dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. J.C., 2021 ONCA 131, 401 C.C.C. (3d) 433, en les approuvant \u00e0 des degr\u00e9s divers. Cette d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e utile par la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie\u2011Britannique dans l\u2019appel de M. Tsang (2022 BCCA 345, 419 C.C.C. (3d) 187). Elle n\u2019est pas cit\u00e9e directement dans la d\u00e9cision sur l\u2019appel dans la cause de M. Kruk (2022 BCCA 18), mais les deux d\u00e9cisions citent des pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents, notamment les arr\u00eats Roth, Cepic et R. c. Perkins, 2007 ONCA 585, 223 C.C.C. (3d) 289. Il est donc utile de s\u2019attarder quelque peu sur l\u2019arr\u00eat J.C.\n[136] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat J.C., le juge Paciocco, qui s\u2019exprimait au nom de la Cour d\u2019appel, a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il existait [traduction] \u00ab deux r\u00e8gles juridiques pertinentes qui permettent de reconna\u00eetre les raisonnements inadmissibles sur la plausibilit\u00e9 du comportement humain \u00bb (par. 57). Il y a tout d\u2019abord la [traduction] \u00ab r\u00e8gle interdisant le recours \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques infond\u00e9es \u00bb, selon laquelle \u00ab les juges du proc\u00e8s doivent \u00e9viter de se livrer \u00e0 des raisonnements conjecturaux fond\u00e9s sur des hypoth\u00e8ses \u201clogiques\u201d qui ne s\u2019appuient pas sur la preuve ou sur la connaissance d\u2019office \u00bb (par. 58). Cette r\u00e8gle [traduction] \u00ab n\u2019emp\u00eache pas de recourir \u00e0 l\u2019exp\u00e9rience humaine du comportement humain pour interpr\u00e9ter la preuve \u00bb, mais \u00ab [e]lle interdit aux juges d\u2019utiliser le \u201cbon sens\u201d ou l\u2019exp\u00e9rience humaine pour introduire dans leur processus d\u00e9cisionnel de nouvelles consid\u00e9rations qui ne d\u00e9coulent pas de la preuve, y compris des consid\u00e9rations sur le comportement humain \u00bb (par. 61).\n[137] La seconde r\u00e8gle recoupe la premi\u00e8re. Selon cette r\u00e8gle, qui [traduction] \u00ab interdit le recours \u00e0 des inf\u00e9rences fond\u00e9es sur des st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00bb, \u00ab les conclusions de fait, y compris celles tir\u00e9es au sujet de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9, ne doivent pas reposer sur des inf\u00e9rences fond\u00e9es sur des st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes au sujet du comportement humain \u00bb (par. 63). Selon cette r\u00e8gle, [traduction] \u00ab constitue une erreur de droit le fait de recourir \u00e0 des st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes ou \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques infond\u00e9es \u00bb sur la fa\u00e7on dont le plaignant ou l\u2019accus\u00e9 est cens\u00e9 se comporter, soit pour renforcer soit pour affaiblir la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de cette personne (ibid.). Cette r\u00e8gle interdit seulement que l\u2019on tire des inf\u00e9rences fond\u00e9es sur des \u00ab st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00bb ou des \u00ab g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisations pr\u00e9judiciables \u00bb; elle n\u2019interdit pas l\u2019admission ou l\u2019utilisation de certains types de preuve. Une conclusion de fait peut logiquement refl\u00e9ter un st\u00e9r\u00e9otype, mais elle ne constitue pas une erreur si elle repose sur la preuve.\n[138] Par ailleurs, le juge Paciocco a estim\u00e9 que les \u00ab erreurs \u00bb d\u00e9coulant de la violation, par le juge, de la r\u00e8gle interdisant le recours \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques infond\u00e9es ou de la r\u00e8gle interdisant le recours \u00e0 des inf\u00e9rences fond\u00e9es sur des st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes, [traduction] \u00ab ne justifient d\u2019infirmer la d\u00e9cision que lorsque l\u2019inf\u00e9rence est \u201cfond\u00e9e\u201d sur ces erreurs et que celles\u2011ci ont jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le d\u00e9terminant ou important pour amener le juge \u00e0 tirer la conclusion attaqu\u00e9e \u00bb (par. 71).\n[139] Les cours d\u2019appel interm\u00e9diaires se sont appuy\u00e9es sur l\u2019arr\u00eat J.C. dans de nombreuses causes depuis qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu, il y a quelques ann\u00e9es \u00e0 peine. Cela t\u00e9moigne de l\u2019importance des questions dont notre Cour est saisie en ce qui concerne le recours, par le juge du proc\u00e8s, \u00e0 des concepts comme \u00ab le bon sens \u00bb ou \u00ab l\u2019exp\u00e9rience humaine \u00bb pour trancher des causes. La professeure Lisa Dufraimont qualifie la tentative de clarification du droit dans l\u2019arr\u00eat J.C. de [traduction] \u00ab progr\u00e8s ind\u00e9niable \u00bb, tout en exprimant certaines r\u00e9serves au sujet de la port\u00e9e et de la souplesse des r\u00e8gles d\u00e9crites (\u00ab Current Complications in the Law on Myths and Stereotypes \u00bb (2021), 99 R. du B. can. 536, p. 563\u2011564).\n[140] Une question essentielle soulev\u00e9e par certaines des parties et certains des intervenants dans les pr\u00e9sents pourvois est celle de savoir si la \u00ab r\u00e8gle interdisant le recours \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques infond\u00e9es \u00bb \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat J.C. devrait \u00eatre reconnue comme un motif justifiant l\u2019intervention d\u2019un tribunal si\u00e9geant en appel. La Couronne et certains intervenants affirment que la r\u00e8gle en question est inapplicable et devrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e par notre Cour, tandis que les intim\u00e9s et d\u2019autres intervenants appuient la d\u00e9marche propos\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat J.C. En revanche, la \u00ab r\u00e8gle interdisant le recours \u00e0 des st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00bb est \u2014 apparemment \u2014 moins controvers\u00e9e; en effet, toutes les parties s\u2019entendent pour dire que les raisonnements st\u00e9r\u00e9otyp\u00e9s constituent un motif justifiant l\u2019intervention d\u2019un tribunal si\u00e9geant en appel. Il y a toutefois un manque de clart\u00e9 quant \u00e0 la conception que certaines des parties et certains des intervenants se font du lien qui existe entre ces deux \u00ab r\u00e8gles \u00bb. De plus, les parties ne s\u2019entendent pas sur la question de savoir s\u2019il est essentiel que ce type d\u2019erreur ait jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le \u00ab d\u00e9terminant \u00bb ou \u00ab important \u00bb dans la conclusion contest\u00e9e pour pouvoir \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une erreur \u00ab justifiant l\u2019infirmation \u00bb de la d\u00e9cision au sens de l\u2019arr\u00eat J.C.\nIII. Principes applicables au processus de recherche des faits\n[141] La prolif\u00e9ration de d\u00e9cisions rendues par des cours d\u2019appel et les arguments qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis \u00e0 notre Cour en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce t\u00e9moignent de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019offrir certains rep\u00e8res en proposant un cadre d\u2019analyse clair et coh\u00e9rent en mati\u00e8re d\u2019examen en appel. \u00c0 mon avis, le manque de clart\u00e9 et d\u2019uniformit\u00e9 s\u2019explique en grande partie par l\u2019emploi impr\u00e9cis de termes comme \u00ab bon sens \u00bb, \u00ab st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00bb, \u00ab mythes \u00bb, \u00ab inf\u00e9rences \u00bb, \u00ab connaissance d\u2019office \u00bb et \u00ab conjectures \u00bb. Il me para\u00eet donc utile de commencer par ce que j\u2019estime \u00eatre certains principes fondamentaux du processus de recherche des faits. J\u2019\u00e9nonce ces principes dans l\u2019objectif d\u2019employer des termes pr\u00e9cis en toute connaissance de cause.\nA. Concepts fondamentaux\n[142] La recherche de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 par l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de \u00ab fait[s] \u00bb auxquels on doit appliquer le droit constitue la raison d\u2019\u00eatre et la caract\u00e9ristique essentielle de tout proc\u00e8s (S. N. Lederman, M. K. Fuerst et H. C. Stewart, Sopinka, Lederman & Bryant : The Law of Evidence in Canada (6e \u00e9d. 2022), \u00b61.40). Dans un proc\u00e8s criminel, le juge des faits est charg\u00e9 d\u2019appliquer le droit aux faits pour d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019accus\u00e9 est coupable ou non des infractions qui lui sont reproch\u00e9es. Les r\u00e8gles de droit sont d\u00e9finies par la loi ou par la common law et elles doivent \u00eatre correctement interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es et appliqu\u00e9es. En revanche, l\u2019\u00e9tablissement des faits est r\u00e9serv\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation souveraine du juge des faits. La t\u00e2che premi\u00e8re de celui\u2011ci consiste \u00e0 tirer des conclusions sur les \u00ab faits en litige \u00bb dans le proc\u00e8s; dans une cause criminelle, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments constitutifs de l\u2019infraction sont les principaux faits en litige. Outre ces derniers, tout autre fait est jug\u00e9 pertinent s\u2019il [traduction] \u00ab permet de prouver ou de rendre probable l\u2019existence \u2014 ou l\u2019inexistence \u2014 pass\u00e9e, actuelle ou future d\u2019un autre fait en litige \u00bb (\u00b62.57). De plus, [traduction] \u00ab [l]es faits relatifs \u00e0 la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de la personne qui fournit des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve directe ou circonstancielle quant \u00e0 un fait en litige sont pertinents\u00bb (\u00b62.58).\n[143] Le juge des faits dispose en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de deux moyens pour tirer une conclusion de fait : a) en admettant un fait d\u2019office; b) en tirant des \u00ab conclusions de fait \u00bb de la preuve ou en tirant des \u00ab inf\u00e9rences \u00bb \u00e0 partir d\u2019autres faits.\n[144] La \u00ab connaissance d\u2019office \u00bb est l\u2019acceptation par le tribunal de la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 d\u2019un fait sans \u00ab preuve \u00bb (Lederman, Fuerst et Stewart, \u00b619.25). Le crit\u00e8re applicable \u00e0 l\u2019admission d\u2019office de faits est strict \u2014 \u00ab [u]n tribunal peut \u00e0 juste titre prendre connaissance d\u2019office de deux types de faits : (1) les faits qui sont notoires ou g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement admis au point de ne pas \u00eatre l\u2019objet de d\u00e9bats entre des personnes raisonnables; (2) ceux dont l\u2019existence peut \u00eatre d\u00e9montr\u00e9e imm\u00e9diatement et fid\u00e8lement en ayant recours \u00e0 des sources facilement accessibles dont l\u2019exactitude est incontestable \u00bb (R. c. Find, 2001 CSC 32, [2001] 1 R.C.S. 863, par. 48). D\u00e8s lors qu\u2019un fait a \u00e9t\u00e9 admis d\u2019office par le tribunal, l\u2019examen des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve portant sur ce fait est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement exclu, puisque, en satisfaisant au test de la connaissance d\u2019office, le fait en question n\u2019est pas cens\u00e9 faire l\u2019objet d\u2019un d\u00e9bat. Cela ne signifie pas pour autant qu\u2019il faut tirer une \u00ab inf\u00e9rence \u00bb du fait qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 admis d\u2019office (Lederman, Fuerst et Stewart, \u00b619.74\u201119.75). En raison des cons\u00e9quences de l\u2019admission d\u2019office de faits, le juge doit aviser les parties qu\u2019elles peuvent y r\u00e9pondre et leur donner la possibilit\u00e9 de le faire, avant de se fonder sur ces faits (\u00b619.78 et suiv.)\n[145] La \u00ab preuve \u00bb est le moyen privil\u00e9gi\u00e9 utilis\u00e9 pour faciliter la pr\u00e9sentation de tous les faits logiquement pertinents au proc\u00e8s (Lederman, Fuerst et Stewart, \u00b61.1). Il existe divers types de preuve; dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs, je m\u2019en tiens aux t\u00e9moignages donn\u00e9s de vive voix \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Une preuve doit \u00eatre admissible pour pouvoir \u00eatre examin\u00e9e par le juge des faits, mais je ne traite pas des questions d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs. Une preuve ou un t\u00e9moignage n\u2019est pas un fait en soi. Les t\u00e9moins d\u00e9posent au sujet de leurs observations et de leurs exp\u00e9riences et il est loisible au juge des faits de tenir un t\u00e9moignage pour av\u00e9r\u00e9 en totalit\u00e9 ou en partie, ou de l\u2019\u00e9carter compl\u00e8tement (voir, p. ex., R. c. Fran\u00e7ois, [1994] 2 R.C.S. 827, p. 837; R. c. D.A.I., 2012 CSC 5, [2012] 1 R.C.S. 149, par. 72).\n[146] La d\u00e9cision du juge des faits de tenir un t\u00e9moignage pour av\u00e9r\u00e9 d\u00e9pend de son appr\u00e9ciation de la \u00ab cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 \u00bb et de la \u00ab fiabilit\u00e9 \u00bb du t\u00e9moin. La cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 s\u2019entend de l\u2019honn\u00eatet\u00e9 et de la sinc\u00e9rit\u00e9 du t\u00e9moin. La fiabilit\u00e9, quant \u00e0 elle, concerne l\u2019exactitude du t\u00e9moignage et s\u2019int\u00e9resse \u00e0 l\u2019aptitude du t\u00e9moin \u00e0 observer, \u00e0 se souvenir et \u00e0 relater les faits (voir R. c. H.C., 2009 ONCA 56, 244 O.A.C. 288, par. 41). Appr\u00e9cier la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et la fiabilit\u00e9 ne rel\u00e8ve pas de la science exacte (voir R. c. Gagnon, 2006 CSC 17, [2006] 1 R.C.S. 621, par. 20). La cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et la fiabilit\u00e9 du t\u00e9moin sont \u00e9valu\u00e9es en fonction de divers facteurs, notamment son temp\u00e9rament, son comportement, son \u00e9tat et ses capacit\u00e9s, la vraisemblance et la coh\u00e9rence interne de son t\u00e9moignage et les renseignements qu\u2019il invoque \u00e0 l\u2019appui; elles sont \u00e9galement \u00e9valu\u00e9es \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de leur compatibilit\u00e9 avec d\u2019autres faits et \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve (D. M. Paciocco, P. Paciocco et L. Stuesser, The Law of Evidence (8e \u00e9d. 2020), p. 593).\n[147] Il existe globalement deux types de preuve : la \u00ab preuve directe \u00bb et la \u00ab preuve circonstancielle \u00bb. Une preuve directe en est une \u00ab qui, si l\u2019on y ajoute foi, r\u00e8gle la question en litige \u00bb (R. c. Cinous, 2002 CSC 29, [2002] 2 R.C.S. 3, par. 88, citant D. Watt, Watt\u2019s Manual of Criminal Evidence (2001), \u00a7 8.0). Par exemple, si le t\u00e9moin dit qu\u2019il a constat\u00e9 qu\u2019il pleuvait \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur, il fournit une preuve directe du fait qu\u2019il pleuvait. La preuve circonstancielle, aussi appel\u00e9e \u00ab preuve indirecte \u00bb, est une preuve \u00e0 partir de laquelle le juge des faits est invit\u00e9 \u00e0 tirer certaines \u00ab inf\u00e9rences \u00bb (R. c. Villaroman, 2016 CSC 33, [2016] 1 R.C.S. 1000, par. 23, citant Comit\u00e9 national sur les directives au jury du Conseil canadien de la magistrature, Mod\u00e8les de directives au jury (en ligne), directive 10.2). Par exemple, si le t\u00e9moin dit qu\u2019il a vu quelqu\u2019un entrer dans le palais de justice v\u00eatu d\u2019un imperm\u00e9able et tenant \u00e0 la main un parapluie, tous deux ruisselant d\u2019eau, il fournit une preuve circonstancielle, \u00e0 partir de laquelle on peut d\u00e9duire qu\u2019il pleuvait (voir ibid.). La preuve circonstancielle [traduction] \u00ab est uniquement affaire d\u2019inf\u00e9rences \u00bb (S. C. Hill, D. M. Tanovich et L. P. Strezos, McWilliams\u2019 Canadian Criminal Evidence (5e \u00e9d. (feuilles mobiles)), \u00a7 31:17, citant R. c. Gibson, 2021 ONCA 530, 157 O.R. (3d) 597, par. 76).\n[148] Une \u00ab inf\u00e9rence \u00bb est une conclusion de fait que l\u2019on peut logiquement et raisonnablement tirer \u00e0 partir d\u2019un autre fait \u2014 ou d\u2019un groupe de faits \u2014 dont on a conclu \u00e0 l\u2019existence ou qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 autrement \u00e9tabli (p. ex., au moyen de la connaissance d\u2019office) (Hill, Tanovich et Strezos, \u00a7 31:17, citant R. c. Chanmany, 2016 ONCA 576, 338 C.C.C. (3d) 578, par. 45; Lampard c.The Queen, [1969] R.C.S. 373; D. Watt, Watt\u2019s Manual of Criminal Evidence (2023), \u00a712.01). Ainsi, le juge des faits tire des inf\u00e9rences \u00e0 partir de faits (les \u00ab faits \u00e9tablis par preuve directe \u00bb) pour conclure \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019autres faits (qui sont des inf\u00e9rences). Les inf\u00e9rences peuvent d\u00e9couler des circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, mais pas n\u00e9cessairement (Watt, \u00a712.01).\n[149] Une \u00ab opinion \u00bb peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une inf\u00e9rence particuli\u00e8re propos\u00e9e par un t\u00e9moin (voir White Burgess Langille Inman c. Abbott and Haliburton Co., 2015 CSC 23, [2015] 2 R.C.S. 182, par. 14). La ligne de d\u00e9marcation entre un fait et une opinion n\u2019est pas toujours nette (Graat c. La Reine, [1982] 2 R.C.S. 819, p. 835). Toutefois, en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, un t\u00e9moin ne peut pas rendre un t\u00e9moignage d\u2019opinion; il ne peut d\u00e9poser que sur les \u00ab faits \u00bb relevant de ses connaissances, de ses observations et de son exp\u00e9rience; c\u2019est au juge des faits qu\u2019il appartient de tirer des inf\u00e9rences \u00e0 partir des faits av\u00e9r\u00e9s (Lederman, Fuerst et Stewart, \u00b612.2). N\u00e9anmoins, un t\u00e9moin expert qualifi\u00e9 peut proposer au juge des faits une [traduction] \u00ab conclusion toute faite \u00bb, que ce dernier ne serait autrement pas en mesure de formuler en raison de la technicit\u00e9 du sujet en cause (ibid.; R. c. Mohan, [1994] 2 R.C.S. 9). Un t\u00e9moin profane peut \u00e9galement \u00eatre admis \u00e0 donner son opinion sur certaines questions (voir Graat); toutefois, plus un t\u00e9moignage porte sur des questions centrales qui doivent \u00eatre tranch\u00e9es par le tribunal, plus celui\u2011ci sera r\u00e9ticent \u00e0 juger ce t\u00e9moignage admissible (Lederman, Fuerst et Stewart, \u00b612.15).\n[150] La \u00ab conjecture \u00bb est un concept qui s\u2019est vu attribuer plusieurs significations dans diff\u00e9rents contextes. Les inf\u00e9rences doivent notamment pouvoir \u00eatre tir\u00e9es de mani\u00e8re raisonnable et logique \u00e0 partir d\u2019un fait av\u00e9r\u00e9 qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli par une preuve directe (ou qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 admis d\u2019office); toutefois, [traduction] \u00ab [l]\u2019inf\u00e9rence ne d\u00e9coulant pas logiquement et raisonnablement de faits \u00e9tablis ne peut \u00eatre tir\u00e9e et est proscrite en tant que supposition et conjecture \u00bb (R. c. Morrissey, (1995), 22 O.R. (3d) 514 (C.A.), p. 530). Il s\u2019ensuit que le raisonnement qui n\u2019est pas fond\u00e9 sur les faits \u00e9tablis par la preuve est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme sp\u00e9culatif. Cependant, [traduction] \u00ab [l]a ligne de d\u00e9marcation entre l\u2019inf\u00e9rence admissible et la conjecture non admissible en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019une preuve circonstancielle est souvent tr\u00e8s difficile \u00e0 tracer \u00bb (Watt, \u00a712.018; voir aussi Hill, Tanovich et Strezos, \u00a7 31:17; Canadian Pacific Railway Co. c. Murray, [1932] R.C.S. 112, p. 117).\nB. Les attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es dans le processus de recherche des faits\n[151] Dans les paragraphes qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, j\u2019ai \u00e9voqu\u00e9 certains concepts fondamentaux du processus de recherche des faits. Pour compl\u00e9ter le tableau, il convient de mentionner le r\u00f4le que joue le raisonnement du juge du proc\u00e8s, qui fait le pont entre la preuve et les faits, les faits \u00e9tablis par preuve directe et les inf\u00e9rences, et ainsi de suite.\n[152] Le bon sens a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit comme [traduction] \u00ab \u00e0 la fois \u00e9vident et imp\u00e9n\u00e9trable \u00bb (P. Cochran, Common Sense and Legal Judgment : Community Knowledge, Political Power, and Rhetorical Practice (2017), p. 15). \u00c0 diverses \u00e9tapes du processus de recherche des faits, le juge du proc\u00e8s prend n\u00e9cessairement appui sur son \u00ab bon sens \u00bb et sur son \u00ab exp\u00e9rience humaine \u00bb (ou \u00ab exp\u00e9rience des affaires humaines \u00bb (R. c. B\u00e9land, [1987] 2 R.C.S. 398, p. 418\u2011419)) pour appr\u00e9cier la preuve et se prononcer sur les faits de l\u2019affaire dont il est saisi (voir R. c. S. (R.D.), [1997] 3 R.C.S. 484, par. 13, 29, 38 et 130; Villaroman, par. 30). Ainsi que le juge Major l\u2019expliquait dans l\u2019arr\u00eat S. (R.D.) :\nIl est manifeste, et la personne raisonnable s\u2019y attend, que le juge des faits est \u00e0 juste titre influenc\u00e9 dans ses d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations par sa propre conception du monde dans lequel ont eu lieu les faits litigieux. En effet, il doit s\u2019appuyer sur ses acquis ant\u00e9rieurs pour exercer ses fonctions juridictionnelles. Ainsi que l\u2019ont \u00e9crit David M. Paciocco et Lee Stuesser dans The Law of Evidence (1996), \u00e0 la p. 277 :\n[traduction] En g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, le juge des faits est habilit\u00e9 simplement \u00e0 appliquer le bon sens et l\u2019exp\u00e9rience humaine pour d\u00e9cider si la preuve est digne de foi et quel usage, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, il peut en faire pour tirer ses conclusions de faits.\n[Italique omis; par. 39.]\n[153] Ainsi, le bon sens et l\u2019exp\u00e9rience humaine sont le fondement de ce que l\u2019on pourrait appeler les \u00ab attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es \u00bb \u2014 qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse du comportement humain typique, de perceptions humaines ou d\u2019autres exp\u00e9riences humaines courantes. Dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs, j\u2019emploie le terme \u00ab attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es \u00bb, pour d\u00e9signer tant les consid\u00e9rations fond\u00e9es sur le \u00ab bon sens \u00bb que celles qui reposent sur \u00ab l\u2019exp\u00e9rience humaine \u00bb et dont le juge tient compte pour formuler son raisonnement. Ce terme fait ressortir le fait que ces consid\u00e9rations sont \u00e0 la fois g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es (en ce sens qu\u2019elles ne concernent pas un individu ou un \u00e9v\u00e9nement particulier, mais les gens et les choses en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) et qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019attentes (c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire d\u2019id\u00e9es sur ce qui est habituellement ou ordinairement vrai, et non sur ce qui est incontestablement vrai dans un cas particulier). De telles attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es sont souvent appel\u00e9es, entre autres, \u00ab hypoth\u00e8ses \u00bb (ce qui inclut les \u00ab hypoth\u00e8ses logiques \u00bb), \u00ab g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisations \u00bb ou \u00ab inf\u00e9rences conformes au bon sens \u00bb. Je suis d\u00e9favorable \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de ces termes, dans la mesure o\u00f9 ils impliquent n\u00e9cessairement une erreur, en raison de leur connotation n\u00e9gative, ou cr\u00e9ent de la confusion avec les inf\u00e9rences entendues comme des conclusions factuelles tir\u00e9es de la preuve ou d\u2019autres faits \u00e9tablis par preuve directe.\n[154] Le bon sens, sur lequel sont fond\u00e9es les attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es, constitue la [traduction] \u00ab principale source dont s\u2019inspire le juge des faits pour rendre sa d\u00e9cision \u00bb (Hill, Tanovich et Strezos, \u00a7 31:16). Les attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es alimentent le raisonnement, en servant de point de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence logique permettant de comparer la preuve. Par exemple, dans le raisonnement servant \u00e0 tirer une inf\u00e9rence \u00e0 partir d\u2019un fait \u00e9tabli par preuve directe, le juge du proc\u00e8s peut comparer une inf\u00e9rence propos\u00e9e avec le point de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence que constitue une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e concernant le d\u00e9roulement g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pr\u00e9visible d\u2019une situation, selon le bon sens et l\u2019exp\u00e9rience humaine. Pour revenir \u00e0 l\u2019exemple de l\u2019imperm\u00e9able et du parapluie tremp\u00e9s d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9voqu\u00e9, il peut en d\u00e9couler l\u2019inf\u00e9rence qu\u2019il pleuvait. Un t\u00e9moin pourrait pr\u00e9senter une preuve circonstancielle affirmant qu\u2019il a vu quelqu\u2019un v\u00eatu d\u2019un imperm\u00e9able et tenant \u00e0 la main un parapluie, tous deux ruisselant d\u2019eau. Pour en inf\u00e9rer qu\u2019il pleuvait, le juge des faits pourrait se fonder sur l\u2019attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e selon laquelle, normalement, si un imperm\u00e9able et un parapluie sont mouill\u00e9s, c\u2019est qu\u2019il a plu. Ce que je veux dire, c\u2019est que l\u2019attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e fait partie int\u00e9grante du processus d\u2019inf\u00e9rences, qu\u2019on se fonde implicitement ou explicitement sur elle. Bien entendu, la valeur de l\u2019inf\u00e9rence d\u00e9pend des autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve au dossier.\n[155] De m\u00eame, pour appr\u00e9cier la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 d\u2019un t\u00e9moin, le juge du proc\u00e8s est \u00e9galement cens\u00e9 recourir au bon sens et \u00e0 l\u2019exp\u00e9rience humaine comme point de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour \u00e9valuer la vraisemblance de son t\u00e9moignage (Paciocco, Paciocco et Stuesser, p. 608; voir aussi R. c. Marquard, [1993] 4 R.C.S. 223, p. 248). Ainsi, le juge du proc\u00e8s s\u2019inspire de son v\u00e9cu et de son bon sens pour juger le comportement et le temp\u00e9rament du t\u00e9moin, ainsi que la vraisemblance interne ou externe de son t\u00e9moignage, afin d\u2019en \u00e9valuer la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 (Paciocco, Paciocco et Stuesser, p. 593).\n[156] La valeur des attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es fond\u00e9es sur le bon sens est fr\u00e9quemment reconnue par les tribunaux. Par exemple, il est logique de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une personne pr\u00e9voie les cons\u00e9quences naturelles et probables de ses actes (R. c. Walle, 2012 CSC 41, [2012] 2 R.C.S. 438, par. 64), de penser qu\u2019il est peu probable qu\u2019une personne fuie une sc\u00e8ne de crime si elle n\u2019est pas l\u2019auteur de l\u2019acte (R. c. Jacquard, [1997] 1 R.C.S. 314, par. 50) ou d\u2019imaginer qu\u2019une personne est peu susceptible de faire de fausses d\u00e9clarations contre son propre int\u00e9r\u00eat (R. c. O\u2019Brien, [1978] 1 R.C.S. 591, p. 594). Cette liste d\u2019hypoth\u00e8ses logiques n\u2019est pas exhaustive; ce ne sont l\u00e0 que des exemples de la pr\u00e9misse de base selon laquelle le juge des faits n\u2019a pas \u00e0 faire abstraction de son bon sens ou de son v\u00e9cu lorsqu\u2019il franchit la porte du palais de justice.\n[157] Certaines attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9es dans la jurisprudence de mythes ou de st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes. Les mots \u00ab mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00bb employ\u00e9s ensemble sont souvent interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s dans le discours juridique canadien comme d\u00e9signant de [traduction] \u00ab fausses croyances au sujet des agressions sexuelles qui alt\u00e8rent le processus de recherche des faits \u00bb, le plus souvent au sujet des plaignants et plus particuli\u00e8rement des femmes et des enfants (L. Dufraimont, \u00ab Myth, Inference and Evidence in Sexual Assault Trials \u00bb (2019), 44 Queen\u2019s L.J. 316, p. 330\u2011332). Sur le fondement de preuves convaincantes tir\u00e9es de publications pertinentes relevant des sciences sociales, notre Cour a reconnu \u00ab l\u2019existence de tels mythes et st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00bb (Find, par. 101). Au sujet des plaignants dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle, notre Cour a fait remarquer que les mythes et les st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00ab sont particuli\u00e8rement odieux parce qu\u2019ils font partie du \u201csens commun\u201d social qui constitue la trame de notre existence quotidienne \u00bb et qu\u2019ils \u00ab font na\u00eetre le risque que, tant dans l\u2019esprit des juges que dans celui des jur\u00e9s, les victimes d\u2019abus sexuels soient bl\u00e2m\u00e9es ou injustement discr\u00e9dit\u00e9es \u00bb (par. 103).\n[158] Selon moi, il y a lieu d\u2019attribuer une signification distincte aux concepts de \u00ab mythes \u00bb et de \u00ab st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00bb. J\u2019adopterais une conception des \u00ab st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00bb qui s\u2019entend de biais fond\u00e9s sur \u00ab les caract\u00e9ristiques que l\u2019on associe \u00e0 un groupe donn\u00e9 \u00bb (R. c. Chouhan, 2021 CSC 26, [2021] 2 R.C.S. 136, par. 53 (je souligne), les juges Moldaver et Brown, citant A. Roberts, \u00ab (Re)forming the Jury : Detection and Disinfection of Implicit Juror Bias \u00bb (2012), 44 Conn. L. Rev. 827, p. 833). Le [traduction] \u00ab mythe \u00bb, quant \u00e0 lui, pourrait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une \u00ab fausse id\u00e9e largement r\u00e9pandue \u00bb (Oxford English Dictionary (en ligne)) qui vaut pour les gens en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, particuli\u00e8rement en mati\u00e8re de comportements sexuels. Par exemple, les \u00ab deux mythes \u00bb dont il est question au par. 276(1) du Code criminel concernent tous les plaignants dont les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents sexuels sont en cause, et ce, bien que ces mythes aient toujours cibl\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on disproportionn\u00e9e les femmes et les enfants. Bien que la signification de ces termes puisse se recouper, il convient de s\u2019efforcer de bien cerner les pr\u00e9occupations pertinentes en jeu dans chaque cas.\n[159] Je rel\u00e8ve que le recours par les juges \u00e0 des attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es dans leur raisonnement est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 par certains comme une forme de \u00ab connaissance d\u2019office \u00bb implicite (voir, p. ex., Hill, Tanovich et Strezos, \u00a7 26:2). \u00c0 mon avis, il vaut mieux \u00e9viter d\u2019employer l\u2019expression \u00ab connaissance d\u2019office \u00bb dans ce contexte, pour pr\u00e9server la distinction qui existe entre a) les raisonnements qui portent sur la preuve en raison d\u2019une compatibilit\u00e9 avec une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e et b) les conclusions qui portent sur des faits notoires ou incontestables et qui rel\u00e8vent de la connaissance d\u2019office (par opposition aux conclusions de fait tir\u00e9es de la preuve). Comme je l\u2019expliquerai plus loin, il y a lieu de maintenir une distinction entre ces concepts.\nIV. Cadre applicable \u00e0 l\u2019examen en appel du recours par le juge du proc\u00e8s \u00e0 des attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es dans le processus de recherche des faits\n[160] Les principes mentionn\u00e9s pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment font ressortir deux id\u00e9es ma\u00eetresses, qui peuvent \u00eatre en tension, mais pas n\u00e9cessairement en conflit.\n[161] D\u2019une part, le juge des faits a n\u00e9cessairement recours \u00e0 des attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es fond\u00e9es sur le bon sens ou sur l\u2019exp\u00e9rience humaine comme point de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence logique pour appr\u00e9cier la preuve. Pour ce faire, il proc\u00e8de d\u2019au moins deux fa\u00e7ons : (1) en tirant des inf\u00e9rences \u00e0 partir des faits \u00e9tablis par preuve directe (en comparant l\u2019inf\u00e9rence propos\u00e9e avec une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e concernant ce qui est susceptible de se passer dans une situation donn\u00e9e); (2) en appr\u00e9ciant la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 d\u2019un t\u00e9moin (en comparant sa d\u00e9position avec une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e quant \u00e0 ce que les gens sont cens\u00e9s faire ou ressentir en pareil cas).\n[162] D\u2019autre part, le recours \u00e0 des attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es en mati\u00e8re criminelle n\u2019est pas illimit\u00e9. Certaines attentes ne sont pas n\u00e9cessairement des pr\u00e9dicteurs exacts ou fiables du comportement humain en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. On pourrait songer, par exemple \u2014 bien que, comme je vais l\u2019expliquer, cette liste ne soit pas limitative \u2014 aux \u00ab st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00bb ou aux autres hypoth\u00e8ses pr\u00e9judiciables relatifs \u00e0 un groupe particulier de personnes, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 certaines fausses id\u00e9es largement r\u00e9pandues sur le comportement humain que l\u2019on a qualifi\u00e9 en droit de \u00ab mythes \u00bb. En outre, m\u00eame si une attente peut \u00eatre acceptable en tant que proposition g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, il existe toujours une possibilit\u00e9 qu\u2019elle soit d\u00e9mentie par la r\u00e9alit\u00e9. Le devoir du juge du proc\u00e8s est de d\u00e9terminer ce qui s\u2019est r\u00e9ellement pass\u00e9, et de le faire en se fondant sur la preuve. Dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, la conclusion factuelle qui repose exclusivement sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e en l\u2019absence \u2014 ou \u00e0 l\u2019exclusion \u2014 de toute preuve pourrait, au mieux, \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme un fait admis d\u2019office, ce qui commande l\u2019application d\u2019un crit\u00e8re rigoureux. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une situation diff\u00e9rente du recours \u00e0 des attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es en tant qu\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment contribuant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9laboration du raisonnement lors de l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de la preuve.\n[163] \u00c0 mon avis, ces id\u00e9es ma\u00eetresses font ressortir trois questions qu\u2019une juridiction d\u2019appel devrait se poser lorsqu\u2019elle est saisie d\u2019une demande d\u2019examen judiciaire dans laquelle il est reproch\u00e9 au juge du proc\u00e8s d\u2019avoir commis une erreur de droit en recourant \u00e0 des attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es dans son processus de recherche des faits :\nA. Le juge du proc\u00e8s s\u2019est\u2011il appuy\u00e9 sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e dans son raisonnement?\nB. Si le juge du proc\u00e8s s\u2019est appuy\u00e9 sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e, cette attente \u00e9tait\u2011elle raisonnable?\nC. Le juge du proc\u00e8s s\u2019est\u2011il fond\u00e9 sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e comme s\u2019il s\u2019agissait en soi d\u2019un fait d\u00e9terminant et incontestable?\n[164] La premi\u00e8re question permet d\u2019\u00e9tablir une distinction entre l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation globale de la preuve par le juge et le recours par celui\u2011ci \u00e0 des attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es pour formuler un raisonnement. Les deuxi\u00e8me et troisi\u00e8me questions permettent de d\u00e9celer d\u2019\u00e9ventuelles erreurs de droit commises par le juge du proc\u00e8s, mais seulement si l\u2019on a r\u00e9pondu affirmativement \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re question et que le juge s\u2019est effectivement appuy\u00e9 sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e. Je discuterai de chaque question \u00e0 tour de r\u00f4le. On trouvera en annexe aux pr\u00e9sents motifs un sch\u00e9ma de ce cadre d\u2019analyse.\nA. Le juge du proc\u00e8s s\u2019est\u2011il appuy\u00e9 sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e dans son raisonnement?\n[165] Lorsqu\u2019un juge du proc\u00e8s parvient \u00e0 une conclusion sur la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 d\u2019un t\u00e9moin ou qu\u2019il tire une inf\u00e9rence ou une conclusion de fait \u00e0 partir de la preuve, cette conclusion peut sembler refl\u00e9ter une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e sur le comportement de la plupart des gens \u2014 ou d\u2019une cat\u00e9gorie particuli\u00e8re de personnes. Or, il est possible que le juge ne se soit pas r\u00e9ellement appuy\u00e9 sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e. Il a peut\u2011\u00eatre plut\u00f4t \u00e9valu\u00e9 la preuve en la comparant \u00e0 d\u2019autres faits ou \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve admis au cours du proc\u00e8s. En r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, une juridiction d\u2019appel ne doit pas s\u2019immiscer dans l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation globale de la preuve effectu\u00e9e par le juge du proc\u00e8s, sauf en cas d\u2019erreur de droit manifeste et d\u00e9terminante, ou \u00e0 moins d\u2019un verdict d\u00e9raisonnable comme le pr\u00e9voit le sous\u2011al. 686(1)a)(i).\n[166] Ainsi, lorsqu\u2019il est reproch\u00e9 au juge de s\u2019\u00eatre ind\u00fbment fond\u00e9 sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e, la juridiction d\u2019appel doit d\u2019abord examiner les motifs du juge pour d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il s\u2019est effectivement fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e en cause. S\u2019il n\u2019a pas recouru \u00e0 une telle attente, il n\u2019y a pas lieu de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 un examen plus pouss\u00e9 en appel, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019il n\u2019existe d\u2019autres motifs reconnus permettant une intervention en appel, comme un verdict d\u00e9raisonnable. Par contre, si la juridiction d\u2019appel conclut que le juge du proc\u00e8s s\u2019est effectivement fond\u00e9 sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e, elle poursuit l\u2019analyse et passe \u00e0 la question suivante.\n[167] \u00c0 ce stade de l\u2019analyse, la juridiction d\u2019appel ne cherche pas \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si une erreur a \u00e9t\u00e9 commise. Le juge qui s\u2019appuie sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e comme point de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence logique pour appr\u00e9cier la preuve ne commet pas en soi d\u2019erreur de droit. Au contraire, comme je l\u2019ai expliqu\u00e9, il s\u2019agit d\u2019un aspect bien reconnu et n\u00e9cessaire du processus de recherche des faits par le juge. Pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re question, la juridiction d\u2019appel cherche plut\u00f4t simplement \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer ce que le juge du proc\u00e8s a r\u00e9ellement d\u00e9cid\u00e9, les raisons pour lesquelles il a rendu cette d\u00e9cision et s\u2019il y a lieu de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 un examen plus approfondi.\n[168] Bon nombre des erreurs fr\u00e9quemment all\u00e9gu\u00e9es devant les juridictions d\u2019appel pourraient \u00eatre r\u00e9solues simplement en r\u00e9pondant \u00e0 cette question. Par exemple, dans l\u2019affaire Quartey, l\u2019accus\u00e9 affirmait qu\u2019il ne souhaitait pas avoir de relations sexuelles avec la plaignante et qu\u2019il avait repouss\u00e9 les tentatives de cette derni\u00e8re de lui faire une fellation parce qu\u2019il n\u2019aimait pas cette pratique. Le juge du proc\u00e8s n\u2019a pas retenu le t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019accus\u00e9 et l\u2019a reconnu coupable d\u2019agression sexuelle. En appel, l\u2019accus\u00e9 a plaid\u00e9 que le juge avait refus\u00e9 de le croire parce qu\u2019il avait tenu pour acquis que les hommes sont davantage int\u00e9ress\u00e9s par le sexe que les femmes et que tous les hommes aiment se faire faire une fellation. Notre Cour a convenu avec la Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Alberta que le juge du proc\u00e8s n\u2019avait pas \u00ab rejet\u00e9 erron\u00e9ment le t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019appelant sur la base de g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisations et de st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00bb parce que \u00ab les affirmations du premier juge \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard visaient la preuve propre \u00e0 l\u2019appelant lui\u2011m\u00eame ainsi que la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 des pr\u00e9tentions de celui\u2011ci quant \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont il avait r\u00e9agi dans les circonstances particuli\u00e8res de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, et non quelque conception st\u00e9r\u00e9otyp\u00e9e de la fa\u00e7on dont les hommes se conduiraient dans de telles circonstances \u00bb (par. 3 (en italique dans l\u2019original); voir aussi, p. ex., Pastro, par. 41 et 66; Percy, par. 107).\n[169] Comme le fait observer la professeure Dufraimont, [traduction] \u00ab [l]\u2019arr\u00eat Quartey suppose [. . .] clairement que l\u2019accus\u00e9 aurait obtenu gain de cause en appel si le juge du proc\u00e8s s\u2019\u00e9tait effectivement fond\u00e9 sur des st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes concernant les hommes et la sexualit\u00e9 masculine \u00bb ((2021), p. 548). Ainsi, une r\u00e9ponse n\u00e9gative \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re question pourrait \u00e9carter la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019une intervention en appel, m\u00eame lorsqu\u2019une pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e aurait constitu\u00e9 une erreur de droit (comme je l\u2019expliquerai plus loin), dans l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se o\u00f9 le juge y aurait eu recours.\n[170] Comment une juridiction d\u2019appel peut\u2011elle d\u00e9terminer si le juge du proc\u00e8s s\u2019est fond\u00e9 sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e (ce qui signifie que l\u2019analyse se poursuit en passant aux deux questions suivantes), ou s\u2019il a rendu sa d\u00e9cision en se fondant sur la preuve et sur les faits de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce (de sorte qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire, selon ce cadre d\u2019analyse, de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 un examen plus approfondi)? Dans le cadre de cette analyse, chaque cas est un cas d\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Notre Cour a toutefois formul\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises, dans des affaires r\u00e9centes, des indications \u00e0 l\u2019intention des juridictions d\u2019appel. La juridiction d\u2019appel doit se demander si les motifs, situ\u00e9s dans le contexte des questions en litige au proc\u00e8s et pris dans leur ensemble, permettent d\u2019expliquer ce qu\u2019a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 le juge du proc\u00e8s et les raisons pour lesquelles il l\u2019a fait, d\u2019une fa\u00e7on qui permet un examen efficace en appel. Les juridictions d\u2019appel ne doivent pas d\u00e9cortiquer avec finesse les motifs du juge du proc\u00e8s \u00e0 la recherche d\u2019une erreur (voir R. c. G.F., 2021 CSC 20, [2021] 1 R.C.S. 801, par. 69, citant R. c. Chung, 2020 CSC 8, [2020] 1 R.C.S. 405, par. 13 et 33). Elles ne doivent donc pas consid\u00e9rer isol\u00e9ment un seul \u00e9nonc\u00e9 qui pourrait sembler refl\u00e9ter une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e. Les motifs, pris dans leur ensemble et examin\u00e9s \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la preuve et des observations pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es au proc\u00e8s, pourraient indiquer que l\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 se rapportait aux circonstances particuli\u00e8res de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ou \u00e0 une conclusion formul\u00e9e par le juge ailleurs dans ses motifs.\n(1) Gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019erreur et application de la disposition r\u00e9paratrice\n[171] Avant de passer \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me question du cadre que je propose, je m\u2019arr\u00eate pour \u00e9tablir une distinction entre, d\u2019une part, la question de savoir si le juge du proc\u00e8s s\u2019est fond\u00e9 sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e, au sens o\u00f9 je l\u2019ai expliqu\u00e9, et, d\u2019autre part, la question de la \u00ab gravit\u00e9 \u00bb de l\u2019erreur qui lui est reproch\u00e9e et celle de l\u2019application de la disposition r\u00e9paratrice du sous\u2011al. 686(1)b)(iii) du Code criminel . Comme je l\u2019ai expliqu\u00e9, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat J.C., la Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Ontario a jug\u00e9 qu\u2019une fois qu\u2019elle a constat\u00e9 que le juge du proc\u00e8s a commis une erreur (en contrevenant \u00e0 la \u00ab r\u00e8gle interdisant le recours \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques infond\u00e9es \u00bb ou \u00e0 celle \u00ab interdisant le recours \u00e0 des st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00bb), la juridiction d\u2019appel n\u2019est justifi\u00e9e d\u2019infirmer cette d\u00e9cision en raison des erreurs qu\u2019elle contient [traduction] \u00ab que lorsque l\u2019inf\u00e9rence est \u201cfond\u00e9e\u201d sur ces erreurs et que celles\u2011ci ont jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le d\u00e9terminant ou important pour amener le juge \u00e0 tirer la conclusion attaqu\u00e9e \u00bb (par. 71). Le juge Paciocco a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il incombait \u00e0 l\u2019accus\u00e9 qui interjette appel de d\u00e9montrer que l\u2019erreur a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le d\u00e9terminant dans l\u2019esprit du juge, et il a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019il en allait autrement pour l\u2019application de la disposition r\u00e9paratrice, dans le cadre de laquelle le fardeau de la preuve incombe \u00e0 la Couronne (par. 100\u2011101). Cet aspect de l\u2019arr\u00eat J.C. a amen\u00e9 la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie\u2011Britannique, dans la cause de M. Tsang, \u00e0 proc\u00e9der \u00e0 un examen approfondi de la preuve et des motifs de la juge du proc\u00e8s pour d\u00e9terminer si cette derni\u00e8re avait commis une erreur justifiant l\u2019infirmation de sa d\u00e9cision, apr\u00e8s avoir conclu qu\u2019elle avait effectivement commis une erreur.\n[172] L\u2019exigence quant \u00e0 la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019erreur \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat J.C. semble reposer sur l\u2019id\u00e9e qu\u2019il est possible que, dans les faits, le juge ne se soit pas \u00ab fond\u00e9 \u00bb sur \u00ab un st\u00e9r\u00e9otype ou une d\u00e9duction inadmissible \u00bb comme c\u2019\u00e9tait le cas par exemple dans l\u2019affaire Quartey (voir J.C., par. 71\u201174). Je r\u00e9pondrais \u00e0 cette question comme je l\u2019ai fait pour la premi\u00e8re question dont j\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 trait\u00e9. Selon moi, la juridiction d\u2019appel doit aborder la question du \u00ab recours \u00bb par le premier juge \u00e0 une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e au d\u00e9but de l\u2019analyse, et non au stade de l\u2019analyse secondaire de la d\u00e9termination de la \u00ab gravit\u00e9 \u00bb de l\u2019erreur apr\u00e8s avoir constat\u00e9 celle\u2011ci. On favorise ainsi la retenue et la simplicit\u00e9 dans la mani\u00e8re de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019examen en appel, en \u00e9vitant une analyse inutile du caract\u00e8re raisonnable d\u2019attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es ou de \u00ab st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00bb hypoth\u00e9tiques sur lesquels le juge du proc\u00e8s ne s\u2019est finalement pas appuy\u00e9.\n[173] Toutefois, contrairement \u00e0 ce que pr\u00e9voyait le cadre d\u2019analyse propos\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat J.C., cette question ne d\u00e9pend pas de la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la question de savoir si le recours par le juge \u00e0 une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le \u00ab d\u00e9terminant \u00bb ou \u00ab important \u00bb dans cette analyse. Chaque fois qu\u2019elle estime que le juge du proc\u00e8s s\u2019est fond\u00e9 sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e, la juridiction d\u2019appel doit, dans son analyse, passer \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me question que j\u2019expose plus loin, et ce, peu importe que le recours par le juge \u00e0 une telle attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e ait jou\u00e9 ou non un r\u00f4le d\u00e9terminant ou important. Je le r\u00e9p\u00e8te : ce n\u2019est pas parce que la juridiction d\u2019appel r\u00e9pond par l\u2019affirmative \u00e0 cette question qu\u2019elle a pour autant conclu qu\u2019une erreur a \u00e9t\u00e9 commise.\n[174] J\u2019en arrive \u00e0 cette conclusion parce que, comme je vais l\u2019expliquer, la question de savoir si l\u2019erreur a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le \u00ab important \u00bb dans la d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 n\u2019est pas pertinente lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9terminer si une erreur de droit a \u00e9t\u00e9 commise. Ce n\u2019est en effet qu\u2019apr\u00e8s que la juridiction d\u2019appel a constat\u00e9 qu\u2019une erreur de droit a \u00e9t\u00e9 commise qu\u2019il incombe \u00e0 la Couronne de d\u00e9montrer si l\u2019erreur a jou\u00e9 ou non un r\u00f4le \u00ab important \u00bb dans la d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9. Les modalit\u00e9s du fardeau qui p\u00e8se sur la Couronne \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard varient selon l\u2019identit\u00e9 de la partie qui fait appel et la nature de l\u2019erreur all\u00e9gu\u00e9e.\n[175] Dans le cadre de l\u2019appel interjet\u00e9 par l\u2019accus\u00e9 de son verdict de culpabilit\u00e9, la question de la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019erreur est examin\u00e9e au regard de la disposition r\u00e9paratrice du sous\u2011al. 686(1)b)(iii) du Code criminel . Chaque fois qu\u2019elle constate que le juge du proc\u00e8s a commis une erreur de droit, la juridiction d\u2019appel saisie de l\u2019appel d\u2019un verdict de culpabilit\u00e9 peut n\u00e9anmoins refuser d\u2019intervenir en vertu de la disposition r\u00e9paratrice si elle est d\u2019avis qu\u2019aucun tort important ou qu\u2019aucune erreur judiciaire grave ne s\u2019est produit. La disposition r\u00e9paratrice peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e dans deux cas : (1) lorsque l\u2019erreur peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme \u00ab inoffensive \u00bb; (2) lorsque la preuve de la Couronne est \u00ab accablante \u00bb (R. c. Sarrazin, 2011 CSC 54, [2011] 3 R.C.S. 505, par. 25 (italique omis)). Il incombe \u00e0 la Couronne de d\u00e9montrer que l\u2019erreur satisfait \u00e0 l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre de ces conditions (R. c. Van, 2009 CSC 22, [2009] 1 R.C.S. 716, par. 34). Dans un cas comme dans l\u2019autre, \u00ab la question sous\u2011jacente est toujours de savoir si, n\u2019e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019erreur, le verdict aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 le m\u00eame \u00bb (Van, par. 36).\n[176] Il ne faut pas confondre les principes r\u00e9gissant l\u2019examen en appel d\u2019une erreur de droit et ceux relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019application de la disposition r\u00e9paratrice. Le Code criminel et la jurisprudence de notre Cour exigent une analyse structur\u00e9e. L\u2019appelant doit d\u2019abord d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019une erreur de droit a \u00e9t\u00e9 commise. Ce n\u2019est qu\u2019ensuite qu\u2019il incombe \u00e0 la Couronne, si elle d\u00e9cide d\u2019invoquer la disposition r\u00e9paratrice, de d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019un des motifs donnant lieu \u00e0 son application entre en jeu. Ce transfert du fardeau de la preuve de l\u2019accus\u00e9 \u00e0 la Couronne \u00ab cr\u00e9e une pr\u00e9somption suivant laquelle l\u2019appel sera accueilli s\u2019il est \u00e9tabli qu\u2019une erreur de droit [. . .] est survenue, \u00e0 moins que soit d\u00e9montr\u00e9e la possibilit\u00e9 de rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 cette erreur ou \u00e0 cette irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 \u00bb (R. c. Khan, 2001 CSC 86, [2001] 3 R.C.S. 823, par. 88; voir aussi Morrissey). Le fardeau impos\u00e9 \u00e0 la Couronne est lourd et \u00ab refl\u00e8te le r\u00f4le limit\u00e9 que joue une cour d\u2019appel et le besoin de prot\u00e9ger le processus de justice p\u00e9nale contre le risque de d\u00e9clarations de culpabilit\u00e9 injustifi\u00e9es \u00bb (R. c. Samaniego, 2022 CSC 9, par. 162, les juges C\u00f4t\u00e9 et Rowe, dissidents). On inverserait effectivement la charge de la preuve si l\u2019on obligeait l\u2019accus\u00e9 qui fait appel de son verdict de culpabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019erreur de droit qu\u2019il reproche au juge du proc\u00e8s, car ces questions ne se posent que lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9terminer si la disposition r\u00e9paratrice s\u2019applique. Par exemple, dans l\u2019affaire J.C., la Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Ontario a estim\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait d\u2019erreur justifiant l\u2019infirmation de la d\u00e9cision que lorsqu\u2019on [traduction] \u00ab ne peut affirmer, sans risque de se tromper, que le juge du proc\u00e8s aurait tir\u00e9 la m\u00eame conclusion sans cette erreur \u00bb (par. 73). On voit mal comment on pourrait conclure que \u00ab n\u2019e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019erreur, le verdict aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 le m\u00eame \u00bb pour l\u2019application de la disposition r\u00e9paratrice s\u2019il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le juge n\u2019aurait pas tir\u00e9 la m\u00eame conclusion sans cette erreur.\n[177] Dans l\u2019affaire J.C., la Cour d\u2019appel a peut\u2011\u00eatre appliqu\u00e9 par erreur \u00e0 l\u2019affaire dont elle \u00e9tait saisie la norme de la gravit\u00e9 en la transposant \u00e0 partir de deux autres cas de figure dans lesquels cette r\u00e8gle devait \u00eatre respect\u00e9e. Or, la justification de l\u2019exigence de la gravit\u00e9 est propre \u00e0 ces cas et l\u2019on ne peut transposer ce crit\u00e8re aux appels de verdicts de culpabilit\u00e9 dans lesquels une erreur de droit est all\u00e9gu\u00e9e.\n[178] Tout d\u2019abord, le crit\u00e8re de la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019erreur de droit s\u2019applique dans les appels interjet\u00e9s par la Couronne d\u2019un verdict d\u2019acquittement (R. c. Graveline, 2006 CSC 16, [2006] 1 R.C.S. 609, par. 14). Dans le cas de ces appels, il incombe \u00e0 la Couronne de prouver \u00e0 la fois l\u2019existence d\u2019une erreur de droit et la gravit\u00e9 de cette erreur. La charge qui p\u00e8se sur la Couronne est \u00ab lourde \u00bb, compte tenu du fait qu\u2019un verdict d\u2019acquittement ne devrait pas \u00eatre annul\u00e9 \u00e0 la l\u00e9g\u00e8re (R. c. Morin, [1988] 2 R.C.S. 345, p. 374; Graveline, par. 15; S. Coughlan, Criminal Procedure, (4e \u00e9d. 2020), p. 587). Ainsi, \u00ab diff\u00e9rentes consid\u00e9rations de principe s\u2019appliquent \u00e0 l\u2019attribution au minist\u00e8re public d\u2019un droit d\u2019appel contre des acquittements \u00bb (R. c. Biniaris, 2000 CSC 15, [2000] 1 R.C.S. 381, par. 33). Or, les pr\u00e9occupations exprim\u00e9es au sujet de la limitation des cas dans lesquels la Couronne peut interjeter appel ne sauraient s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 l\u2019accus\u00e9 qui fait appel de son verdict de culpabilit\u00e9 o\u00f9, encore une fois, les erreurs de droit sont pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es lui avoir caus\u00e9 un pr\u00e9judice, \u00e0 moins que la Couronne ne r\u00e9ussisse \u00e0 prouver le contraire comme le pr\u00e9voit la disposition r\u00e9paratrice.\n[179] Ensuite, la question de la gravit\u00e9 se pose dans le contexte d\u2019une interpr\u00e9tation erron\u00e9e de la preuve qui a entra\u00een\u00e9 une erreur judiciaire (voir Morrissey; R. c. Lohrer, 2004 CSC 80, [2004] 3 R.C.S. 732; R. c. Sinclair, 2011 CSC 40, [2011] 3 R.C.S. 3). Dans le cas qui nous occupe, l\u2019accus\u00e9 qui interjette appel de son verdict de culpabilit\u00e9 doit prouver la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019erreur parce que l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation erron\u00e9e de la preuve est, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, une question factuelle et non une question de droit. Il n\u2019existe pas de pr\u00e9somption selon laquelle les questions de fait sont importantes et les erreurs commises \u00e0 leur sujet constituent des erreurs judiciaires, de sorte que les motifs de l\u2019intervention en appel en vertu de l\u2019al. 686(1) a) du Code criminel seraient engag\u00e9s. Comme l\u2019a expliqu\u00e9 le juge Doherty dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Morrissey : [traduction] \u00ab [l]orsque l\u2019erreur reproch\u00e9e est une erreur de droit, il incombe \u00e0 la Couronne de d\u00e9montrer que cette erreur n\u2019a pas entra\u00een\u00e9 d\u2019erreur judiciaire. Lorsque l\u2019erreur ne porte pas exclusivement sur une question de droit, le fardeau de la preuve repose sur l\u2019appelant \u00bb (p. 540).\n[180] Cette pr\u00e9cision faite, je passe maintenant \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me question que la juridiction d\u2019appel devrait se poser dans l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se o\u00f9 elle a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le juge du proc\u00e8s s\u2019est fond\u00e9 sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e.\nB. Si le juge du proc\u00e8s s\u2019est appuy\u00e9 sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e, cette attente \u00e9tait\u2011elle raisonnable?\n[181] Je le r\u00e9p\u00e8te : le juge du proc\u00e8s qui se fonde sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e comme point de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence logique pour appr\u00e9cier la preuve ne commet pas de ce fait une erreur de droit. Les attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es jouent n\u00e9cessairement un r\u00f4le lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de tirer des inf\u00e9rences ou de se prononcer sur la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9. Cependant, comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 expliqu\u00e9, les attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es ne prennent pas appui sur la preuve, mais sur le bon sens et l\u2019exp\u00e9rience humaine. Certaines attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es qui sont largement r\u00e9pandues dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 peuvent, au fil du temps, s\u2019av\u00e9rer inexactes ou peu fiables, notamment en raison de l\u2019\u00e9volution des recherches en psychologie ou en sciences sociales. Il y a aussi des attentes qui ne sont pas g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement r\u00e9pandues, mais qui sont le produit de l\u2019intuition personnelle du juge du proc\u00e8s et qui ne permettent pas toujours de pr\u00e9voir avec pr\u00e9cision ou fiabilit\u00e9 les comportements ou les exp\u00e9riences des gens ordinaires. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9vidence, une inf\u00e9rence elle\u2011m\u00eame ne peut \u00eatre fond\u00e9e sur les propres [traduction] \u00ab intuitions [du juge] de ce qui constitue une r\u00e9action probable, alors que ces notions ne cadrent pas avec la th\u00e9orie de la probabilit\u00e9 objectivement pertinente \u00bb ou sur \u00ab un raisonnement st\u00e9r\u00e9otyp\u00e9 ou pr\u00e9judiciable ind\u00e9fendable \u00bb (Hill, Tanovich et Strezos, \u00a7 31:25). De m\u00eame, lorsqu\u2019on tire une inf\u00e9rence en se fondant sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e, celle\u2011ci doit refl\u00e9ter un certain bon sens objectif plut\u00f4t que l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se formul\u00e9e par une seule personne, hypoth\u00e8se qui peut \u00eatre intuitive, mais qui peut s\u2019av\u00e9rer en fin de compte inexacte. Ainsi, \u00ab si le proc\u00e8s est une recherche de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et si on veut faciliter, au lieu de fausser, ce processus de recherche, il faut faire la lumi\u00e8re sur les hypoth\u00e8ses inexactes relatives au comportement humain qui am\u00e8nent le juge des faits \u00e0 tirer de la preuve des conclusions erron\u00e9es \u00bb (Marquard, p. 265\u2011266 (je souligne), la juge L\u2019Heureux\u2011Dub\u00e9, dissidente).\n[182] Je proposerais donc la question suivante aux fins d\u2019un examen en appel. Si, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re question, la juridiction d\u2019appel conclut que le juge du proc\u00e8s s\u2019est effectivement fond\u00e9 sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e pour appr\u00e9cier la preuve, elle doit d\u00e9terminer si cette attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e \u00e9tait raisonnable. Une norme fond\u00e9e sur le caract\u00e8re raisonnable suppose une part d\u2019objectivit\u00e9 et de consensus social lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de pr\u00e9ciser la mesure dans laquelle le juge du proc\u00e8s peut recourir au bon sens et \u00e0 l\u2019exp\u00e9rience humaine pour rendre sa d\u00e9cision, ce qui garantit que le juge des faits ne se fonde pas sur des attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es inexactes ou peu fiables. Une telle norme reconna\u00eet aussi qu\u2019\u00e0 mesure que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9volue, sa conception de ce qui est raisonnable peut changer.\n[183] Je note qu\u2019il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 possible d\u2019exprimer la norme en termes d\u2019\u00ab exactitude \u00bb, de \u00ab v\u00e9rit\u00e9 \u00bb, de \u00ab plausibilit\u00e9 \u00bb, etc. J\u2019estime toutefois que le terme \u00ab caract\u00e8re raisonnable \u00bb est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable. Il \u00e9tablit un \u00e9quilibre entre a) la garantie que le juge des faits ne s\u2019appuie pas sur des g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisations inacceptablement pr\u00e9judiciables ou inexactes, d\u2019une part, et b) le respect du r\u00f4le du juge des faits et la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 du bon sens et de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience humaine dans l\u2019\u00e9tablissement des faits, d\u2019autre part.\n[184] Le juge du proc\u00e8s qui s\u2019appuie sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e d\u00e9raisonnable pour appr\u00e9cier la preuve commet une erreur de droit. Cela donne lieu \u00e0 une intervention en appel, \u00e0 moins que la Couronne n\u2019invoque avec succ\u00e8s la disposition r\u00e9paratrice ou, si l\u2019appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 interjet\u00e9 par la Couronne, \u00e0 moins que cette derni\u00e8re ne soit en mesure de d\u00e9montrer la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019erreur (comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 expliqu\u00e9, ces questions se distinguent de l\u2019identification d\u2019une erreur de droit). J\u2019ajoute que le fait qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse d\u2019une norme fond\u00e9e sur le \u00ab caract\u00e8re raisonnable \u00bb n\u2019emp\u00eache pas d\u2019effectuer un examen en appel selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019erreurs de droit; d\u2019autres normes faisant appel au \u00ab caract\u00e8re raisonnable \u00bb (p. ex., l\u2019existence de motifs raisonnables et probables (R. c. Shepherd, 2009 CSC 35, [2009] 2 R.C.S. 527, par. 20)) peuvent comporter une question de droit.\n[185] Tout comme la ligne de d\u00e9marcation entre une inf\u00e9rence raisonnable et une conjecture \u00ab n\u2019est pas toujours facile \u00bb \u00e0 tracer (Villaroman, par. 38 et 43), il est difficile de d\u00e9finir avec une pr\u00e9cision parfaite, dans l\u2019abstrait, ce qui constitue une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e raisonnable. C\u2019est \u00e0 la juridiction d\u2019appel qu\u2019il appartient de se prononcer sur le caract\u00e8re raisonnable d\u2019une proposition fond\u00e9e sur le bon sens ou l\u2019exp\u00e9rience humaine. Il est toutefois essentiel que l\u2019attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e soit le reflet raisonnablement exact de ce qui est vrai dans la plupart des circonstances, pour qu\u2019on puisse s\u2019en servir comme point de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence fiable pour appr\u00e9cier la preuve.\n[186] La jurisprudence regorge d\u2019exemples d\u2019attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es raisonnables. Souvent, celles\u2011ci ont trait \u00e0 l\u2019exp\u00e9rience ou au comportement humains. En font partie les \u00ab hypoth\u00e8ses logiques \u00bb dont j\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 parl\u00e9, selon lesquelles les gens pr\u00e9voient les cons\u00e9quences naturelles de leurs actes ou sont peu susceptibles de faire de fausses d\u00e9clarations contre leur propre int\u00e9r\u00eat. On recourt fr\u00e9quemment \u00e0 de telles attentes dans le processus de recherche des faits parce que l\u2019on consid\u00e8re qu\u2019elles refl\u00e8tent raisonnablement fid\u00e8lement le comportement ou l\u2019exp\u00e9rience humaine ordinaire, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 preuve du contraire. Cela ne signifie pas que ces attentes sont invariablement vraies, mais seulement qu\u2019elles le sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement. Le raisonnement s\u2019articule autour de ce type [traduction] \u00ab d\u2019hypoth\u00e8ses sur les r\u00e9actions ordinaires des gens pour appr\u00e9cier la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et pour \u00e9valuer des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve circonstancielle \u00bb (R. c R.R., 2018 ABCA 287, 366 C.C.C. (3d) 293, par. 5; voir, p. ex., A.R.D., par. 100; voir R. c. White, 2011 CSC 13, [2011] 1 R.C.S. 433, par. 67). Ainsi, l\u2019attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e acceptable dans un cas pourra \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e dans un autre (en vertu du principe de l\u2019universalit\u00e9, que j\u2019examinerai plus loin).\n[187] Lorsque les limites du bon sens ou de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience humaine ont \u00e9t\u00e9 franchies et que le juge du proc\u00e8s s\u2019est appuy\u00e9 sur une proposition erron\u00e9e sous pr\u00e9texte qu\u2019elle est fond\u00e9e sur \u00ab le bon sens \u00bb ou \u00ab l\u2019exp\u00e9rience humaine \u00bb, on ne peut tenir pour acquis que cette proposition refl\u00e8te raisonnablement la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 dans la plupart des circonstances, de sorte qu\u2019on ne devrait pas s\u2019en servir comme point de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour appr\u00e9cier la preuve. Les mythes et les st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes sont des exemples reconnus d\u2019attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es inexactes qui \u00ab compromettent la fonction judiciaire de recherche de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 \u00bb (R. c. A.G., 2000 CSC 17, [2000] 1 R.C.S. 439, par. 2). Par exemple, la common law refl\u00e9tait historiquement l\u2019attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e selon laquelle il est probable qu\u2019une victime d\u2019agression sexuelle d\u00e9nonce ce type d\u2019acte, et que son d\u00e9faut de faire un signalement indiquait que les actes reproch\u00e9s n\u2019avaient pas eu lieu. Bien que, \u00e0 une certaine \u00e9poque, cette attente ait \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e raisonnable, comme en t\u00e9moignait la \u00ab doctrine [. . .] de la plainte imm\u00e9diate \u00bb, l\u2019\u00e9volution des connaissances a permis de comprendre, avec le temps, qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e inexacte et, donc, d\u00e9raisonnable (voir R. c. D.D., 2000 CSC 43, [2000] 2 R.C.S. 275, par. 60\u201163 et 65). Toutefois, les mythes et les st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes ne sont pas les seules formes d\u2019exemples d\u2019attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es d\u00e9raisonnables. Comme je vais l\u2019expliquer, j\u2019estime qu\u2019il ne faut pas se fonder sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e inexacte portant sur le comportement humain ordinaire pour appr\u00e9cier la preuve, que cette attente puisse ou non \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9e de mythe ou de st\u00e9r\u00e9otype.\n[188] J\u2019insiste sur le fait que cette analyse porte sur un aspect bien pr\u00e9cis du processus de recherche des faits. Je le r\u00e9p\u00e8te : les attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es fond\u00e9es sur le bon sens et l\u2019exp\u00e9rience humaine font partie int\u00e9grante du processus de recherche des faits. Elles servent de point de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence logique pour \u00e9valuer la preuve afin de tirer des conclusions au sujet de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 ou des inf\u00e9rences factuelles. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de l\u2019examen de cette question, la juridiction d\u2019appel s\u2019en tient \u00e0 ce point de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence, et se garde d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter la preuve ou de tirer des conclusions \u00e0 partir de la preuve. Lorsque le juge du proc\u00e8s s\u2019est fond\u00e9 sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e raisonnable, la juridiction d\u2019appel ne doit pas intervenir pour modifier l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de la preuve faite par le juge en fonction de l\u2019attente en question simplement parce qu\u2019elle aurait tir\u00e9 une conclusion diff\u00e9rente.\n[189] Jusqu\u2019\u00e0 maintenant, j\u2019ai expos\u00e9 la fa\u00e7on dont je con\u00e7ois la d\u00e9marche que les juridictions d\u2019appel devraient adopter pour \u00e9valuer le caract\u00e8re raisonnable d\u2019attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es. Dans les sections suivantes, je vais discuter de deux autres points qui ressortent des observations de la Couronne, en l\u2019occurrence : (1) la question de savoir si la d\u00e9termination du caract\u00e8re raisonnable d\u2019une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e est une question de droit; (2) la question de savoir si l\u2019on devrait adopter le cadre d\u2019analyse propos\u00e9 par la Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Ontario dans l\u2019arr\u00eat J.C., y compris la \u00ab r\u00e8gle interdisant le recours \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques infond\u00e9es \u00bb et la \u00ab r\u00e8gle interdisant le recours \u00e0 des inf\u00e9rences fond\u00e9es sur des st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00bb.\n(1) Question de droit ou question de fait?\n[190] La question au c\u0153ur du diff\u00e9rend qui oppose les parties au sujet des principes juridiques en cause dans les pr\u00e9sents pourvois est celle de savoir si le recours par le juge du proc\u00e8s \u00e0 une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e constitue une question de droit ou une question de fait. Cette caract\u00e9risation est importante tant pour d\u00e9limiter la comp\u00e9tence de la juridiction d\u2019appel que pour d\u00e9finir la norme d\u2019examen en appel.\n[191] Il n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9 que l\u2019on ne peut recourir sans limites aux attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es qui constituent des questions de droit. Ainsi, diverses attentes fond\u00e9es sur des mythes ou des st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des plaignants, en particulier les femmes et les enfants, dans le contexte des proc\u00e8s pour agression sexuelle ont \u00e9t\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9es d\u2019erreurs de droit, soit par la loi, soit par les tribunaux. Par exemple, le par. 276(1) du Code criminel interdit de tirer des d\u00e9ductions des activit\u00e9s sexuelles ant\u00e9rieures du plaignant pour formuler des conclusions sur les questions du consentement ou de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 du plaignant \u2014 ce qui est souvent d\u00e9sign\u00e9 sous le vocable des \u00ab deux mythes \u00bb. Les tribunaux ont relev\u00e9 d\u2019autres attentes sur lesquelles on ne peut, en droit, se fonder, comme celle selon laquelle la personne qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d\u2019une agression sexuelle aura n\u00e9cessairement un comportement d\u2019\u00e9vitement envers son agresseur (voir A.R.J.D.; voir aussi, p. ex., R. c. Mills, [1999] 3 R.C.S. 668, par. 90; R. c. Osolin, [1993] 4 R.C.S. 595, p. 670).\n[192] Soyons clairs : rien dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs ne doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme modifiant ou diluant la jurisprudence sur les mythes et les st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes reconnus dans le contexte des proc\u00e8s pour agression sexuelle. Ces mythes et ces st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u2014 y compris les \u00ab deux mythes \u00bb dont il est fait mention dans le Code criminel et d\u2019autres attentes d\u00e9savou\u00e9es sur la fa\u00e7on dont les gens, et les femmes et les enfants de fa\u00e7on disproportionn\u00e9e, sont cens\u00e9s se comport\u00e9es durant des rapports sexuels \u2014 n\u2019ont pas leur place en droit et ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 juste titre d\u00e9nonc\u00e9s comme des erreurs de droit (A.R.J.D., par. 2). Mes motifs ne doivent pas non plus \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s comme laissant entendre que toutes les personnes vivent de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on les pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s et la marginalisation ou les subissent au m\u00eame degr\u00e9, ind\u00e9pendamment de caract\u00e9ristiques comme le sexe, l\u2019\u00e2ge et la race.\n[193] La Couronne laisse toutefois entendre que les cat\u00e9gories d\u2019attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es sur lesquelles on ne peut, en droit, se fonder se limitent \u00e0 celles qu\u2019on peut qualifier de \u00ab mythes \u00bb ou de \u00ab st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00bb r\u00e9prouv\u00e9s. Je ne suis pas d\u2019accord. \u00c0 mon avis, une d\u00e9marche aussi restrictive cr\u00e9erait des distinctions artificielles en droit, limiterait ind\u00fbment le r\u00f4le important que jouent les juridictions d\u2019appel dans le syst\u00e8me de justice p\u00e9nale et risquerait de miner la confiance du public \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019administration de la justice. Pour les motifs qui suivent, j\u2019estime plut\u00f4t que l\u2019examen en appel d\u2019une erreur de droit devrait aussi porter sur le caract\u00e8re raisonnable de toute attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e sur laquelle s\u2019est appuy\u00e9 le juge du proc\u00e8s.\n[194] Sur le plan conceptuel, la raison invoqu\u00e9e pour justifier le recours \u00e0 une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e est la m\u00eame, et ce, peu importe que l\u2019on consid\u00e8re l\u2019attente en cause comme un \u00ab mythe \u00bb, un \u00ab st\u00e9r\u00e9otype \u00bb ou comme autre chose. M\u00eame si le nombre de personnes faisant l\u2019objet de telles attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es et leur v\u00e9cu diff\u00e8rent, toutes les attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es se r\u00e9clament de la m\u00eame source, soit du \u00ab bon sens \u00bb et de \u00ab l\u2019exp\u00e9rience humaine \u00bb. Je ne suis pas persuad\u00e9 qu\u2019il existe une raison de principe justifiant de traiter s\u00e9par\u00e9ment diverses cat\u00e9gories d\u2019attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es, au risque de cr\u00e9er en droit des distinctions artificielles sans que la ligne de d\u00e9marcation entre elles soit clairement d\u00e9finie.\n[195] Sur le plan pratique, les cours d\u2019appel interm\u00e9diaires soul\u00e8vent de plus en plus de questions au sujet du recours par les juges du proc\u00e8s \u00e0 des attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es d\u00e9raisonnable en dehors des cat\u00e9gories paradigmatiques des mythes et des st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes sur les plaignants dans les affaires d\u2019agression sexuelle. La professeure Dufraimont signale que d\u2019autres cat\u00e9gories sont apparues dans la jurisprudence, comme les st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes concernant les hommes et les personnes accus\u00e9es d\u2019agression sexuelle ou ceux fond\u00e9s sur des motifs autres que le sexe et le genre, par exemple \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des Autochtones et des personnes racialis\u00e9es (voir (2021), p. 546\u2011550 et 557\u2011559). Selon moi, on ne peut pas \u00e9carter ces pr\u00e9occupations du revers de la main en les qualifiant de simple interventionnisme.\n[196] Je suis \u00e9galement d\u2019accord avec l\u2019intervenante, l\u2019Association qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise des avocats et avocates de la d\u00e9fense, pour dire que l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation plus restrictive pr\u00e9conis\u00e9e par la Couronne ne tiendrait pas compte d\u2019attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es que l\u2019on ne pourrait qualifier \u00e0 juste titre de \u00ab mythes \u00bb ou de \u00ab st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00bb concernant les plaignants dans les affaires d\u2019agressions sexuelles, mais que l\u2019on ne pourrait n\u00e9anmoins pas invoquer dans un proc\u00e8s criminel. Par exemple, dans l\u2019affaire J.C., pour rejeter le t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019accus\u00e9, le juge du proc\u00e8s s\u2019\u00e9tait fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019attente selon laquelle les gens \u2014 en l\u2019occurrence, les personnes accus\u00e9es d\u2019agressions sexuelles \u2014 n\u2019atteignent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas l\u2019id\u00e9al \u00ab politiquement correct \u00bb de v\u00e9rifier le consentement de l\u2019autre personne \u00e0 chacune des \u00e9tapes des \u00e9bats sexuels. Dans l\u2019affaire Roth, le juge du proc\u00e8s a sembl\u00e9 pr\u00e9sumer que l\u2019accus\u00e9, \u00e9tant un dynamophile, \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab d\u2019une fa\u00e7on ou d\u2019une autre moins susceptible de ressentir la fatigue apr\u00e8s une longue journ\u00e9e, une activit\u00e9 physique ou la consommation d\u2019alcool \u00bb (par. 70). On peut difficilement qualifier ce type d\u2019attentes de \u00ab mythes \u00bb ou de \u00ab st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00bb au sens o\u00f9 l\u2019on interpr\u00e8te habituellement ces termes dans la jurisprudence (p. ex., dans l\u2019affaire Roth, la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie\u2011Britannique s\u2019est dite d\u2019avis que le juge du proc\u00e8s ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas fond\u00e9 sur un [traduction] \u00ab st\u00e9r\u00e9otyp[e] \u00bb \u00e0 propos du \u00ab comportement masculin \u00bb (par. 66)). J\u2019abonde toutefois dans le sens des juridictions d\u2019appel dans ces affaires lorsqu\u2019elles affirment que l\u2019on ne peut pas raisonnablement consid\u00e9rer que ces attentes refl\u00e8tent fid\u00e8lement le comportement humain habituel au regard duquel des questions aussi importantes que celles qui sont en cause dans un proc\u00e8s criminel peuvent \u00eatre tranch\u00e9es.\n[197] La Couronne affirme que l\u2019examen en appel d\u2019attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es devrait \u00eatre \u00e9troitement circonscrit parce que ce type d\u2019attentes fait partie de l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation factuelle de la preuve. Bien entendu, il y a lieu de faire preuve de d\u00e9f\u00e9rence envers le juge du proc\u00e8s sur les questions de fait. Toutefois, les questions qui portent sur des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ne sont pas n\u00e9cessairement toutes des questions de fait qui commandent la d\u00e9f\u00e9rence. Notre Cour reconna\u00eet au moins quatre types de situations o\u00f9 le traitement inad\u00e9quat de la preuve peut constituer une erreur de droit : (1) lorsque la conclusion de fait n\u2019est appuy\u00e9e par aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve; (2) lorsque l\u2019effet juridique des conclusions de fait ou des faits incontest\u00e9s soul\u00e8ve une question de droit; (3) lorsque l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de la preuve est fond\u00e9e sur un mauvais principe juridique; (4) lorsque le juge du proc\u00e8s n\u2019a pas tenu compte de tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve se rapportant \u00e0 la question ultime de la culpabilit\u00e9 ou de l\u2019innocence (R. c. J.M.H., 2011 CSC 45, [2011] 3 R.C.S. 197). Ainsi, le recours, par le juge du proc\u00e8s, \u00e0 des \u00ab mythes \u00bb ou \u00e0 des \u00ab st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00bb est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une erreur de droit, m\u00eame si ceux\u2011ci se rapportent \u00e0 l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de la preuve, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que, dans ce cas, l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de la preuve est fond\u00e9e sur un mauvais principe juridique \u2014 la troisi\u00e8me cat\u00e9gorie \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat J.M.H. (voir A.R.D., par. 28; Coughlan, p. 589, note 135). Encore une fois, \u00e0 mon avis, la m\u00eame logique vaut pour tout recours \u00e0 des attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es d\u00e9raisonnables.\n[198] Je suis confort\u00e9 dans ma conclusion, d\u2019une part, par les raisons de principe pour lesquelles la juridiction d\u2019appel fait preuve de d\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des conclusions factuelles tir\u00e9es par le juge du proc\u00e8s et, d\u2019autre part, par le vaste pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire qui permet aux juridictions d\u2019appel d\u2019intervenir sur des questions de droit.\n[199] La juridiction d\u2019appel fait preuve de retenue \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des conclusions tir\u00e9es par le juge du proc\u00e8s sur des questions de fait pour au moins les trois grandes raisons de principe suivantes \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Housen c. Nikolaisen, 2002 CSC 33, [2002] 2 R.C.S. 235 (une affaire civile) : (1) r\u00e9duire le nombre, la dur\u00e9e et le co\u00fbt des appels; (2) favoriser l\u2019autonomie du proc\u00e8s et son int\u00e9grit\u00e9; (3) reconna\u00eetre l\u2019expertise du juge de premi\u00e8re instance et sa position avantageuse pour \u00e9valuer la preuve (par. 16\u201118).\n[200] \u00c0 mon avis, le fait d\u2019appliquer la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte \u00e0 l\u2019examen d\u2019attentes d\u00e9raisonnables aurait peu d\u2019incidence sur ces raisons de principe. Bien qu\u2019il soit important, le souci de pr\u00e9server les ressources publiques et de favoriser l\u2019autonomie et l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 des proc\u00e8s est secondaire par rapport aux droits de l\u2019accus\u00e9 dans une proc\u00e9dure p\u00e9nale, compte tenu des int\u00e9r\u00eats en jeu et de la d\u00e9cision du l\u00e9gislateur d\u2019accorder un droit d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e9largi \u00e0 un premier niveau d\u2019appel (voir, p. ex., Sarrazin, par. 27, confirmant la norme rigoureuse applicable \u00e0 la disposition r\u00e9paratrice). C\u2019est plut\u00f4t la reconnaissance de l\u2019expertise et de la position avantageuse du juge du proc\u00e8s qui constitue la principale raison \u00e0 la base de la d\u00e9f\u00e9rence dont les cours d\u2019appel doivent faire preuve \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des questions de fait dans le contexte des proc\u00e9dures p\u00e9nales (voir, p. ex., R. c. Spencer, 2007 CSC 11, [2007] 1 R.C.S. 500, par. 17; R. c. Beaudry, 2007 CSC 5, [2007] 1 R.C.S. 190, par. 62). Les juges du proc\u00e8s ne sont cependant pas plus exp\u00e9riment\u00e9s ou dans une position plus avantageuse que les juges d\u2019appel pour d\u00e9terminer s\u2019ils ont affaire \u00e0 une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e raisonnable fond\u00e9e sur le bon sens ou l\u2019exp\u00e9rience humaine. Au contraire, la raison pour laquelle ces attentes sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement cens\u00e9es \u00eatre fiables est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment parce qu\u2019elles sont \u00ab r\u00e9pandues \u00bb ou qu\u2019elles correspondent aux exp\u00e9riences communes de toute la collectivit\u00e9.\n[201] En revanche, \u00ab le r\u00f4le premier [. . .] des cours d\u2019appel est de pr\u00e9ciser et de raffiner les r\u00e8gles de droit et de veiller \u00e0 leur application universelle \u00bb (Housen, par. 9). Les juridictions d\u2019appel disposent donc d\u2019un vaste pouvoir d\u2019examen sur les questions de droit. En raison du principe de l\u2019universalit\u00e9, les questions juridiques exigent des r\u00e9ponses claires et coh\u00e9rentes afin de maintenir la confiance du public dans l\u2019administration de la justice. De plus, les justiciables s\u2019attendent \u00e0 ce que les tribunaux participent \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation du droit en faisant preuve d\u2019un certain degr\u00e9 d\u2019expertise dans l\u2019art d\u2019\u00e9laborer des r\u00e8gles de droit justes et pratiques. Les tribunaux d\u2019appel \u00e9laborent des r\u00e8gles de droit qui s\u2019appliquent non seulement \u00e0 l\u2019affaire dont ils sont saisis, mais aussi \u00e0 d\u2019\u00e9ventuelles affaires (ibid.).\n[202] Dans le contexte des appels en mati\u00e8re p\u00e9nale, les juridictions d\u2019appel jouent un r\u00f4le particuli\u00e8rement important lorsqu\u2019elles examinent la fa\u00e7on dont le premier juge a instruit le proc\u00e8s, pour pr\u00e9venir les condamnations injustifi\u00e9es et garantir que toutes les d\u00e9clarations de culpabilit\u00e9 font suite \u00e0 un processus \u00e9quitable qui maintient la confiance du public dans l\u2019administration de la justice. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 expliqu\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Biniaris, \u00ab [l]es appels sur des questions de droit en mati\u00e8re criminelle reposent en partie sur la volont\u00e9 d\u2019assurer que les d\u00e9clarations de culpabilit\u00e9 criminelle r\u00e9sultent de proc\u00e8s d\u00e9nu\u00e9s de toute erreur. Les proc\u00e8s d\u00e9nu\u00e9s de toute erreur sont souhaitables en soi, mais \u00e0 plus forte raison en tant que moyen d\u2019\u00e9viter les d\u00e9clarations de culpabilit\u00e9 erron\u00e9es \u00bb (par. 26). Notre Cour a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00ab [u]ne personne qui est accus\u00e9e d\u2019un crime a droit \u00e0 un proc\u00e8s \u00e9quitable selon la loi. Toute erreur qui se produit au cours du proc\u00e8s et qui prive l\u2019accus\u00e9 de ce droit constitue une erreur judiciaire \u00bb (Fanjoy c. La Reine, [1985] 2 R.C.S. 233, p. 240; Morrissey, p. 541). Toute conception de l\u2019examen en appel qui minimise l\u2019importance du r\u00f4le des juridictions d\u2019appel compromettrait s\u00e9rieusement le syst\u00e8me de justice p\u00e9nale dans son ensemble.\n[203] Le fait de qualifier une question de question de droit rev\u00eat \u00e9galement de l\u2019importance pour fonder la comp\u00e9tence de la cour d\u2019appel en mati\u00e8re criminelle, sp\u00e9cialement en ce qui concerne les moyens limit\u00e9s permettant \u00e0 la Couronne d\u2019interjeter appel d\u2019un verdict d\u2019acquittement. Le droit limit\u00e9 reconnu \u00e0 la Couronne d\u2019interjeter appel sur des questions de droit permet de trouver un juste \u00e9quilibre entre, d\u2019une part, les imp\u00e9ratifs l\u00e9gitimes d\u2019un syst\u00e8me de justice criminelle fond\u00e9 sur la primaut\u00e9 du droit et, d\u2019autre part, le droit de l\u2019accus\u00e9 qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 acquitt\u00e9 d\u2019accusations criminelles \u00e0 ce que le verdict d\u2019acquittement soit d\u00e9finitif. Le l\u00e9gislateur et les tribunaux ont reconnu l\u2019importance de prot\u00e9ger la dignit\u00e9, la vie priv\u00e9e, l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 et les autres droits de tous les acteurs du syst\u00e8me de justice criminelle \u2014 y compris les plaignants \u2014 pour pr\u00e9server la confiance du public dans l\u2019administration de la justice (voir, p. ex., R. c. Ewanchuk, [1999] 1 R.C.S. 330). Si le caract\u00e8re raisonnable d\u2019une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e \u00e9tait consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une question de fait, la Couronne ne pourrait jamais interjeter appel d\u2019un verdict d\u2019acquittement fond\u00e9 sur des attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es qui ne constituent pas des \u00ab mythes \u00bb ou des \u00ab st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00bb, et ce, peu importe \u00e0 quel point elles seraient d\u00e9raisonnables ou contraires aux attentes collectives de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\n[204] \u00c0 mon avis, ces consid\u00e9rations militent en faveur de l\u2019application de la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de se prononcer sur le caract\u00e8re raisonnable d\u2019une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e. Cette analyse ne se fait pas en fonction de la preuve; elle repose plut\u00f4t sur ce qui est raisonnablement vrai dans la plupart des cas. L\u2019importance de pr\u00e9server la confiance du public \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019administration de la justice exige que, dans les affaires criminelles, les verdicts \u2014 qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse d\u2019acquittements ou de d\u00e9clarations de culpabilit\u00e9 \u2014 ne soient pas fond\u00e9s sur des hypoth\u00e8ses qui ne refl\u00e8tent pas raisonnablement la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 dans la plupart des cas. Les tribunaux d\u2019appel contribuent de fa\u00e7on appr\u00e9ciable \u00e0 assurer la coh\u00e9rence et la l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 du recours par les juges \u00e0 des attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es, dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat non seulement des affaires dont ils sont saisis, mais aussi de toute affaire \u00e9ventuelle.\n[205] Les cours d\u2019appel doivent se garder d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter quoi que ce soit dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs comme signifiant que la Couronne peut interjeter appel d\u2019un acquittement sur la base d\u2019une simple r\u00e9\u00e9valuation des faits.\n[206] Nous devrions veiller \u00e0 ne pas miner le r\u00f4le institutionnel important des cours d\u2019appel. Les juges de premi\u00e8re instance et les cours d\u2019appel assument des r\u00f4les compl\u00e9mentaires, les secondes servant de filet de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 pour rem\u00e9dier aux erreurs commises par les premiers. En droit criminel, il est crucial que l\u2019examen en appel soit efficace pour \u00e9viter les verdicts erron\u00e9s. Ant\u00e9rieurement, les cours d\u2019appel intervenaient trop ais\u00e9ment pour substituer leur propre appr\u00e9ciation de la preuve \u00e0 celle du juge du proc\u00e8s. Plus r\u00e9cemment, au nom de la \u00ab d\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00bb, il est de plus en plus risqu\u00e9 que le r\u00f4le de \u00ab filet de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00bb des cours d\u2019appel soit ind\u00fbment affaibli.\n[207] La norme de contr\u00f4le de l\u2019erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante peut servir \u00e0 mauvais escient pour g\u00e9n\u00e9rer une \u00ab bo\u00eete noire \u00bb d\u00e9cisionnelle qui facilite la prise de d\u00e9cisions ad hoc. J\u2019entends par cela une approche par laquelle si la Cour d\u2019appel consent \u00e0 ce qu\u2019a fait le juge du proc\u00e8s, elle \u00ab fait preuve de d\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00bb, tandis que lorsqu\u2019elle pr\u00e9f\u00e8re une autre issue, elle conclut que la d\u00e9cision du juge du proc\u00e8s est entach\u00e9e d\u2019une erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante et y substitue son issue pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e.\n[208] Bien entendu, cela pourrait aussi se produire en appliquant la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte, comme dans \u00ab le mauvais vieux temps \u00bb o\u00f9 les cours d\u2019appel substituaient trop ais\u00e9ment leur propre \u00e9valuation de la preuve. Cependant, l\u2019application de la norme de l\u2019erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante peut s\u2019av\u00e9rer un processus opaque. En revanche, la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte, en raison de sa nature, exige d\u2019\u00e9noncer express\u00e9ment un raisonnement diff\u00e9rent et de d\u00e9montrer pourquoi il devrait \u00eatre suivi. Appliqu\u00e9e comme il se doit, la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte demande une clart\u00e9 conceptuelle et une rigueur analytique accrues. C\u2019est ce point de vue qui sous\u2011tend mon analyse.\n(2) Les \u00ab r\u00e8gles \u00bb \u00e9tablies dans l\u2019arr\u00eat J.C.\n[209] Ayant expos\u00e9 mon point de vue sur la norme de contr\u00f4le applicable en appel et sur la port\u00e9e de ce contr\u00f4le, j\u2019en viens \u00e0 la question de savoir si l\u2019approche pr\u00e9conis\u00e9e par la Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Ontario dans l\u2019arr\u00eat J.C. devrait \u00eatre adopt\u00e9e. Comme je l\u2019ai expliqu\u00e9, l\u2019arr\u00eat J.C. repr\u00e9sente une tentative remarquable de r\u00e9pondre aux pr\u00e9occupations soulev\u00e9es par des tribunaux d\u2019appel interm\u00e9diaires dans de nombreuses d\u00e9cisions r\u00e9centes. S\u2019agissant de la \u00ab r\u00e8gle interdisant le recours \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques infond\u00e9es \u00bb \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat J.C., la Couronne soutient qu\u2019elle devrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e parce qu\u2019elle inciterait selon elle les juridictions d\u2019appel \u00e0 intervenir trop ais\u00e9ment pour censurer le recours par les juges du proc\u00e8s \u00e0 des attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es, comme l\u2019illustre bien l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie\u2011Britannique dans la cause de M. Tsang.\n[210] Je n\u2019adopterais pas la \u00ab r\u00e8gle interdisant le recours \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques infond\u00e9es \u00bb telle qu\u2019elle est formul\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat J.C. Elle suppose qu\u2019une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e peut \u00eatre \u00e9cart\u00e9e pour la simple raison qu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas \u00ab fond\u00e9e \u00bb sur la preuve. Or, les attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es ne sont pas elles\u2011m\u00eames fond\u00e9es sur la preuve, mais bien sur le bon sens et l\u2019exp\u00e9rience humaine. Elles jouent n\u00e9anmoins un r\u00f4le indispensable dans le raisonnement suivi par le juge pour appr\u00e9cier la preuve.\n[211] \u00c0 mon avis, la fa\u00e7on dont la Cour d\u2019appel a appliqu\u00e9 cette r\u00e8gle aux circonstances de l\u2019affaire dont elle \u00e9tait saisie dans J.C. illustre bien le probl\u00e8me que soul\u00e8ve la norme qu\u2019elle propose dans cette d\u00e9cision. L\u2019accus\u00e9 avait expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait l\u2019habitude de v\u00e9rifier le consentement de sa partenaire \u00e0 chacune des \u00e9tapes des \u00e9bats sexuels. Le juge du proc\u00e8s avait conclu que le t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019accus\u00e9 \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab contraire \u00e0 la logique et \u00e0 l\u2019exp\u00e9rience quant \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont se d\u00e9roulent les rapports sexuels \u00bb (R. c. J.C., 2018 ONSC 5547, par. 88 (CanLII)). La Cour d\u2019appel a estim\u00e9 que le juge du proc\u00e8s en \u00e9tait venu \u00e0 cette conclusion en se fondant sur l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se selon laquelle [traduction] \u00ab les gens qui se livrent \u00e0 des actes sexuels n\u2019atteignent tout simplement pas l\u2019id\u00e9al \u201cpolitiquement correct\u201d de discuter express\u00e9ment du consentement au fur et \u00e0 mesure qu\u2019ils se livrent \u00e0 des actes sexuels \u00bb (par. 97). Selon la Cour d\u2019appel, ce raisonnement allait \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la r\u00e8gle interdisant le recours \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques infond\u00e9es parce que l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se du juge constituait une [traduction] \u00ab g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisation pure et simple sur la fa\u00e7on dont les gens se comportent \u00bb et \u00ab ne reposait sur aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment propre \u00e0 cette affaire ni sur les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve dont disposait le juge du proc\u00e8s sur la fa\u00e7on dont toutes les relations sexuelles se d\u00e9roulent \u00bb (par. 96). \u00c0 mon humble avis, une telle norme d\u2019examen en appel est inapplicable. L\u2019absence de preuves \u00e0 l\u2019appui d\u2019une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e ne saurait constituer en soi une raison permettant de censurer le recours \u00e0 cette attente. On ne peut s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce que la Couronne fournisse des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve sur la fa\u00e7on dont les rencontres sexuelles se d\u00e9roulent habituellement dans chaque proc\u00e8s pour agression sexuelle avant que le juge du proc\u00e8s puisse se fier \u00e0 son bon sens ou \u00e0 son exp\u00e9rience humaine en ce qui concerne le comportement sexuel humain (voir R.R., par. 8).\n[212] Je n\u2019adopterais pas la \u00ab r\u00e8gle interdisant le recours \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses logiques infond\u00e9es \u00bb telle qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat J.C., mais cela ne signifie pas que la Cour d\u2019appel n\u2019a pas, dans cet arr\u00eat, soulev\u00e9 des pr\u00e9occupations l\u00e9gitimes au sujet du raisonnement suivi par le juge du proc\u00e8s dans cette affaire. La Cour d\u2019appel a conclu que l\u2019inf\u00e9rence contest\u00e9e contrevenait aussi \u00e0 la \u00ab r\u00e8gle interdisant le recours \u00e0 des inf\u00e9rences fond\u00e9es sur des st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00bb, parce qu\u2019elle [traduction] \u00ab pr\u00e9suppose que personne ne v\u00e9rifierait le consentement avec autant de prudence \u00bb (par. 97) et que \u00ab la conduite que le juge du proc\u00e8s a rejet\u00e9e au motif qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait \u201ctrop parfaite\u201d, \u201ctrop m\u00e9canique\u201d et \u201ctrop politiquement correcte\u201d pour \u00eatre cr\u00e9dible est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment celle qu\u2019encourage la loi, et elle est certainement prudente \u00bb (par. 98). Soit dit en tout respect, je vois mal comment on pourrait consid\u00e9rer l\u2019attente du juge dans cette cause comme un \u00ab st\u00e9r\u00e9otype \u00bb (Quel groupe de personnes est vis\u00e9 par ce st\u00e9r\u00e9otype?). Je constate toutefois que, dans l\u2019affaire J.C., la Cour d\u2019appel a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une erreur de droit au sens de cette r\u00e8gle le recours non seulement \u00e0 des st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes, mais aussi \u00e0 des [traduction] \u00ab hypoth\u00e8ses logiques erron\u00e9es \u00bb (par. 63). Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 expliqu\u00e9, je ferais entrer toutes ces hypoth\u00e8ses dans la cat\u00e9gorie plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es d\u00e9raisonnables.\n[213] Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e \u00e0 laquelle le juge du proc\u00e8s a recouru dans l\u2019affaire J.C. \u00e9tait probl\u00e9matique, non pas parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas fond\u00e9e sur la preuve ou parce qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un \u00ab st\u00e9r\u00e9otype \u00bb, mais parce qu\u2019on ne pouvait raisonnablement pr\u00e9sumer que les gens n\u2019atteignent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas l\u2019id\u00e9al \u00ab politiquement correct \u00bb d\u2019obtenir le consentement de l\u2019autre personne. L\u2019issue de l\u2019affaire J.C. et les motifs \u00e0 l\u2019appui de cette d\u00e9cision sont donc compatibles avec le cadre que je propose, et ce, en d\u00e9pit du fait que je ne formulerais pas les principes de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re que la Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Ontario.\nC. Le juge du proc\u00e8s s\u2019est\u2011il fond\u00e9 sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e comme s\u2019il s\u2019agissait en soi d\u2019un fait d\u00e9terminant et incontestable?\n[214] Comme je l\u2019ai expliqu\u00e9, les juges du proc\u00e8s disposent d\u2019une latitude consid\u00e9rable pour recourir \u00e0 des attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es raisonnables comme point de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence logique pour appr\u00e9cier la preuve. Une juridiction d\u2019appel ne doit pas intervenir pour modifier l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de la preuve du juge simplement parce qu\u2019elle aurait tir\u00e9 une conclusion diff\u00e9rente de la preuve ou des attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es raisonnables relatives \u00e0 la preuve.\n[215] Le recours \u00e0 une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e, m\u00eame raisonnable, est toutefois assujetti \u00e0 d\u2019importantes limites : le juge du proc\u00e8s ne peut pas la consid\u00e9rer comme constituant en soi un fait d\u00e9terminant et incontestable, au point de ne pas tenir compte de la preuve ou d\u2019en faire abstraction. Cela s\u2019explique par le fait qu\u2019il est toujours possible que les gens agissent contrairement \u00e0 ce \u00e0 quoi l\u2019on s\u2019attendrait normalement d\u2019eux selon le bon sens ou l\u2019exp\u00e9rience humaine. Le devoir du juge du proc\u00e8s est de d\u00e9terminer ce qui s\u2019est r\u00e9ellement pass\u00e9, et de le faire en se fondant sur la preuve. Par exemple, lorsqu\u2019il tire des inf\u00e9rences \u00e0 partir d\u2019une preuve circonstancielle, le juge doit examiner la preuve \u00ab au regard tant de l\u2019ensemble de la preuve disponible que de l\u2019absence de preuve, appr\u00e9ci\u00e9e logiquement, ainsi qu\u2019au regard de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience humaine et du bon sens \u00bb (Villaroman, par. 30 (je souligne)). Ainsi, les attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019exp\u00e9rience humaine et le bon sens ne sont qu\u2019un des \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui aident le juge \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter la preuve. En d\u00e9finitive, l\u2019analyse doit demeurer ax\u00e9e sur la preuve.\n[216] Cet aspect du cadre d\u2019analyse que je propose n\u2019a rien de nouveau. Il y a au moins deux raisons pour lesquelles on peut conclure \u00e0 une erreur de droit. Tout d\u2019abord, commet une erreur de droit le juge qui ne tient pas compte de l\u2019ensemble de la preuve pour trancher la question fondamentale de la culpabilit\u00e9 ou de l\u2019innocence de l\u2019accus\u00e9 (la quatri\u00e8me cat\u00e9gorie d\u2019erreurs dont il est question dans l\u2019arr\u00eat J.M.H. (par. 31\u201132; voir aussi Walle, par. 46). Ensuite, le juge du proc\u00e8s qui consid\u00e8re une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e comme un fait incontestable prend en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 connaissance d\u2019office de ce fait. Or, la connaissance d\u2019office est assujettie \u00e0 un crit\u00e8re rigoureux, auquel on ne peut que rarement \u2014 voire jamais \u2014 satisfaire en s\u2019appuyant sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e sur les gens, \u00e0 cause de la grande diversit\u00e9 d\u2019exp\u00e9riences et de comportements humains. La conclusion factuelle qui n\u2019est fond\u00e9e ni sur la preuve ni sur la connaissance d\u2019office rel\u00e8ve de la conjecture. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une erreur de droit, qui fait partie de la premi\u00e8re cat\u00e9gorie d\u2019erreurs d\u00e9crites dans l\u2019arr\u00eat J.M.H. (en tant que conclusion de fait qui ne repose sur aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve (par. 25; voir Schuldt c. La Reine, [1985] 2 R.C.S. 592).\n[217] \u00c0 titre d\u2019exemple, dans l\u2019affaire L. (J.), le juge du proc\u00e8s n\u2019a pas tenu compte des t\u00e9moignages de la plaignante et de l\u2019accus\u00e9 et s\u2019est plut\u00f4t [traduction] \u00ab fond\u00e9 sur deux faits pour expliquer pourquoi il acceptait que la plaignante avait communiqu\u00e9 son refus de consentir \u00e0 d\u2019autres contacts sexuels et que [l\u2019accus\u00e9] avait poursuivi sa tentative d\u2019avoir des rapports sexuels avec elle \u00bb, l\u2019un \u00e9tant [traduction] \u00ab sa conclusion qu\u2019il est \u201ccontraire \u00e0 la raison et \u00e0 toute logique\u201d qu\u2019une \u201cjeune femme se retrouverait \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur en robe \u00e0 la mi-d\u00e9cembre, s\u2019\u00e9tendrait sur le sol, dans le gravier et l\u2019herbe mouill\u00e9e, et se livrerait \u00e0 une activit\u00e9 sexuelle consensuelle\u201d \u00bb (par. 43). La Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Ontario a estim\u00e9 que, m\u00eame s\u2019il est loisible aux juges du proc\u00e8s de faire appel au bon sens pour trancher une affaire, le juge avait, dans cette affaire, commis une erreur [traduction] \u00ab en se fondant sur une hypoth\u00e8se concernant ce qu\u2019une jeune femme est cens\u00e9e accepter ou refuser de faire, comme s\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un fait \u00bb (par. 47 (je souligne)). Si l\u2019on ajoute \u00e0 cela le fait que le juge n\u2019avait pas tenu compte du t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019accus\u00e9 et qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas expliqu\u00e9 pourquoi il estimait que ce t\u00e9moignage ne soulevait pas de doute raisonnable, il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une erreur de droit.\n[218] Bien entendu, le juge du proc\u00e8s n\u2019est pas tenu de mentionner chacun des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qu\u2019il a examin\u00e9s ou d\u2019expliquer en d\u00e9tail l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation qu\u2019il a faite de chacun d\u2019eux (J.M.H., par. 31\u201132). \u00ab Le juge du proc\u00e8s doit examiner tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui se rapportent \u00e0 la question ultime \u00e0 trancher, mais \u00e0 moins que les motifs d\u00e9montrent que cela n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, l\u2019omission de consigner que cet examen a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait ne permet pas de conclure qu\u2019une erreur de droit a \u00e9t\u00e9 commise \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard \u00bb (R. c. Morin, [1992] 3 R.C.S. 286, p. 296).\n[219] En outre, cet aspect du cadre d\u2019analyse que je propose est beaucoup moins utile \u00e0 la Couronne lorsqu\u2019elle interjette appel d\u2019un verdict d\u2019acquittement qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019accus\u00e9 qui fait appel de son verdict de culpabilit\u00e9. Il y a plusieurs raisons \u00e0 cela. Premi\u00e8rement, on ne peut conclure \u00e0 une erreur de droit pour cause d\u2019absence de preuve permettant de conclure \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019un fait, \u00ab dans le cas d\u2019un acquittement, [. . .] que si la loi a transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019accus\u00e9 l\u2019obligation de prouver un fait donn\u00e9 \u00bb (Schuldt, p. 604). La raison en est qu\u2019\u00e0 d\u00e9faut \u00ab [d\u2019un] transfert du fardeau de la preuve \u00e0 l\u2019accus\u00e9, il y a toujours quelque \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve qui permet de tirer une conclusion de fait favorable \u00e0 l\u2019accus\u00e9 \u00bb (p. 610). Dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, la d\u00e9cision du juge du proc\u00e8s d\u2019acquitter l\u2019accus\u00e9 en raison du doute raisonnable qui subsiste dans son esprit \u00ab est non pas une conclusion de fait, mais une conclusion qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfait \u00e0 la norme de persuasion hors de tout doute raisonnable \u00bb (J.M.H., par. 25). Il n\u2019est donc pas n\u00e9cessaire que le doute raisonnable \u00e0 l\u2019origine d\u2019un verdict d\u2019acquittement soit fond\u00e9 sur la preuve; ce doute peut reposer simplement sur l\u2019absence de preuve (par. 26\u201127; Villaroman, par. 36). Ainsi, la juridiction d\u2019appel qui examine les motifs du juge du proc\u00e8s pour d\u00e9terminer s\u2019ils sont entach\u00e9s d\u2019une erreur de droit doit redoubler de prudence lorsqu\u2019elle est saisie d\u2019un appel interjet\u00e9 par la Couronne d\u2019un verdict d\u2019acquittement : \u00ab [I]l faut prendre garde de ne pas s\u2019arr\u00eater aux lacunes apparentes des motifs formul\u00e9s par le juge du proc\u00e8s lors de l\u2019acquittement pour cr\u00e9er un motif d\u2019\u201cacquittement d\u00e9raisonnable\u201d, verdict que le tribunal ne peut prononcer en vertu du Code criminel . . . \u00bb (R. c. Walker, 2008 CSC 34, [2008] 2 R.C.S. 245, par. 2).\nV. Application aux pr\u00e9sents pourvois\n[220] Apr\u00e8s avoir expliqu\u00e9 ce que j\u2019estime \u00eatre les trois questions qu\u2019il faut se poser lors de l\u2019examen en appel d\u2019une d\u00e9cision dans laquelle le juge du proc\u00e8s s\u2019est fond\u00e9 sur des attentes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es, je passe maintenant \u00e0 l\u2019examen des erreurs qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 commises dans chacun des deux pourvois dont est saisie notre Cour.\nA. Monsieur Kruk\n[221] Monsieur Kruk a \u00e9t\u00e9 accus\u00e9 d\u2019un chef d\u2019agression sexuelle \u00e0 la suite d\u2019un incident survenu \u00e0 son domicile au petit matin, le 27 mai 2017. Plus t\u00f4t dans la soir\u00e9e, il \u00e9tait tomb\u00e9 par hasard dans la rue sur la plaignante, qui \u00e9tait alors fortement intoxiqu\u00e9e. La plaignante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 s\u2019\u00eatre r\u00e9veill\u00e9e dans le lit de M. Kruk, sans son pantalon, avec M. Kruk sur elle, son p\u00e9nis dans son vagin. Monsieur Kruk a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait occup\u00e9 de la plaignante tout au long de la soir\u00e9e et qu\u2019il avait l\u2019intention de la raccompagner chez elle le lendemain matin. Il a ni\u00e9 tout attouchement sexuel sur la plaignante et a affirm\u00e9 que cette derni\u00e8re avait elle\u2011m\u00eame retir\u00e9 son pantalon alors qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait en \u00e9tat d\u2019\u00e9bri\u00e9t\u00e9. Selon sa version des faits, lorsqu\u2019elle s\u2019est r\u00e9veill\u00e9e, la plaignante, qui \u00e9tait encore en \u00e9tat d\u2019\u00e9bri\u00e9t\u00e9, a constat\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait plus de pantalon et a alors imagin\u00e9 le pire.\n[222] Le juge du proc\u00e8s a conclu que le t\u00e9moignage de M. Kruk ne soulevait pas de doute raisonnable. En acceptant le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante malgr\u00e9 ses r\u00e9serves quant \u00e0 sa fiabilit\u00e9 en raison de l\u2019\u00e9tat d\u2019\u00e9bri\u00e9t\u00e9 dans lequel elle se trouvait, le juge a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit: [traduction] \u00ab Elle a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait senti [le] p\u00e9nis [de l\u2019accus\u00e9] en elle et qu\u2019elle savait ce qu\u2019elle ressentait. Bref, son sens du toucher \u00e9tait sollicit\u00e9. Il est extr\u00eamement improbable qu\u2019une femme se trompe sur cette sensation \u00bb (par. 68 (CanLII)). La Cour d\u2019appel a conclu que le juge avait commis une erreur de droit en se livrant \u00e0 des [traduction] \u00ab raisonnements conjecturaux \u00bb et en formulant une hypoth\u00e8se sur une question qui ne relevait pas du bon sens ou qui ne pouvait pas l\u00e9gitimement faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une admission d\u2019office.\n[223] Je ne partage pas l\u2019avis de la Cour d\u2019appel. R\u00e9pondant aux trois questions que j\u2019ai \u00e9nonc\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, j\u2019en arrive \u00e0 la conclusion que le juge du proc\u00e8s n\u2019a pas commis d\u2019erreur.\n[224] En ce qui concerne la premi\u00e8re question, le juge du proc\u00e8s s\u2019est effectivement fond\u00e9 sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e au sujet des gens \u2014 en l\u2019occurrence, en mati\u00e8re de perceptions physiques. Il n\u2019y avait aucune preuve indiquant que la plaignante en question \u00e9tait peu susceptible de se tromper au sujet de la sensation d\u2019une p\u00e9n\u00e9tration vaginale. Par cons\u00e9quent, le juge a \u00e9valu\u00e9 la vraisemblance du t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante en fonction d\u2019une attente de ce qu\u2019il pensait que les gens \u2014 ou, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, les femmes \u2014 en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral ressentiraient ou non en pareilles circonstances.\n[225] Comme je l\u2019ai expliqu\u00e9, le fait que le juge s\u2019est fond\u00e9 sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e n\u2019est pas en soi probl\u00e9matique. Au contraire, il s\u2019agit d\u2019un aspect indispensable du raisonnement que doit suivre le juge pour appr\u00e9cier la preuve en fonction d\u2019un point de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence portant sur ce \u00e0 quoi l\u2019on s\u2019attendrait normalement. Toutefois, le fait que le juge du proc\u00e8s s\u2019est fond\u00e9 sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e soul\u00e8ve la possibilit\u00e9 qu\u2019il ait commis une erreur de droit au regard des deuxi\u00e8me et troisi\u00e8me questions que j\u2019ai expos\u00e9es. Je passe donc \u00e0 l\u2019analyse de ces questions.\n[226] Au regard de la deuxi\u00e8me question, je conclus que l\u2019on peut raisonnablement s\u2019attendre de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une femme soit peu susceptible de se m\u00e9prendre sur la sensation d\u2019une p\u00e9n\u00e9tration vaginale. Cela ne veut pas dire qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un fait irr\u00e9futable qui vaut pour toutes les femmes dans toutes les situations ou qu\u2019une femme ne pourrait jamais se m\u00e9prendre. Cependant, de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, cette proposition est parfaitement raisonnable. Comme le fait remarquer la Couronne, un acte sexuel de cette nature aurait un impact profond et traumatisant sur l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 corporelle d\u2019une personne, et les gens ordinaires n\u2019auraient g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas besoin de connaissances particuli\u00e8res de cet aspect de la perception chez l\u2019humain pour \u00eatre en mesure d\u2019\u00e9valuer ce type de t\u00e9moignage. Pr\u00e9tendre le contraire ferait resurgir l\u2019id\u00e9e depuis longtemps discr\u00e9dit\u00e9e selon laquelle le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019une plaignante au sujet d\u2019une agression sexuelle ne peut, sans preuve corroborante, donner lieu \u00e0 une d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9. De plus, on ferait ainsi porter \u00e0 la Couronne un fardeau inutile, irr\u00e9aliste et accablant en l\u2019obligeant \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019un expert m\u00e9dical sur la physiologie de base de la plaignante dans toute affaire d\u2019agression sexuelle.\n[227] La Cour d\u2019appel a laiss\u00e9 entendre qu\u2019il aurait pu \u00eatre utile que la plaignante fournisse davantage de d\u00e9tails dans son t\u00e9moignage au sujet de ce qu\u2019elle avait v\u00e9cu. La cour a fait observer : [traduction] \u00ab . . . on n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 [\u00e0 la plaignante], par exemple, d\u2019expliquer dans ses propres mots \u00e0 quoi avait ressembl\u00e9 [la sensation de la p\u00e9n\u00e9tration], si elle avait \u00e9prouv\u00e9 de la douleur, si elle avait subi des blessures, ni m\u00eame pourquoi elle \u00e9tait aussi s\u00fbre d\u2019elle dans son t\u00e9moignage \u00bb (par. 55 (CanLII)). Je ne suis pas d\u2019accord pour dire qu\u2019une description plus d\u00e9taill\u00e9e de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience physique v\u00e9cue par la plaignante aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 utile en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments superflus n\u2019auraient rien apport\u00e9 de plus; s\u2019il \u00e9tait retenu, le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante \u00e9tablissait ais\u00e9ment l\u2019actus reus de l\u2019agression sexuelle.\n[228] Monsieur Kruk pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019il est probl\u00e9matique que le juge du proc\u00e8s, un homme, s\u2019en remette \u00e0 une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e sur ce que les femmes ressentiraient probablement, puisque le juge n\u2019aurait [traduction] \u00ab aucune exp\u00e9rience personnelle en la mati\u00e8re \u00bb (m.i., par. 56; voir aussi par. 64). Je ne suis pas de cet avis. M\u00eame si le juge du proc\u00e8s n\u2019a pas v\u00e9cu personnellement cette exp\u00e9rience pr\u00e9cise, il est parfaitement raisonnable pour toute personne de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une autre personne ne se trompe pas quant \u00e0 la sensation de voir son int\u00e9grit\u00e9 corporelle viol\u00e9e de cette mani\u00e8re.\n[229] Monsieur Kruk affirme \u00e9galement que le caract\u00e8re raisonnable de l\u2019attente d\u00e9pend des circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et que [traduction] \u00ab [p]lus la situation s\u2019\u00e9carte de la norme au point de devenir un cas extr\u00eame, moins il est probable que son appr\u00e9ciation rel\u00e8ve du bon sens \u00bb (transcription, p. 70). Ainsi, selon lui, le fait que la plaignante [traduction] \u00ab \u00e9tait extr\u00eamement intoxiqu\u00e9e et d\u00e9sorient\u00e9e \u00bb fait en sorte que l\u2019attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e sur laquelle le juge s\u2019est fond\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9tait plus raisonnable (ibid.). Cet argument m\u00e9conna\u00eet la nature d\u2019une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e et le r\u00f4le qu\u2019elle joue dans le processus de recherche des faits. Il suffit que l\u2019attente soit raisonnable de mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire qu\u2019elle correspond \u00e0 la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 dans la plupart des cas. L\u2019\u00e9tat d\u2019\u00e9bri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la plaignante et les doutes que son \u00e9tat suscitait quant \u00e0 sa fiabilit\u00e9 \u00e9taient certainement des aspects importants de la preuve dont le juge devait tenir compte pour appr\u00e9cier le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante, mais les d\u00e9tails de la preuve ne modifient en rien le caract\u00e8re raisonnable de l\u2019attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e en cause. De fait, le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante devait \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9 au regard \u00e0 la fois d\u2019un point de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence raisonnable et de l\u2019ensemble de la preuve, y compris la preuve de l\u2019intoxication. C\u2019est \u00e9galement le cas, par exemple, lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de prendre en consid\u00e9ration la \u00ab d\u00e9duction conforme au bon sens \u00bb selon laquelle une personne veut les cons\u00e9quences raisonnables et probables de ses actes, m\u00eame lorsque, selon la preuve, l\u2019accus\u00e9 avait les facult\u00e9s affaiblies (Walle, par. 58\u201167). Cet aspect nous renvoie \u00e0 la troisi\u00e8me question du cadre d\u2019analyse que je propose et sur laquelle je me penche maintenant.\n[230] \u00c0 mon avis, la conclusion de la Cour d\u2019appel \u00e9voque davantage une pr\u00e9occupation relevant de la troisi\u00e8me question. La Cour d\u2019appel a estim\u00e9 que le juge du proc\u00e8s avait commis une erreur en tirant une [traduction] \u00ab conclusion \u00bb qui ne pouvait \u00ab l\u00e9gitimement faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une admission d\u2019office \u00bb (par. 67), ce qui l\u2019a amen\u00e9 \u00e0 se livrer \u00e0 des \u00ab raisonnements conjecturaux qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas fond\u00e9s sur la preuve \u00bb (par. 68). J\u2019admets que, si c\u2019\u00e9tait vrai, il s\u2019agirait d\u2019une erreur de droit, mais je ne suis pas d\u2019accord pour dire que le juge du proc\u00e8s a commis une telle erreur. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le juge du proc\u00e8s n\u2019a pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un fait d\u00e9terminant et incontestable \u2014 c.\u2011\u00e0\u2011d., comme un fait admis d\u2019office \u2014 l\u2019attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e suivant laquelle une femme est peu susceptible de se m\u00e9prendre sur la sensation d\u2019une p\u00e9n\u00e9tration vaginale. Il s\u2019est plut\u00f4t servi \u00e0 bon droit de cette attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e comme point de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour appr\u00e9cier la vraisemblance du t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante.\n[231] Fait crucial, le juge n\u2019a pas fait abstraction du reste de la preuve en partant du principe qu\u2019une femme ne pourrait jamais se m\u00e9prendre sur la sensation d\u2019une p\u00e9n\u00e9tration vaginale. Il s\u2019est fond\u00e9 sur une preuve circonstancielle qu\u2019il a jug\u00e9e [traduction] \u00ab compatible avec la proposition selon laquelle l\u2019accus\u00e9 et la plaignante ont eu des rapports sexuels \u00bb, compte tenu notamment du fait qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient tous les deux d\u00e9v\u00eatus et que la plaignante n\u2019avait plus son pantalon (par. 69). Le juge a \u00e9galement estim\u00e9 que [traduction] \u00ab le d\u00e9faut de l\u2019accus\u00e9 de contacter les parents de la plaignante, eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble des circonstances [. . .] \u00e9tait compatible avec une intention de profiter sexuellement d\u2019une jeune femme qu\u2019il savait \u00eatre dans un \u00e9tat d\u2019extr\u00eame fragilit\u00e9 et vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 \u00bb (par. 70). Le juge \u00e9tait par ailleurs parfaitement conscient des probl\u00e8mes de fiabilit\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante (par. 48). Il lui \u00e9tait loisible de consid\u00e9rer comme fiable le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante sur cet aspect en l\u2019\u00e9valuant au regard de l\u2019attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e raisonnable sur les perceptions humaines comme point de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence et en tenant compte des autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve circonstancielle.\n[232] Pour les motifs que j\u2019ai expos\u00e9s, je conclus que le juge du proc\u00e8s n\u2019a pas commis les erreurs que lui reproche M. Kruk ou que la Cour d\u2019appel a d\u00e9cel\u00e9es.\nB. Monsieur Tsang\n[233] Monsieur Tsang a \u00e9t\u00e9 accus\u00e9 d\u2019un chef d\u2019agression sexuelle \u00e0 la suite d\u2019un incident survenu dans sa voiture au petit matin, le 29 d\u00e9cembre 2018. La plaignante et lui s\u2019\u00e9taient rencontr\u00e9s lors d\u2019un concert de musique et ils se sont retrouv\u00e9s par la suite \u00e0 la salle de bal Commodore, \u00e0 Vancouver. Ils sont partis ensemble dans la voiture de M. Tsang. La plaignante a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, alors qu\u2019il la raccompagnait, M. Tsang avait arr\u00eat\u00e9 la voiture dans un stationnement, o\u00f9 il lui avait demand\u00e9 s\u2019ils pouvaient s\u2019embrasser sur la banquette arri\u00e8re. Elle a accept\u00e9, ne s\u2019attendant \u00e0 rien de plus. Toutefois, sans son consentement, M. Tsang l\u2019a forc\u00e9e \u00e0 se livrer \u00e0 des relations sexuelles orales et l\u2019a p\u00e9n\u00e9tr\u00e9e par voie vaginale et anale. Il a ensuite d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la plaignante chez une amie de cette derni\u00e8re et est parti en trombe d\u00e8s qu\u2019elle est sortie du v\u00e9hicule. Une m\u00e9decin l\u00e9giste sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e dans les agressions sexuelles a constat\u00e9 des traumatismes dans la r\u00e9gion g\u00e9nitale, notamment une d\u00e9chirure du vagin. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Tsang a affirm\u00e9 que la plaignante avait pris l\u2019initiative \u00e0 chaque \u00e9tape de leur rencontre sexuelle, y compris la fellation et la p\u00e9n\u00e9tration vaginale avec les doigts; qu\u2019elle lui avait demand\u00e9 une [traduction] \u00ab fess\u00e9e \u00bb et d\u2019autres \u00ab actes sexuels brutaux \u00bb; qu\u2019il ne l\u2019avait jamais p\u00e9n\u00e9tr\u00e9e par voie anale; et qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait jamais eu de p\u00e9n\u00e9tration du p\u00e9nis dans le vagin parce qu\u2019il n\u2019arrivait pas \u00e0 trouver de condom. La juge du proc\u00e8s n\u2019a pas retenu le t\u00e9moignage de M. Tsang, concluant que ce dernier avait exerc\u00e9 un contr\u00f4le sur la plaignante toute la nuit et qu\u2019il avait \u00ab organis\u00e9 \u00bb tout ce qui s\u2019\u00e9tait pass\u00e9. Elle a estim\u00e9 que la plaignante \u00e9tait cr\u00e9dible, a accept\u00e9 son t\u00e9moignage et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 M. Tsang coupable (2020 BCPC 306).\n[234] La Cour d\u2019appel a conclu que la juge du proc\u00e8s avait commis une erreur en \u00e9cartant le t\u00e9moignage de M. Tsang en se fondant sur trois [traduction] \u00ab hypoth\u00e8ses \u00bb ou \u00ab g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisations \u00bb sur le comportement humain qui \u00e9quivalaient \u00e0 des \u00ab raisonnements conjecturaux \u00bb, en l\u2019occurrence, (1) qu\u2019une personne ne demanderait pas \u00ab de but en blanc \u00bb \u00e0 recevoir une fess\u00e9e pendant des pr\u00e9liminaires sexuels; (2) qu\u2019une personne contr\u00f4lante ne s\u2019abstiendrait pas de se livrer \u00e0 des rapports sexuels vaginaux parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas de condom; (3) qu\u2019une personne ne quitterait pas abruptement et cavali\u00e8rement la personne avec laquelle elle vient d\u2019avoir des rapports sexuels consensuels (par. 73\u201174).\n[235] Je vais examiner \u00e0 tour de r\u00f4le chacune de ces trois pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es erreurs.\n(1) Une personne ne demanderait pas \u00ab de but en blanc \u00bb \u00e0 recevoir une fess\u00e9e pendant des pr\u00e9liminaires sexuels\n[236] En ce qui concerne la premi\u00e8re question que j\u2019ai \u00e9nonc\u00e9e, je conclus que la juge du proc\u00e8s ne s\u2019est pas fond\u00e9e sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e en mati\u00e8re de comportement humain lorsqu\u2019elle a conclu que la plaignante n\u2019avait pas demand\u00e9 \u00e0 recevoir une fess\u00e9e et qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas incit\u00e9 M. Tsang \u00e0 se livrer \u00e0 des \u00ab actes sexuels brutaux \u00bb. Je note que, m\u00eame si elle s\u2019est \u00e0 certains moments attard\u00e9e au rejet, par la juge du proc\u00e8s, du t\u00e9moignage de M. Tsang selon lequel la plaignante [traduction] \u00ab lui [avait] demand\u00e9 de lui administrer une fess\u00e9e \u00bb (par. 28), la Cour d\u2019appel s\u2019est dite d\u2019une mani\u00e8re plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale pr\u00e9occup\u00e9e par le fait que la juge du proc\u00e8s avait [traduction] \u00ab rejet\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage de [M. Tsang] selon lequel la plaignante l\u2019avait encourag\u00e9 \u00e0 se livrer \u00e0 des actes sexuels brutaux \u00bb (par. 43).\n[237] Le rejet, par la juge du proc\u00e8s, du t\u00e9moignage de M. Tsang au sujet des \u00ab actes sexuels brutaux \u00bb ne reposait pas sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e sur la question de savoir si toute personne demanderait une fess\u00e9e ou encouragerait autrement son partenaire \u00e0 se livrer \u00e0 des actes sexuels brutaux. Il \u00e9tait plut\u00f4t fond\u00e9 sur son appr\u00e9ciation de la preuve concernant les personnes qui \u00e9taient devant elle et sur ses conclusions quant \u00e0 la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de M. Tsang en particulier. Il ressort clairement de ses motifs que la juge n\u2019a pas cru la version des faits de M. Tsang, qui soutenait que la plaignante avait \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019instigatrice de tous les gestes de s\u00e9duction et de toutes les avances sexuelles ce soir\u2011l\u00e0. \u00c0 ce stade de ses motifs, la juge avait fait remarquer que la plaignante [traduction] \u00ab n\u2019avait manifest\u00e9 aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00bb pour M. Tsang pendant toute la soir\u00e9e, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019incident survenu dans le v\u00e9hicule de ce dernier, et qu\u2019elle \u00ab avait pass\u00e9 une partie de la soir\u00e9e avec un autre homme \u00bb (par. 121 (CanLII)). La juge avait \u00e9galement rejet\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage de M. Tsang selon lequel la plaignante avait commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019embrasser sur la piste de danse de la salle de bal Commodore \u2014 une conclusion qu\u2019il lui \u00e9tait loisible de tirer selon la preuve, comme l\u2019a reconnu la Cour d\u2019appel (par. 39). De plus \u2014 et cet aspect est important \u2014, la juge du proc\u00e8s a estim\u00e9 que M. Tsang avait cr\u00e9\u00e9 de toutes pi\u00e8ces ses affirmations sur les actes sexuels brutaux pour pouvoir expliquer la pr\u00e9sence de blessures (par. 158). Interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 de la fa\u00e7on la plus g\u00e9n\u00e9reuse possible, le t\u00e9moignage de M. Tsang donnait \u00e0 penser que la plaignante voulait recevoir \u00ab une fess\u00e9e \u00bb ou se faire p\u00e9n\u00e9trer avec les doigts \u00ab de fa\u00e7on plus brutale \u00bb. La juge a estim\u00e9, compte tenu des blessures de la plaignante, que ce type d\u2019\u00ab actes sexuels brutaux \u00bb pr\u00e9tendument consensuels ne pouvait expliquer la gravit\u00e9 des blessures effectivement subies par la plaignante. C\u2019est \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de ces conclusions que la juge a conclu qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab pas cr\u00e9dible \u00bb que cette plaignante aurait demand\u00e9 de recevoir une fess\u00e9e ou \u00ab se pr\u00e9parait \u00e0 se livrer \u00e0 des actes sexuels brutaux \u00bb avec M. Tsang (par. 126).\n[238] \u00c0 mon avis, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la Cour d\u2019appel a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 un r\u00e9examen de la preuve. Elle a minimis\u00e9 certains aspects du raisonnement de la juge du proc\u00e8s en concluant, par exemple, que [traduction] \u00ab ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9 avant l\u2019incident dans le stationnement ne tire pas vraiment \u00e0 cons\u00e9quence \u00bb (par. 42) et en ajoutant qu\u2019on ne pouvait pas dire que ces aspects de la preuve avaient \u00ab pes\u00e9 lourd \u00bb dans l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation que la juge du proc\u00e8s avait faite de la preuve (par. 45). Pour appr\u00e9cier la preuve, la juge du proc\u00e8s a de toute \u00e9vidence retrac\u00e9 le fil des \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus au cours de la soir\u00e9e et s\u2019est fond\u00e9e sur son \u00e9valuation globale de la preuve. Il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas loisible \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appel de substituer \u00e0 cette appr\u00e9ciation sa propre opinion sur la mesure dans laquelle les diverses parties de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des faits \u00ab tiraient \u00e0 cons\u00e9quence \u00bb.\n[239] Par cons\u00e9quent, la juge du proc\u00e8s ne s\u2019est pas fond\u00e9e sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e quant \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re dont les gens sont susceptibles de se comporter au cours d\u2019une activit\u00e9 sexuelle. Il n\u2019est donc pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019examiner relativement \u00e0 cette erreur all\u00e9gu\u00e9e les deuxi\u00e8me et troisi\u00e8me questions que j\u2019ai \u00e9nonc\u00e9es.\n(2) Une personne contr\u00f4lante ne s\u2019abstiendrait pas d\u2019avoir des relations sexuelles vaginales parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas de condom\n[240] Comme pour la premi\u00e8re erreur pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e, je conclus, au regard de la premi\u00e8re question, que la juge du proc\u00e8s ne s\u2019est pas fond\u00e9e sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e concernant le comportement humain pour rejeter le t\u00e9moignage de M. Tsang selon lequel il s\u2019\u00e9tait abstenu d\u2019avoir des relations sexuelles vaginales parce qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas de pr\u00e9servatif. Il n\u2019est donc pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019examiner les deuxi\u00e8me et troisi\u00e8me questions que j\u2019ai \u00e9nonc\u00e9es.\n[241] Voici le passage contest\u00e9 des motifs de la juge du proc\u00e8s :\n[traduction] Je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019affirmation de l\u2019accus\u00e9 selon laquelle l\u2019absence de condom dans sa voiture avait eu raison de sa motivation \u00e0 avoir des relations sexuelles vaginales, alors qu\u2019il avait un condom \u00e0 sa disposition, a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e de toutes pi\u00e8ces; de plus, cette affirmation contredit le degr\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le qu\u2019il a exerc\u00e9 tant ce soir\u2011l\u00e0 qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019audience. Il a affirm\u00e9 que [la plaignante] lui avait dit qu\u2019elle voulait lui faire une fellation pour terminer et qu\u2019elle lui avait r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 son offre. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il l\u2019avait agripp\u00e9e en douceur par les cheveux et l\u2019avait guid\u00e9e. Il s\u2019est rappel\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait eu un haut\u2011le\u2011c\u0153ur, puis qu\u2019elle s\u2019\u00e9tait de nouveau servie de sa bouche et de ses mains. Monsieur Tsang a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 [la plaignante] si elle recrachait ou avalait. Lorsque [la plaignante] lui a r\u00e9pondu : \u00ab j\u2019avale; cracher, c\u2019est pour les perdants \u00bb, il a \u00e9jacul\u00e9 dans sa bouche. J\u2019estime qu\u2019\u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0, M. Tsang \u00e9tait centr\u00e9 sur lui\u2011m\u00eame et que, sinon, il aurait pu constater que, de toute \u00e9vidence [la plaignante] ne participait que pour en finir et non parce qu\u2019elle le souhaitait ou qu\u2019elle y prenait plaisir. [Je souligne; par. 129.]\n[242] La Cour d\u2019appel a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que la juge du proc\u00e8s s\u2019\u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur un [traduction] \u00ab st\u00e9r\u00e9otype pr\u00e9judiciable \u00bb au sujet des personnes \u00ab contr\u00f4lantes \u00bb pour tenir pour acquis que de telles personnes ne s\u2019abstiendraient pas de relations sexuelles si elles n\u2019avaient pas de condom (par. 65). \u00c0 mon avis, aucune attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e quant aux personnes \u00ab contr\u00f4lantes \u00bb n\u2019\u00e9tait en jeu dans les motifs de la juge du proc\u00e8s. La juge a conclu que M. Tsang lui\u2011m\u00eame \u00e9tait \u00ab contr\u00f4lant \u00bb et qu\u2019il avait \u00ab organis\u00e9 \u00bb tout ce qui s\u2019\u00e9tait pass\u00e9 cette nuit\u2011l\u00e0, comme le d\u00e9montrait notamment l\u2019insistance avec laquelle il avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante et \u00e0 l\u2019amie de celle\u2011ci de laisser leurs sacs banane et leurs effets personnels dans sa voiture et les avait incit\u00e9es \u00e0 boire davantage. La juge du proc\u00e8s a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme cr\u00e9\u00e9e de toutes pi\u00e8ces l\u2019affirmation de M. Tsang suivant laquelle le fait qu\u2019il n\u2019arrivait pas \u00e0 trouver un condom aurait \u00ab eu raison \u00bb de sa motivation \u00e0 avoir des relations sexuelles vaginales avec la plaignante, compte tenu de tous les autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve de son comportement tout au long de la soir\u00e9e. Pour tirer sa conclusion g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, la juge s\u2019est \u00e9videmment fond\u00e9e sur le t\u00e9moignage direct de la plaignante \u2014 t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019elle a accept\u00e9 \u2014, qui affirmait que M. Tsang avait effectivement \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019instigateur des relations sexuelles. Cette conclusion \u00e9tait \u00e9galement \u00e9tay\u00e9e par la constatation de la juge selon laquelle M. Tsang avait fait preuve de peu d\u2019inhibitions tout au long de la nuit et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait centr\u00e9 sur son propre plaisir dans la voiture, comme en t\u00e9moignait son indiff\u00e9rence face aux pleurs et aux haut\u2011le\u2011c\u0153ur de la plaignante pendant qu\u2019elle lui faisait une fellation.\n[243] La Cour d\u2019appel a l\u00e0 encore r\u00e9examin\u00e9 la preuve \u00e0 la recherche d\u2019une erreur. Elle n\u2019a pas remis en question la conclusion de la juge du proc\u00e8s selon laquelle M. Tsang \u00e9tait \u00ab contr\u00f4lant \u00bb et avait \u00ab organis\u00e9 \u00bb tout ce qui s\u2019\u00e9tait pass\u00e9 cette nuit\u2011l\u00e0. Elle a pris acte des divers aspects de la preuve que la juge avait examin\u00e9s. Bien qu\u2019elle ait reconnu ces points, la Cour d\u2019appel a minimis\u00e9 l\u2019importance des impressions que M. Tsang avait donn\u00e9es \u00e0 la juge, en d\u00e9clarant, comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9, que \u00ab ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9 avant l\u2019incident dans le stationnement ne tire pas vraiment \u00e0 cons\u00e9quence \u00bb (par. 42) La Cour d\u2019appel n\u2019avait aucune raison d\u2019intervenir pour revoir l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de l\u2019ensemble de la preuve qu\u2019avait faite la juge du proc\u00e8s.\n[244] Comme je suis d\u2019avis de rejeter cet argument au regard de la premi\u00e8re question, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019examiner le caract\u00e8re raisonnable de toute attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e en fonction de la deuxi\u00e8me question, puisque la juge du proc\u00e8s ne s\u2019est pas appuy\u00e9e sur une telle attente. Je tiens toutefois \u00e0 ajouter que, \u00e0 mon avis, la Cour d\u2019appel a d\u00e9form\u00e9 le sens du mot \u00ab st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00bb en consid\u00e9rant que, dans son analyse, la juge du proc\u00e8s s\u2019\u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur un \u00ab st\u00e9r\u00e9otype pr\u00e9judiciable \u00bb au sujet \u00ab des personnes contr\u00f4lantes \u00bb. Les \u00ab personnes contr\u00f4lantes \u00bb ne sont pas des personnes faisant partie d\u2019un groupe particulier qui fait l\u2019objet de pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s que l\u2019on pourrait l\u00e9gitimement qualifier de \u00ab st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes \u00bb. L\u2019approche de la Cour d\u2019appel sous\u2011entend que toute caract\u00e9risation de la personnalit\u00e9 d\u2019un individu comme \u00e9tant \u00ab agressive \u00bb ou \u00ab insouciante \u00bb pourrait \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9e de \u00ab st\u00e9r\u00e9otype \u00bb, et ce, m\u00eame lorsque cette caract\u00e9risation d\u00e9coule de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au sujet du comportement de l\u2019int\u00e9ress\u00e9.\n(3) Une personne ne quitterait pas abruptement et cavali\u00e8rement la personne avec laquelle elle vient d\u2019avoir des rapports sexuels consensuels\n[245] Je passe maintenant \u00e0 la derni\u00e8re erreur relev\u00e9e par la Cour d\u2019appel. Voici les passages contest\u00e9s des motifs de la juge du proc\u00e8s :\n[traduction] [Le] manque d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat [de M. Tsang] [. . .] face \u00e0 l\u2019invitation de [la plaignante] \u00e0 se revoir contredit son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019ils avaient simplement pass\u00e9 un bon moment; il est plut\u00f4t compatible avec une rencontre non consensuelle o\u00f9 il avait obtenu ce qu\u2019il voulait sans \u00e9gard pour elle et avait ensuite d\u00e9tal\u00e9.\n. . .\nLe t\u00e9moignage de M. Tsang concorde avec celui de [la plaignante] et de [l\u2019amie de celle\u2011ci] selon lequel il est parti en trombe d\u00e8s que [la plaignante] est sortie de sa voiture et qu\u2019il ne l\u2019a pas regard\u00e9e entrer dans la maison. J\u2019estime que ce fait s\u2019accorde davantage avec l\u2019affirmation de [la plaignante] selon laquelle il s\u2019agissait de relations sexuelles non consensuelles qu\u2019avec la version de M. Tsang de ce qui venait de se passer. Il est parti en trombe \u00e0 cause de ce qu\u2019il venait de lui faire vivre et parce qu\u2019elle ne repr\u00e9sentait rien pour lui. Ses agissements ne concordent pas avec son t\u00e9moignage selon lequel il voulait lui donner du plaisir ce soir\u2011l\u00e0. [Je souligne; par. 131 et 153.]\n[246] En ce qui concerne la premi\u00e8re question que je propose \u2014 et contrairement \u00e0 ma conclusion quant aux deux premi\u00e8res erreurs pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es \u2014, j\u2019estime que la juge du proc\u00e8s s\u2019est effectivement fond\u00e9e sur une attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e quant \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont les gens se comportent habituellement apr\u00e8s des rapports sexuels consensuels. Contrairement \u00e0 la Couronne, je ne crois pas que la juge s\u2019est uniquement int\u00e9ress\u00e9e \u00e0 la coh\u00e9rence entre le t\u00e9moignage de M. Tsang, selon lequel la plaignante et lui avaient simplement pass\u00e9 un tr\u00e8s bon moment ensemble, et le t\u00e9moignage selon lequel M. Tsang \u00e9tait parti en trombe. La juge ne s\u2019est pas content\u00e9e de dire que le t\u00e9moignage de M. Tsang \u00e9tait incoh\u00e9rent; elle a explicitement consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que le d\u00e9part brusque de M. Tsang \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab compatible avec une rencontre non consensuelle o\u00f9 il avait obtenu ce qu\u2019il voulait sans \u00e9gard pour elle \u00bb et \u00ab s\u2019accord[ait] davantage avec l\u2019affirmation de [la plaignante] selon laquelle il s\u2019agissait de relations sexuelles non consensuelles \u00bb. Rien dans la preuve ne permettait de croire que M. Tsang \u00e9tait le genre d\u2019individu qui d\u00e9talerait ou non apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une personne avec laquelle il vient d\u2019avoir des relations sexuelles consensuelles. La juge a plut\u00f4t estim\u00e9 que la plupart des gens n\u2019agiraient pas de la sorte.\n[247] De plus, en ce qui concerne la deuxi\u00e8me question, je consid\u00e8re qu\u2019il est d\u00e9raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 voir un lien logique entre le fait pour une personne d\u2019attendre que son partenaire sexuel soit rentr\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur et le caract\u00e8re consensuel ou non de la rencontre qu\u2019ils viennent d\u2019avoir. Partir en trombe pourrait certainement indiquer un manque de politesse ou de tact social. Mais de l\u00e0 \u00e0 laisser entendre que la personne en question vient de participer \u00e0 des rapports sexuels non consensuels, il y a toute une marge. On ne peut raisonnablement pas consid\u00e9rer que cette proposition correspond fid\u00e8lement \u00e0 la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 dans la plupart des cas, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 pouvoir s\u2019en servir comme point de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence fiable pour \u00e9valuer la preuve.\n[248] Malgr\u00e9 cette erreur de droit, je suis d\u2019avis de confirmer le verdict de culpabilit\u00e9 en vertu de la disposition r\u00e9paratrice au motif qu\u2019aucun tort important ou aucune erreur judiciaire grave ne s\u2019est produit. \u00c0 mon avis, cette erreur de droit est de celles qui sont \u00e0 ce point \u00ab inoffensives ou n\u00e9gligeables [qu\u2019elles] n\u2019ont aucune incidence sur le verdict \u00bb (Van, par. 34). Comme le fait remarquer la Couronne, cette attente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le tr\u00e8s mineur dans l\u2019analyse de la juge du proc\u00e8s. Le verdict qu\u2019elle a rendu reposait clairement sur son \u00e9valuation favorable de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de la plaignante, ainsi que sur son rejet complet du t\u00e9moignage de M. Tsang au motif qu\u2019il \u00e9tait incompatible avec le d\u00e9roulement de la soir\u00e9e et avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9 de toutes pi\u00e8ces pour expliquer les blessures de la plaignante. Bien que la juge ait effectivement consid\u00e9r\u00e9 le d\u00e9part en trombe de M. Tsang comme une preuve suppl\u00e9mentaire de l\u2019absence de consentement de la plaignante aux relations sexuelles, elle n\u2019a tenu compte de cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve qu\u2019en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019affirmation de M. Tsang selon laquelle la plaignante et lui\u2011m\u00eame venaient de passer une excellente soir\u00e9e. Dans ces conditions, il est inconcevable de pr\u00e9tendre qu\u2019un doute raisonnable au sujet du consentement aurait subsist\u00e9 dans l\u2019esprit de la juge du proc\u00e8s si elle n\u2019avait pas retenu le d\u00e9part en trombe de M. Tsang comme \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve.\nVI. Dispositif\n[249] Pour les motifs que j\u2019ai expos\u00e9s, je suis d\u2019avis d\u2019accueillir les deux pourvois et de r\u00e9tablir les verdicts de culpabilit\u00e9.\nANNEXE\nPourvois accueillis.\nProcureur de l\u2019appelant : Ministry of Attorney General \u2014 Criminal Appeals, Vancouver.\nProcureurs de l\u2019intim\u00e9 Christopher James Kruk : Johnson Doyle Nelson & Anderson, Vancouver.\nProcureurs de l\u2019intim\u00e9 Edwin Tsang : Fowler & Blok, Vancouver.\nProcureur de l\u2019intervenant le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l\u2019Alberta : Alberta Crown Prosecution Service \u2014 Appeals and Specialized Prosecutions Office, Calgary.\nProcureurs de l\u2019intervenante Independent Criminal Defence Advocacy Society : Thorsteinssons, Vancouver; Pringle Law, Vancouver.\nProcureurs de l\u2019intervenante Criminal Lawyers\u2019 Association (Ontario) : Gorham Vandebeek, Toronto.\nProcureurs de l\u2019intervenante Trial Lawyers Association of British Columbia : Peck and Company, Vancouver; Olthuis van Ert, Vancouver.\nProcureurs de l\u2019intervenante l\u2019Association qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise des avocats et avocates de la d\u00e9fense : Hugo Caissy (ad hoc), Amqui (Qc); Beaudry Roussin, Qu\u00e9bec.\nProcureurs des intervenants West Coast Legal Education and Action Fund Association et le Fonds d\u2019action et d\u2019\u00e9ducation juridique pour les femmes : Megan Stephens Law, Toronto; West Coast LEAF, Vancouver; Fonds d\u2019action et d\u2019\u00e9ducation juridique pour les femmes, Toronto.\n[1] Par exemple, la Cour a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019id\u00e9e que les questions \u00e0 se poser dans le cadre de l\u2019analyse \u00e9tablie dans l\u2019arr\u00eat W.(D.) doivent l\u2019\u00eatre dans un ordre pr\u00e9cis (R. c. W. (D.), [1991] 1 R.C.S. 742; R. c. Vuradin, 2013 CSC 38, [2013] 2 R.C.S. 639); de plus, le juge du proc\u00e8s peut, dans les circonstances appropri\u00e9es, rejeter le t\u00e9moignage de la personne accus\u00e9e parce qu\u2019il a cru celui de la personne plaignante (R. c. D. (J.J.R.) (2006), 215 C.C.C. (3d) 252 (C.A. Ont.)). La Cour a \u00e9galement exprim\u00e9 des r\u00e9serves quant \u00e0 savoir si un examen in\u00e9gal de la preuve de la Couronne d\u2019une part et de la d\u00e9fense d\u2019autre part est un motif d\u2019appel appropri\u00e9 et ind\u00e9pendant (R. c.

L\u2019emploi interchangeable des mots \u00ab non fond\u00e9e \u00bb et \u00ab conjecturale \u00bb dans ce contexte ne veut pas dire que la cour voulait indiquer que toute forme de conjecture, au sens familier, \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 une erreur de droit.\n[3] Voir, p. ex., R. c.

R., 2022 QCCA 104 (voies de fait, attentat \u00e0 la pudeur et menaces de causer la mort ou des l\u00e9sions corporelles).\n[4] L\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 fait intervenir des facteurs tels que : la logique et la coh\u00e9rence internes de la d\u00e9position du t\u00e9moin et le nombre de contradictions avec des d\u00e9clarations ant\u00e9rieures, surtout celles faites sous serment (Maxwell c. La Reine, [1979] 2 R.C.S. 1072); la compatibilit\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage avec d\u2019autres faits accept\u00e9s et circonstances probables (R. c. Norman (1993), 16 O.R. (3d) 295 (C.A.), p. 314, citant Faryna c. Chorny, [1952] 2 D.L.R. 354 (C.A.

(K.G.), [1993] 1 R.C.S. 740, p. 803); et le comportement, m\u00eame si le tribunal ne devrait pas se fonder exclusivement sur cette consid\u00e9ration et devrait y accorder un poids limit\u00e9 (R. c. N.S., 2012 CSC 72, [2012] 3 R.C.S. 726, par. 25-26; R. c. J.A.A., 2011 CSC 17, [2011] 1 R.C.S. 628, par. 14; R. c. Rhayel, 2015 ONCA 377, 324 C.C.C. (3d) 362, par. 84-94; R. c. Pelletier (1995), 165 A.R. 138 (C.A.), par. 18). L\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de la fiabilit\u00e9 fait intervenir des facteurs tels que : les conditions dans lesquelles le t\u00e9moin a fait les observations pertinentes; la quantit\u00e9 de d\u00e9tails dans son t\u00e9moignage; le temps qui s\u2019est \u00e9coul\u00e9 entre les observations et le t\u00e9moignage; et tout facteur interm\u00e9diaire ayant pu vicier les souvenirs du t\u00e9moin (voir, p. ex., R. c.

Son assureur lui a initialement vers\u00e9 des indemnit\u00e9s d\u2019accident. Cependant, en janvier 2011, l\u2019assureur a inform\u00e9 Y dans une lettre que le versement des indemnit\u00e9s avait \u00e9t\u00e9 arr\u00eat\u00e9 vu l\u2019absence de certificat d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 d\u00fbment rempli. Un formulaire de r\u00e8glement des diff\u00e9rends \u00e9tait joint \u00e0 la lettre. Puis, en f\u00e9vrier 2011, l\u2019assureur a inform\u00e9 Y que, par suite d\u2019un examen m\u00e9dical, ses indemnit\u00e9s de remplacement de revenu \u00e9taient r\u00e9tablies, mais que ses deux autres demandes d\u2019indemnit\u00e9s \u2014 pour travaux m\u00e9nagers et travaux d\u2019entretien du domicile \u2014 \u00e9taient refus\u00e9es. Enfin, en septembre 2011, l\u2019assureur a inform\u00e9 Y que ses indemnit\u00e9s de remplacement de revenu \u00e9taient refus\u00e9es et que les versements cesseraient. Aucun formulaire de r\u00e8glement des diff\u00e9rends n\u2019\u00e9tait joint \u00e0 ces deux derni\u00e8res lettres.\nY a sollicit\u00e9 la m\u00e9diation, qui \u00e9tait obligatoire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, afin de contester le refus de lui verser les indemnit\u00e9s qu\u2019elle demandait. Le processus de m\u00e9diation a pris fin en janvier 2014 et le m\u00e9diateur a remis son rapport. Au moment de l\u2019accident de Y, la Loi sur les assurances de l\u2019Ontario pr\u00e9cisait que le d\u00e9lai pour engager des proc\u00e9dures afin de contester le refus d\u2019un assureur de verser des indemnit\u00e9s \u00e9tait de deux ans suivant ce refus. La Loi pr\u00e9voyait \u00e9galement le prolongement du d\u00e9lai de prescription pendant une p\u00e9riode de 90 jours apr\u00e8s la remise du rapport du m\u00e9diateur. Y a commenc\u00e9 la proc\u00e9dure devant le Tribunal d\u2019appel en mati\u00e8re de permis (\u00ab TAMP \u00bb) en mars 2018. Sa demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e pour cause de prescription et sa demande de r\u00e9examen a elle aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e.\nEn vertu de la Loi de 1999 sur le tribunal d\u2019appel en mati\u00e8re de permis de l\u2019Ontario, le droit de Y d\u2019interjeter appel de la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019arbitre du TAMP sur le r\u00e9examen \u00e9tait limit\u00e9 aux questions de droit. Y a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un appel fond\u00e9 sur des questions de droit, en plus de pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate en r\u00e9vision judiciaire relativement \u00e0 des questions de fait ou des questions mixtes de fait et de droit. La Cour divisionnaire a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019appel, statuant que Y n\u2019avait d\u00e9montr\u00e9 aucune erreur de droit de la part de l\u2019arbitre du TAMP. Elle a \u00e9galement rejet\u00e9 la requ\u00eate en r\u00e9vision judiciaire de Y, au motif qu\u2019il n\u2019existait aucune circonstance exceptionnelle justifiant une r\u00e9vision judiciaire. La Cour d\u2019appel a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019appel de Y, jugeant que ce serait seulement dans de rares cas que le recours en r\u00e9vision judiciaire serait exerc\u00e9, compte tenu du r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif de r\u00e8glement de tels diff\u00e9rends, et que Y disposait d\u2019un autre recours appropri\u00e9. Elle a en outre conclu que, m\u00eame en supposant que la requ\u00eate en r\u00e9vision judiciaire aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre examin\u00e9e, elle aurait \u00e9chou\u00e9 puisque la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019arbitre du TAMP \u00e9tait raisonnable.\nArr\u00eat : Le pourvoi est accueilli et l\u2019affaire est renvoy\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019arbitre du TAMP.\nLes cours inf\u00e9rieures ont fait erreur en concluant que, lorsqu\u2019il existe un droit d\u2019appel limit\u00e9, il ne devrait \u00eatre proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 une r\u00e9vision judiciaire que dans des cas rares ou exceptionnels. L\u2019existence d\u2019un droit d\u2019appel limit\u00e9 aux pures questions de droit en ce qui concerne les d\u00e9cisions du TAMP ne refl\u00e8te pas une intention du l\u00e9gislateur de restreindre le recours aux tribunaux \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019autres questions d\u00e9coulant de la d\u00e9cision administrative du TAMP. La d\u00e9cision du l\u00e9gislateur d\u2019\u00e9tablir un droit d\u2019appel \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de questions de droit d\u00e9note seulement l\u2019intention d\u2019assujettir \u00e0 la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte la r\u00e9vision des d\u00e9cisions du TAMP portant sur des questions de droit, et le fait de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une r\u00e9vision judiciaire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de questions de fait ou de questions mixtes de fait et de droit respecte pleinement les choix du l\u00e9gislateur en mati\u00e8re d\u2019organisation institutionnelle. De plus, la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019arbitre du TAMP sur le r\u00e9examen \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable, car il a omis de tenir compte de contraintes l\u00e9gales pertinentes. L\u2019affaire doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019arbitre du TAMP pour r\u00e9examen.\nComme a statu\u00e9 la Cour dans Vavilov, l\u2019existence d\u2019un droit d\u2019appel n\u2019emp\u00eache pas une personne de pr\u00e9senter une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de questions non vis\u00e9es par l\u2019appel. En pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un droit d\u2019appel pr\u00e9vu par la loi limit\u00e9 aux questions de droit, la r\u00e9vision judiciaire est possible \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de questions de fait ou de questions mixtes de fait et de droit. Toutefois, malgr\u00e9 l\u2019existence du droit de pr\u00e9senter une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire, il est loisible au juge \u00e0 qui une telle demande est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e de d\u00e9cider s\u2019il y a lieu d\u2019exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d\u2019accorder ou non r\u00e9paration \u2014 mais ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire ne va pas jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019autoriser \u00e0 refuser de consid\u00e9rer la demande. Le juge doit exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire et d\u00e9cider, au regard du cadre d\u2019analyse \u00e9tabli dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Strickland c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2015 CSC 37, s\u2019il proc\u00e9dera \u00e0 la r\u00e9vision judiciaire. Au minimum, le juge doit d\u00e9terminer si le contr\u00f4le judiciaire constitue un recours appropri\u00e9. Si, dans l\u2019examen de la demande, le juge conclut \u00e0 l\u2019existence de l\u2019un des motifs discr\u00e9tionnaires justifiant de ne pas accorder une r\u00e9paration, il peut refuser d\u2019examiner au fond la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire. Le juge a aussi le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de refuser d\u2019accorder une r\u00e9paration m\u00eame s\u2019il conclut que la d\u00e9cision soumise au contr\u00f4le est d\u00e9raisonnable.\nDans l\u2019exercice de son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire, en plus de la pertinence et du caract\u00e8re opportun du contr\u00f4le judiciaire dans les circonstances, la cour doit \u00e9galement tenir compte des autres recours disponibles. Cette mise en balance devrait prendre en compte les objectifs et les consid\u00e9rations de principe qui sous\u2011tendent le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif en cause. Il existe d\u2019autres possibilit\u00e9s de recours lorsque les processus internes de r\u00e9vision n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9puis\u00e9s ou lorsqu\u2019il y a un droit d\u2019appel pr\u00e9vu par la loi qui n\u2019est pas limit\u00e9, de telle sorte que les questions de droit, de fait et mixtes de fait et de droit peuvent \u00eatre examin\u00e9es en appel. Ce serait faire abstraction des enseignements de l\u2019arr\u00eat Strickland que de conclure que c\u2019est seulement en pr\u00e9sence de circonstances exceptionnelles qu\u2019il y a ouverture \u00e0 la r\u00e9vision judiciaire lorsqu\u2019il existe un droit d\u2019appel limit\u00e9. Ce serait \u00e9galement une erreur de conclure qu\u2019il ne devrait \u00eatre proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9vision judiciaire que dans de rares cas seulement.\nEn l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la Cour divisionnaire aurait d\u00fb exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire et proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la r\u00e9vision judiciaire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de questions non vis\u00e9es par le droit d\u2019appel pr\u00e9vu par la loi. Le droit d\u2019appel pr\u00e9vu par la loi et la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019arbitre du TAMP sur le r\u00e9examen ne constituent pas d\u2019autres recours ad\u00e9quats. Y soul\u00e8ve des erreurs de fait ou des erreurs mixtes de fait et de droit qui ne sont pas r\u00e9visables en vertu du droit d\u2019appel pr\u00e9vu par la loi, et l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure de r\u00e9examen interne ne saurait repr\u00e9senter un recours ad\u00e9quat, puisque c\u2019est la d\u00e9cision sur le r\u00e9examen elle-m\u00eame qui est l\u2019objet de la r\u00e9vision.\nQui plus est, la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019arbitre du TAMP sur le r\u00e9examen est d\u00e9raisonnable, car il a omis de consid\u00e9rer l\u2019effet du r\u00e9tablissement des indemnit\u00e9s de remplacement de revenu entre f\u00e9vrier et septembre 2011 sur la validit\u00e9 du refus initial. De surcro\u00eet, il n\u2019a pas pris en compte les d\u00e9cisions ant\u00e9rieures du tribunal administratif, dont certaines avaient jug\u00e9 que, dans les cas o\u00f9 il y a r\u00e9tablissement des indemnit\u00e9s d\u2019un demandeur, le d\u00e9lai de prescription peut uniquement \u00eatre d\u00e9clench\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019il est une fois de plus mis fin valablement au versement des indemnit\u00e9s. Il est possible de soutenir qu\u2019un refus valable des indemnit\u00e9s de remplacement de revenu \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour d\u00e9clencher le compte \u00e0 rebours concernant le d\u00e9lai de prescription, et c\u2019est au TAMP qu\u2019il revient de trancher cette question.\nJurisprudence\nArr\u00eats appliqu\u00e9s : Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration) c.

Aper\u00e7u\n[1] La pr\u00e9sente affaire porte sur l\u2019exercice par les tribunaux de leur pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de d\u00e9cider s\u2019il y a lieu de proc\u00e9der au fond \u00e0 une r\u00e9vision judiciaire[1], lorsqu\u2019il existe un droit d\u2019appel limit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vu par la loi.\n[2] Ummugulsum Yatar conteste le refus de lui verser les indemnit\u00e9s d\u2019assurance qu\u2019elle demandait \u00e0 la suite d\u2019un accident survenu en 2010. Apr\u00e8s le rejet de sa demande par le Tribunal d\u2019appel en mati\u00e8re de permis (\u00ab TAMP \u00bb) en 2019, pour cause de prescription, Mme Yatar a demand\u00e9 le r\u00e9examen de cette d\u00e9cision, demande qui a elle aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e. Ensuite, elle a simultan\u00e9ment fait appel de cette d\u00e9cision devant la Cour divisionnaire de l\u2019Ontario et pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 celle\u2011ci une requ\u00eate en r\u00e9vision judiciaire. Le paragraphe 11(6) de la Loi de 1999 sur le tribunal d\u2019appel en mati\u00e8re de permis, L.O. 1999, c. 12, annexe G (\u00ab Loi sur le TAMP \u00bb), pr\u00e9cise qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision du TAMP portant sur une question vis\u00e9e par la Loi sur les assurances, L.R.O. 1990, c. I.8, ne peut \u00eatre port\u00e9e en appel que sur une question de droit seulement.\n[3] Suivant l\u2019arr\u00eat Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration) c. Vavilov, 2019 CSC 65, [2019] 4 R.C.S. 653, l\u2019existence d\u2019un droit d\u2019appel n\u2019emp\u00eache pas une personne de pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate en r\u00e9vision judiciaire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de questions non vis\u00e9es par l\u2019appel. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, malgr\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un droit d\u2019appel pr\u00e9vu par la loi limit\u00e9 aux questions de droit, la r\u00e9vision judiciaire est possible \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de questions de fait ou de questions mixtes de fait et de droit. La d\u00e9cision de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la r\u00e9vision judiciaire rel\u00e8ve alors du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du tribunal au regard du cadre d\u2019analyse \u00e9tabli dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Strickland c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2015 CSC 37, [2015] 2 R.C.S. 713.\n[4] La Cour divisionnaire a fait erreur en concluant que c\u2019est seulement en pr\u00e9sence de [traduction] \u00ab circonstances exceptionnelles \u00bb qu\u2019il y a ouverture \u00e0 la r\u00e9vision judiciaire lorsqu\u2019il existe un droit d\u2019appel limit\u00e9 (2021 ONSC 2507, 157 O.R. (3d) 337, par. 4); cette conclusion fait abstraction des enseignements de l\u2019arr\u00eat Strickland. La Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Ontario a elle aussi fait erreur en jugeant que ce serait seulement dans de [traduction] \u00ab rares cas \u00bb qu\u2019il serait proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9vision judiciaire (2022 ONCA 446, 25 C.C.L.I. (6th) 1, par. 42), et qu\u2019en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce Mme Yatar disposait d\u2019un autre recours appropri\u00e9. Les deux cours cherchaient \u00e0 appliquer l\u2019arr\u00eat Strickland, mais elles ont commis des erreurs de principe \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Elles ont fait erreur en consid\u00e9rant que le droit d\u2019appel pr\u00e9vu par la loi \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de questions de droit \u00e9tait indicatif de l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur de restreindre l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la r\u00e9vision judiciaire relativement aux questions de fait et aux questions mixtes de fait et de droit. Aucune inf\u00e9rence de la sorte n\u2019est justifi\u00e9e. Afin d\u2019appliquer ad\u00e9quatement l\u2019arr\u00eat Strickland, la Cour divisionnaire aurait d\u00fb exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire et proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la r\u00e9vision judiciaire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de questions non vis\u00e9es par le droit d\u2019appel pr\u00e9vu par la loi.\n[5] En ce qui concerne la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019arbitre du TAMP sur le r\u00e9examen (2020 CanLII 34442 (\u00ab d\u00e9cision sur le r\u00e9examen \u00bb)), elle est d\u00e9raisonnable, car l\u2019arbitre a omis de consid\u00e9rer les effets du r\u00e9tablissement des indemnit\u00e9s sur le d\u00e9lai de prescription, et il n\u2019a pas tenu compte de la jurisprudence pertinente sur la question. Par cons\u00e9quent, le pourvoi est accueilli et l\u2019affaire est renvoy\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019arbitre du TAMP pour r\u00e9examen.\nII. Contexte factuel\nA. La r\u00e9clamation d\u2019assurance sous\u2011jacente\n[6] Madame Yatar [traduction] \u00ab a \u00e9t\u00e9 bless\u00e9e lors d\u2019un accident de voiture en f\u00e9vrier 2010 et a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 des indemnit\u00e9s en vertu de l\u2019Annexe sur les indemnit\u00e9s d\u2019accident l\u00e9gales \u2014 accidents survenus le 1er novembre 1996 ou apr\u00e8s ce jour, R\u00e8gl. de l\u2019Ont. 403\/96 (\u201cAIAL\u201d) \u00bb (d\u00e9cision de la Cour divisionnaire, par. 5). L\u2019une des deux parties intim\u00e9es, TD Assurance Meloche Monnex, \u00e9tait son assureur \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, et elle a re\u00e7u la demande d\u2019indemnit\u00e9s d\u2019accident de Mme Yatar le 22 f\u00e9vrier 2010, ainsi que son formulaire de confirmation de l\u2019employeur le 13 mars 2010. Dans sa demande, Mme Yatar r\u00e9clamait \u00e9galement des indemnit\u00e9s de remplacement de revenu (\u00ab IRR \u00bb), ainsi que des indemnit\u00e9s pour travaux m\u00e9nagers et travaux d\u2019entretien du domicile.\nRefus des indemnit\u00e9s demand\u00e9es et proc\u00e9dures subs\u00e9quentes\n[7] La demande d\u2019indemnit\u00e9s de Mme Yatar a initialement \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e valide par TD Assurance, et cette derni\u00e8re lui a vers\u00e9 des indemnit\u00e9s. Toutefois, au cours des mois qui ont suivi, TD Assurance a refus\u00e9 dans trois lettres les indemnit\u00e9s demand\u00e9es :\na) La lettre de janvier : Le 7 janvier 2011, TD Assurance a inform\u00e9 Mme Yatar que le versement des IRR ainsi que des indemnit\u00e9s pour travaux m\u00e9nagers et travaux d\u2019entretien du domicile avait \u00e9t\u00e9 arr\u00eat\u00e9 vu l\u2019absence de certificat d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 d\u00fbment rempli. La lettre contenait des instructions pour un examen m\u00e9dical, examen auquel Mme Yatar s\u2019est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e les 17 et 27 janvier. Un formulaire de r\u00e8glement des diff\u00e9rends \u00e9tait joint \u00e0 cette lettre.\nb) La lettre de f\u00e9vrier : Le 16 f\u00e9vrier 2011, Mme Yatar a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e par TD Assurance que, par suite de l\u2019examen m\u00e9dical, sa demande d\u2019indemnit\u00e9s pour travaux m\u00e9nagers et travaux d\u2019entretien du domicile \u00e9tait refus\u00e9e. Toutefois, ses IRR \u00e9taient r\u00e9tablies. Aucun formulaire de r\u00e8glement des diff\u00e9rends n\u2019\u00e9tait joint \u00e0 cette lettre.\nc) La lettre de septembre : Le 19 septembre 2011, Mme Yatar a \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9e que ses IRR \u00e9taient refus\u00e9es par TD Assurance, et que les versements cesseraient le 28 septembre 2011. Aucun formulaire de r\u00e8glement des diff\u00e9rends n\u2019\u00e9tait joint \u00e0 cette lettre.\n[8] D\u2019importantes modifications l\u00e9gislatives ont \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9es depuis que Mme Yatar a commenc\u00e9 ses proc\u00e9dures. Au moment de l\u2019accident, en 2010, la Loi sur les assurances pr\u00e9cisait que le d\u00e9lai pour engager des proc\u00e9dures \u00e9tait de deux ans suivant le refus de l\u2019assureur de verser les indemnit\u00e9s (par. 281.1(1)), et que la m\u00e9diation \u00e9tait une premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape obligatoire aux fins de r\u00e8glement d\u2019un diff\u00e9rend (par. 281(2)), processus qui prolongeait le d\u00e9lai de prescription de 90 jours apr\u00e8s la remise du rapport du m\u00e9diateur (al. 281.1(2)b)). Madame Yatar a sollicit\u00e9 la m\u00e9diation le 13 septembre 2012 afin de contester le refus de lui verser les indemnit\u00e9s qu\u2019elle demandait. Le processus de m\u00e9diation a pris fin le 14 janvier 2014.\n[9] Cependant, l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment le plus pertinent en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est le fait que, lorsque Mme Yatar a commenc\u00e9 sa proc\u00e9dure devant le TAMP en mars 2018, tant la Loi sur les assurances que l\u2019AIAL avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 remani\u00e9es. Par suite des modifications apport\u00e9es \u00e0 la Loi sur les assurances, le TAMP s\u2019est vu conf\u00e9rer comp\u00e9tence exclusive, en premi\u00e8re instance, en mati\u00e8re de r\u00e8glement des diff\u00e9rends portant sur l\u2019AIAL. En outre, le processus de m\u00e9diation obligatoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9limin\u00e9. La Loi sur le TAMP a elle aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e afin de permettre l\u2019appel des d\u00e9cisions du TAMP, mais sur des questions de droit seulement (par. 11(6)).\n[10] Le 31 mars 2016, Mme Yatar a intent\u00e9 son action devant la Cour sup\u00e9rieure de justice. L\u2019action a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e par voie d\u2019ordonnance sur consentement le 27 mars 2017, et la demande \u00e0 l\u2019origine du pr\u00e9sent pourvoi a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au TAMP en mars 2018.\nIII. Historique judiciaire\nA. Tribunal d\u2019appel en mati\u00e8re de permis\n[11] Dans la premi\u00e8re d\u00e9cision de l\u2019arbitre du TAMP en avril 2019 (2019 CanLII 43918 (\u00ab d\u00e9cision pr\u00e9liminaire \u00bb), l\u2019arbitre du TAMP a examin\u00e9 la demande de Mme Yatar r\u00e9clamant des IRR ainsi que des indemnit\u00e9s pour travaux m\u00e9nagers et pour travaux d\u2019entretien du domicile, et il l\u2019a rejet\u00e9e, concluant que la demande \u00e9tait prescrite depuis avril 2014. Lorsque Mme Yatar a entrepris le processus de m\u00e9diation au d\u00e9but de 2011, tant l\u2019al. 281.1(2)b) de la Loi sur les assurances que le par. 51(2) de l\u2019AIAL pr\u00e9voyaient un d\u00e9lai de prescription qui expirait 90 jours apr\u00e8s la remise du rapport du m\u00e9diateur.\n[12] L\u2019arbitre du TAMP a statu\u00e9 que TD Assurance avait, dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 7 janvier 2011, refus\u00e9 d\u2019accorder les IRR ainsi que les indemnit\u00e9s pour travaux m\u00e9nagers et pour travaux d\u2019entretien du domicile. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que [traduction] \u00ab [Mme Yatar] a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente demande au [TAMP] le 16 mars 2018, plus de sept ans apr\u00e8s le refus de ces indemnit\u00e9s le 7 janvier 2011 \u00bb (par. 19), et m\u00eame en tenant compte de l\u2019allongement du d\u00e9lai de prescription en raison de l\u2019\u00e9valuation et de la m\u00e9diation, l\u2019arbitre du TAMP a conclu que les demandes \u00e9taient prescrites depuis avril 2014.\n[13] L\u2019arbitre du TAMP a soulign\u00e9 que, [traduction] \u00ab [\u00e0] la lumi\u00e8re du t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019avocate, il est \u00e9vident que les avocats de son cabinet auraient d\u00fb conna\u00eetre le d\u00e9lai de prescription de deux ans applicable. Il est \u00e9galement \u00e9vident que [Mme Yatar] s\u2019est, \u00e0 son d\u00e9triment, fi\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019expertise de son avocate eu \u00e9gard au d\u00e9lai de prescription pr\u00e9vu par la loi \u00bb (d\u00e9cision pr\u00e9liminaire, par. 25).\n[14] Dans la d\u00e9cision sur le r\u00e9examen, l\u2019arbitre du TAMP a examin\u00e9 ses motifs pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents ainsi que la preuve. L\u2019arbitre a corrig\u00e9 une erreur factuelle au par. 12 de sa d\u00e9cision originale, mais il a confirm\u00e9 cette d\u00e9cision.\n[15] L\u2019arbitre du TAMP s\u2019est fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019arr\u00eat Smith c. Cie d\u2019assurance g\u00e9n\u00e9rale Co\u2011operators, 2002 CSC 30, [2002] 2 R.C.S. 129. Il a conclu que le formulaire de r\u00e8glement des diff\u00e9rends qui \u00e9tait joint \u00e0 la lettre de janvier 2011 [traduction] \u00ab \u00e9nonce clairement les trois \u00e9tapes du processus de r\u00e8glement des diff\u00e9rends et avertit en termes clairs et simples de l\u2019existence du d\u00e9lai de prescription de deux ans \u00bb (par. 13). L\u2019arbitre du TAMP a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Smith c. Co\u2011operators, le but de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada \u00e9tait de faire en sorte que le demandeur soit inform\u00e9 du processus de r\u00e8glement des diff\u00e9rends. Il a fait remarquer qu\u2019il y avait eu [traduction] \u00ab acceptation implicite des refus qui avaient pris effet le 4 janvier 2011 \u00bb, et il a confirm\u00e9 sa conclusion pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente selon laquelle la lettre du 7 janvier 2011 constituait un refus valide des indemnit\u00e9s (d\u00e9cision sur le r\u00e9examen, par. 15; voir aussi le par. 16).\n[16] Le d\u00e9lai de prescription a \u00e9t\u00e9 prolong\u00e9 jusqu\u2019en avril 2014 par suite de la m\u00e9diation. Toutefois, comme Mme Yatar a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande d\u2019indemnit\u00e9s au TAMP le 16 mars 2018, cette demande \u00e9tait prescrite. La demande de r\u00e9examen a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e.\nB. Cour sup\u00e9rieure de justice de l\u2019Ontario (Cour divisionnaire), 2021 ONSC 2507, 157 O.R. (3d) 337 (les juges Swinton, Penny et Kristjanson)\n[17] Le droit de Mme Yatar d\u2019interjeter appel de la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019arbitre du TAMP sur le r\u00e9examen \u00e9tait limit\u00e9 aux questions de droit, conform\u00e9ment au par. 11(6) de la Loi sur le TAMP. \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de cette limitation, Mme Yatar a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un appel fond\u00e9 sur des questions de droit, en plus de pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate en r\u00e9vision judiciaire relativement \u00e0 des questions de fait ou des questions mixtes de fait et de droit.\n[18] La Cour divisionnaire a jug\u00e9 que son pouvoir d\u2019entendre la requ\u00eate en r\u00e9vision judiciaire d\u00e9coulait du par. 280(3) de la Loi sur les assurances et du par. 2(1) de la Loi sur la proc\u00e9dure de r\u00e9vision judiciaire, L.R.O. 1990, c. J.1; ce pouvoir n\u2019\u00e9tait pas \u00e9cart\u00e9 par le droit d\u2019appel limit\u00e9 aux questions de droit que pr\u00e9voit le par. 11(6) de la Loi sur le TAMP.\n[19] L\u2019appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que Mme Yatar n\u2019avait d\u00e9montr\u00e9 aucune erreur de droit de la part de l\u2019arbitre du TAMP, et avait plut\u00f4t \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9 des [traduction] \u00ab conclusions factuelles tir\u00e9es par l\u2019arbitre [du TAMP], puis simplement affirm\u00e9 que l\u2019arbitre [du TAMP] avait commis une erreur de droit, sans identifier l\u2019erreur de droit en question ou quelque principe juridique isolable \u00bb (d\u00e9cision de la Cour divisionnaire, par. 27).\n[20] En ce qui concerne la requ\u00eate en r\u00e9vision judiciaire visant des questions de fait et des questions mixtes de fait et de droit, la Cour divisionnaire a conclu, sur la base de l\u2019arr\u00eat Vavilov, que le droit d\u2019appel limit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vu par la Loi sur le TAMP n\u2019avait pas pour effet de [traduction] \u00ab priver la cour du pouvoir d\u2019examiner d\u2019autres aspects d\u2019une d\u00e9cision dans le cadre d\u2019une proc\u00e9dure de r\u00e9vision judiciaire \u00bb (par. 36). La cour a ajout\u00e9 que la r\u00e9vision judiciaire est un recours discr\u00e9tionnaire, et qu\u2019il faudrait donc refuser d\u2019y proc\u00e9der lorsque d\u2019autres recours sont ad\u00e9quats (voir Strickland, par. 37 et 40).\n[21] Relativement \u00e0 la question de savoir s\u2019il y avait lieu qu\u2019elle exerce son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la r\u00e9vision judiciaire en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la Cour divisionnaire a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 quatre facteurs : (i) l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur de limiter aux questions de droit seulement la r\u00e9vision judiciaire des d\u00e9cisions du TAMP sur les indemnit\u00e9s en mati\u00e8re d\u2019accidents, (ii) l\u2019\u00e9tendue du pouvoir de r\u00e9examen du TAMP, (iii) la nature des erreurs all\u00e9gu\u00e9es, et (iv) les difficult\u00e9s syst\u00e9miques associ\u00e9es au traitement d\u2019une r\u00e9vision judiciaire et d\u2019un appel (par. 41\u201145).\n[22] La Cour divisionnaire a conclu qu\u2019il n\u2019existait en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce [traduction] \u00ab aucune circonstance exceptionnelle \u00bb justifiant une r\u00e9vision judiciaire (par. 46). Sur ce fondement, la Cour divisionnaire a refus\u00e9 d\u2019accueillir la requ\u00eate en r\u00e9vision judiciaire.\nC. Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Ontario, 2022 ONCA 446, 25 C.C.L.I. (6th) 1 (les juges Lauwers, Nordheimer et Zarnett)\n[23] Deux questions ont fait l\u2019objet de l\u2019appel \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appel : (i) la question de savoir si [traduction] \u00ab la Cour divisionnaire a[vait] fait erreur en limitant la r\u00e9vision judiciaire, dans les cas o\u00f9 il y a appel pr\u00e9vu par la loi [. . .], aux cas pr\u00e9sentant des \u201ccirconstances exceptionnelles\u201d \u00bb, et (ii) la question de savoir si \u00ab la d\u00e9cision du [TAMP] sur le r\u00e9examen [\u00e9tait] raisonnable \u00bb (par. 27).\n[24] La Cour d\u2019appel a fait remarquer que, lorsque la Cour divisionnaire avait discut\u00e9 de l\u2019ouverture du recours en r\u00e9vision judiciaire, [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019utilisation de l\u2019expression \u201ccirconstances exceptionnelles\u201d avait \u00e9t\u00e9 malencontreuse \u00bb et risquait de susciter de la confusion (par. 35). La Cour d\u2019appel a jug\u00e9 que le message que la Cour divisionnaire [traduction] \u00ab tentait de communiquer \u00e9tait que ce serait seulement dans de rares cas que le recours en r\u00e9vision judiciaire serait exerc\u00e9, compte tenu du r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif de r\u00e8glement des diff\u00e9rends relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019AIAL \u00bb (par. 42).\n[25] La Cour d\u2019appel a conclu qu\u2019un droit d\u2019appel limit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vu par la loi ne fait pas obstacle \u00e0 la r\u00e9vision judiciaire. Le droit de demander la r\u00e9vision judiciaire existe toujours, mais cela [traduction] \u00ab ne change [pas] le fait que la r\u00e9vision judiciaire est un recours discr\u00e9tionnaire \u00bb (par. 41). La Cour d\u2019appel a aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9, en s\u2019appuyant sur l\u2019arr\u00eat Strickland, que [traduction] \u00ab [l]e pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du tribunal en ce qui concerne la r\u00e9vision judiciaire s\u2019applique tant \u00e0 sa d\u00e9cision de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la r\u00e9vision qu\u2019\u00e0 celle d\u2019accorder r\u00e9paration \u00bb (par. 44).\n[26] La Cour d\u2019appel a statu\u00e9 que la Cour divisionnaire avait correctement consid\u00e9r\u00e9 les facteurs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans Strickland relativement \u00e0 la question de savoir s\u2019il existe ou non d\u2019autres recours que la r\u00e9vision judiciaire. Il y a [traduction] \u00ab intention du l\u00e9gislateur de limiter l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux tribunaux \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ces diff\u00e9rends \u00bb (par. 43).\n[27] La Cour d\u2019appel a conclu que, m\u00eame en supposant que [traduction] \u00ab la requ\u00eate en r\u00e9vision judiciaire aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre examin\u00e9e \u00bb, Mme Yatar n\u2019avait pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019arbitre du TAMP sur le r\u00e9examen \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable : [traduction] \u00ab . . . cette demande aurait \u00e9chou\u00e9 suivant la pr\u00e9somption voulant que la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable soit la norme applicable . . . \u00bb (par. 52).\n[28] La Cour d\u2019appel a jug\u00e9 que la conclusion sous\u2011jacente de l\u2019arbitre du TAMP selon laquelle le refus valide des indemnit\u00e9s avait d\u00e9clench\u00e9 le d\u00e9but du d\u00e9lai de prescription \u00e9tait elle aussi raisonnable :\n[traduction] . . . le d\u00e9lai de prescription aurait expir\u00e9 en 2013, n\u2019e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 le processus de m\u00e9diation [. . .] qui a prolong\u00e9 ce d\u00e9lai jusqu\u2019en avril 2014. Mais dans un cas comme dans l\u2019autre, le fait que [Mme Yatar] n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande au [TAMP] avant le 16 mars 2018 signifiait que celle\u2011ci \u00e9tait hors d\u00e9lai. [par. 51]\n[29] En cons\u00e9quence, bien que la Cour d\u2019appel ait conclu que la r\u00e9vision judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019arbitre du TAMP n\u2019aurait pas d\u00fb \u00eatre effectu\u00e9e, la requ\u00eate en r\u00e9vision judiciaire aurait \u00e9chou\u00e9 puisque la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019arbitre du TAMP sur le r\u00e9examen \u00e9tait raisonnable.\nIV. Questions en litige dans le pourvoi\n[30] Dans le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi, Mme Yatar soul\u00e8ve deux questions : premi\u00e8rement, la question de savoir si la Cour d\u2019appel a fait erreur en concluant que la d\u00e9cision du l\u00e9gislateur de limiter aux [traduction] \u00ab pures \u00bb questions de droit le droit de faire appel des d\u00e9cisions du TAMP avait pour effet de restreindre aux cas \u00ab rares \u00bb ou \u00ab inhabituels \u00bb l\u2019ouverture de la r\u00e9vision judiciaire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des d\u00e9cisions du TAMP pour les erreurs de fait ou des erreurs mixtes de fait et de droit; et, deuxi\u00e8mement, la question de savoir si la Cour d\u2019appel a fait erreur en concluant que la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019arbitre du TAMP sur le r\u00e9examen \u00e9tait raisonnable (m.a., par. 28).\nV. Observations des parties\nA. Madame Yatar\n[31] Madame Yatar fait valoir que la Cour d\u2019appel a fait erreur en concluant que l\u2019existence d\u2019un droit d\u2019appel limit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vu par la loi peut constituer un fondement permettant de refuser de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une r\u00e9vision judiciaire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de questions d\u00e9bordant le champ d\u2019application de l\u2019appel pr\u00e9vu par la loi. L\u2019arr\u00eat Vavilov confirme que [traduction] \u00ab le droit d\u2019interjeter appel \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une question de droit n\u2019est pas le recours appropri\u00e9 si le justiciable sollicite le contr\u00f4le judiciaire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une question de fait ou d\u2019une question mixte de fait et de droit, [. . .] les deux recours sont compl\u00e9mentaires \u00bb (m.a., par. 52).\n[32] Pour ce qui est de la r\u00e9vision judiciaire en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, Mme Yatar pr\u00e9tend que, comme aucun formulaire de r\u00e8glement des diff\u00e9rends n\u2019\u00e9tait joint aux lettres de f\u00e9vrier et septembre 2011, ces lettres ne peuvent pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme des refus valides de verser des indemnit\u00e9s. L\u2019arbitre du TAMP a commis une erreur en consid\u00e9rant que la lettre de janvier 2011 constituait un refus valide, car il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une suspension temporaire des indemnit\u00e9s qui [traduction] \u00ab ne constituait pas un avis en \u201ctermes clairs et simples \u2014 qu\u2019un profane peut saisir \u2014 \u201d indiquant que les indemnit\u00e9s ne seraient pas vers\u00e9es \u00bb (m.a., par. 79). Par cons\u00e9quent, la lettre de janvier 2011 ne saurait \u00eatre le point de d\u00e9part du d\u00e9lai de prescription.\n[33] Madame Yatar soutient que le fait que l\u2019arbitre du TAMP ne s\u2019est pas pench\u00e9 sur la question des \u00ab ambigu\u00eft\u00e9s \u00bb de la lettre de janvier 2011 repr\u00e9sente une lacune fondamentale de son analyse, et la d\u00e9cision de ce dernier est en cons\u00e9quence d\u00e9raisonnable.\nB. TD Assurance et Tribunal d\u2019appel en mati\u00e8re de permis\n[34] TD Assurance plaide que la Cour divisionnaire n\u2019a pas fait erreur en exer\u00e7ant son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire pour refuser de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la r\u00e9vision judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019arbitre du TAMP sur le r\u00e9examen. La l\u00e9gislature ontarienne a choisi de limiter aux questions de droit l\u2019intervention des tribunaux en appel.\n[35] La r\u00e9vision judiciaire est un recours qui rel\u00e8ve du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire des tribunaux, et la d\u00e9cision de la Cour divisionnaire d\u2019exercer ou non ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire commande la d\u00e9f\u00e9rence. Comme l\u2019a reconnu notre Cour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Canadien Pacifique Lt\u00e9e c. Bande indienne de Matsqui, [1995] 1 R.C.S. 3, les brefs de pr\u00e9rogative sont des \u00ab recours extraordinaires \u00bb. Le droit de pr\u00e9senter une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire n\u2019emporte pas \u00ab le droit d\u2019exiger que la cour proc\u00e8de effectivement \u00e0 ce contr\u00f4le \u00bb, ind\u00e9pendamment de la nature de la question (par. 30; Canada (V\u00e9rificateur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Canada (Ministre de l\u2019\u00c9nergie, des Mines et des Ressources), [1989] 2 R.C.S. 49, p. 93).\n[36] TD Assurance avance que les facteurs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Strickland constituent un fondement suffisant pour rejeter le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi. Si d\u2019autres recours que la r\u00e9vision judiciaire sont ad\u00e9quats, comme c\u2019est le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il est alors \u00ab appropri\u00e9 \u00bb de donner effet \u00e0 l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur, et de refuser de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la r\u00e9vision judiciaire. D\u2019autres facteurs tir\u00e9s de la jurisprudence confirment que la r\u00e9vision judiciaire n\u2019\u00e9tait pas appropri\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, notamment : la nature du r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif, la nature de la d\u00e9cision et le processus suivi pour y arriver, l\u2019importance de la d\u00e9cision pour la ou les personnes touch\u00e9es, et la question de savoir si l\u2019affaire pr\u00e9sente de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat pour le public.\n[37] Subsidiairement, TD Assurance soutient que, s\u2019il y a lieu de r\u00e9viser judiciairement la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019arbitre du TAMP sur le r\u00e9examen, l\u2019arbitre a conclu de mani\u00e8re raisonnable que la demande \u00e9tait prescrite.\n[38] Le TAMP affirme que la Cour d\u2019appel a correctement jug\u00e9 que ce serait [traduction] \u00ab seulement dans de rares cas \u00bb que devrait \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la r\u00e9vision judiciaire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de questions de fait et de questions mixtes de fait et de droit (motifs de la C.A., par. 42). Autrement, la concr\u00e9tisation de l\u2019intention qu\u2019a exprim\u00e9e le l\u00e9gislateur en \u00e9dictant une disposition restreignant le droit d\u2019appel serait compromise.\n[39] Le TAMP pr\u00e9tend que les observations qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent sont conformes aux conclusions de l\u2019arr\u00eat Strickland quant \u00e0 l\u2019exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de proc\u00e9der ou non \u00e0 la r\u00e9vision judiciaire. L\u2019arr\u00eat Vavilov n\u2019a pas modifi\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9tat du droit relatif au pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de refuser de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la r\u00e9vision judiciaire lorsqu\u2019un autre recours existe; l\u2019arr\u00eat Vavilov n\u2019a pas \u00e9cart\u00e9 l\u2019arr\u00eat Strickland.\n[40] De l\u2019avis du TAMP, si on interpr\u00e8te ensemble les arr\u00eats Vavilov et Strickland, on arrive \u00e0 la conclusion que l\u2019exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de proc\u00e9der ou non \u00e0 la r\u00e9vision judiciaire doit tenir compte du caract\u00e8re ad\u00e9quat du droit d\u2019appel limit\u00e9 en tant qu\u2019autre recours tout en respectant le choix du l\u00e9gislateur de cr\u00e9er un droit d\u2019appel limit\u00e9 aux questions de droit seulement. Le TAMP ne formule pas de position quant au caract\u00e8re raisonnable de sa d\u00e9cision.\nVI. Analyse\nA. Norme de contr\u00f4le\n[41] La principale question en litige dans le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi porte sur la d\u00e9cision de la Cour divisionnaire et de la Cour d\u2019appel de ne pas proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la r\u00e9vision judiciaire. Comme il s\u2019agit d\u2019une d\u00e9cision discr\u00e9tionnaire, elle commande la d\u00e9f\u00e9rence (voir Strickland, par. 39). Toutefois, une telle d\u00e9cision peut \u00eatre \u00e9cart\u00e9e si le juge a \u00ab tenu compte de facteurs non pertinents, [. . .] omis de prendre en consid\u00e9ration des facteurs pertinents ou [. . .] tir\u00e9 une conclusion d\u00e9raisonnable \u00bb (Bande indienne de Matsqui, par. 39). Comme je vais l\u2019expliquer, la Cour divisionnaire et la Cour d\u2019appel ont fait erreur dans l\u2019application de l\u2019arr\u00eat Strickland, en ce qu\u2019elles ont agi sur la base d\u2019un \u00ab principe erron\u00e9 \u00bb (Bande indienne de Matsqui, par. 112, le juge Sopinka).\n[42] Une fois qu\u2019il est d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019il est appropri\u00e9 de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la r\u00e9vision judiciaire dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, la question qui se pose consiste \u00e0 se demander si la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019arbitre du TAMP sur le r\u00e9examen \u00e9tait raisonnable. Aux termes de l\u2019arr\u00eat Vavilov, il existe une \u00ab pr\u00e9somption voulant que la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable soit la norme applicable chaque fois qu\u2019une cour contr\u00f4le une d\u00e9cision administrative \u00bb (par. 16). Cette pr\u00e9somption n\u2019est pas r\u00e9fut\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\nB. L\u2019existence d\u2019un droit d\u2019appel limit\u00e9 ne fait pas obstacle en soi aux requ\u00eates en r\u00e9vision judiciaire\n[43] Lorsque le diff\u00e9rend a pris naissance au d\u00e9but de 2011, la m\u00e9diation \u00e9tait une premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape obligatoire dans toute contestation visant le refus d\u2019un assureur de verser des indemnit\u00e9s. Tant l\u2019al. 281.1(2)b) de la Loi sur les assurances que le par. 51(2) de l\u2019AIAL pr\u00e9cisaient que le d\u00e9lai de prescription \u00e9tait prolong\u00e9 de 90 jours apr\u00e8s la remise du rapport du m\u00e9diateur. Madame Yatar a entrepris un processus de m\u00e9diation en septembre 2012. Lorsqu\u2019elle a commenc\u00e9 sa proc\u00e9dure devant le TAMP en mars 2018, le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif avait \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 et pr\u00e9voyait qu\u2019il pouvait \u00eatre interjet\u00e9 appel \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019une d\u00e9cision du TAMP portant sur une question vis\u00e9e par la Loi sur les assurances \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de questions de droit seulement.\n[44] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la Cour divisionnaire et la Cour d\u2019appel ont jug\u00e9 qu\u2019une partie peut \u00e0 la fois exercer un droit d\u2019appel pr\u00e9vu par la loi et pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate en r\u00e9vision judiciaire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de questions d\u00e9bordant le champ d\u2019application de ce droit d\u2019appel. D\u2019autres tribunaux ont eux aussi conclu qu\u2019un droit d\u2019appel pr\u00e9vu par la loi ne fait pas obstacle \u00e0 la r\u00e9vision judiciaire (voir Smith c. The Appeal Commission, 2023 MBCA 23, 479 D.L.R. (4th) 121; Wongkingsri c. Alberta (Appeals Commission for Alberta Workers\u2019 Compensation), 2022 ABQB 545, 61 Alta. L.R. (7th) 170; Zarooben c. Workers\u2019 Compensation Board, 2021 ABQB 232, 84 Admin. L.R. (6th) 96, conf. par 2022 ABCA 50, 95 Admin. L.R. (6th) 163).\n[45] La question qui demeure est la suivante : Quel r\u00f4le joue le droit d\u2019appel dans l\u2019exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de proc\u00e9der au contr\u00f4le judiciaire? Pour trancher cette question, il est important de se r\u00e9f\u00e9rer aux principes fondamentaux. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Immeubles Port Louis Lt\u00e9e c. Lafontaine (Village), [1991] 1 R.C.S. 326, notre Cour a jug\u00e9 que \u00ab [l]e principe de subordination de l\u2019administration publique au pouvoir de surveillance des cours sup\u00e9rieures est la pierre angulaire du syst\u00e8me de droit administratif canadien et qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. Ce contr\u00f4le judiciaire est une cons\u00e9quence n\u00e9cessaire de la [primaut\u00e9 du droit] \u00bb (p. 360).\n[46] L\u2019importance du contr\u00f4le judiciaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e par la Cour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Dunsmuir c. Nouveau\u2011Brunswick, 2008 CSC 9, [2008] 1 R.C.S. 190, par. 27 :\nSur le plan constitutionnel, le contr\u00f4le judiciaire est intimement li\u00e9 au maintien de la primaut\u00e9 du droit. C\u2019est essentiellement cette assise constitutionnelle qui explique sa raison d\u2019\u00eatre et oriente sa fonction et son application. Le contr\u00f4le judiciaire s\u2019int\u00e9resse \u00e0 la tension sous\u2011jacente \u00e0 la relation entre la primaut\u00e9 du droit et le principe d\u00e9mocratique fondamental, qui se traduit par la prise de mesures l\u00e9gislatives pour cr\u00e9er divers organismes administratifs et les investir de larges pouvoirs.\n[47] Dans Vavilov, au par. 52, notre Cour a statu\u00e9 que l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur de limiter les droits d\u2019appel pr\u00e9vus par la loi ne fait pas obstacle en soi aux demandes de contr\u00f4le judiciaire :\nLa pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un droit d\u2019appel circonscrit dans le cadre d\u2019un r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif ne fait pas obstacle en soi aux demandes de contr\u00f4le judiciaire visant des d\u00e9cisions ou des questions qui ne sont pas vis\u00e9es par le m\u00e9canisme d\u2019appel, ni aux recours intent\u00e9s par des personnes qui n\u2019ont aucun droit d\u2019appel.\n[48] Ce pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent de la Cour envisage le cas d\u2019une personne qui pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 la fois un appel pr\u00e9vu par la loi sur la base de questions de droit, ainsi qu\u2019une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire sur la base de questions de fait et de questions mixtes de fait et de droit. Dans un tel cas, comme il est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans Vavilov, au par. 37, les questions de droit vis\u00e9es par l\u2019appel seraient contr\u00f4l\u00e9es selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte (Housen c. Nikolaisen, 2002 CSC 33, [2002] 2 R.C.S. 235), et les questions de fait ainsi que les questions mixtes de fait et de droit le seraient suivant la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable (voir Vavilov).\n[49] Une personne a le droit de pr\u00e9senter une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire, et [traduction] \u00ab [c]onf\u00e9rer aux tribunaux le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de ne pas entendre des demandes de contr\u00f4le judiciaire en raison de leur perception de la qualit\u00e9 et de la quantit\u00e9 des mesures de r\u00e9examen internes disponibles permettrait \u00e0 un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire judiciaire de supplanter un principe constitutionnel \u00bb (P. Daly, A Culture of Justification : Vavilov and the Future of Administrative Law (2023), p. 226, note 94). Bien que les tribunaux aient le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d\u2019entendre ou non au fond une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire et de refuser d\u2019accorder r\u00e9paration, ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire ne va pas jusqu\u2019\u00e0 les autoriser \u00e0 refuser de consid\u00e9rer la demande, comme je vais l\u2019expliquer ci\u2011apr\u00e8s.\n[50] Je prends acte d\u2019arr\u00eats r\u00e9cents de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale concernant l\u2019ouverture du recours en contr\u00f4le judiciaire en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019une clause privative, c.\u2011\u00e0\u2011d. une clause qui vise \u00e0 exclure ou \u00e0 restreindre ce recours (voir, p. ex., Canada (Attorney General) c. Pier 1 Imports (U.S.), Inc., 2023 CAF 209; Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Best Buy Canada Ltd., 2021 CAF 161; D\u00e9mocratie en surveillance c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2023 CAF 39, 14 Admin. L.R. (7th) 48; D\u00e9mocratie en surveillance c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2022 CAF 208). Cependant, il ne s\u2019agit pas l\u00e0 de la question en litige dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Par cons\u00e9quent, je reporte \u00e0 une autre occasion l\u2019examen de cette question.\nC. L\u2019exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d\u2019accorder r\u00e9paration en cas de contr\u00f4le judiciaire\n[51] Malgr\u00e9 l\u2019existence du droit de pr\u00e9senter une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire, il est loisible au juge \u00e0 qui une telle demande est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e de d\u00e9cider s\u2019il y a lieu d\u2019exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d\u2019accorder ou non r\u00e9paration. Notre Cour a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit dans Strickland, par. 37, citant Canada (Ministre de l\u2019\u00c9nergie, des Mines et des Ressources), p. 90 :\nLe contr\u00f4le judiciaire effectu\u00e9 au moyen des anciens brefs de pr\u00e9rogative a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant discr\u00e9tionnaire. Cela signifie que, m\u00eame si le demandeur \u00e9tablit le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 de sa demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire, la cour de r\u00e9vision dispose du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rant de refuser d\u2019accorder la r\u00e9paration demand\u00e9e [. . .]. Les d\u00e9clarations de droit, qu\u2019elles soient sollicit\u00e9es au moyen d\u2019une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire ou d\u2019une action, sont \u00e9galement des r\u00e9parations discr\u00e9tionnaires : [traduction] \u00ab . . . les tribunaux ont la plus grande discr\u00e9tion pour d\u00e9cider s\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une affaire o\u00f9 le jugement d\u00e9claratoire demand\u00e9 devrait \u00eatre accord\u00e9 \u00bb . . . [Je souligne.]\n[52] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Canada (Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration) c. Khosa, 2009 CSC 12, [2009] 1 R.C.S. 339, par. 135, le juge Rothstein a dit ceci :\nEn common law, le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de refuser d\u2019accorder r\u00e9paration dans le cadre du contr\u00f4le judiciaire a traditionnellement \u00e9t\u00e9 exerc\u00e9 en fonction de la conduite des parties, d\u2019un retard excessif et de l\u2019existence d\u2019autres recours possibles : Immeubles Port Louis Lt\u00e9e c. Lafontaine (Village), [1991] 1 R.C.S. 326, p. 364. Comme le confirme l\u2019arr\u00eat Harelkin [c. Universit\u00e9 de Regina, [1979] 2 R.C.S. 561], \u00e0 la p. 575, les tribunaux judiciaires peuvent exercer leur pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de ne pas accorder r\u00e9paration aux demandeurs si ceux\u2011ci \u00ab sont responsables d\u2019un retard d\u00e9raisonnable ou d\u2019une faute ou s\u2019il existe un autre recours appropri\u00e9, m\u00eame s\u2019ils ont fait la preuve de l\u2019incomp\u00e9tence du tribunal d\u2019instance inf\u00e9rieure ou de l\u2019omission d\u2019accomplir un devoir public \u00bb. Comme dans le cas des injonctions interlocutoires, les cours de justice exercent leur pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d\u2019accorder r\u00e9paration dans le cadre d\u2019un contr\u00f4le judiciaire en tenant compte de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public, de tout effet disproportionn\u00e9 sur les parties et des int\u00e9r\u00eats des tiers. [Je souligne.]\n[53] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la Cour d\u2019appel a affirm\u00e9 que [traduction] \u00ab [l]e pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du tribunal en ce qui concerne la r\u00e9vision judiciaire s\u2019applique tant \u00e0 sa d\u00e9cision de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la r\u00e9vision qu\u2019\u00e0 celle d\u2019accorder r\u00e9paration \u00bb (par. 44). Cet \u00e9nonc\u00e9 n\u2019est pas clair; il est donc n\u00e9cessaire de le clarifier.\n[54] Lorsqu\u2019une personne pr\u00e9sente une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire, le juge doit examiner la demande : au minimum, cela signifie que le juge doit d\u00e9terminer si le contr\u00f4le judiciaire constitue un recours appropri\u00e9. Si, dans l\u2019examen de la demande, le juge conclut \u00e0 l\u2019existence de l\u2019un des motifs discr\u00e9tionnaires justifiant de ne pas accorder une r\u00e9paration, il peut refuser d\u2019examiner au fond la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire (Strickland, par. 1, 38 et 40; Matsqui, par. 31). Le juge a aussi le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de refuser d\u2019accorder une r\u00e9paration, m\u00eame s\u2019il conclut que la d\u00e9cision soumise au contr\u00f4le est d\u00e9raisonnable (Khosa, par. 135; Strickland, par. 37, citant Ministre de l\u2019\u00c9nergie, des Mines et des Ressources, p. 90).\n[55] La Cour d\u2019appel a initialement conclu \u00e0 l\u2019absence d\u2019erreur r\u00e9visable dans la d\u00e9cision de la Cour divisionnaire de refuser d\u2019instruire la requ\u00eate en r\u00e9vision judiciaire et, \u00e0 l\u2019instar de la Cour divisionnaire, elle a jug\u00e9 : (i) qu\u2019il existait d\u2019autres recours, et (ii) que le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif d\u00e9montrait [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur de limiter l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux tribunaux \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ces diff\u00e9rends \u00bb (par. 43). La Cour d\u2019appel a ensuite proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9vision judiciaire, tout comme l\u2019avait fait la Cour divisionnaire.\n[56] D\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019arr\u00eat Strickland, l\u2019exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire exige que la cour de r\u00e9vision d\u00e9cide du caract\u00e8re appropri\u00e9 du contr\u00f4le judiciaire : \u00ab La cour doit tenir compte non seulement de l\u2019autre recours disponible, mais aussi de la pertinence et du caract\u00e8re opportun du contr\u00f4le judiciaire dans les circonstances. Bref, la question ne consiste pas simplement \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si quelque autre recours est ad\u00e9quat, mais \u00e9galement s\u2019il convient de recourir au contr\u00f4le judiciaire. [. . .] Cette mise en balance devrait prendre en compte les objectifs et les consid\u00e9rations de principe qui sous\u2011tendent le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif en cause . . . \u00bb (par. 43\u201144).\n[57] Avec \u00e9gards, la Cour d\u2019appel a fait erreur dans l\u2019application des facteurs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans Strickland. Comme je vais l\u2019expliquer, il n\u2019y a pas de fondement ad\u00e9quat permettant d\u2019inf\u00e9rer que le l\u00e9gislateur entendait \u00e9carter la r\u00e9vision judiciaire dans le cas des questions (de fait et des questions mixtes de fait et de droit) qui d\u00e9bordent le champ d\u2019application de l\u2019appel pr\u00e9vu par la loi. De surcro\u00eet, il n\u2019existait pas d\u2019autre recours ad\u00e9quat \u00e0 la disposition de Mme Yatar \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des questions de fait et des questions mixtes de fait et de droit.\n[58] La Cour d\u2019appel a fait erreur en concluant que le droit d\u2019appel limit\u00e9 refl\u00e9tait l\u2019intention de restreindre le recours aux tribunaux \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019autres questions d\u00e9coulant de la d\u00e9cision administrative, et que la r\u00e9vision judiciaire devrait en cons\u00e9quence \u00eatre rare. La d\u00e9cision du l\u00e9gislateur d\u2019\u00e9tablir un droit d\u2019appel \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de questions de droit d\u00e9note seulement l\u2019intention d\u2019assujettir \u00e0 la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte la r\u00e9vision des d\u00e9cisions du TAMP portant sur des questions de droit. L\u2019id\u00e9e que les d\u00e9cisions du TAMP ne devraient pas faire l\u2019objet de recours en r\u00e9vision judiciaire sur la base de questions de fait et de questions mixtes de fait et de droit ne saurait \u00eatre inf\u00e9r\u00e9e de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de.\n[59] L\u2019intim\u00e9e TD Assurance plaide que le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif et ses modifications de 2016 refl\u00e8tent le choix de politique d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du l\u00e9gislateur de limiter consid\u00e9rablement l\u2019intervention des tribunaux dans les diff\u00e9rends portant sur les indemnit\u00e9s li\u00e9es aux accidents : [traduction] \u00ab Le paragraphe 11(6) de la Loi sur le TAMP limite les appels aux questions de droit seulement. [. . .] Dans le cas des d\u00e9cisions que rend le TAMP en vertu d\u2019environ vingt autres lois, le l\u00e9gislateur a pr\u00e9vu qu\u2019il peut \u00eatre interjet\u00e9 appel \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de toutes les questions \u00bb (m.i., par. 62\u201163). TD Assurance pr\u00e9tend en outre que [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019application d\u2019une norme de r\u00e9vision d\u00e9f\u00e9rentielle (la d\u00e9cision raisonnable) \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des questions de fait et des questions mixtes d\u00e9coulant des d\u00e9cisions du TAMP concernant l\u2019AIAL ne respecterait pas de mani\u00e8re appropri\u00e9e les choix du l\u00e9gislateur en mati\u00e8re d\u2019organisation institutionnelle \u00bb (par. 84).\n[60] Avec \u00e9gards, je ne suis pas d\u2019accord. Le l\u00e9gislateur aurait pu d\u00e9cider d\u2019englober tous les types d\u2019erreurs dans le droit d\u2019appel, mais il ne l\u2019a pas fait. De plus, le par. 2(1) de la Loi sur la proc\u00e9dure de r\u00e9vision judiciaire maintient le droit des plaideurs de solliciter une r\u00e9vision judiciaire \u00ab malgr\u00e9 tout droit d\u2019appel \u00bb. Les erreurs de fait ou les erreurs mixtes de fait et de droit ne sont par cons\u00e9quent pas assujetties \u00e0 une r\u00e9vision suivant la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte. \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, le fait de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une r\u00e9vision judiciaire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de questions de fait ou de questions mixtes de fait et de droit respecte pleinement les choix du l\u00e9gislateur en mati\u00e8re d\u2019organisation institutionnelle.\n[61] Dans Vavilov, notre Cour a conclu que, \u00ab \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le contr\u00f4le judiciaire b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie de la protection de l\u2019art. 96 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 , le l\u00e9gislateur ne peut soustraire le processus d\u00e9cisionnel administratif \u00e0 tout examen judiciaire \u00bb (par. 24). Le professeur Paul Daly soutient que [traduction] \u00ab [d]ans les cas o\u00f9 la comp\u00e9tence des tribunaux en mati\u00e8re de contr\u00f4le judiciaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9cart\u00e9e avec succ\u00e8s par la loi [. . .] le l\u00e9gislateur a pr\u00e9vu une voie particuli\u00e8re permettant de surveiller la l\u00e9galit\u00e9, la rationalit\u00e9 et l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale de l\u2019action administrative \u00bb (Understanding Administrative Law in the Common Law World (2021), p. 188 (en italique dans l\u2019original)). En d\u2019autres mots, il existait dans ces cas\u2011l\u00e0 un autre forum ou redressement appropri\u00e9.\n[62] Le droit d\u2019appel pr\u00e9vu par la loi et la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019arbitre du TAMP sur le r\u00e9examen ne constituent pas d\u2019autres recours ad\u00e9quats. Le droit d\u2019appel pr\u00e9vu au par. 11(6) de la Loi sur le TAMP se limite aux erreurs de droit seulement. Madame Yatar soul\u00e8ve des erreurs de fait ou des erreurs mixtes de fait et de droit. La r\u00e9vision de ces questions n\u2019est pas possible en vertu du droit d\u2019appel pr\u00e9vu par la loi.\n[63] L\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure de r\u00e9examen interne ne saurait repr\u00e9senter un recours ad\u00e9quat, puisque c\u2019est la d\u00e9cision sur le r\u00e9examen elle-m\u00eame qui est l\u2019objet de la r\u00e9vision. Il existe concr\u00e8tement d\u2019autres possibilit\u00e9s de recours lorsque les processus internes de r\u00e9vision n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9puis\u00e9s ou lorsqu\u2019il y a un droit d\u2019appel pr\u00e9vu par la loi qui n\u2019est pas limit\u00e9, de telle sorte que les questions de droit, de fait et mixtes de fait et de droit peuvent \u00eatre examin\u00e9es en appel. Ce n\u2019est toutefois pas le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[64] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Strickland, par. 43, notre Cour a \u00e9galement mis l\u2019accent sur le caract\u00e8re appropri\u00e9 du contr\u00f4le judiciaire eu \u00e9gard aux circonstances, parlant d\u2019une \u00ab mise en balance \u00bb :\nLa liste des facteurs pertinents n\u2019est pas limit\u00e9e, car il appartient aux cours de justice de les cerner et de les soupeser dans le contexte d\u2019une affaire donn\u00e9e : Matsqui, par. 36\u201137, citant [Ministre de l\u2019\u00c9nergie, des Mines et des Ressources], p. 96. Il ne s\u2019agit donc pas, pour d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il existe un autre recours appropri\u00e9, de suivre une liste de v\u00e9rification ax\u00e9e sur les similitudes et les diff\u00e9rences entre les recours potentiels. L\u2019examen auquel il faut se livrer est encore plus pouss\u00e9. La cour doit tenir compte non seulement de l\u2019autre recours disponible, mais aussi de la pertinence et du caract\u00e8re opportun du contr\u00f4le judiciaire dans les circonstances. Bref, la question ne consiste pas simplement \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si quelque autre recours est ad\u00e9quat, mais \u00e9galement s\u2019il convient de recourir au contr\u00f4le judiciaire. En d\u00e9finitive, cela requiert une analyse du type de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des inconv\u00e9nients : Khosa, par. 36; TeleZone, par. 56. Comme l\u2019a dit le juge en chef Dickson au nom de la Cour : \u00ab Se demander si l\u2019autre recours disponible est appropri\u00e9 \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 examiner l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 d\u2019exercer le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d\u2019accorder le contr\u00f4le judiciaire recherch\u00e9. C\u2019est aux tribunaux qu\u2019il appartient d\u2019identifier et de mettre en \u00e9quilibre les facteurs applicables . . . \u00bb [Ministre de l\u2019\u00c9nergie, des Mines et des Ressources], p. 96. [Je souligne.]\n[65] Les deux intim\u00e9s ont plaid\u00e9 que la r\u00e9vision judiciaire n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un recours appropri\u00e9 dans les circonstances, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur \u00e9tait de [traduction] \u00ab simplifier le processus de r\u00e8glement des diff\u00e9rends et de r\u00e9duire les co\u00fbts \u00bb (m.i., TD Assurance, par. 61). Avec \u00e9gards, je dois exprimer mon d\u00e9saccord. L\u2019utilisation \u00e9conomique des ressources judiciaires est une pr\u00e9occupation l\u00e9gitime. Toutefois, cette pr\u00e9occupation est pond\u00e9r\u00e9e par la consid\u00e9ration qui consiste \u00e0 veiller \u00e0 ce que les justiciables dont les int\u00e9r\u00eats d\u00e9pendent de d\u00e9cisions prises par un titulaire de pouvoirs d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s par une loi disposent d\u2019un moyen utile et ad\u00e9quat de contester les d\u00e9cisions qui, consid\u00e8rent-ils, sont d\u00e9raisonnables sur le plan de leur substance et de leur justification, ou ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises d\u2019une mani\u00e8re in\u00e9quitable sur le plan de la proc\u00e9dure.\n[66] En cons\u00e9quence, dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, les aspects de la d\u00e9cision sur le r\u00e9examen qui ne sont pas vis\u00e9s par le droit d\u2019appel limit\u00e9 devraient \u00eatre r\u00e9vis\u00e9s judiciairement.\n[67] Je vais maintenant examiner la question de savoir si la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019arbitre du TAMP \u00e9tait raisonnable.\nD. La d\u00e9cision de l\u2019arbitre du TAMP \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable\n[68] En janvier 2011, Mme Yatar a re\u00e7u de l\u2019assureur une lettre l\u2019avisant qu\u2019elle ne recevrait plus d\u2019IRR ni d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour travaux m\u00e9nagers et travaux d\u2019entretien du domicile, au motif qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de certificat d\u2019invalidit\u00e9. Un formulaire de r\u00e8glement des diff\u00e9rends \u00e9tait joint \u00e0 la lettre.\n[69] Madame Yatar a fourni le certificat d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 demand\u00e9 et, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la lettre qu\u2019elle a re\u00e7ue de l\u2019assureur en f\u00e9vrier 2011, ses IRR ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9tablies, mais celles visant les travaux m\u00e9nagers et les travaux d\u2019entretien du domicile lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9es. \u00c0 la suite d\u2019un autre examen m\u00e9dical, l\u2019assureur a refus\u00e9 de verser d\u2019autres IRR, comme cela \u00e9tait indiqu\u00e9 dans la lettre de septembre 2011.\n[70] Madame Yatar soutient que les lettres de f\u00e9vrier et de septembre 2011 ne sont pas des refus valides, parce qu\u2019aucun formulaire de r\u00e8glement des diff\u00e9rends n\u2019y \u00e9tait joint. Bien que l\u2019arbitre du TAMP soit lui aussi arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 cette conclusion, Mme Yatar affirme qu\u2019il a fait erreur en concluant que la lettre de janvier constituait un refus valide.\n[71] Suivant l\u2019arr\u00eat Vavilov, deux cat\u00e9gories de lacunes peuvent rendre une d\u00e9cision d\u00e9raisonnable : premi\u00e8rement, un \u00ab manque de logique interne du raisonnement \u00bb et, deuxi\u00e8mement, la pr\u00e9sence \u00ab d\u2019une d\u00e9cision ind\u00e9fendable sous certains rapports compte tenu des contraintes factuelles et juridiques pertinentes qui ont une incidence sur la d\u00e9cision \u00bb (par. 101). Il faut \u00ab consid\u00e9rer comme un tout \u00bb la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019arbitre du TAMP sur le r\u00e9examen \u00ab et s\u2019abstenir de faire une chasse au tr\u00e9sor, phrase par phrase, \u00e0 la recherche d\u2019une erreur \u00bb (Syndicat canadien des communications, de l\u2019\u00e9nergie et du papier, section locale 30 c. P\u00e2tes & Papier Irving, Lt\u00e9e, 2013 CSC 34, [2013] 2 R.C.S. 458, par. 54).\n[72] L\u2019arbitre du TAMP s\u2019est fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019arr\u00eat Smith c. Co\u2011operators, et il a conclu de l\u2019affidavit produit par Mme Yatar qu\u2019il y avait eu [traduction] \u00ab acceptation implicite des refus qui avaient pris effet le 4 janvier 2011 \u00bb (d\u00e9cision sur le r\u00e9examen, par. 15) et que son avocate aurait d\u00fb conna\u00eetre le d\u00e9lai de prescription de deux ans, mais que rien n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait pour prot\u00e9ger les droits de Mme Yatar.\n[73] \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, tant l\u2019al. 281.1(2)b) de la Loi sur les assurances que le par. 51(2) de l\u2019AIAL pr\u00e9cisaient que le d\u00e9lai de prescription \u00e9tait prolong\u00e9 de 90 jours apr\u00e8s la remise du rapport du m\u00e9diateur. L\u2019arbitre du TAMP a pris en compte le fait que Mme Yatar a commenc\u00e9 le processus de m\u00e9diation apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u la lettre de septembre. L\u2019arbitre a pris en consid\u00e9ration les lettres ainsi que le processus de m\u00e9diation, et il a conclu que [traduction] \u00ab [l]e d\u00e9lai de prescription avait expir\u00e9 le 14 avril 2014, au terme de la p\u00e9riode de prolongation de quatre\u2011vingt\u2011dix jours pr\u00e9vue par la loi \u00e0 la suite du rapport du m\u00e9diateur \u00bb (d\u00e9cision pr\u00e9liminaire, par. 26, conf. par la d\u00e9cision sur le r\u00e9examen, par. 17).\n[74] Cependant, l\u2019arbitre du TAMP a omis de consid\u00e9rer l\u2019effet du r\u00e9tablissement des IRR entre f\u00e9vrier et septembre. L\u2019arbitre n\u2019a pas pris en compte les d\u00e9cisions ant\u00e9rieures du tribunal administratif, dont certaines avaient jug\u00e9 que, dans les cas o\u00f9 il y a r\u00e9tablissement des indemnit\u00e9s d\u2019un demandeur, le d\u00e9lai de prescription peut uniquement \u00eatre d\u00e9clench\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019il est une fois de plus mis fin valablement au versement des indemnit\u00e9s (voir Veldhuizen c. Coseco Insurance Co., 1995 ONICDRG 144 (CanLII); Rudnicki c. Certas Direct Insurance Co., 2001 ONFSCDRS 60 (CanLII)).\n[75] Il n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9 que Mme Yatar a demand\u00e9 la m\u00e9diation en septembre 2012. La m\u00e9diation s\u2019est d\u00e9roul\u00e9e entre le 18 juin 2013 et le 14 janvier 2014. Le 14 janvier 2014, le m\u00e9diateur a remis son rapport. Toutefois, l\u2019al. 281.1(2)b) de la Loi sur les assurances et le par. 51(2) de l\u2019AIAL (tels qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient r\u00e9dig\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque) ne d\u00e9clenchent pas un d\u00e9lai de prescription de 90 jours commen\u00e7ant \u00e0 courir \u00e0 partir de la remise du rapport du m\u00e9diateur. Ces dispositions pr\u00e9voient plut\u00f4t une prolongation du d\u00e9lai de prescription de deux ans, \u00e0 partir du moment o\u00f9 le m\u00e9diateur remet son rapport. En d\u2019autres mots, il est possible de soutenir qu\u2019un refus valable des IRR continuait d\u2019\u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire pour d\u00e9clencher le compte \u00e0 rebours. Je n\u2019entends pas trancher cette question; cela revient au TAMP.\n[76] L\u2019arbitre du TAMP a omis de tenir compte de contraintes l\u00e9gales pertinentes. \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de cela, sa d\u00e9cision est d\u00e9raisonnable.\nVII. Conclusion\n[77] Le pourvoi est accueilli. Ayant conclu que la d\u00e9cision sur le r\u00e9examen est d\u00e9raisonnable, je renvoie l\u2019affaire \u00e0 l\u2019arbitre du TAMP pour qu\u2019il examine la question des effets du r\u00e9tablissement des indemnit\u00e9s sur la validit\u00e9 du refus initial et, en cons\u00e9quence, sur le d\u00e9lai de prescription.\n[78] Comme Mme Yatar a eu gain de cause \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la question jurisprudentielle concernant l\u2019exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la r\u00e9vision judiciaire lorsqu\u2019il existe un droit d\u2019appel limit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vu par la loi, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la r\u00e9vision judiciaire, elle a droit \u00e0 ses d\u00e9pens devant notre Cour et devant les cours inf\u00e9rieures, payables par TD Assurance.\nPourvoi accueilli avec d\u00e9pens.\nProcureurs de l\u2019appelant : Dewart Gleason, Toronto.\nProcureurs de l\u2019intim\u00e9e TD Assurance Meloche Monnex : McCarthy T\u00e9trault, Toronto.\nProcureur de l\u2019intim\u00e9 le Tribunal d\u2019appel en mati\u00e8re de permis : Tribunaux d\u00e9cisionnels Ontario \u2014 Unit\u00e9 des services juridiques, Toronto.\nProcureurs de l\u2019intervenant le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada : Minist\u00e8re de la Justice du Canada \u2014 Bureau r\u00e9gional de l\u2019Ontario, Secteur national du contentieux, Toronto; Minist\u00e8re de la Justice du Canada \u2014 Bureau r\u00e9gional du Qu\u00e9bec, Secteur national du contentieux, Montr\u00e9al.\nProcureur de l\u2019intervenant le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l\u2019Ontario : Minist\u00e8re du Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u2014 Bureau des avocats de la Couronne \u2014 Droit civil, Toronto.\nProcureur de l\u2019intervenant le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Qu\u00e9bec : Minist\u00e8re de la Justice du Qu\u00e9bec, Qu\u00e9bec.\nProcureur de l\u2019intervenant le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Colombie-Britannique : Ministry of the Attorney General, Legal Services Branch, Vancouver.\nProcureur de l\u2019intervenant le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l\u2019Alberta : Alberta Justice, Legal Services Division \u2014 Constitutional and Aboriginal Law Team, Edmonton.\nProcureur de l\u2019intervenant le Centre d\u2019action pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du revenu : Centre d\u2019action pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du revenu, Toronto; Clinic Resource Office \u2014 Legal Aid Ontario, Toronto.\nProcureur de l\u2019intervenant le Centre ontarien de d\u00e9fense des droits des locataires : Centre ontarien de d\u00e9fense des droits des locataires, Toronto.\nProcureur de l\u2019intervenante l\u2019Association canadienne des t\u00e9l\u00e9communications : Paul Daly Law, Ottawa.\nProcureurs de l\u2019intervenant le Bureau d\u2019assurance du Canada : Lenczner Slaght, Toronto.\nProcureurs de l\u2019intervenant Forest Appeals Commission : Arvay Finlay, Victoria.\nProcureur des intervenants Aboriginal Council of Winnipeg, Inc. et Social Planning Council of Winnipeg : Centre juridique d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public, Winnipeg.\n[1] L\u2019expression \u00ab r\u00e9vision judiciaire \u00bb est utilis\u00e9e dans la Loi sur la proc\u00e9dure de r\u00e9vision judiciaire, L.R.O. 1990, c.
