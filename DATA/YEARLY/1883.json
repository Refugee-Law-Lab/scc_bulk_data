Henderson ([1]); Mutchmor v. Davis ([2]); Barnes v. Boomer ([3]); Lawrence v. Pomeryo (1); Boulton v. Jeffreys (2); Cosgrave v. Corbett (3); Henderson v. Westover ([4]); Dougall v. Lang ([5]); Proctor v. Grant ([6]); Martyn v. Kennedy ( ([7]); Stevens v. Cook ([8]); and Attorney-General v. McNulty ([9]).\nRITCHIE, C.J.:\u2014\nThis is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench for Manitoba. The bill of complaint alleges that William Guy Livingstone, of Boyne River Settlement:\n\u201c1. On the eighteenth day of February, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-nine, the defendant Farmer commenced an action of ejectment in this honorable court against the plaintiff to recover possession of the south-west quarter of section thirty in the sixth township in the fourth range west of the principal meridian in the Province of Manitoba in the Dominion of Canada, containing by admeasurement one hundred and fifty-seven and forty-four one-hundredths acres, be the same more or less, of which the plaintiff was then and still is in lawful possession, and claiming title thereto under and by virtue of a patent from the Crown to the defendant Farmer, dated the twelfth day of December, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-eight.\n\u201c2. The said action was decided in this honorable court in favor of the plaintiff, but upon an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, it was there held the defendant Farmer had under his patent a legal right to the said land, and that the equities of the defendant herein after set forth to displace and invalidate the same, could not be set up by way of defence to the said action of ejectment, but that independent proceedings would have to be taken to assist the said equities.\n\u201c3. By reason of the said decision of the Supreme Court, the plaintiff is in danger of being ejected from the said land by the defendant Farmer, and will be so ejected unless this honorable court restrains the further prosecution of the said action until the determination of this suit.\nAnd his prayer is: \u201c1. The plaintiff therefore prays that it may be declared that the said defendant Farmer is not entitled further to prosecute his said action by reason of his being patentee of the said lands; 2. That it may be declared that the defendant Farmer procured the issue of the said patent to himself unconscionably, and in derogation of the plaintiff\u2019s right to homestead the said lands, or that it might be declared that the said patent was issued improvidently, and in ignorance of the plaintiff\u2019s right in the premises, and that the defendant Farmer holds the said lands as trustee for the plaintiff.\nThe suit then seeks two things: first, that Farmer may be restrained from further prosecuting his ejectment suit by reason of being patentee of the lands; secondly, that it may be declared Farmer obtained the patent unconscionably and in derogation of plaintiffs right to homestead the lands, and that Farmer holds lands as trustee for plaintiff, or that the patent be set aside.\nThe grounds of demurrer set forth by the defendant are: That the plaintiff hath not in his bill shown any interest in or right to the lands therein mentioned, or any title to attack the patent of the defendant Farmer and therefore he hath not by his said bill made and stated such a case as entitled him in a court of equity to any relief against the defendant Farmer as to the matters contained in the said bill or any of the said matters.\nAs to enjoining the further prosecution of the ejectment suit, we all know that the simplest and most generally accepted test in determining whether one is a proper party complainant to a bill for an injunction, is whether he possesses a legal or equitable interest in the subject-matter in controversy. And it is equally clear that rights arising under Acts of Parliament are legal rights, and must be dealt with by courts according to ordinary rules and principles.\nIn the bill in this case, I find the plaintiff makes a great many statements impeaching the defendant\u2019s rights in the land, and his dealings with the Crown in respect thereof, but he carefully avoids any allegation that in pursuance of the statute 35 Vict. ch. 23, he was ever entered or permitted to be entered for the lands in question with a view of securing a homestead right therein, either in the book or records of the local land department of the Government, or in any other book, or in any other way or manner whatsoever; but on the contrary, by section 7, the most that can be gathered from plaintiff\u2019s allegations is, that his application, affidavit, and office fee of $10 Were lying in the office in the hands of the said land agent, with whom the defendant pretends he made the contract of purchase. Until he was so entered or was permitted to enter the land, he had no homestead, interest in, or claim to the land, and until all the provisions of the act had been complied with, he had no legal or equitable title, and the lands remained public lands of the government, and, in my opinion, his bill does not show any legal or equitable status, under the statute, capable of being enforced in a court of law or equity.\nThe lands until the provisions of the statute had been complied with, and such an entry was permitted to be made, were unappropriated Dominion lands, of which, as such, the Crown had the right of disposing, and which they did dispose of, as the bill alleges, to the defendant, for a valuable consideration paid by the defendant and received by the crown; the plaintiff then showing no statutory or other right or interest therein how is it possible he can be permitted to interfere between the crown and the defendant in respect of such sale?\nThe learned Chief Justice says:\nThe evidence of the plaintiff discloses at least a moral wrong done him, a prejudice, a grievance.\nNow courts of law do not sit to redress moral wrongs, unless the moral is accompanied by a legal wrong, such as a court of law or equity can recognize.\nAny mere moral wrongs invading no legal or equitable rights recognized by law must be left to be disposed of in foro conscientic\u00e6. Before a defendant in an action at law can ask a court of equity to stay the execution on a judgment regularly and properly obtained in a court of law, he must have rights in the legal sense of that term. On this short ground I think the judgment of Mr. Justice Miller was right.\nTo declare this patent void, would be to interfere with and destroy the contract made by and between the Crown and the purchaser of Crown lands, it would in effect be determining that the Crown had no right to dispose of unappropriated Crown lands by permitting parties having no interest in or right to the land to interfere with the Crown dealing with the Crown estate and its grantees, and so destroy a sale, of which neither of the contracting parties complain, the letters patent of the Crown, and the title conveyed by the Crown for valuable consideration, and thus break up an arrangement with which, so far as the bill shows, the Crown is in no way dissatisfied and has never impeached, and for reasons of alleged impositions on the Crown, of which the Crown makes no complaint, thus leaving the purchase-money in the hands of the Crown, and at the same time revesting the legal title of the lands sold and paid for in the Crown. If a party has no legal or equitable rights enforceable in a court of law or equity, he cannot, in the eye of the law, be injured by the letters patent. He is a mere volunteer, and if so, not a proper party to seek the relief sought by this bill. He must show a title to the relief asked. This disposes of any right to an injunction.\nBut the plaintiff invokes the 35 Vict., ch. 23, s. 69, and asks to have this patent declared void.\nThis section enacts that\u2014\nIn all cases wherein patents for lands have issued through fraud or in error or improvidence, any court having competent jurisdiction in cases respecting real property in the Province or place where such are situate, may, upon action, bill or plaint respecting such lands, and upon hearing of the parties interested, or upon default of the said parties after such notice of proceeding as the said court shall order, decree such patent to be void, and upon the registry of such decree in the office of the Registrar-General of the Dominion, such patent shall be void to all intents.\nBut the same reason that prevents his obtaining an injunction equally applies, in my opinion, to his impeaching the patent. If plaintiff never acquired any interest in the land, what locus standi has he to maintain an action, bill or plaint, either in a court of law or equity having competent jurisdiction in cases respecting real property, and if no locus standi to sustain an action, what locus standi to impeach under this statute the issue of a patent in respect thereof. It is only in an action, bill or plaint respecting such lands that the patent can, under this statute, be impeached. How can a party sustain an action, bill or plaint respecting such lands, unless he has a right or interest therein, which a court of law or equity can recognize. If a plaintiff brings a suit, whether at law or equity, and does not show on the face of his declaration or bill a legal or equitable cause of action, he may be met at the outset by a demurrer, and I am at a loss to conceive the practitioner bold enough to urge on the court that though he has no legal or equitable claim that a court of law or equity can recognize, he has a moral claim which he chooses to designate \u201ca grievance\u201d or 11 \u201ca prejudice,\u201d and therefore can maintain his action. I am therefore of opinion that to enable a party to take proceedings under this act, he should have some legal or equitable status in connection with the land; that is to say, some interest therein or right thereto enforceable at law or in equity, and that it is only for the protection of such rights or interests, that a party can invoke the aid of a court of justice to repeal, under the statute, letters patent issued by the Crown in reference to Crown property.\nI have looked through the cases relied on in the judgment of the court and by the counsel at the bar, but it appears to me that many of them are distinguishable and all can be reconciled with this doctrine, except those which recognize an interest under the established and recognized usage and practice of the lands department of Ontario, which apply only to that Province, and do not apply to the Province of Manitoba, where no such usage or practice exists.\nIn this view, it is not necessary to decide how far the court can look at the record in the ejectment suit, but I think it right to say, that while I admit to the fullest extent the principle that by demurring the defendant, for the purposes of the argument, admits all the matters of fact stated in the bill, as at present advised, I am not prepared to admit that, in a case like this, in which the judgment of this court is sought to be enjoined, and the bill refers to that judgment, and bases the right to succeed thereon as is set out in the 2nd and 3rd paragraphs of the bill ([10]): when, in truth and in fact, the court never decided that the defendant had any \u201cequities\u201d nor \u201cthat independent proceedings\u201d would have to be taken to assist said equities, a majority of the court having unequivocally decided that the defendant had shown no legal or equitable title to the lands in question, this court is debarred from looking at its own record and judgment, but on the contrary, that by such an allegation it is so far virtually in possession of the suit sought to be enjoined and of its own judgment and proceedings thereon as to take judicial notice of such record and judgment to enable it to say whether or not, the present plaintiff is entitled to the relief he seeks as against such judgment. That when called on to stay the execution of one of its own judgments, it has from necessity the right to take judicial notice of its own records and proceedings, and is officially bound to take notice that the allegations referred to are incorrect and the contrary the fact. But in the view I take of this case, there is no necessity of looking at the record, except to negative the strong observations that have been made with reference to what are called the equities of the plaintiff, and to show that all the statements in his bill are directly at variance with the facts as disclosed by letters and documents under his own hand and the official documents of the land department.\nThe ejectment suit was brought for the lands in question, plaintiff claiming title under letters patent granting to him said lands, dated 12th December, 1878.\nThe defendant defended for the whole of the lands in question. In answer to the action of the plaintiff, the defendant, on legal and equitable grounds, says as follows:\u2014\n1. The defendant as against the plaintiff is entitled to the possession of the lands in question, under and by virtue of his homestead entry thereof, made in the month of May, 1875, under 35 Vic. ch. 23, sec. 33 of the Statutes of Canada.\n2. The alleged purchase by the plaintiff from the Crown of the lands in question, on or about the fifth day of June, 1875, was directly contrary to the express provisions of 35 Vic. ch. 23, sec. 33, and the sub-sections thereof; and the subsequent issue to him from the Crown of the patent for the same lands, in pursuance of the said contract of purchase, was, and is, as against the defendant, fraudulent and void ; and the same was issued through fraud, error or improvidence.\n3. The plaintiff did not, on the eighth day of April, 1874, or at any other time, in good faith, make a homestead entry of the north-west quarter of section thirty, in township six, range four west,\u201d for the purpose of securing a homestead right in respect thereof,\u201d and \u201c for his exclusive use and benefit,\u201d and \u201cfor the purpose of actual settlement \u201c within the true intent and meaning of the Public Lands Act of Canada\u2014nor did he on the fifteenth day of February, 1875, or at any time, bond fide and according to the true intent and meaning of the statute in that behalf, pre-empt the south-west quarter of section thirty, township six, range four west, under and by virtue of the alleged homestead entry aforesaid; and defendant charges that both the said alleged entries were at the time they were made, and were before, and at the time he, the defendant, made his said homestead entry, in the first paragraph of this, his answer mentioned, void, and of no effect, and had, under the operation of 35 Vic., ch. 23, sub-sec. 14, of sec. 33, become, and were forfeited, and the lands in question in this cause had become, and were \u201cunappropriated Dominion lands,\u201d and were at the time the defendant so made his homestead entry, as aforesaid, subject, on application, to be entered by any eligible, person \u201c for the purpose of securing a homestead right in respect thereof and the defendant avers that the said lands so being open to be homesteaded as aforesaid, he duly homesteaded the same accordingly ; and immediately went into actual possession and cultivation thereof, and has ever since remained in such actual possession and cultivation thereof, and has made large and extensive improvements thereon, and he is now with his family in such actual possession and cultivation.\n4. By way of laying the foundation of cross relief, the defendant, in addition to the grounds mentioned in the preceding three paragraphs, states and shows to the court here that the alleged contract of purchase of the lands in question between the Crown and the plaintiff, in pursuance of which the patent for the same lands was granted to the plaintiff, and under which the plaintiff seeks in this cause to recover possession of the same from the defendant, was made by the Crown in ignorance and misapprehension of material facts affecting t the right of the defendant, and in violation of the statute and contrary to the custom and usage of the Crown Lands Department and in fraud of the defendant, and the defendant submits that the said letters patent should be declared void ; and the defendant prays, that the said letters patent may, under the provisions of 35 Vic., ch. 23, sec. 89, be decreed to be void, for haying been issued through fraud, or in error or improvidence.\nThe plaintiff took issue on the answer of the defendant, and denied that he was on the facts or in law entitled to the relief he prays.\nThis case was without objection fully investigated in the court below, and all the facts alleged either as affording a legal or equitable defence fully gone into and adjudicated on without any objection or question being raised as to the mode of procedure, and the court of Manitoba decided defendant had made out an equitable defence.\nOn this case coming before this court on appeal, all the merits of the case were gone into as before the court of first instance, and it was held that the plaintiff had shown no right or title to the land in question, either at law or equity; the right of the plaintiff to the land was sustained, and judgment reversed.\nIn my opinion no other conclusion could have been arrived al, for the defendant did not show that he had any legal or equitable defence to the action independent of the statute, and he did not show any legal title or equitable interest in the land under any statutory provision. He had never been permitted to enter, was not in possession under the statute, nor had he any statutory right of possession nor any parliamentary title to, interest in or right to the possession, of the land. On the contrary, the facts as they appeared in the first case showed that the Crown, after fully considering the conflicting claims of plaintiff and defendant, refused to entertain the defendant\u2019s (the now plaintiff\u2019s) application and to enter him as a homestead claimant on the lot, refused to keep his money and refused to give him a receipt therefor under the provisions of the act, but returned the same to him, and after exercising its judgment and discretion on a full knowledge of all the circumstances, deliberately sold the property to the defendant, received the consideration money, caused the patent to issue to the defendant, and so it was clearly established, to my mind at any rate, that the patent for the lands was not issued through fraud or in error, or improvidence, but on the contrary, on and after the fullest and most deliberate consideration with a full and perfect knowledge of the position of the said lands and the rights of all parties connected therewith or claiming to be interested therein.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nThis appeal, being from an order overruling a demurrer, we are confined entirely to the facts as stated on the face of the bill. The allegations of the bill are sufficient to show that the appellant had forfeited any pre-emption right which he might have had to the lands in question, and that he cannot ascribe his right to the patent to any equitable or statutory title arising at a date earlier than that of the day on which the patent itself was issued. The important question, however, is whether the respondent shows any title to impeach the patent.\nThe allegations of the bill, material to be considered in this respect, are contained in the 6th paragraph, which is in the following words:\nPrior to the 1st of May, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-five, the plaintiff made application to homestead the said lands in question herein, and procured proper affidavits according to the statute, whereby he proved to the satisfaction of the Dominion Lands Agent in that behalf (and the plaintiff charges the same to be true), that the said defendant Farmer had never settled on or improved the said lands assumed to be homesteaded by him or the land herein in question, but had been absent therefrom continuously since his pretended homesteading and pre emption entries, and thereupon the claim of the defendant Farmer, under the said entries, became and were forthwith forfeited, and any pretended rights of the defendant Farmer thereunder ceased, and the plaintiff thereupon, on or about the 8th day of May, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-five, and then and there with the assent and by the direction of the Dominion Lands Agent, who caused the same to be prepared for the plaintiff, signed an application for a homestead right to the lands in question in this suit according to Form \u201cA,\u201d mentioned in thirty-fifth Victoria, chapter twenty-three, section thirty-three, and did make and swear to an affidavit according to Form \u201c B \u201c mentioned in section thirty-three, sub-section seven of the same Act, and did pay to the same agent the homestead fee of ten dollars, who accepted and received the same as the homestead fee, and thereupon the plaintiff was informed that he had done all that was necessary or required for him to do under the statute and the regulations of the department, and that the statute said (thirty-fifth Victoria, chapter twenty-three, section thirty-three, sub-section eight): \u201cUpon making this affidavit and filing it, and upon payment of an office fee of ten dollars (for which he shall receive a receipt from the agent) he should be permitted to enter the lands specified in the application,\u201d and thereupon and in pursuance thereof, and in good faith the plaintiff did forthwith enter upon said lands and take actual possession thereof, and has ever since remained in actual occupation thereof, and has erected a house and other buildings thereon, cleared a large portion of said lands and fenced and cultivated the same, and made many other valuable improvements thereon, costing in the aggregate one thousand dollars.\nBy the common law, \u201c if a Crown grant prejudiced or affected the rights of third persons, the king was by law bound on proper petition to him to allow a subject to use his royal name to repeal it, on a scire facias, and it is said that in such a case the party may upon enrolment of the grant in Chancery have a scire facias to repeal it as well as the king\u201d ([11]). The 69th sec. of the Dominion Lands Act, 35 Vic., c. 23, provides a new remedy for the subject prejudiced by a grant from the Crown issued through fraud, error, or improvidence. That section is in these words:\n[The learned judge then read section 69 (1).]\nIt is under this clause of the statute that the bill in the present case has been filed.\nIt will be observed that this section says nothing as to the title required to authorize a party to institute an action under its provisions. It must, however, be assumed that no one but a person having a title, or being interested in the subject of the grant, is entitled to attack the patent, as it never could have been intended to enable a stranger to take such a proceeding. The statute merely gives anew remedy for the old common law right, and a third person proceeding under it to set aside a patent must therefore show precisely the same title as was required to maintain a scire facias in the name of the subject, namely, that he had rights in the subject of the grant which have been prejudiced and affected by the patent. We have therefore to consider whether the plaintiff in the present case shows by his bill that he had any right or title to the land in question. The statements in the bill, showing the plaintiff\u2019s title, are to be found in the allegations of the sixth paragraph which I have before extracted.\nFrom this it appears that the only foundation for this suit is the filing of an application for a homestead right in the form prescribed by Schedule A of the Dominion Lands Act, supported by the required affidavit and the payment of the office fee of $10, and the plaintiff\u2019s subsequent unauthorized possession of the lands as a squatter and the improvements he has made.\nIt is not alleged that any entry of a homestead right in the lands in question was ever made in the plaintiffs name, nor in the words of the statute that he was \u201cpermitted to enter the lands specified in the application,\u201d nor that he was authorized by the crown or its officers to take possession. The provisions of the act relating to homestead entries, when made by persons applying as the plaintiff did, are contained in sub-sees. 7 and 8 of sec. 33, and are as follows:\nA person applying for leave to be entered for lands, with a view of securing a homestead right therein, shall make affidavit before the local agent (Form B) that he is over twenty-one years of age, that he has not previously obtained a homestead under the provisions of this act, that to the best of his knowledge and belief there is no person residing on the land in question, or entitled to enter the same as a homestead, and that the application is made for his exclusive use and benefit and for the purpose of actual settlement.\nUpon making this affidavit and filing it with the local agent, and on payment to him of an office fee of ten dollars, for which he shall receive a receipt from the agent, he shall be permitted to enter the land specified in the application.\nIt must altogether depend on the construction to be given to these provisions, whether or not the plaintiff has shown a sufficient title to maintain his bill. It is contended in support of the bill, that the words \u201c shall be permitted to enter the lands specified in the application,\u201d give the party, who files an application and affidavit and pays the fee, an absolute right to be entered on the books of the land office as having a homestead right to the lands applied for, and therefore the want of an actual entry is immaterial, since the agent was bound to make the entry and had no option to refuse to do so. I do not accede to this proposition. \u201cWhether the agent was or was not bound to make the entry, the statute clearly confers no right on the homestead applicant until the entry is actually made. Even if the words \u201cshall be permitted to enter \u201c were to be construed as imperative on the agent, so as to leave him no discretion to refuse the entry, I should still be of opinion that no right in the land was required until the entry was actually made. The very form of the application which, in the words of the seventh sub-section, is to be \u201cfor leave to be entered for lands with a view of securing a homestead right therein,\u201d imply that no homestead right is to be acquired until the entry is actually made, and leave to be entered has been accorded by the agent. The words of the eighth sub-section \u201cshall be permitted to enter,\u201d also show that the filing the application and affidavit and payment of the fee are not to be considered as sufficient to give a title, but that the assent of the Crown, through the agent, is indispensable for the purpose. If the statute had intended that any person should acquire a homestead right by merely doing what the plaintiff alleges he did, it would have so provided, and the additional requirement of entry would not have been superadded. If it was the duty of the agent to make the entry upon the papers being filed and the fee paid, and nothing appearing to contradict the facts required to be sworn to in the affidavit, it might be that an action would lie for his refusal to complete the entry. I am, however, of opinion that the statute does not exclude all discretion of the agent. An application for leave to be entered implies that leave has to be given\u2014this leave has to be given, by the agent and must involve the exercise of judgment and discretion on the part of the officer. Surely it would be out of the question to say that, if the agent knew that there was a prior application for the lands by a person who had applied, but had not been entered, for a homestead right, but whose application was in suspense, he would merely, on the applicant\u2019s affidavit to the contrary, be bound to authorize the entry last applied for; and yet, if the construction contended for on the plaintiffs behalf was to prevail, we should have to hold that, even with such a fact within the knowledge of the agent, he would be bound to make the entry. I think the words \u201cshall be permitted to enter\u201d are not to be construed in favor of the applicant as imperative. They are directions to a public officer as to the performance of his duty, and as such, even if that construction was not borne out, as it clearly is by the context, I should construe them as not conferring any right on third parties. A late writer on the principles of statutory construction ([12]) states the result of decisions which warrant this conclusion in these words:\nWhen the prescriptions of a statute relate to the performance of a public duty, they seem to be generally understood to be merely instructions for the guidance and government of those on whom the duty is imposed, or directory only. The neglect of them may be punishable indeed, but it does not affect the validity of the act done in disregard of them.\nAnd he adds:\nIt is no impediment to this construction that there is no remedy for non-compliance with the direction.\nTo hold otherwise would be to determine that the effect of the statute would be to enable parties to acquire the lands of the Crown without its assent, and even in direct opposition to the desire of the Crown to retain particular parcels of lands for public uses. To warrant a construction which would thus authorize an expropriation of crown lands adverse to the public interests and requirements nothing short of an explicit enactment by the legislature could possibly be sufficient, and no such express words are to be found in this statute.\nThere remains to be considered what effect is to be given to the allegation in the 6th section: that the plaintiff, after filing his application, entered into possession and made improvements. It has already been observed that it is not alleged that he was authorized to take possession by the agent, or by any one having authority so to do on behalf of the Crown. Sub-sec. 5 of the 33 Vic. seems, however, to recognize a preferable right on the part of squatters who have made improvements to make a homestead entry; and this is further countenanced by the terms of the affidavit required under sub-sec. 7 for a homestead entry by a non-occupant. I cannot, however, agree that sub-sec. 5 recognizes any actual right or title upon entry in a squatter who has made improvements. Upon the principles already indicated as applicable to the construction of sub-sec, it seems to be very clear, that although sub-sec. 5 does concede a preference to a person who has entered and improved, when claiming a right to a homestead entry in competition with a person who has not been in occupation, yet no right or title to the lands arises until the actual entry is made by the agent, and that the Crown is not so far bound as to exclude all discretion on the part of its officers in granting or withholding a homestead entry to a squatter.\nFurther, the bill does not show that the patent was issued by the Crown in ignorance of the plaintiff\u2019s possession and improvements. It does not therefore show that there was error or improvidence in this respect. It has been well settled by numerous decisions in Ontario in suits instituted under a provision similar to that of the statute now in question, that when the Crown has issued the letters patent in view of all the facts, the grant is conclusive, and a party cannot, as it is said, set up equities behind the patent.\nNow, in the present case there is no sufficient allegation to show that the patent was issued by the Crown in ignorance of the facts of plaintiff\u2019s possession and improvements. It is true it is stated generally in the bill that the patent was issued in ignorance of his rights, but this allegation cannot, on the general rules applicable to equity pleadings, be construed as a sufficient allegation that the Crown was ignorant of the facts of the plaintiff\u2019s possession and improvements. There is, of course, no pretence for saying that the Ontario decisions, which proceed on the practice prevailing in the Grown Lands Department of that Province, and which also prevailed in the late Province of Canada, of recognizing a right of pre-emption in squatters, can have any application here. It is not alleged in the bill that any such practice prevails in the Dominion Lands Department, and the Ontario cases in which patents have been set aside for non-disclosure of possession and improvements all proceed on the practice referred to, which, it has been expressly decided, must be distinctly averred in the bill.\nI am of opinion that the appeal must be allowed, and that the order over-ruling the demurrer must be vacated in the court below, and an order allowing the demurrer entered in lieu thereof, with costs to the appellant in both courts.\nFOURNIER, J., concurred.\nHENEY, J.\u2014\nI do not consider it absolutely necessary, in the view I take of this case, to determine whether under the bill of the respondent, if it were the original proceeding in this suit, he could seek the relief prayed for. The first paragraph of it refers to the ejectment suit brought against him by the appellant to recover the possession \u201cof the land in question herein, which came to this court by appeal and in which this court gave judgment in June, 1880, for the present appellant.\nReferring to that action, the respondent, in the second paragraph of his bill, alleges:\nThat said action was decided in this honorable court in favor of the plaintiff, but upon an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada it was there held the defendant Farmer had under his patent a legal right to the said land, and that the equities of the defendant set forth to displace and invalidate the same could not be set up by way of defence to the said action of ejectment, but that independent proceedings would have to be taken to assert the said equities.\nIn the third paragraph the respondent alleges that he was in danger of being ejected from the land in question in the action of ejectment, and that he would be, unless the court, in which the bill was filed, should restrain the further prosecution of the said action until the determination of the suit.\nThe identity of the subject matter in dispute in the two suits is shown by the bill, and the fact stated that a judgment was given by this court on the appeal in the first action. This court decided that the appellant was entitled to the land in question, that the judgment below should be reversed, and that a verdict and judgment should be entered for him. To prevent that being done, the plaintiff filed his bill in the present suit, and the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench in Manitoba failed to give effect to the judgment of this court, and by injunction interposed to stay it. I have considered that course of procedure, and am of opinion that the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench exceeded its jurisdiction when interposing to prevent the legal consequences of the judgment of this court. And I am the more astonished when it was known to the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench that the respondent in the first case was permitted, rightly or otherwise, to setup and prove as a defence to the action of ejectment all the facts and circumstances upon which his alleged equities rested. On the trial of the action of ejectment, before the late Chief Justice of the Queen\u2019s Bench of Manitoba, an objection was raised to the equitable defence set up. His lordship dealt with that subject, and having decided against the objection, says, in his judgment\u2014 Thereupon the defendant went into evidence exhibiting the principal facts and circumstances connected with and surrounding the history of the lands in question, in so far as the plaintiff and the defendant were concerned.\nThe learned Chief Justice of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench concludes an exhaustive judgment on the facts and circumstances in evidence and the law he alleged as applicable to them, as follows:\nIn every point of view, as it seems to me, as against the defendant, the purchase of the plaintiff fails, and the issue of the patent to him in pursuance of the purchase cannot be upheld. I think the patent must be declared to be void as having been issued in error and mistake.\nAn appeal was heard from that verdict and judgment to the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, which appeal was heard by his lordship the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Betournay. Another exhaustive judgment was delivered by his lordship the Chief Justice confirming this previous one, and that was concurred in by Mr. Justice Betournay. It was on an appeal from that judgment that it came before our court. On the argument before us the question of the right of the respondent to plead equitable defences was again raised, and the judgment of four out of the five judges of this court who heard the argument shows that the respondent got the full benefit of the equities he alleged as far as the evidence in the whole case warranted. It shows, too, that the allegations in the second paragraph of the bill, and upon which the respondent sought the interposition of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, were false and unfounded; and I may safely say that the language of the judgment was too plain to create any doubt, and I am free to add that the statement in that paragraph, if made by any intelligent person who read that judgment, must have wilfully misstated it.\nWhether such was the case or not, the fact is patent on the face of the judgment, and must have been apparent to the learned judges of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench. That this court had reversed their judgment on the equitable defence of the respondent did not, however, prevent the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench from reconsidering the case already decided by this court, and our judgment was by the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench reversed and the legal effect of it destroyed. It is true that the bill did not refer to the rebutting evidence of the appellant on the first trial, and if the judgment given by this court, and that of the court appealed from, had not been founded on a consideration of the evidence on both sides, the position of the case might have been wholly different. The judgment of this court being referred to in the bill, we are not only privileged but required also to refer to it, and when in doing so we find the whole case on the equitable defence disposed of, I do not consider we would be justified, as the highest court in the Dominion, in permitting a court of inferior jurisdiction in so direct a manner to reverse it.\nThe judgment of the majority of this court was delivered by our learned Chief Justice, and I will cite from it shortly in proof of the correctness of the position I have taken, as follows ([13]):\nI think it quite unimportant whether a defendant in Manitoba could or could not avail himself of an equitable defence in an ejectment suit, because the plaintiff made out a clear case under a Crown grant, and the defendant did not show that he had any legal or equitable defence to the action ; he did not show any grantor conveyance from the Crown, nor any legal title or equitable interest in the land, under any statutory provisions\u2014in other words, he showed no locus standi enabling him to attack the letters patent, even if they could be impeached in such a proceeding.\nIf the bill had truthfully referred, as it should have done, to the judgment of this court, it would have been patent that our judgment disposed of the whole case on the merits, in which case no court of inferior jurisdiction would have had any right to reverse it as has been done in this case. When that judgment was referred to as it was in the bill, it was, I think, the duty of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench to have looked at and considered it, and when it was plainly shown by it that the whole of the alleged equities of the respondent were adjudicated on and disposed of, the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench should not have, in the most palpable manner as it did, disrespected it. By the judgment lastly appealed from, the two justices of the Queen\u2019s Bench have, in the most marked and direct manner; undertaken to reverse the judgment of this court, and virtually made their court an appellate one from the judgment of this court deliberately and clearly given. If such could be done, it would be in direct violation of the statutes under which this court was established, and it would be a precedent in other cases under which courts of inferior jurisdiction might seek to reverse the decisions of this court. I cannot see either what ultimate benefit it would be to the respondent to have the demurrer disallowed. If, instead of appealing to this court, the appellant had submitted to the last judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, and issues as to the equities alleged in the bill were raised and evidence again taken, and this court were again called upon to decide upon them, the result would certainly be the same. Unless, indeed, the case were materially changed by other evidence as to the locus standi of the respondent, which, from the documentary and other evidence in the action of ejectment, I cannot believe to be possible. Not being able to conceive how the respondent could be benefited by such a course, I am strongly of the opinion, that is for the interests of both parties, that the last judgment of the court below should be reversed. If, however, the position I have taken be not tenable, I think our judgment should be for the appellant on at least one ground.\nThe statutes regulating the disposal of Crown Lands in Manitoba must be taken to control all matters of title under them. One provision requires that before an applicant can have a locus standi which would enable him to obtain a patent, he must pay to the proper departmental office the sum of ten dollars and be entered as such applicant. If he merely pays the required amount of money and he is not so entered, the ground, I take it, remains clear for another applicant to obtain a patent by fully complying with the statutory requirements. I think that is the legal consequence, whether the controlling departmental officer rightly or wrongfully failed to enter an applicant. It would be a grievance, if wrongfully refused, for the government but not a court of law to consider. The first applicant, therefore, failing to comply with such requirements has no sufficient locus standi. I consider the bill in this case defective, because it does not allege that the respondent was so entered as an applicant. It is not necessary for me to express any opinion as to the effect of such an entry, and to decide whether even had it been made the Crown would be legally bound to grant a patent in every case where all the requirements of the statutes had been complied with. That, however, is a question not involved in this case and need not be debated.\nFor the foregoing reasons, I think, the judgment below should be reversed and the demurrer of the appellant allowed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\u2014\nUpon this demurrer we have undoubtedly to take for granted that each and every one of the facts alleged by the plaintiff in his bill of complaint are true; and if they are true, the allegations of the bill seem to sufficiently warrant the judgment appealed from, which overruled the demurrer. I concur fully in the opinion given by my brother Gwynne, and am of opinion with him, and for the reasons given by him, that this appeal should be dismissed.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nIn giving judgment upon this demurrer we can look at nothing but the allegations contained in the bill in the light of the acts of Parliament therein referred to, and we must not criticise its expressions with too much preciseness. Our simple duty is to determine whether, looking at the substance of it, there are any facts stated in it which call for an answer. \u201cWe cannot import into the case anything which may have come to our knowledge in the ejectment suit between the same parties for the same lot of land which not long ago came before us on appeal, least of all any matter in apparent or actual contradiction of any of the averments contained in the bill of complaint now before us, all the material averments in which are by the demurrer admitted to be true upon this record, and must therefore, for the purposes of our judgment herein, be conclusively regarded as true. The question which is raised by the demurrer now before us was not and indeed could not have been in issue, so as to call for judicial decision in that case, which was an action of ejectment brought by the defendant Farmer, and which put in issue solely his legal title. Anything, therefore, which may have been said in that case seemingly decisive of the point now raised must, in my opinion, be considered as extrajudicial, and the question now submitted by this demurrer must be regarded as having been first brought sub judice by the demurrer, and must be treated as jesting wholly upon the sufficiency of the substantial allegation of material facts contained in the bill of complaint.\nNow, the substance of the bill of complaint appears to me to be, that the plaintiff alleges that the defendant Farmer, being a resident upon a large farm of his own, distant about forty miles from the land in question in this suit, and without any bond fide intention of settling on, occupying, or cultivating, the lot adjoining the one in question, or of making it a home for himself and family within the intent and provisions of 35 Vic., ch. 23, but with the view of acquiring it solely for purposes of speculation, made an affidavit as required by the above statute, as if he contemplated occupying the lot as a home, and procured his name to be entered for it as his homestead, but that in total disregard of the intent and provisions of the statute in that behalf he continued to reside upon his farm forty miles off, and never in fact, either by himself or any other person on his behalf, entered into possession or occupation of, or caused any other person to settle upon, cultivate, or improve such lot or any part thereof, but that the same remained wholly unoccupied and unimproved, whereby, according to the provisions of the statute in that behalf, all claim of the said Farmer to such lot upon which he had so fraudulently procured his name to be entered, or to have it treated as his homestead, became lost and forfeited. That after the passing of 37 Vic., ch. 19, the defendant, with the like fraudulent intent of acquiring lands of the Crown in the Province of Manitoba for purposes of speculation, under color and pretence of acquiring them for purposes of settlement within the provisions of the statute in that behalf, in the month of February, 1875, procured his name to be entered for the lot in question in this suit as what is called an interim pre-emption entry, but the plaintiff submits that under the provisions of the statute in that behalf such interim pre-emption entry was not one authorized by the statute, by reason of the defendant having so as aforesaid procured his name to have been entered for the adjoining lot\u201d as a homestead, without any intention of occupying it as such, and of his never having been, as the plaintiff alleges he never was in the actual or constructive possession thereof, and that he never had made any cultivation or improvement thereon. The bill then proceeds to allege, that under these circumstances, and while the lot adjoining to the lot in question in this suit, for which the defendant had procured his name to be entered as and for a homestead, as well as the lot in question in this suit, remained wholly unoccupied, the plaintiff procured proper affidavits to be made in accordance with the provisions of the statute in that behalf, whereby he proved to the satisfaction of the Dominion Lands Agent in that behalf that the defendant never had in fact settled on or improved the said lands, which he had procured to be entered to him for a homestead, nor upon the land in question in this suit, and that he had, under the circumstances, lost all claim to the said lot entered for a homestead, and also to the said lot now in question in this suit; and thereupon and on the 8th May, 1875, the plaintiff, with the consent and by the direction of the Dominion Land\u2019s Agent, made an application in writing which the agent himself prepared for the plaintiff to sign, whereby the plaintiff applied for the lot now in question, as a homestead for his family under the provisions of the statute in that behalf, and paid to the said agent the homestead fee of ten dollars, which the said agent accepted and received from the plaintiff as such homestead fee, and thereupon that the plaintiff; having done all that was required by the statute to be done by him in order to acquire the said lot, as a homestead for himself and family, did forthwith in good faith enter upon the said land, and took actual possession thereof, and erected a house and other buildings thereon, cleared a large portion of said land, and fenced and cultivated the same, and made many other valuable improvements thereon, costing in the aggregate $l,000,and that he has ever since remained in actual occupation thereof; that while the plaintiff was so in occupation of the said land, and after he had made large improvements on the same, of which the defendant Farmer had full knowledge, the defendant procured letters patent to be issued, bearing date the 12th December, 1878, granting to him in fee the said lands so occupied by plaintiff as his homestead, and had brought an action of ejectment therein to evict the plaintiff from the possession thereof; and the bill concludes with the allegation that the Crown issued the said patent to the defendant Farmer improvidently and through error in not being advised of the true facts as hereinbefore set forth\u2014in not being advised of the facts and circumstances surrounding the defendant Farmer\u2019s pretended homesteading the one lot, and his making the pretended interim pre-emption entry of the lands in question, and in not being informed that the plaintiff had given up another homestead claim he had, as he alleges the fact is that he did, in order to homestead the lands in question herein, and that the defendant Farmer, although he well knew all and singular the premises and matters aforesaid, caused, procured and induced the Crown, in ignorance of the plaintiff\u2019s rights and position in regard to the lands in question in this suit, to issue to him, the defendant Farmer, the said letters patent; and the bill prays, among other things, that it may be declared that the said patent was issued improvidently and in ignorance of the plaintiff\u2019s right in the premises, and that the said patent may be set aside and be declared to be absolutely null and void and of no effect. Now, assuming the facts alleged in this bill to be true, as by the demurrer they are admitted to be, I must say that I cannot see how a doubt can be entertained that under the provisions of the Act 35 Vic, (ch. 23, sec. 33 and its sub-sections relating to homestead rights, the plaintiff, when he made his application for the lot in question, and paid his homestead fee and satisfied the local agent that the entry of the defendant on the books of the land office was in effect a fraud upon the provisions of the Act, was a person who, in the words of the Act, was entitled to be entered on the books of the land office for the lot as his homestead, and that having in good faith entered upon the lot as his homestead, which, upon the allegations in the bill admitted by the demurrer, I consider myself bound to regard him as having done, and that having, as is also admitted, made in good faith such improvements on the lot while he occupied it as a homestead and which he thought was secured to him by the statute, he is a person having such an interest in procuring the letters patent which have been issued to the defendant Farmer for the lot in question to be set aside, as having been issued either through fraud, or in error, or improvidence, as entitles the plaintiff to maintain this suit under the provisions of the 69th sec. of the Act, which enacts that\nin all cases wherein patents for lands have issued through fraud, or in error or improvidence, any court, having competent jurisdiction in cases respecting real property in the province or place where such lands are situate, may upon action, bill, or plaint respecting such lands, and upon hearing of the parties interested, or upon default of the said parties after such notice of proceedings as the said court shall order, decree such patent to be void, and upon the registry of such decree in the office of the Registrar General of the Dominion, such patent shall be void to all intents.\nIf the allegations contained in this bill, admitted as they are to; be true, are not sufficient within the provisions of this section to give to the plaintiff a locus standi as a party interested in having the letters patent issued, as is admitted, in fraud of the provisions of the act, and by error upon part of the government, and in ignorance of such facts, and through improvidence set aside, I am, I confess, unable to conceive any case wherein a locus standi in maintenance of a bill to set aside letters patent, as issued through fraud, or in error, or improvidence, can be accorded to any complainant.\nI am of opinion, therefore, that the defendant\u2019s demurrer was rightly disallowed in the court below, and that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Rose, Killam & Haggart.\nSolicitors for respondents: McKenzie & Rankin.\n[1] 14 Grant 226.\n[2] 14 Grant 346.\n[3] 10 Grant 532.\n1 9 Grant 475.\n2 1 Err. and App. Ont. 111\n3 14 Grant 117.\n[4] 1 Err and App. Onto 465.\n[5] 5 Grant 292.\n[6] 9 Grant 26.\n[7] 4 Grant 61.\n[8] 10 Grant 416.\n[9] 8 Grant 324.\n[10] The learned Chief Justice read the 2nd and 3rd paragraphs of the bill.\n[11] Chitty Prer. of the Crown, p. 331\n1 Ubi Supra p. 146.\n[12] Maxwell on Statutes, pp. 337, 338.\n[13] 5 Can.

(P Q.,) for the House of Commons. The petition was met by preliminary objections, in which the sitting member alleged, inter alia, that the petitioners were not electors, nor qualified to vote at the election in question, &c. A day having been fixed for the hearing of these preliminary objections, no evidence was given upon them, and they were dismissed by Plamondon, J., who held, following the practice adopted by the Superior Court of Quebec, sitting as an Election Court in the L'Islet case, Duval v. Casgrain ([1]) that the onus probandi was on the respondent to support such objections.\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, Fournier, Henry and Gwynne, JJ., were of opinion that the onus probandi was on the appellant, who by his p\u0155eliminary objections had affirmed the disqualification of the petitioner.\nContra, Ritchie, C. J., and Strong and Taschereau, JJ.\nThe Court being equally divided, the judgment of the Court below stood affirmed without costs\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Election Court of the province of Quebec dismissing the preliminary objections filed by the present appellant to the election petition of the respondents.\nIn this case a petition was presented by the present respondents complaining of an undue election and return for the county of Megantic at the last general election for the House of Commons. The petition was met by preliminary objections, the first of which was that the petitioners were not electors, nor qualified to vote at the election in question A day having been fixed for the trial and hearing of these preliminary objections, no evidence was given upon them either by respondent or petitioners, and the court dismissed them.\nThe principal question which arose on this appeal was on whom was the onus probandi of the facts set up by the preliminary objections?\nMr. Crepea\", Q.C., and Mr. Gormully, for appellant.\nMr. Irvine, Q.C., for respondents.\nThe authorities relied on by counsel are referred to in the judgments hereinafter given. RITCHIE, O.J.:\u2014\nThis is an appeal from the decision of Mr. Justice Plamondon, dismissing the preliminary objections of the appellant to the petition of the respondents.\nThe main objection on which the appeal turns is:\n\"Because at the time of the election mentioned in the said petition, the said petitioners were not, and have not since been, electors according to the legal interpretation of the word, duly qualified to vote at the said election held in the month of June last.\"\nOn the 25th August the petitioners filed a notice to the respondent to have a day fixed for evidence and hearing on the merits of the preliminary objections; and, on the judge's order, it was continued to the 31st August. The record states that on that day \"the court asks the defendant's attorney if he is ready to proceed with his enqu\u00eate upon preliminary objections, the defendant's attorney being requested so to do, does not proceed. The parties are heard on preliminary objections and cause taken en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9,\" and the court adjourned until the 4th September, on which day judgment was rendered on these preliminary objections, as follows:\nLes objections preliminaries products par le d\u00e9fendeur \u00e0 l'encontre do la petition d'\u00e9lection en cette cause sont au nombre de quinze. Les objections premiere, deuxi\u00e8me, quatri\u00e8me cinqui\u00e8rne et treizi\u00e8me s'appuient sur l'affirmation do faits dont la prevue incombait au d\u00e9fendeur excipant.\nIl n'a pas fait d'enqu\u00eate au subject de ces faits. La cour no peut done s'en occupier.\nThis was upon the ground that the burden of proof on the issues raised was upon the defendant and not on the petitioners. The question on this appeal is, therefore on whom the burden rests?\nThe petitioners make the first assertion, an assertion essential to their case \u2014\u2014\nThat your petitioners were duly qualified electors at said election and had a right to vote thereat, and did vote thereat, and your petitioners are now duly qualified electors of said electoral district.\nTo this respondent pleads by way of \"objections preliminaires\" a denial of petitioners' assertion. Surely here is a perfect issue on a substantial and most material allegation, and unless substantiated, the petition, on which the petitioners' case rests, must fail, and therefore, it is no question of practice at all, nor matter of discretion as to who shall begin, as at nisi prius, nor is it a material question whether the party is benefited or injured by being required to commence, and all cases in reference thereto have, in my opinion, no bearing whatever on this case\" it is a case of failure of proof on the part of the petitioners, and without which proof they cannot recover. Whenever a party sues in a. representative character, such as executors, administrators, trustees, and the right to do so is disputed and put in issue, the party averring the right is always bound to establish it; in other words, the burden of proof is on him, because, if no proof is offered, he has failed to establish his right to sue, and again the affirmative is with him and the evidence of his right to sue is within his own knowledge and is part of his case, which, when challenged, he must maintain. The question of a petitioner's status seems to me to be peculiarly a preliminary objection, which it is in the interest of all parties to have disposed of before costs are incurred on the issues on the merits and indeed, where the status of the petitioner is put in issue, this must necessarily be first determined, because, if the petitioner has not the necessary qualification to enable him to petition there can be no trial on the merits at all because the ineligibility or disqualification of the petitioner being shown, no further proceedings thereon should be had. That this is a preliminary objection contemplated by the statute, there can be no doubt, because the statute expressly provides that when an objection is taken to the status of a petitioner, that is a preliminary objection, and then provides that these preliminary objections shall be tried within certain specified times under another provision.\nIn my opinion, when the statute provided that preliminary objections should be tried in the first instance, it did not in any way, directly or indirectly, expressly or by implication, intend to relieve the petitioner from the burthen of showing, when he complained of the election return, that he was a person duly qualified by law to do so, if this was disputed. There has then been no hearing of the objections, the Court, acting on the assumption that the burthen of proof was on the defendant, called on him to proceed to proof; it being my opinion, that the burthen of proof was on the petitioners, the judge should have so ruled and should have called on them to proceed with their enqu\u00eate and not on the respondent and if they then fail to do so the judge should have sustained the objection and dismissed the petition. The course, however, the judge pursued was quite excusable, being in accordance with the case of Duval v. Casgrain ([2]) by which he considered himself bound There was therefore a mistrial, and we ought now to give the judgment the court below should have given and declare that it is for the petitioner in the first instance to sustain his allegation of being an elector and not on the defendant in the first instance to offer evidence to disprove his being so. I think the judgment of this court should be that the appeal should be allowed but as the learned judge was guided by a procedure previously pursued in the province of Quebec, I should be disposed to remit the case back to the Superior Court, to call upon the party to proceed to his proof, and not to impose any costs in the case. I think the practice which is pursued in the province of Quebec should not affect us in this case because the Dominion Election Act is applicable to all the provinces, and there should be uniformity upon a decision of this kind.\nSTRONG J.:\u2014\nI concur with the Chief Justice in the view taken by him.\nFOURNIER, J.:\u2014\nJe suis en faveur de renvoyer l'appel parceque cette cause doit \u00eatre d\u00e9cid\u00e9e par la cause de Duval v.

Casgrain justifient le jugement dont est appel.\nJe suis en consequence d'opinion que le judgment de l'honorable judge Plamondon doit \u00eatreconfirm\u00e9.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nThe question for our decision is as to the correctness of the ruling of the learned judge before whom the petition in this case came for trial. The preliminary objections having been filed and having been denied, an issue was raised, and the one consideration\u2014the only one indeed\u2014is as to who should prove that issue In the ordinary case of trials, he who alleges, even negatively, an affirmative matter, has thrown upon him by the allegation the necessity of proving it. This is one of the first principles of pleading, and, although the matter may be stated negatively, still it is he who raises the issue, even in a negative form, that is required to prove it. In this case the petitioners, no doubt on the trial of the petition, would have been required to show their status and give evidence of it. This is an allegation contained in the petition, and, as soon as it is denied, the issue was thrown upon the petitioners to prove their position, viz.: \"That your petitioners were duly qualified electors at the election, and had the right to vote thereat, and did vote thereat, and your petitioners are duly qualified electors of the said electoral district.\" When issue is taken on these allegations the parties are no doubt required to prove them. It becomes necessary, however, to consider what the object of preliminary objections is, and the course of procedure which has been followed in regard to them. The object is clearly, in taking an objection, either that the petitioners are not qualified, or that it was too late, or any other objection to ascertain and show whether the parties are correctly before the court. This is no doubt a matter for a preliminary objection. The question is who is to prove the position? Is it the party who takes it in the first place as a preliminary objection? The respondent says: \"I undertake to allege;\" and, in my opinion, if he alleges, the onus of proving the allegation is upon him for the purpose of determining that question as a preliminary question. That is the beginning. That is the first allegation, and we must keep it separate altogether from the petition, because that same issue is raised on the petition, and, if the objection were not taken as a preliminary one, it would come up to be tried in its ordinary way. The respondent, however, says virtually to the court. \"I allege and will be prepared to show that these parties are not eligible as petitioners.\" That is the undertaking, and the object of filing a preliminary objection is for the purpose of enabling the respondent to show that the petitioners had no right to file the petition against him. That being the case, we have the right to look at the pleading which creates that issue. It is as follows '. \"That the said preliminary objections and each of them is false and unfounded in fact and in law, and expressly denies the same.\" There is the issue. Who raised it? Who made the first allegation? The respondent. It has been decided by the whole court in Montreal that the onus of proof is on the party who alleges facts which, if proved, would go to prevent the petition from being heard. The learned judge here followed that decision of the Quebec court. I take it that is a matter of procedure, and I think the authorities go to show very strongly the position that, in a matter of procedure, there ought to be no appeal at all. It is discouraged, and the practice is said to be now almost done away with in England. It is true that that procedure has been adopted only in Quebec, and I am not at all sure it is not the correct one to be applied to all the provinces and all petitions. I think it tends to prevent those preliminary objections being taken unless the party is prepared to offer some proof, What would be the use of a party filing a preliminary objection unless he is prepared to prove it? The respondent, holding the seat, is induced to file preliminary objections for the delay consequent upon them, and until very recently it was a stay of the whole proceedings. By recent legislation the trial of the election petition nevertheless may go on. If the party himself does not give the evidence which is necessary to stay the proceedings, the \"trial is going on, and I suppose that now the petition is before the judge for the very purpose of taking this evidence under the original petition, showing clearly that it was the duty of the respondent, if he desired a decision that would avoid the petition to allege and give evidence of what he did allege for the purpose of avoiding it.\nUnder these circumstances, I think the practice in the province of Quebec is the correct one, and will tend to prevent these preliminary objections being taken unless the party is prepared to give some evidence of them, because there is very little use in making preliminary objections on allegations which the respondent cannot sustain. The fact of these parties not being electors or having a right to vote, he could have proved as easily as the other parties. All he had to do was to produce the regular lists and show that they were not on them. It is alleged that, it they were on the lists, they were so fraudulently. Surely the party who alleges fraud is bound to prove it? He says: \"You fraudulently got yourself put on that list.\" It is the duty of the party who alleges fraud, to prove it. I think that the learned judge was right, that it is the true principle that it is for the furtherance of the ends of justice that that should be the rule and I therefore think the appeal should be dismissed.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\u2014\nThis petition contains the usual allegation that the petitioners were duly qualified electors and had a right to vote and did vote at the election in question. To this allegation, the respondent in the court below, (present appellant,) pleaded as a preliminary objection, that the petitioners were not duly qualified electors at the said election, as they alleged. Is this not in substance a plea of general issue to this part of the petition? The petitioners say \" we were duly qualified electors;' the respondent says \"you were not duly qualified electors.\" Why, in such a case, the burden of proof is not to be on the petitioners, I cannot tinder-stand. There is no legal presumption in their favor, there is no prim\u00e2 facie evidence in support of their allegation that I can see. the voters list is not produced and moreover the facts to be proved lie peculiarly within their own knowledge. It is not denied that in England, and with us formerly before the parliamentary committees, the onus probandi of these facts lies and did lie on the petitioners. Why it should lie with us on the respondent, because under our statute he pleads the petitioners want of qualification by preliminary objections, I cannot see. As held by Mr. Justice Johnson, in the Montreal Centre case ([4]) if the respondent does not contest the petitioner's right to petition by preliminary objection, the petition is at issue, and the respondent must be held to have admitted the petitioner's locus standi. Our statute allows him to deny the petitioner's locus standi by preliminary objection, and to have the issue on this decided before the trial l but the burden of proof still lies on the petitioner upon that issue, and this is not as a mere matter of procedure, but as a fundamental principle of law. I am of opinion to allow the appeal and to render the judgment that the court below ought to have rendered, following the rule actore non probante, reus absolvitus, and that is to say, dismiss the petition.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nThis is an appeal from a decision of Mr. Justice Plamondon in an election case. Certain preliminary objections had been filed in the matter of the contested election for the county of Megantic, wherein the above respondents were petitioners, and the above appellant was respondent in an election court in the district of Arthabaska and province of Quebec. It is only with .the first three objections that it is at all necessary for us to deal.\nIn and by his preliminary objections the above appellant insisted, by way of opposition to the status of the petitioners, that he ought not to be called upon to answer the substance and merits of the election petition of the petitioners, but that on the contrary, the said election petition should be dismissed with costs for the following reasons:\n\"1st. Because at the time of the election mentioned in the said petition, the said petitioners were not, and have not since been, electors according to the legal interpretation of the word duly qualified to vote at the said election held in the month of June last.\n\"2nd. Because neither of them is a subject of Her Majesty of full age possessing the qualities and qualifications of proprietor, tenant or occupant as required by law, and that if the names of the said petitioners or any of them are entered on the voter's lists of their respective municipalities such entry was made illegally by fraud and collusion on their part.\n\u201c3rd. Because there exists no legal voters lists duly homologated in the township where petitioner (McCurdy) resides, nor in the parish of Ste Julie de Somerset, where the other two petitioners reside.\"\nThe petitioners filed their answer to these preliminary objections and say that the same are and each and every of them is false and unfounded in fact and in law and the petitioners expressly deny the same and the sufficiency thereof, wherefore the said petitioners pray for the dismissal of the said preliminary objections with costs.\nThe 31st day of August, 1882, having been appointed for taking evidence upon the matter alleged in the preliminary objections, a court was held for that purpose, at which counsel for the sitting member (the above appellant) and the petitioners attended, and the counsel for the above appellant did not, nor did the appellant himself offer any evidence in support of any of the allegations contained in his preliminary objections, and the learned judge, having been of opinion that the burthen of proving these allegations lay upon the appellant, dismissed the preliminary objections for the want of any evidence to support them. It is from his order dismissing the objections that this appeal is taken, and in my opinion the appeal should be dismissed, whether the learned judge was right or wrong in the opinion which he formed as to the party upon whom the burthen of proof lay.\nThe enquiry\u2014upon whom does the burthen of proof rest when an issue between two parties is before a court\u2014is practically the same as the inquiry\u2014which party has the privilege, or incurs the duty, of beginning? The general rule upon the subject is that the issue must be proved by the party who states an affirmative, that is to say, he must begin, and not the party who states the negative ; but a legal affirmative is not necessarily a grammatical affirmative, nor a legal negative a grammatical negative; on the contrary, a legal affirmative frequently assumes the shape of a grammatical negative, and a legal negative that of a grammatical affirmative, consequently a rule subsidiary to the above has been established, namely, that the issue must be proved by the party who states the affirmative in sub-stance, that is the legal affirmative, not merely the affirmative; in form or the grammatical affirmative; that is to say, he incurs the duty to begin, but this duty to begin carrying with it the burthen of proving the issue, and which is expressed in the maxim probandi necessilas illi incumbit qui agit, raises only a mere question of practice and not of law. In Mills v Barber ([5]) to an action by an indorse against the acceptor of a bill of exchange, the defendant pleaded that the bill of exchange was given without consideration and for the accommodation of the drawer and endorsed to the plaintiff without value to which the plaintiff replied that it was endorsed to him for valuable consideration. At the trial a question arose whether the plaintiff was bound to prove consideration for the bill which he had by his replication affirmed he had given, or whether the defendant, who had in his plea affirmed the grammatical negative that the plaintiff took the bill without consideration was not bound to show the want of consideration. Alderson, B., who tried the cause, held that the onus probandilay on the defendant who had affirmed the grammatical negative, and the defendant, not being prepared to prove the want of consideration, the verdict passed for the plaintiff. The correctness of this ruling having been questioned upon a motion for a new trial, Lord Abinger, delivering the judgment of the court after a very full argument of the case, said: \"It is rather a question of practice than of law,\" and after referring to cases in which a different practice had prevailed, he stated that after consultation with the judges of all the courts the general opinion which prevailed among them was that in such a case the onus probandi lay upon the defendant, and thenceforth the practice has been to require the defendant to prove the want of consideration in such a case. That it is a mere rule of practice further appears from the fact that the judges of all the courts have assumed to vary the practice in certain cases, as in libel, islander, criminal conversation, and indeed in all cases where the plaintiff goes for substantial unascertained damages, by giving to the plaintiff the right to begin, although the sole issue upon the record be upon an affirmative plea the burthen of proving which the defendant has assumed. In Mercer v. Whall ([6]) where the circumstances under which the practice became established are stated the matter is spoken of as merely a rule of practice, and where a wrong party is made to begin by the erroneous ruling of a judge at nisi prius the only mode of rectifying that error is by a rule for a new trial, which in practice is never granted, unless it be made manifestly to appear that substantial injustice has resulted from that ruling ([7]). An appeal in such a case has never been heard of. Between cases arising before committees of the House of Commons and the present, there is this difference, that upon petitions before the House the whole case is at issue upon the averments in the petition, whereas in the case of preliminary objections, under our statute, there is no issue whatever upon the averments in the petition but on the contrary the respondent below, the now appellant, propounds those objections which he affirms and relies upon as reasons why he should not be compelled to make any answer to or to come to any issue upon the matters alleged in the petition. However, the contradictory decisions of Election Committees upon the point are, I think, in some measure capable of explanation upon the ground that these tribunals, also considered the point one of practice merely. In the North Cheshire case to which we have been referred ([8]) the committee was of opinion that, the petitioners' qualification and status as petitioners being disputed, they should prove the allegation of qualification averred in their petition before proceeding further. In the Harwich case ([9]) counsel for the sitting member objected to the qualification and status of the petitioner and proposed to offer evidence in support of his objection, but the committee in that case without calling on the other side resolved that the petitioner, having claimed to vote, and having actually voted at the election, the committee are of opinion they must proceed with the case. From the Dundalk case ([10]) it appears to me to be clear that the committee in that case thought that the burthen of proving that a person averred not to be a natural born British subject lay upon the person making the averment; for the resolution of the committee was, that it has not been proved that the sitting member is disqualified as an alien.\nIn Duval v. Casgrain ([11]) the Court of Review, sitting as an Election Court for the district of Quebec in which district the county of Megantic is situate, held, that upon a preliminary objection calling in question the status and qualification of a petitioner, the burthen of proof lay upon the party who, by his preliminary objection, had affirmed the disqualification. \"Without at present enquiring whether that was a right or a wrong decision, it seems to me to be sufficient to say that it was the decision of an election court which was at the time the ultimate court for deciding all questions arising upon election cases within the district in which the county of Megantic is situate, and of a court competent to establish its own practice upon the point, and the learned judge, before whom the question in the present case arose, having that case before him, cannot surely, with any degree of propriety, be said to have erred in following the decision of a full court of which he is only a single member. Stare decisis is a good rule in all cases, but especially in points of practice involving no substance or merit whatever. To countenance an appeal in such a case as the present\u2014involving no question of law, of substance or of merit, and where no injury whatever is or can be suggested as having been done to the appellant, would be, as it appears to me, not only unprecedented, but calculated to encourage the setting up of frivolous and vexatious objections made for the purpose of defeating or retarding the investigation of a subject in which not the mere interests of a private suitor but those of the public are involved, of frustrating the ends of justice and harassing petitioners with unnecessary costs.\nThe respondent below (the now appellant) had the same facility of access as the petitioners had to the voter's list. That was a public document no more in the possession of the one party than of the other, but equally accessible to both, and if the above appellant did not choose to produce it or to offer any evidence of the assertions propounded by him in his preliminary objections, the natural and reasonable conclusion appears to be that it would not have supported his case for if produced, it must have afforded prima facie evidence of the truth or falsity of his assertions. The appeal which is given to this court from a judgment upon preliminary objections is, as it appears to me, only from a decision affecting the substance and merit of a case either on some point of law or upon some fact established in evidence, and not upon such a mere point of practice as the question upon whom rests the duty to begin to offer evidence of the matter in issue\u2014a point which is not the subject of appeal when arising in any other court and which however erroneous the decision given upon it by the judge trying the issue may be, does not constitute foundation even for a rule for a new trial, unless it be manifestly made to appear that substantial injustice has been the result.\nBut I am of opinion that the decision appealed from in this case as well as that of the Court of Review in Duval v. Gasgrain, is in every respect correct. I have already noticed the fact that these preliminary objections to the status of petitioners are not to be regarded as taking issue upon any averment in the petition. They are not negations of any averments in the petition. They are on the contrary reasons first propounded by the sitting member as reasons why he should not be called upon to give any answer to, or to come to any issue upon, anything contained in the petition; the averments in the preliminary objections are in fact legal affirmations, however negative in form they may be; and in truth, as appears by the answer to them which raises the only issue that is raised upon them, such answer is not even affirmative in form. The answer is, that the preliminary objections are and each of them is untrue and without foundation and the petitioners expressly deny the same, treating the objections as affirming the legal or substantial affirmative, to which (in order to risk an issue) the petitioners supply the negative.\nThe contents of the election petition do not, as it appears to me, constitute any part of the issue which is raised by the preliminary objections and the answer thereto. The issue is made up of the preliminary objections affirming the disqualification of the persons who are petitioners in the election petition, and their answer denying the truth of the matters affirmed in the preliminary objections. An election court or judge trying that issue has not, as it seems to me, any occasion, or indeed right, to refer to the election petition to see what averments are made in it. The issue is raised upon the legal affirmative of a grammatical negative contained in the preliminary objections and the denial of such legal affirmative contained in the answer filed to the preliminary objections. Now, in Amos v. Hughes ([12]) the plaintiff, in his declaration, alleged as a breach of contract that the defendant did not emboss certain calico in a workmanlike manner, the defendant pleaded that he did emboss the calico in a workmanlike manner. It was held that the onus probandi lay on the plaintiff; his was the legal affirmative although the defendant's was the grammatical one.\nMills v. Barber, to which I have already alluded, was a similar case. So in Soward v. Leggatt ([13]), in an action for breach of covenant to repair, the declaration alleged that the premises were not kept in repair, to which the defendant pleaded that they were kept in repair, it was held that the onus probandi lay on the plaintiff as the asserter of the legal affirmative. So in Ashby v. Bates ([14]), in an action by executors on a life policy, the plaintiffs in their declaration averred that the assured was not afflicted with rupture or any other disease at the time of the assurance, to this the defendant pleaded that the assured was suffering from rupture at the time and had concealed the fact. The court held that the declaration involved the substantial or legal affirmative, although it was the plea which was affirmative in form, and the onus probandi was held to lie upon the plaintiffs, whose duty therefore it was to begin. Rolfe, B., in this case said that he considered it a sort of scandal to the administration of justice that this question should ever be made per se a ground for a new trial; he says that he should have thought it much better if the courts had laid down some general rule that the discretion of the judge trying a case should, upon such a point, be conclusive. lie therefore, it is plain, considered the question one of practice merely, but the observations of Alderson, B., are quite appropriate to the present case. He says ([15]):\nThe first assertion [upon which the issue arose.] was made by the plaintiffs. The defendant has contradicted what the plaintiffs affirmed, and the real issue is whether what they affirmed is true if true it is for the plaintiffs to prove its truth.\nNow in the case of these preliminary objections in election cases, there being, as I have shown, no issue upon the averments in the petition but the record of the issue consisting of the averments propounded in the preliminary objections, and of the answer filed thereto, contradicting what was so affirmed, it is plain that the real issue is whether what is affirmed in those objections be true, and the onus probandi therefore lies upon the sitting member, the affirm ant therein. He plainly is the person who, if no evidence at all were offered, must fail as having failed to support what he had affirmed, and which the petitioners had only contradicted, so putting him upon proof of what he had asserted. The propriety of this conclusion appears to me to be established beyond question when we consider the formalities prescribed by statute to be observed in the construction of the voters list and its object.\nBy the 40th sec. of Dominion statute, 37 Vic., ch. 9, it is enacted that, subject to certain exceptions:\nAll persons qualified to vote at the election of representative in the House of Assembly of the several provinces composing the Dominion of Canada and no others shall be entitled to vote at the election of members of the House of Commons of Canada for the several electoral districts comprised within such provinces respectively: and all lists of voters made and prepared, and which would according to the laws in force in the said several provinces be used if the election were that of a representative to the House of Assembly of the Province in which the election is held, where such lists are required to be made shall be the lists of voters which shall be used at the election of members of the House of Commons to be hell under the provisions of this Act.\nNow by \" Quebec Election Act,\" 38 Vic., ch. 7, sec. 7, it is enacted that no person shall be entitled to vote at the election of a member of the Legislative Assembly of that province unless at the time of voting he be an elector entered as owner, tenant or occupant upon the list of electors in force. Then the most stringent provisions are enacted so as to ensure perfect accuracy in the preparation of the lists.\nBy section 8 it is enacted, that no person shall be entered upon the list unless he be of the male sex of full age, and a subject of Her Majesty by birth or naturalization, and not otherwise legally incapacitated, and actually and in good faith owner or occupant of real estate of the estimated value on the valuation roll in force at the sum of at least $300 in any city municipality and at $200 in real value, or $20 in annual value, in any other municipality, or be a tenant in good faith, Paying an annual rent for real estate of at least $30 in any city municipality, or of at least $20 in any other municipality.\nSec. 11 defines the persons who are disqualified from being on the list,\nSec. 12 to 26 inclusive provide most stringent regulations for the preparation of the list, among these, by section 19, it is enacted that the secretary-treasurer, whose duty it is to prepare the list, shall certify in duplicate the correctness of the list (when prepared) by his oath to the effect that to the best of his knowledge and belief the list is correct, and that nothing has been inserted therein or omitted therefrom unduly or by fraud, and by sec. 20 it is enacted that one of the duplicates of the list so attested shall be kept in the office of the secretary treasurer at the disposal of and for the information of all persons interested, of which, by sec. 21 public notice shall be given and published in the same manner as notices for municipal purposes in the municipality for which the list has been prepared. Sec. 27 to 40, inclusive, provide for the examination and putting into force of the list. The examination is, by sec. 27, to be made by the council of the municipality even in the absence of any complaint. By secs. 28 and 29 any person who deems himself aggrieved by being wrongly inserted upon or omitted from the list may complain, or any person on the list may complain of the insertion upon the list of any unqualified person or the omission therefrom of any qualified person, and after investigation of the list and of the complaints relating to it, the council of the municipality may confirm or correct each duplicate of the list; and by section 35 it is enacted that the list shall come into force at the expiration of 30 days following the notice given in virtue of sec. 21 and shall remain in force until the month of March then next and thereafter until a new list is made and put in force under the authority of the Act, so that when the first list should be made under the Act the municipality could never be without a correct list; and by sec. 37 it is enacted that it should be the duty of the secretary treasurer as as soon as the list should come into force to certify to its correctness and to the time when it came into force by his certificate at the end of the list, in a form prescribed by the Act; and by the 38th section that one of the duplicates of the list should be kept of record in the archives of the municipality, and the other transmitted to the registrar of the registration division in which the municipality is situate, to be preserved by such officer and remain of record in his office (sec. 40.) Then by sec. 41, as amended by 43 and 44 Vic., ch. 15, it was enacted that '. any elector of the electoral division might appeal from any decision of the council confirming, correcting, or amending the list to the judge of the Superior Court of the district within fifteen days following such decision, by means of a petition in which should be briefly set forth the reasons of appeal, and by sec. 48 that the decision of the judge upon any such appeal should be final. Now, after all these formalities prescribed by statute for the preparation of the list by a public officer obliged to swear to its correctness have been complied with and after the examination of the list by the council of the municipality, and the opportunity given to every elector to complain of the improper insertion upon, or omission from, the list of any person, and to appeal if dissatisfied with the decision of the council to the judge of the Superior Court, it is impossible to arrive at any other conclusion than that the list so prepared when finally completed and filed of record in the offices appointed for that purpose, is prim\u00e2 facie (if not conclusive) evidence of every thing contained in it; it affords therefore at least prime facie evidence that every person inserted upon it as an. elector is in every respect qualified, both as a subject of Her Majesty, and of full age, and having the necessary property qualification, and not otherwise disqualified, for none but such duly qualified persons are permitted to be inserted upon it, and its correctness is guaranteed by the oath of the public officer entrusted with the preparation of it. The maxim omnia presumuntur rile esse acta must apply any other conclusion would make all the stringent regulations enacted by the statute to be observed in the preparation of the list as a useless, solemn farce, and a great waste of time, care, diligence, legal investigation and circumspection. The list, therefore, being prim\u00e2 facie evidence of the due qualification as an elector of every person inserted upon it, the burthen of proving it to be incorrect, after its final completion and becoming matter of record (if it is then at all open to further investigation), must clearly rest upon the person alleging its inaccuracy, and insisting that a person inserted upon it as duly qualified is, for any reason, not qualified and was wrongly placed upon it.\nIf the allegation be that a petitioner is not qualified by reason of his name not being on the list, that is clearly a legal affirmative, the burthen of proving which, upon the authority of all the cases, rests upon the party making the allegation, and as the evidence in such a case is the list itself which is a public document and matter of record and accessible to the sitting member who makes the allegation equally as to the petitioners who deny it, if the party making the allegation should decline or neglect to produce the only evidence capable of being produced in the given case, he is the party who must fail as neglecting or declining to produce evidence of an allegation made by himself. Here, however, the averment is not that the petitioners are not upon the list, but the averment is put hypothetically, that, if upon it, they are so by fraud, though no fraud is alleged or suggested, and if there had been any fraud alleged, the party alleging it was the party to prove it\u2014of that there can be no doubt. I cannot, therefore, doubt the correctness of the judgment of the learned judge whose decision is appealed from, namely, that the onus probandi lay upon the sitting member who had filed the preliminary objections; indeed he might, in my judgment, have well gone further and pronounced the objections to be insufficiently pleaded as vague, uncertain indefinite devoid of all the essentials of good, and possessed of many of the vices of bad pleading; but it is not necessary in the view which I have taken to dwell upon this point.\nThe appeal in my judgment should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed without costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: Eugene Crepeau.\nSolicitors for respondents: Irvine and Pemberton.\n[1] 19 L.

Q.) (1), the City Council of the city of Montreal by a resolution, adopted a report from their road committee prepared on the 30th April previous, as amended by a report of their finance committee of May 27, 1879, recommending the construction of permanent sidewalks in the following streets (inter alia) Dorchester and St Catherine. On the adoption of these reports with which an estimate indicating the quantity of flag stone required for each street, and the approximate cost of the work to be made in each street, had been submitted, the city surveyor caused the sidewalks in said streets to be made, and assessed the cost of these sidewalks according to the front of the real estate owned by the proprietors on each side of the same, and prepared a statement of the same, which he deposited with\n\u201c(1) Sec. 192. it shall be \" lawful for the council of the \" said city to order, by resolution, \" the construction of flagstone \" or asphalt sidewalks, or street g grading in the said city, and \" to defray the cost of the said \" works or improvements out \" of the city funds, or to assess \"the cost thereof in whole \"or in part, as the said council \" may, in their discretion, deem \" proper, upon the proprietors or usufructuaries of the real \" estate situate on each side of \" such streets, public places or \"squares, in proportion to the \" frontage of the said real estate \" respectively; and in the latter \" case it shall be the duty of the \" city surveyor to apportion and \" assess, in a book to be kept by \" him for that purpose the cost \" of the said works or improve- the treasurer for collection. D. A. B. possessed real estate on Dorchester and St Catherine streets and did not object to the construction of the new sidewalk. On the 3rd December 1877 a few days after receiving a notice from the city treasurer to pay within fifteen days certain sums, in default whereof execution would issue, D. A. B. paid, without protest, $946.25; and on the 29th Oct., 1878, paid a further sum of $438.90, and on the 14th November, 1878, without having received any notice, paid $700 on account of 1877 assessments.\nIn an action instituted by D.

B. against the city of Montreal, to recover the said sums of money which she alleged to have paid in error that the assessment was invalid.\nHeld,\u2014affirming the judgment of the Court below\u2014(Henry and Gwynne, JJ., dissenting), that D. A. B. had failed, both in allegation and proof, to make out a case for the recovery of the assessment paid by her, either as a voluntary payment made in ignorance of its illegality, or as a constrained payment of an illegal tax, and that mere irregularities in the mode of proceeding to the assessment, although they might in a proper proceeding, have entitled the ratepayers to have had the assessment quashed did not now entitle her to recover the amount back as a payment of a void assessment illegally extorted.\n2. That the City Council in laying pavements in parts of the city only, the cost of which was to be paid by assessment according to the frontage of the respective properties, and not in proportion to the cost of the part laid opposite each property, were acting within the scope of the power conferred upon them by 87 Vic ch. 51, sec. 192.\n3. That the objection founded on the invalidity of the assessment for want of notice, not having been alleged nor relied on at the trial of the case, was irrelevant on this appeal.\n\"ments, or such part thereof as \" the said council may have deter-\" mined should be borne by the s said proprietors or usufructuaries, upon the said real estate, \" according to the frontage there- \" of, as aforesaid; and the said a assessment, when so made and \" apportioned, shall be due and \" recoverable, the same as all \" other taxes and assessments, b before the Recorder's Court. \" The 39 Vic., ch. 52, sec. 7 amended the above sec. 192 of the 37 Vic. ch. 51, by striking out the words \" flagstone or asphalt sidewalks \" in the second and third lines thereof and substituting the following in their stead, \"sidewalks made of stone \" or asphalt, or both together, or \" of any other durable and permanent material, to the exclusion of wood.\" APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower canada (appeal side) ([1]) confirming a judgment of the Superior Court for Lower Canada \" sitting in the district of Montreal, which dismissed an action of the appellant en r\u00e9p\u00e9tition de l'ind\u00fb brought on the 8th January, 1879, whereby she claimed the recovery of an amount of $2,085.16, paid the respondent on account of a larger amount of $3258 for which she has been assessed by certain assessment rolls made by the city surveyor, dated the 27th January, 1877, as being her proportion of the cost of flagstone footpaths laid by the city of Montreal, respondent, in front of her property in St. Catherine and Dorchester streets in the city of Montreal, by and in virtue of a resolution of the city council of the 31st May, 1875.\"\nThe pleadings and facts sufficiently appear in the head note and the judgments hereinafter given.\nMr. Barnard, Q.C., and Mr. Creighton for the appellant:\nThere is no voluntary payment or acquiescence.

The rule Las invariably been adhered to in the Province of Quebec\nThe onus probandi was on appellant: the respondent not bound to adduce evidence \"Ei incumbit probatio qui dicit, non qui negat.\"\nIt would have been otherwise if city had sued for the assessment: \"Omnia pr\u00e6summuntur rite acta esse e Reni\u00e9re v.

([136]); Dillon ([137]).\nNor can appellant invoke injustice to third parties, her action not having the character of au action populaire.\nIt was so decided re The Mayor v. Stephens ([138]) ; The action was a mere personal action, in which he sought to be relieved from the distress upon his property, and to have damages for the illegal act of seizure. The judgment cannot have the effect of a judgment in rem, and must be construed to mean that the assessment was null and of no effect against the plaintiff.\nStatute of Quebec, 42 and 43 Vic., ch, 53, having been passed long after institution of the present case,\u2014sec. 12 does not apply. Cooley on Tax. ([139]); Cooley on Tax. ([140]).\nThe discrepancy in the width of the sidewalks was not even alluded to, in appellant's action. The point is irrelevant and foreign to the issues\nBesides, the Charter did not require council to fix width, and they did not fix it; the city surveyor had control on this point, and, as observed by a witness, width varied according to sinuosities and irregularities of streets; moreover, the evidence on that point is, to say the least, ambiguous and uncertain.\nLastly the appellant has seen the work done under her own eyes and never complained.

Fair Haven ([145]); Angell, Highways ([146]).\nOn the question of notice. It is not a ground of the present action; therefore irrelevant.\nHence the maxim: \"Omnia pr\u00e6sumuntur &c.\" applies.\nIn the Province of Quebec the rule is that where all the formalities prescribed by statute have been complied with, the proceedings are valid: and, should the appellant have thought of urging this ground of want of notice before the Superior Court or in the Court of Appeals, she would have been told, as she was repeatedly on other points, that the question was not in issue. and, besides, that the statute did not require such a notice.\nThe knowledge of the appellant of the improvement being carried on opposite her property (where she resided) was a sufficient notice.\nRitchie, C.J. :\u2014\nThis was an action instituted by the appellant to recover $2,085, which she alleges to have paid by error, on account of a larger amount claimed by the city under a special assessment for a flag-stone sidewalk laid in front of her properties in certain streets of Montreal'. The appellant opposed the assessment on several grounds. The first of which is on the ground \" that at the time the city caused the sidewalks to be constructed in front of her properties she had good serviceable and permanent sidewalks which were removed by the corporation without accounting or making any allowance for the same; and also that the resolution of the council was too indefinite as it did not determine the kind of stone, the width of the sidewalk, or the quality of the work.\nI agree with Chief Justice Dorion in saying that the plaintiff has failed to establish her first ground of objection as well as the second. Had there been any objection taken at the time, the corporation had it in their power then to remedy any irregularities. I think it is too late now for this plaintiff to complain of uncertainty in the resolutions or irregularities in the assessment roll.\nThe city council had clearly under 37 Vic. ch 51 sec. 192, as amended by sec. 7 of 39 Vic., ch. 52 the right to \"order by a resolution the construction of the sidewalks of stone or asphalt in the city and to assess the costs thereof in whole or in part as the council may in their discretion deem proper, upon the proprietor or \"usufructuarias of the real estate situate on each side of said streets, public places, or squares, in proportion to the frontage of the said real estate respectively.\" And the city surveyor, under the same statute, had power to apportion and assess the costs of the said works or improvement, &c, upon the said real estate, according to the frontage thereof.\nThe improvements have been made in front of plaintiff's properties; she saw the work going on, and permitted it to go on, she is in the full enjoyment of such improvements, and after she has voluntarily paid the amount, without objection or protest, how can she, assuming the resolution may be too general, and that there may have been irregularities in the mode of assessment ask the amount to be refunded to her on such grounds?\nI do not think there was such error in the payment she made as would justify her under the laws of the Province of Quebec to raise now these objections. I think it is entirely too late and I do not think she has given any valid reason why the amount expended for her benefit should be refunded.\nSTRONG, J:\u2014\nI am of opinion that this appeal must be dismissed. The payment made by the appellant was a voluntary one, made without any other pressure than that of a demand on the part of the corporation, there having been, so far as the evidence shows, no seizure of goods or other constraint. It certainly appears, according to the later authorities differing in this respect from Pothier ([147]), that the action condictio indebt can be maintained as well for the recovery of a payment made under error of law as for one made in error of fact ([148]) but ignorance or error of law is not to be presumed but must be proved. In the present case the plaintiff has not in her declaration alleged that at the time of payment she was ignorant of the legal objections to the assessment which she now invokes, nor has she proved such ignorance.\nThere is, therefore, wanting an essential ingredient, both in allegation and proof to the establishment of a right to the repetition de l'ind\u00fb upon the ground of payment in error.\nThat a tax paid without compulsion or remonstrance is to be considered a voluntary payment, which cannot be recovered back upon mere proof of its illegality, is well established by numerous authorities in English law, and these, although they would not be conclusive if error had been proved are not the less relevant to show that the payment here must be considered a voluntary one, as distinguished from a payment after a distress or after the inception of legal process to enforce it Graham v. City of Toronto ([149]); Dillon on Municipal Corporations ([150]).\nThe plaintiff has therefore failed to make out a case for the recovery of the money, either as a voluntary payment made in ignorance of its illegality, or as a constrained payment of an illegal tax.\nThe reasons just stated are alone sufficient to warrant the dismissal of the appeal. But upon the other grounds stated in the \u201cconsid\u00e9rants\" of the judgment under appeal and on the notes of the learned Chief Justice, it would seem impossible that the plaintiff could succeed. I can find nothing in the statute which limits the power of the city council to make a special assessment on the property owners for sidewalks of flag stones or asphalts in certain localities and yet to provide for the construction of wooden sidewalks out of the general rates. This being so, the only objection would be to the vagueness of the resolution and the correctness of the mode of proceeding,\u2014but these would constitute mere irregularities which, although they might m a proper proceeding have entitled the ratepayers to have the assessment quashed do not entitle a party who has paid the tax to recover the amount back as a payment of a void assessment illegally extorted ([151]).\nIt may be that the assessment was void by reason of the omission to give notice of the making of it to the proprietors, for although the statute requires no such notice, yet in a quasi judicial proceeding, such as the imposition of a tax, sound rules of statutory construction require that the obligation of giving a notice is to be implied, but a sufficient answer to any objection founded on the invalidity of the assessment for want of notice has been given by the respondent's counsel in his supplementary factum; namely, \" that it is not a ground of the present action and is therefore irrelevant.\"\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that the judgment of the Superior Court was entirely right, and the appeal there from was properly dismissed by the Court of Queen's Bench, whose judgment must be affirmed with costs.\nFOURNIER, J. :\u2014\nI am in favour of dismissing the appeal for the reasons given by the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Queen's Bench, and by my learned brother Taschereau, whose judgment I have read.\nHENRY, J. :\u2014\nThe first question involved in the consideration of this case appears to me to be: whether the payments made by the appellant were in law such voluntary acts on her part that she cannot now seek to recover them or any of them back in this action. In considering this legal proposition involving also the consideration of the evidence in the cause I have referred to article 1047 of Civil Code, which provides as follows:\nHe who receives what is not die him through error of law or fact, is bound to restore it, or if it cannot be restored in kind to give the value of it.\nThe same provision will be found in article 1376 of the code Napoleon, and the authorities in France hold that the receiving party, in such a case, is bound to make restitution as well in case he became the receiver in good faith, as in bad\u2014the duty to repay is imposed as soon as he learns that the demand for which the payment was made was illegal.\nWhen therefore the repayment was demanded, if not before, the respondent was bound, under the authority just referred to, to repay the amount illegally paid, if such were the fact. If the tax in this case were illegal through irregularities of the respondent or otherwise, he was bound to know it, and ignorance of the law and what it required is no legal excuse or defence. The law is therefore plain as applicable to the circumstances, and the next inquiry is, necessarily, as to the evidence.\nThe first matter of proof in the proceedings, which formed the basis of the tax on the appellant was the report of the road committee and of the finance committee of the city of Montreal which were approved of by the city council. Next evidence that the side-walks referred to in the reports were made, and that a notice was served on the appellant from the city treasurer, as follows:\nTake notice, that having failed to pay the above mentioned sums within the time prescribed by public notice, you are hereby required, within fifteen days from the date hereof, to pay the same to me at my office, together with the costs of this notice and service thereof as below: in default whereof execution will issue against your goods and chattels.\n(Signed) James F. D. Black,\nCity Treasurer.\nMontreal, 27th Nov ,1877.\nCosts 10c.\nNotice 20c.\n30 cents.\nThe ultimatum was, therefore, an execution to levy on the goods and. chattels of the appellant if the sums demanded were not paid in fifteen days. The appellant may fairly he presumed to have known that the sidewalks had been made but there is nothing in the evidence to show that she knew that she was to be called upon to contribute in the shape of a tax for the cost of them She, or her agent, had good reason to suppose that the city authorities had proceeded legally, and under that impression, paid the several sums demanded from time to time but further she must also have felt that, rightfully or otherwise, she occupied such a position, that say or do what was in her power, she could not prevent the levy of the execution as threatened in the notice. She had, therefore, to adopt the only mode open to her of preventing it by the payment of the sums demanded. Payment under such circumstances cannot therefore be characterized as voluntary. She was as helpless to resist the threatened levy as an unarmed traveller would be when stopped by an armed robber who demanded his money, threatening the consequences of a refusal, and who would be glad to escape the consequences by handing over the money demanded, as she did. The payment might be considered voluntary in the one case as well as in the other. Besides, can we assume the payments in this case to have been made voluntary under the circumstances? What I would call a voluntary payment is one made after a. full knowledge of all the facts. It is in no way shown that the appellant, when the payments were enforced from her, knew what the proceedings of the city authorities were; it is not shown that she knew of any irregularities having been committed, or that by the payments made she could he considered to waive Parties who allege a voluntary payment must show that when such was made the maker of it thereby waived the objections which he subsequently relied on. There is nothing in the evidence to establish that position. The defence that the payment was voluntary is founded on the doctrine of estoppel by which a party, who by words or actions admits the existence of certain facts or circumstances and thereby changes the position of another is prohibited from saying that what he admitted was untrue. Here no such position can be taken. Besides, the article of the code to which I have referred draws no distinction between voluntary and involuntary payments but simply enacts that \"He who receives what is not due to him through error of law or of fact is bound to restore it Besides the provisions in article 1047, we have that contained in article 1140 :\nEvery payment presupposes a debt; what has been paid where there is no debt may be recovered.\nIt provides that \"there can be no recovery of what has been paid in discharge of a natural obligation.' The latter provision does not apply to the circumstances of this case and therefore leaves the first para\u00e9\u00edraph of the article to its full operation. Article 1214 is also applicable to our inquiry on another point. It declares that:\nThe act of ratification or confirmation of the obligation which is voidable, does not make proof, unless it expresses the substance of the obligation the cause of its being voidable and the intention to cover the nullity.\nThe case of payments by the appellant of the taxes sought to be recovered may not come exactly within the provisions of that article, but we are, I think, bound to apply to her acts of payment the equitable provisions of the article. If we do so, then our judgment must on that point be in her favour.\nI have looked at and considered several cases in the courts in the Province of Quebec and in none of them do I find that the question of the voluntary payment of taxes alleged to have been illegal was raised as a defence to an action brought to recover money paid as taxes illegally imposed. In the Court of Revision at Quebec ([152]) it was unanimously decided that a seigneur who had paid an illegal tax could recover it, even from the successors of the Commissioners of Schools to whom he had paid it.\nSee also Leprohon v. Montreal Cot potation ([153]) where it was held :\nThat a party who has voluntarily paid a tax imposed by a by law of a municipal corporation, which by-law is declared by the court to be void, has a right to recover back what he has so paid.\nGrant on Corporations ([154]) says :\nWhere a corporation has been receiving money wrongfully, they are liable in assumpsit for money had and received.\nAnd he cites the case of Hall v. The Mayor &c., of Swansea ([155]) as the leading case on that point. In that case the question of liability being raised, Lord Chief Justice Denman ([156]) says:\nSo, here, if the corporation have helped themselves to another man's money it would be absurd to say that they must bind themselvss under seal to return it. The question is what title they have to retain the money, and the only title they show is there having taken it. Their wrongful act binds them to return it without any actual promise.\nThere have been many others decided m the courts of Quebec, and they have been decided in the terms of the code\u2014not on the question of the voluntary or involuntary payment of the taxes, but solely on the question as to the validity of the proceedings and the right to impose and collect the taxes. The sole question was whether the taxes were legally imposed, and in every case where they were found illegal the parties paying them were decided to be entitled to recover back the amount of them. It may be contended, however, that in this case the appellant must be presumed to know the law and the proposition may be a sound one, but she cannot be presumed to know that the respondent had not acted according to its provisions.\nThe respondent is called upon to repay moneys illegally obtained from the appellant by threats of an execution against her goods and chattels. They are then called upon to allege and prove that they were legally entitled to collect from her and retain the moneys in question. If they fail in doing so, she is entitled to recover. The prescription in such a case is thirty years, and we cannot make it less. We may be told that a judgment in favor of the appellant will operate injuriously to the public interests, and open the door for many others to come forward with similar claims. My answer is simply that with such consequences or results we have nothing to do. It is our province and duty to declare the law, and if the public interests thereby suffer, the blame must rest with those who, placed in a position of heavy responsibility, have negligently executed the public trust confided to them, and thereby produced the very results they would ask this court to prevent; when, in the proper discharge of our duty we have it not in our power to do so. Having therefore decided in favour of the appellant on the first objection raised to her right to recover, I will refer the plea to her declaration. The plea sets out in substance__\nThat in deciding that a sidewalk in stone or flags should be contracted on certain streets, and that the cost thereof should be borne one half by the proprietors or usufructuaries of the properties situated on the said streets and that a special assessment should be imposed for that purpose according to law and in proportion to the frontage of each such property, the city of Montreal acted within the limits of its corporate privileges and exercised a power which is in its nature legislative. That neither the city of Montreal. nor the surveyor exceeded their authority in the matters aforesaid and that in the making of the assessment roll all the formalities required by law were duly complied with. That the plaintiff was justly indebted to the defendants when she paid to the defendants the sum placed to her charge as her part of the contribution to defray the half of the cost of the construction of the said sidewalks That long before the institution of the present action the plaintiff has recognized and admitted the validity of the assessment roll by paying to the defendants the sum of $2085.15 the amount o her contribution, &c.\nThe authority for the proceedings of the respondent is contained in section 192 of the act of the Legislature of Quebec (37 Vic., ch. 51) entitled \"An Act to revise and consolidate the charter of the city of Montreal and the several acts amending the same.\"\nIt shall be lawful for the council of the said city to order by resolution the construction of stone or asphalt sidewalks or street grading in the said city, and to defray the cost of the said works or improvements out of the city funds or to assess the cost thereof in whole or in part, as the said council may, in their discretion, deem proper, upon the proprietors or usufructuaries of the real estaee situate on each side of such streets, public places or squares in proportion to the frontage of the said real estate respectively: and in the latter case, it shall be the duty of the city surveyor to apportion and assess in a book to be kept by him for that purpose the cost of the said works or improvements or such part thereof as the said council may have determined should be borne by the said proprietors or usufructuaries upon the said real estate, according to the frontage thereof as aforesaid and the said assessment when so made and apportioned shall be due and recoverable the same as all other taxes and assessments before the Recorder's Court.\nUnder the Act the Recorder's Court had no further jurisdiction in the matter than to issue the execution or warrant to levy for the taxes imposed in case they remained unpaid for fifteen days after demand and notice from the city treasurer.\nThe section just quoted gives power to the council, by resolution to order the construction of stone or asphalt sidewalks, but the plea does not allege that any such order to construct such was passed and there is no proof that any such was passed. It is true the two committees, before referred to made certain suggestions and recommendations to the council. The council considered those reports and the following extract from the minutes show what the action of the council was. On the 31st of May, 1875\nThe order of the day being read to consider the repots from the road and finance committees to construct side walks in certain streets the following reports were brought up and read, and on motion of Alderman Nelson seconded by Alderman Davis, it was resolved that the said reports be adopted.\nThe reports referred to are set out in the declaration and affect differently as I read them the interests of the appellant. The claim against her is for the sidewalks on Dorchester and another street. The road committee in their report recommend that the sidewalks on Dorchester street be made \"from Union Avenue to city limits on both sides,\" while the finance committee, in their report, recommend an amendment to the report of the road committee, and suggest that the sidewalks on Dorchester street be made \"from corner of Beaver Hall terrace westward to the city limits \" The minutes of the council show that it was resolved to adopt both the reports. As respects Dorchester street then, which of the two reports is really confirmed or adopted? The termini are different and is it from Union Avenue or Beaver Hall terrace that the adoption of the report decides upon as one of such termini? The resolution of the council I consider as void for uncertainty not only as affecting Dorchester street, but others, as a comparison of the two reports will show. I take, however, a higher ground of objection to the legality of the proceedings. By the statute under which they were taken (37 Vic. ch. 51, sec. 192) the city council was authorized \" to order by a resolution the construction of sidewalks.\" &c. The order for the construction must therefore be made by the council. No such order was made for the construction of the sidewalks in question by the only body authorized to make such an order. As far as the case shows the road committee volunteered to make a report to the council containing certain suggestions and recommendations. That report was referred to the finance committee, who, with certain amendments and changes recommended the adoption of the report. As I have before stated, both reports, although inconsistent with each other, were adopted. Here the action of the City Council ended and what did such adoption amount to? Certainly nothing more than a present approval of what the reports recommended. I cannot give effect to that mere signification of approval of the reports as an \" order for the construction \" of the sidewalks The respondent claims in his plea that the statute conferred on the council a quasi legislative power in the premises. To test the value of the resolution adopting the reports it is only necessary to refer to well known practice of parliaments and legislatures, by which the opinion of members is ascertained in a general way as to any particular measure or matter by a resolution affirming some proposition. If after consideration the resolution be sustained, a bill providing for the mode and manner by which the general terms of the resolution shall be carried out is the next and necessary proceeding, and it matters not how specific the resolution may have been in its details the only means of giving effect to it is by an act. The resolution is but an expression of opinion favourable to the legislation proposed, and if no act be passed, it remains on the journals merely as such an expression, and without giving the slightest authority to any one to act in the matter. In this case no one was authorized, to build the sidewalks in question nor did the council authorize any one, as far as I can see, to enter into contracts to bind the council or the city. To establish this proposition it is only necessary to put a very plain case. Suppose an action were brought against the city by a contractor for the materials supplied by a party who entered into an agreement with the city surveyor, or by a party who sustained damages by his negligence whilst engaged in the work, would it not be a good defence for the council to answer that, although approving the reports of the two committees, no order or authority was given to carry out the recommendations contained in them.\nIt is a legal proposition universally recognized that where power of taxation is given as the result of certain proceedings by a statute to one body, there can be no delegation of it to another. Here then the power to order by resolution is given only to the city council. That body was to decide on the material or materials to be used, and, as a necessary consequence, on the width of the sidewalks. They were to be made of stone or asphalt, or both together, or any other durable and permanent material to the exclusion of wood. To order a stone sidewalk would necessarily require some provision as to the mode and manner of making it. It might be called a stone sidewalk if made Of McAdam stone\u2014 or of any other size. It might be made of free stone granite, slate, or any other kind of stone laid in blocks or thin slabs, with or without cement;\u2014the city was to bear the whole of the cost or of such part as the council should decide\u2014the proprietors or usufructuaries to be assessed for the balance. Up to this point the city council were alone authorized to act. After all had been done by the council and a decision had been come to by the council, and the necessary resolution passed to assess the proprietors or usufructuaries, then, and then only does the section in question call -for the action of the city surveyor., and his duty or authority is confined to the apportionment and assessment by him of \" the cost of the said works or improvements or such \"part thereof as the council may have \" determined, should be borne by the said proprietors or usufructuaries.\" how different has been the proceedings. The council decided to adopt the reports of the two committees. The road committee merely recommend that a flag stone foot path, or side walk, be laid on the streets named without specifying the width of such sidewalks, or describing in any way how they were to he made The city surveyor, however, seems to have taken upon himself the whole responsibility, and made such sidewalks and of such widths and of such materials as he pleased. If the council afterwards ratified his acts, that might bind the city, but would not affect other parties or interests. In acting as he did I consider he undertook to do what the Legislature gave him no power to do, and which his position as city surveyor did not authorize. The act gave the council and the council alone the power which he exercised and which the records show the council did not even authorize him to do were such in its power He might in the exercise of an arbitrary and irresponsible power have made the sidewalks double, or only half the proper width, and if he had the right to decide, the public and the proprietors would necessarily be injured. If the Legislature intended the exercise by him of such a power, it would have so provided. I consider, then that as the council in this relation failed to do what the Legislature intended and provided for, I consider there is no foundation for an assessment. The same objection I have taken to the absence of any order of the council for the construction of the sidewalks is available also as to the assessment. The council was required \" to order, by resolution \"the construction of the sidewalks and to assess the costs thereof in whole or in part on the proprietors,\" &c. Now, there is no resolution in the terms of that provision. The assessment is specially required to be made by the council and I hold that such was not in any manner done by the mere adoption of the reports of the committees before too, any work was done, and when no body could tell the amount for which the assessment should be made. The apportionment and assessment made by the city surveyor, is, in my opinion, ultra vires in the absence of a previous resolution in the terms of the section, of the city council. I consider there was not at the time of the several payments which were made by the appellant as set out in her declaration, any debt due by her to the city as alleged by the respondents and that she is entitled to recover back the same and as the city council should under the circumstances be deemed to have enforced such payments in bad faith I think she is also entitled to interest from the date of the several payments. I think the appeal should be allowed and judgment entered accordingly for the appellant.\nTASOHEREAU, J. :\u2014\nI am of opinion to dismiss this appeal. No other judgement could have been given in the case than the one dismissing the appellant's action given unanimously by the two courts and five judges appealed from.\nThe appellant's first contention is, that though her demand has been met by a general denial of all her allegations, yet she is not obliged to prove her case. Onus probandi, for her is no vain word. It is a real onus and so she would like to get rid of it and to throw it upon her adversary. Some English and American authorities have been cited in support of her proposition, that where a corporation relies upon its proceedings as a matter of defence the burden of proving the regularity of these proceedings falls upon this corporation. These authorities are not applicable to actions en rep\u00e9titinn de l'ind\u00fb and to the present case, which is ruled exclusively by our own civil law, under which there is no room for doubt or argumentation on this point, and this whether the defendant be a corporation or a private individual. It is laid down in precise words in the Digest ([157]) De probat, et pr\u00e6sumpt. that if on an action de condictione ind, biti, the defendant admits to have received the sum claimed by the plaintiff, but contends that it was justly due to him it is for the plaintiff who sues to recover back this sum on the ground that it was not due, to prove that it was not due; and a note in Toullier ([158]) says that this is still the law; Laurent ([159]) is also clear on this. An exception to this rule existed in the Roman law in favour of ignorant or negligent persons, or women, minors, and certain other privileged classes, but such exceptions are not now recognized.\nApart from the general rule, that the plaintiff has to prove his case and that the defendant has not to adduce any evidence till the plaintiff's case is made out, there is a special one, in actions en r\u00e9p\u00e9tition de l'ind\u00fb, why it should particularly be so; it is that there is a legal presumption against the plaintiff, that as he paid there was a debt, according to Art. 1140 C. C. This presumption says Art. 1239 C. C, exempts the defendant from making any proof. \"You have paid me,\" can he say ;\" you are therefore presumed to have owed me what you paid. You must prove that you did not owe me to get back your money. I have not got to prove that you owed me.\"\nIn other words, as stated in Lahaye Code Civil ([160]).\nPuisque tout paiement suppose une dette, on doit conclure de l\u00e0 que c'est \u00e0 c'elst qui a pay\u00e9 mal \u00e0 propos et qui veut r\u00e9p\u00e9ter \u00e0. prouver qu'il ne devait pas. Pr\u00e6sumptionem pro eo esse qui accepit nemo dubitat, dit Paul.\nIt is true that in the present case the corporation defendant fyled with the general issue an exception in which it is pleaded that the sum paid by the plaintiff was legally due in virtue of certain resolutions and proceedings of the council it is also true that reus excipiendo fit actor, hut this does not relieve the plaintiff from the onus probandi, from the obligation to prove her case.\nLe demandeur doit prouver le fait, qui sert de base \u00e0 sa pr\u00e9tention et comme le d\u00e9fendeur est toujours assimil\u00e9 au demandeur lorsqu'il avance quelque chose dans ses exceptions, c'est \u00e0 lui \u00e0 prouver le fait sur lequel il appuie sa d\u00e9fense. Mais celuici n'est tenu \u00e0 cette preuve que lorsque celuil\u00e0 a v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 le fondement de sa demande. Merlin, Rep. vo. preuve, p. 705.\nDemolombe, ([161]) says :\nC'est \u00e0 celui qui pr\u00e9tend avoir pav\u00e9 ind\u00fbment et qui veut exercer la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition qu'encombe la charge de prouver que la dette n'existait pas.\nAnd error in the payment must also be proved by the plaintiff. The law of the Digest on the subject says :\nC'est pourquoi celui qui pr\u00e9tend avoir pa\u00e9\u00e9 ce qu'il no devait pas. est oblig\u00e9 de justifier par de bonnes preuves quo c'est par la mauvaise foi de celui \u00e0 qui ii a pay\u00e9, ou par de justes raisons d'ignorance, vel aliquam justcam ignoranti\u00e6 causam, qu'il a ainsi pay\u00e9 ce qu'il no devait pas; autrement ii n'aura aucune action pour ce faire rendre ce qu'il aura pay\u00e9. (Traduction Hulot.)\nEt le digeste dit; Si sciens se non debere solvit, cessat repetitio. (De condict. indeb.) This same law says :\nLorsque quelqu'un paye une chose qu'il salt no pas devoir dans l'intention de la redemander apr\u00e8s, ii est priv\u00e9 du droit do la rep\u00e9tor. (Traduction Hulot.)\nAnd in Pandectes fran\u00e7aises ([162]) it is said :\nPour qu'il y alt lieu \u00e0 la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition, il faut quo celui qui a pay\u00e9 ignore qu'il ne doit pas, car celui qui paie sciemment ce qu'il no doit pas, ne peut pas rep\u00e9ter, quand m\u00eame, en payant, il aurait eu l'intention do r\u00e9clamer ensuite.\nPothier ([163]) says :\nIl n'y a lieu \u00e0 l'action comdictio indebiti pour ce qu'on a pay\u00e9 sans le devoir, que lorsque c'est par erreur qu'on a pay\u00e9 Si, lors du paiement quo j'ai fait d'une chose, je savais no la pas devoir, je n'en ai aucune r\u00e9p\u00e9tition.\nDemolombe ([164]) says as clearly :\nNous disons, au contraire, que l'erreur est toujours requise de la part de celui qui a pay\u00e9, de sorte que le paiement de l'indu fait en connasssaince de cause ne donne lieu \u00e0 aucune action en r\u00e9p\u00e9tition.\nAs late as 1878, the Cour de Cassation in a case of Chemin defer du midi v. Schmid ([165]) held that :\nC'est \u00e0 celui qui r\u00e9p\u00e8te la chose payee de prouver qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 pav\u00e9e ind\u00fbment et par erreur.\nOn the same principle, the Louisiana Court of Appeal, in Hills v. Kerrion ([166]) held, that to reclaim money paid on the ground that it was not due, the plaintiff must show not only that it was not due, but also that it was paid through error. See also Urquhart v. Gore ([167]).\nThe authorities and decisions referred to in Mlerlin, Rep. vo. Restitutions de droits ind\u00fbment percus, vente de meubess, and prescription, relied upon by the appellant, have no application to the present cause. They are based on special laws concerning the public revenues in France.\nAccording to the principles which must govern this action, the plaintiff had consequently to prove: 1st. The payment; 2nd. That the sums paid were not due; and 8rd. That she paid through error or involuntarily; that is to say under contrainte. The payment is admitted. The other allegations are denied.\nIn this case, however, the plaintiff does not allege error. She rests her claim on the exclusive ground that she paid under contrainte\u2014under compulsion. She therefore could not be admitted to prove error and she did not attempt it. There is not a word of evidence as to this. Her agent, who made this payment for her, and who was examined as her witness, was not even questioned on this point. Had she alleged such error, to rebut the presumption of implied ratification arising out of her payments, the proof of it would have been on her. On this there can be no doubt. The authorities I have just quoted are clear. Marcad\u00e9, it is true, ([168]) contends that the burthen of proving the absence of error or of ignorance of the party making the payment falls on the party to whom the payment was made. But Merlin, though at first of that opinion, and Toullier, B\u00e9darride and Rolland de Villargues are of a contrary opinion. Toullier says ([169]):\nFinissons par observer qu'il nous parait que Merlin ne s'est point exprim\u00e9 avec son exactitude ordinaire quand ii a fait entendre que pour qu'un contrat fut ratine par l'ex\u00e9cution volontaire, ii fallait prouver que la partie oblig\u00e9e avait, en l'ex\u00e9cutant, connaissance du vice qui pouvait le faire annuler. Autrement, ditil, et \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de cette preuve, elle est cens\u00e9e ne l'ex\u00e9cuter que parcequ'elle en ignore le vice. Cette proposition nous parait contraire \u00e0 l'article 1338, qui porte expres\u00e9\u00e9ment qu'\u00e0 d\u00e9faut d'acte de confirmation ou ratification, ii que l'obligation soit ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e volontairement. Si l'ex\u00e9cution volontaire suffit, celui au profit de qui le contrat est ratifi\u00e9 par l'ex\u00e9cution n'a done rien autre chose \u00e0 proaver. Il n'est pas tenu de prouver que le ratifiant connaissait le vice du contrat quand il l'a volontairement ex\u00e9cut\u00e9; c'est, au contraire, \u00e0 ce dernier de prouver qu'il ne le connaissait pas. sil croit pouvoir le faire Our law as to ratifiication by voluntary execution, is the same as here mentioned by Toullier, though not included in our Code art. 1214 as it is in art 1338 of the Code Napol\u00e9on, See also Solon Nullit\u00e9s ([170]).\nMerlin ([171]) admits that the opinion he had given on the point in the previous editions of his works was wrong, and he concludes, with Toullier, that the proof of the error in the payment lies on the plaintiff who alleges it.\nLaurent ([172]), also says :\nLe motif quo l'on donne pour dispenser le demandeur de faire cette preuve se retourne contre lui. Sans doute, personne n'est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 jeter son argent, mais qu'nn fautil conclure? Il faut dire avec Toullier que c'est une raison de plus pour imposer la preuve do l'erreur \u00e0 celui qui, contre toute probabilit\u00e9, soutient qu'il a pay\u00e9 par erreur ce qu'il ne devait pas.\nSee also Fradet v. Guay ([173]).\nB\u00e9darride, de la fraude ([174]), adopts as follows Merlin's last opinion :\nCette d\u00e9monstration nous parait sans r\u00e9plique: nous admettons donc que l'ex\u00e9cution fait pr\u00e9sumer par ellem\u00eame la connaissance du vice de l'obligation qve cette pr\u00e9somption doit ceder dervant la preuve du contraire: que cette preuve est \u00e0 la charge exclusive du d\u00e9biteur pr\u00e9tendant se faire relever des effets de l'obligation,\nAnd he cites a decision of the Cour de Cassation dated July 23 1825 in that sense. Solon ([175]) thinks that this is going too far and that as to implied ratification a distinction should be made between nullit\u00e9s apparentes et nullit\u00e9s cat li\u00e9es. But his opinion, however, does not help the plaintiff, for he says ;\nSi le vice \u00e9tait apparent il y a pr\u00e9somption l\u00e9gaee quo la partie qui a ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 l'acte connaissait les moyens qu'elle avait de le faire annuler, car comme chacun est cens\u00e9 conna\u00eetre le droit, personne no peut pr\u00e9tendre avoir ignore l\u2019imperfection apparente et en quelque sorte mat\u00e9rielle, d'un acte qu'il avait dans les mains, ou qu'il \u00e9tait sense y avoir, par la facilit\u00e9 qu'il avait de se le procurer. En pareil cas, ii est \u00e0 pr\u00e9sumer que l'ex\u00e9cution a \u00e9t\u00e9 volontaire, c'est a dire qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite dans l'intention de couvrir la nullit\u00e9.\nHere, the causes of nullity alleged by the plaintiff against the proceedings of the counsel were all of them apparent ou the face of the documents, and the plaintiff had free access to these documents and could see them when she pleased. If she did not see them it is her own fault, and vigilantibus non dormientibus subvenit lex, Error of law and error of fact I may remark, are here on the same basis under article 1047 of our code, which is not given as new law, though it settled a mooted point. Though the Napoleon code is not so clear, error of law and error of fact are also in France both good grounds of revision. See Marcad\u00e9 ([176]); Demoloinbe ([177]) Laurent ([178]).\nI say, then, that the plaintiff in this case has made the payments in question with the full knowledge, at the time she made them that she was not bound to make them and this 1st. because she does not herself allege that she made them through error; 2nd., because she did not prove or attempt to prove that she made them through error; 3rd., because the legal presumption is that she was aware when she made them of the grounds of nullity she now; complains of in the defe\u00e6dants ' proceedings. Now, if she has not paid through error, she is presumed to have paid voluntarily, unless she proves that she paid under contrainte and under violence as it were. In fact, though it seems to have been lost sight of at the argument before us, her action is, as I have already remarked, simply based on this last ground and is not the action condictio indebiti, stricto sensu. She says virtually to the defendant: \" I \" paid you, though I knew I did not owe you; but I \"was constrained to do so to avoid the seizure and sale \" of my goods, or, in other words, I paid through fear and \" under threats of violence \" In law these certainly are good grounds of action. Art. 998 C. C., relating to contracts made under legal constraint or fear enacts that :\nIf the violence be only a legal constraint or the fear only of a party doing that which he has a right to do, it is not a ground of nullity but it is if the forms of law be used or threatened for an unjust and illegal cause to extort a consent.\nReplace this last word consent by payment, and we have the law applicable to the plaintiff's demand in the present case.\nI am thus brought to the consideration of the question whether the plaintiff has established, 1st, That the payment in question was extorted from her through the fear of forms of law used or threatened against her; and 2nd if these forms of law were used or threatened against her for an unjust and illegal cause.\nThe Superior Court and the Court of Queen's Bench have both unanimously found as a matter of fact, that the plaintiff made her payments voluntarily, and not under compulsion. I concur fully in this finding. The evidence shows that the plaintiff did not at all act under the influence of the fear of forms of law when she made these payments; but on the contrary, acted throughout as voluntarily as possible, and with the most perfect freedom.\nIn the first place, she paid without protest, and so, presumably, voluntarily. The case of Leprohon v. City of Montreal ([179]), relied upon by the plaintiff, was very different from this one. There the plaintiff alleged a payment made through error. Of course, one who pays through error, cannot protest: he is under the impression that he owes, and has nothing to protest against, or no reason to protest at all. But here the plaintiff knew, or is in law held to have known that she did not the sum she paid; she merely contends that she paid under contrainte or fear. She should then have paid under protest. The case of The Corporation of Quebec v. Caron is precisely like the present one; that is to say, there also the defendant had paid under contrainte knowing that he did not owe but the defendant had alleged in his declaration, and specially proved, that he had paid under protest, and this protest was a special ground of the judgment of the court. In Wilson v. The City of Montreal ([180]) the payment had also been made under protest.\nIn Dubois v La Corporation d' Acton Vale ([181]) there had also been a protest.\nIn Sutherland v. The Mayor of Montreal, cited by the Chief Justice in Baylis v. The Mayor hereafter cited it also appears that the payment had been made under protest.\nIn Bavlis v. The City of Montreal ([182]) there had been no protest and the majority of the court seemed to have been of opinion that such was not necessary. I, how-ever remark that in that case a warrant of distress had actually been issued against the defendant when he paid. The Chief Justice seems to insist specially upon that feat and it is one of the consid\u00e9rants of the judgment.\nThe case of Buckley v. Brunelle ([183]) was also a payment alleged by the plaintiff to have been made through error and which the Court of Appeal held to have been made contrary to a law d'ordre public.\nI cannot help but thinking that, that when a party pays a debt which he believes he does not owe but has to pay it under contrainte or fear, he ought to accompany this payment with a protest, if not under the impossibility to make one, and so put the party whom he pays under his guard, and notify him that he does not pay voluntarily, if this party is in good faith. If he is in bad faith and receives what he knows is not due to him, he is, perhaps, not entitled to this protection. A distinction might also perhaps be made between the case of a payment under actual contrainte, and one made under a threat only of contrainte, or through fear.\nIf there is an actual contrainte a protest may not be necessary, and in some cases, it is obvious, may be impossible, but if there is a notice of threat only of contrainte, then, if the party pays before there is an actual contrainte, he should pay under protest. Demolombe ([184]), seems, at first sight, to say that a protest is not absolutely necessary, but he speaks, it must be remarked, of the case of an actual contrainte.\nOf course, each case has to be decided on its own facts. It is not as a rule of law that a protest may be said to be required. For a protest is of no avail when the payment or execution of the obligation is otherwise voluntary. Favard de Langlade,R\u00e9p.Vo. Acquiescement ([185]); Solon ([186]); B\u00e9darride De la Fraude ([187]).\nThe contention of the appellant, that as the payment of a judgment ex\u00e9cutoire par provision is not an acquiescement to it, so the payments she made to the corporation should be held not to be an acquiescement to its proceedings. But the case of a judgment ex\u00e9cutoire par provision stands on totally special grounds. Bioche Procedure ([188]). The rule is, that he who executes a judgment of that nature is not estopped from appealing it. Why? The very terms given to these judgments explain it. They are provisional. He who pays such a judgment pays only what is a provisional order, his very payment is therefore only provisional l therefore, it is impossible to attach to such a payment consequences to which the very nature of the judgment is forcibly opposed. Yet, Pothier requires that the payment of such a judgment should be made under protest if the party desires not to acquiesce in it. However, some modern cases seem to say that a protest is not necessary. But here there is no provisional order; the corporation's judgment against the appellant for the rate was equivalent to a judgment\u2014was a final judgment; and the voluntary payment of a final judgment, unaccompanied by protest or reservation, has always been held to import a complete acquiescement to it, in fact the clearest and most unequivocal possible. Charbonnean v. Davis ([189]); Poncet, Des jugements ([190]); Bioche, Proc\u00e9d. Vo. ([191]); Merlin, Quest, dr. Vo. Acquiescement ([192]) Pothier ([193]) says :\nA plus forte raison doitelle \u00eatre cens\u00e9e avoir acquiesc\u00e9e lorsqu'elle est entr\u00e9e en paiement, soit de la somme port\u00e9e par la condamnation soit des d\u00e9pens auxquels elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9e, \u00e0 moins que dans les cas auxquels la sentence est ex\u00e9cutoire par provision, elle n'ait pay\u00e9 en vertu do contrainte, en protestant qu'elle ne payait qu'en vertu do contrainte, sans pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 l'appel par elle interjet\u00e9, ou qu'lee comptait inteijeter.\nJousse under art. 5 tit. XXVII de l'ordonn. de 1667 also requires a protest.\nGuyot, Rep. Vo. Chose jug\u00e9e ([194]), says :\nIl suffit que l'acquiescement puisse sepr\u00e9sumer par la conduite de la partie, comme si elle demande du -temps pour payer ou pour ex\u00e9cuter la sentence, \u00e0 moins quo la sentence, \u00e9tant ex\u00e9cutoire par provision, elle n'e\u00fbt pay\u00e9 ou promis de payer que pour \u00e9viter des contraintes; et encore faudraitil qu'elle eat fait ses protestations, sais quoi elle serait pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e y avoir acquiesc\u00e9.\nSome of the authorities would tend to say that in a case like the first payment made by the appellant, of which I will speak presently, a protest would not be. necessary; but they are all unanimous in the conclusion that payments made under the circumstances under which the appellant made her second and third payment should have been made under protest, if made with the intention to claim them back. Indeed as I have already remarked, even had there been a protest these last payments should be held to have been voluntary. The absence of protest cannot but have always great weight against the contention that an act done under the circumstances disclosed in this case was not voluntary.\nThen, what evidence did the appellant bring to prove that she made these payments under coutrainte or fear at all? Her claim is based on three different payments of three instalments of the taxes in question: one on the third December eighteen hundred and seventy-seven; one on the twenty-ninth October, eighteen hundred and severity-eight; the other one on the -fourteenth November eighteen hundred and seventy-eight. As to the two first payments the plaintiff's sole proof of contrainte consists in the notices given to her by the corporation under sec. 86, 37 Vic, ch. 51 requiring her to pay the said two instalments of the said taxes and informing her that in default of such payment, execution would issue against her goods and chattels. These notices are dated the 27th November 1877, and in the absence of proof to the contrary, must be held to have been served on that day. What did the plaintiff do on the receipt of these notices? She paid on the third of December, 1877, a few days after the notice, and nine days before a warrant of distress could at all be issued a first instalment of the said taxes without any protest of any kind; she then waited ten months and without any other notice or threat of any kind, again without protest, paid a second instalment of these taxes No warrant of distress was ever issued against her, B\u00e9darride ([195]). Then one month later again she Walks up to the city treasurer's office and pays $700 for a third instalment, without ever having been threatened with seizure for it; nay without ever even having been asked to pay it, and, it must not be lost sight of, with the full knowledge, or presumed knowledge, all this time, of the illegalities in the defendant's proceedings she now relies upon. Can this plaintiff now contend, under these circumstances that she made these payments under contrainte or fear? For the first one, perhaps, if alone, there might be a reasonable ground for such a contention, hut the two last ones it seems to me clear and the last one more particularly were made without contrainte or threats of any kind and as such were ratifications of the first or rather they reflect back on the first and indicate that it was equally made as voluntarily as possible. I must say that, in my opinion, the plaintiff should have taken her action after the first payment, instead of paying two other instalments ten and eleven months later. Her conduct as evidenced in the case establishes conclusively that she did not at all act under contrainte in the matter. I say then that even if the plaintiff did not owe the sums she so paid to the corporation, she could not now recover them back.\n1st. Because she did not pay through error.\n2nd. Because she did not pay under contrainte or compulsion.\nThis would dispose of the plaintiff's action, but, with the courts below, I go further, and say that, in this case, she did not prove that she did not owe the sums she paid, or, in other words, she did not prove that legal forms were threatened against her for an unjust or illegal cause.\nUnder the doctrine of implied ratification, the plain- tiff has, I have already remarked, by paying these taxes waived her right to impeach their legality upon any ground appearing on the simple inspection of the Corporation\u2019s proceedings:\nSi la nullit\u00e9 est apparente, l'ex\u00e9cution est toujours volontaire et ontra\u00eene n\u00e9cessairement la ratification ([196]).\nThere is nothing here to support the contention that the resolution and assessment roll were null d'une nullit\u00e9 absolue, they might have been voidable, and that is all. This also supports the consid\u00e9rant of the judgment of the Superior Court that,\u2014\nConsid\u00e9rant que Ia demanderesse n'a pas demand\u00e9 par sos conclusions Ia nullit\u00e9 do la resolution et des r\u00f4les de c\u00f4tisation en question mais qu'elle conclut seulement an remboursement dos sommes de deniers qu'elle a pay\u00e9es en plusieurs versements \u00e0 plusieurs rnois d'intervalle en vertu des dits r\u00f4les\nWhat is a nullity of non esse, can be treated as such in certain cases, Dumont v. Laforge ([197]), but what is simply voidable must be annulled, and is valid till so annulled as said by Mr. Justice Tessier, in Baylis v. The City of Montreal. The majority of the court there held, it is true, that the proceedings complained of in that case, were an absolute nullity, but they did not dissent from the law so laid down by Mr. Justice Tessier as to voidable acts.\nThe question of want of notice raised by the appellant before us is not opened to her. She did not allege it in her declaration; it does not appear before the face of the proceedings, and was not before the courts below. if she had invoked the want of notice as a ground of the action, the defendant might, perhaps, have proved that such notice was actually given.\nIn Garden Gully United Quartz Minino'' Co. v. McLister ([198]), in the Privy Council Sir Barnes Peacock delivering the judgment of the court, said:\nTheir lordships are not disposed to hold parties too strictly to their pleadings in the lower courts, but they consider that it would be an act of gret injustice to allow defences to be set up in appeal which have not been suggested or alluded to in the pleadings, or called to the attention of the courts below In Devine v. Holloway ([199]), it was also held in the Privy Council that an objection not raised in the court below cannot be taken unless it is patent upon the face of the proceedings so that the Appellate Court can take notice of the objection. In Shay v. Marshall ([200]) the House of Lords would not permit parties on appeal to raise objections which they did not raise in the court below. in Livingstone v. Rawyards Coal Co. ([201]) it was held per Lord Cairns in the House of Lords that \"it is not usual to argue points in this house that have not been argued in the court below.\"\nI refer also to Mackay v. Commercial Bank of New Brunswick ([202]), and to L'Union St. Joseph v. Lapierre, in this court ([203]). The recent case Firth ex parte, is also in the same sense.\nOn the resolution itself and the assessment roll made thereon I have very little to add to the remarks made by the learned judges of the Court of Queen's Bench or to the consid\u00e9rants of the judgment of the Superior Court. I will simply remark that the appellant seems to forget that with us :\nPoint d'int\u00e9r\u00eat, point d'action, pas de nullit\u00e9 sans grief. Les lois ayant principalement pour objet l'ordre public et la conservation des int\u00e9r\u00eats particuliers, (says Solon,) leurs dispositions n'ont et ne peuvent jamais avoir de l'importance qu'autant quo de leur inobservation dolt r\u00e9sulter un dommage quelconque: l'absence de tout pr\u00e9judice enl\u00e8ve \u00e0 une contravention toute sa gravit\u00e9, et ce serait m\u00e9conna\u00eetre la volont\u00e9 du l\u00e9gislateur et les r\u00e8gles de l'\u00e9quite que de faire r\u00e9sulter do cette contravention la nullit\u00e9 d'un acte ou d'une convention; aussi at-on toujours tenu pour certain qu'il n'existe pas de nullit\u00e9 sans grief .La maxime qu'il n'est point do nullit\u00e9 sans grief a pour objet do repousser une action dont le mobile est la chicane on Ia malice.([204])\nThis disposes of what seemed at the argument the strongest cause of nullity involved by the plaintiff against the corporation's proceedings, that is to say, the ground based on the fact that a sidewalk of four feet only could he made and not one of six feet as has been done. Far from its being demonstrated in any way that the plaintiff has any interest in complaining of this, it is proved that the six feet sidewalk actually cost less than the estimate made for a four feet one. So that the plaintiff complains of what turned to her benefit. How can she be admitted in a court of justice when she has suffered no grievance, when the corporation gave her more than she was entitled to. Then as said in Dillon ([205]) :\nA municipal corporation may ratify the unauthorized acts and contracts of its agents or officers, which are within the corporate powers, but not otherwise Ratification may be inferred from acquiescence after knowledge of all the material facts or from acts inconsistent with any other supposition. The same principle is applicable to corporations as to individuals.\nHere if the corporation did not order the six feet sidewalk, it certainly approved of it and ratified the surveyor\u2019s doings in accepting it. See Municipality v. Guillolle ([206]). So that the assessment made was perfectly legal.\nThe appellant invoked that part of the judgment of the Superior Court by which judgment was given against the corporation for the interest over paid by her, as admitting the principle that her action ought to be maintained. This at first sight would appear a contradicting in the judgment hut the defendant explained to us at the hearing that this part of it was given by consent.\nGWYNNE J.:\u2014\nIt cannot but be with the greatest distrust of my own judgment that I find myself unable to concur in the conclusion arrived at by so many learned Judges who have expressed their opinion upon the matter in contestation in this case as well in the courts of the Province of Quebec as in this Court. However as after the best consideration I have been able to give the case according to my understanding of it, and an earnest desire to concur with my learned brothers constituting the majority of this court, I find myself unable to do so, the parties litigant are entitled to an expression of my opinion whatever it may be worth. I understand the judgment of the court in effect to be that the payments made by the plaintiff, which she now seeks to recover back, must be regarded as having been made voluntarily by her, and that, therefore, they cannot be recovered back and that it is a matter of no importance whether the demand made upon her by the corporation of the city of Montreal was a legal demand or not. That is to say that it is a matter of indifference, in so far as the present action is concerned, whether or not the corporation exercised the powers conferred upon them by the statute in such a manner as to attach to the amount demanded the character of an assessment duly imposed by authority of law so as to constitute a debt due from the plaintiff to the corporation. It is upon this point in limine that my difficulty arises for whether or not the proceedings of the corporation were so conducted in accordance with the powers conferred upon them by the statute as to constitute the demand made by the corporation upon the plaintiff to be legally due from her in the character of an assessment lawfully imposed, appears to me to be an element in the consideration of the case before us which cannot be separated from it, and upon the answer to which, in the affirmative or the negative, the right of the plaintiff or of the defendants to succeed in this contestation wholly depends. If the proceedings of the corporation were not such as to make the sum demanded a legal debt or sum due from the plaintiff to the corporation in the character of an assessment lawfully imposed, I cannot give my assent to the proposition that the payment of a demand which was made upon the plaintiff as a legally imposed assessment which she was in law obliged to pay, and which demand was accompanied with the threat to levy the amount out of her property by summary process of law, which could have been done if the assessment had been legally imposed, can be regarded as a voluntary payment, if it should afterwards appear, as is now insisted, that the demand never had been legally imposed, and in point of fact, that the proceedings authorized by law, as necessary to be taken to constitute a legal valid assessment and to impose a liability upon the plaintiff to pay the amount demanded, never had been taken. Surely if in point of law the assessment was not imposed in accordance with the powers conferred upon the corporation it constituted no assessment and created no debt or sum due from the plaintiff to the corporation. In such case the demand upon the plaintiff was an illegal demand of a sum of money which the corporation had no right to receive, and the retention of a sum of money paid under the circumstances above mentioned cannot, as it appears to me, be justified and defended upon any principle having the sanction of equity and good conscience. The case appears to me to come within the article 1047 of the Civil Code which declares that he who receives what is not due to him through error of law or of fact, is bound to restore it. Laurent ([207]), in his observations upon the corresponding article No. 1376 of the Code Napoleon, says that the obligation to make restitution is the same whether the defendant received what he did receive in good or in bad faith that good faith in him who receives that which is not due to him does not permit him to retain that which he received ind\u00fbment; on the contrary, it imposes upon him a duty to repay it so soon as he learns that that the payment was indu. With the greatest deference for the opinions of the learned judges with whom it is my misfortune to be unable to concur, and with the utmost distrust, consequently, in my own judgment, I must, nevertheless, say that the character of voluntary payment cannot, in my opinion, be attributed to the payment made by The plaintiff in this case without a disregard of the above article of the C, C., which the very able, and, I may be permitted to add, to my mind, conclusive argument of the learned counsel for the appellant has convinced me does apply to, and has a most important bearing upon the decision of this case.\nThe material contents of the plaintiff's declaration, so far as it is necessary to set them out here, are as follows: The plaintiff alleges that she has paid to the defendants the sum of $2085 15, being the amount of a certain tax assessment levied on the plaintiff's property by the defendants in virtue of a certain special assessment roll, as follows, to wit :\u2014$946.25 the 3rd December, 1877, and $438.90 the 29th October, 1878 in virtue of a special assessment roll made by the city surveyor of the said city of Montreal, the defendants aforesaid, to defray one-half of the cost of laying sidewalks in front of the plaintiff's property on Dorchester street said assessment roll bearing date the 27th January, 1877, and the sum of $700.00 the 14th November, 1878, in virtue of another special assessment roll made by the said city surveyor to defray one-half of the cost of laying sidewalks in front of the Plaintiff's property on St, Catharine street. The evidence fails to shew with certainty that this last sum of $700000 was assessed for the cost of sidewalks but the defendant's plea admits that the whole sum of $2,035.15 in the plaintiff's declaration mentioned, of which the $700.00 is part, was charged and paid as assessed upon plaintiff for the sidewalks, as most probably it was, although not clearly made so to appear in evidence, in consequence perhaps of the admission in defendants' pleas. The declaration then alleges that the said tax was so paid to avoid the seizure and sale of the property belonging to the plaintiff, the said defendants having threatened the plaintiff with such seizure and then and there proceeding to collect such tax by means of seizure from the other parties mentioned in said assessment rolls. And the plaintiff alleges that the said assessment rolls are illegal null and void and the said City of Montreal thereunder had no right in law to assess the said plaintiff's property.\nThe city council of the city of Montreal adopted by resolution two reports the one of the road and the other of the finance committee of the council. The mode of adopting the reports appear to have been as follows: On the 81st May, 1875, the order of the day being read to consider reports from the road and finance committees to construct sidewalks in certain streets the following reports were brought up and read and on motion of alderman Nelson, seconded by alderman Davis it was resolved that the said reports be adopted.\nThe reports so adopted are set out in the declaration as follows: The road committee respectfully report :\u2014\nThat the question of sidewalks has recently engaged their attention and fully impressed with the necessity of doing away with the old and decayed method of planked footpaths, your Committee believe the time has come when an effort should be made to inaugurate a new system of good and substantial sidewalks in the city.\nIt will take many years, of course, before these can be laid ' throughout the city generally- and it is only gradually that this much needed improvement, can be obtained.\nAs the proprietors on the line of the streets where these new foot* paths are to he laid will undoubtedly receive a direct benefit from the improvement, your Committee believe they should bear a proportion\u2014say one-half of the cost thereof.\nYour Committee therefore recommend that it be resolved to lay in the coarse of this summer (eighteen hundred and seventy-five) a flag stone footpath or sidewalk in the following streets or sections of streets namely: (here follows the enumeration of several streets, including Dorchester street from Union Avenue to the city limits on both sides, and St. Catherine street from Bleury to Guy streets), and that the cost of said footpaths or sidewalks be borne and paid as follows: i. e.\u2014one-half by the Corporation, out of the loan, for street paving and permanent sidewalks, and the other half by the proprietors or usufructuaries of the real estate on each side of such streets public places, or squares, by means of a special assessment to be imposed and levied according to law, and in proportion to the frontage of their properties respectively.\nYour Committee further recommend that an appropriation of $79,623, being the amount of the accompanying estimates less the items per chain stone and flag-stone already appropriated, be made to your Committee for the purpose of said footpaths, and of the said loan, for street paving and permanent sidewalks, the whole nevertheless respectfully submitted.\nThe Finance Committee respectfully report that as directed by the Council, they have considered the accompanying report of the Road Committee recommending the laying of flagstone foot-paths in certain streets and on certain conditions therein mentioned of date the 30th April, ultimo and that they concur in the recommendation therein made with the exception of the streets, avenues, squares and places wherein the said foot-paths are to be laid which shall be as follows: (Here follows an enumeration of the places approved by the Finance Committee, including Dorchester street from corner of Beaver Hall terrace westward to the city limits and St. Catherine Street from Bleury street to Guy street.) Your Committee recommend that so amended, the said report of the Road Committee be adopted, the whole nevertheless respectfully submitted.\nThe declaration then proceeds to allege; That it is an the sole strength of the resolution of the City Council adopting the above reports of the said Road and Finance Committees of the said City Council; that the City Surveyor has proceeded to introduce in the said streets a new sidewalk, removing the one formerly existing which was in a good state of preservation, and in many parts thereof of durable and permanent materials, and using. the materials thereof without accounting for the same, and the said plaintiff alleges that at the time the said city caused the said sidewalks to be constructed in front of her said properties, the said plaintiff had good permanent serviceable sidewalks in front of her said properties, and the said plaintiff further alleges that the said re-solution as given above is altogether indefinite, and such as could only lead to the most arbitrary proceedings on the part of the official charged with the duty of carrying out the same. That while it orders the laying of a flag-tone footpath in Dorchester and St. Catherine streets, it does not determine the kind of stone the width of sidewalk or the quality of the work. That in the absence of a provision of the statute allowing the new system to be introduced gradually, the Council could not force the proprietors in said streets to pay the cost of one-half of the new sidewalks while the proprietors in other streets are wholly provided with sidewalks out of the city funds without any contribution on their part.\nThat moreover the said assessment has been passed on an illegal principle inasmuch as more has been charged plaintiff than the sidewalk has cost in proportion to frontage of plaintiff's said propeities, the plaintiff being charged a proportion of the cost of the sidewalk throughout the whole of said Dorchester and St. Catherine streets instead of the cost of the sidewalk actually laid in front of the plaintiff's properties. That in the aforesaid amount paid to defendants by plaintiff was included the sum of $269.59 for interest on the capital unpaid illegally charged to plaintiff by defendants at the rate of 10 per cent. That the plaintiff in virtue of the above allegations has a right to have the said sum of $2085.15 refunded to her with interest from the day of payment, wherefore the plaintiff prays that the said defendants be condemned to pay and satisfy her the said sum with interest from the date of payment\nTo this declaration the defendants plead\nThat in deciding that a sidewalk in stone or flags should be constructed on the streets turned and that the cost of such sidewalk should be borne one-half by the proprietors or usufrctuaries of the properties situated on the said streets, and that a special assessment should he imposed for that purpose according to law, and in proportion to the frontage of each such property, the City of Montreal acted within the limits of its corporate privileges and exercised a power which is in its nature legislative. That neither the City of Montreal nor the City Surveyor exceeded their authority in the matters aforesaid, and that in the making of the assessment roll all the formalities required by law were duly complied with, that the plaintiff was justly indebted to the defendants when she paid to the defendants the sum placed to her charge, as her part of the contribution to defray the half of the cost of the construction of the said sidewalks; that long before the institution of the present action the plaintiff has recognized and admitted the validity of the said assessment roll by paying to the defendants the sum of $2085155 the amount of her contribution.\nThat therefore the plaintiff cannot be heard to demand the recovery of the said sum as having been illegally paid to the defendants, and the allegations contained in her declaration are untrue.\nThe plaintiff joined issue upon this plea. Now, the plea, upon which issue is so joined, seems to me to rest the defence of the defendants wholly upon the legality of the proceedings of the Corporation of the City of Montreal so as to give to them the character and effect of an imposition, in its nature legislative, upon the plaintiff as a good and valid assessment of the amount demanded of her, so as to constitute that sum to be a debt due by the plaintiff capable of being levied by the defendants by process of law as a good and valid-tax. There seems to me to be no point here made that the payment was made voluntarily, and for that reason not recoverable whether the sum demanded as a tax was duly imposed or not. The payment is referred to solely as amounting to, as is contended, a recognition and admission of the validity of the assessment, which it cannot be, as it appears to me, if in truth the assessment was invalid, for an admission by implication of an assessment being valid, which in fact and in law was invalid, would, as it appears to me, to be so clearly erroneous as to constitute the payment from which the admission by implication is claimed to arise, a payment made in error within the provision of Article 1,047 of the Civil Code\nThe 192nd section of the Act of the Legislature of the Province of Quebec, 37 Vic., ch. 51 intituled: \"An Act to revise and consolidate the charter of the City of Montreal and the several Acts amending the same \" enacts that :\nIt shall be lawful for the Council of the said City to order by resolution the construction of flagstone or asphalt sidewalks or street grading in the said city, and to defray the cost of the said works or improvements out of the city funds, or to assess the cost thereof, in whole or in part as the said Council may in their discretion deem proper, upon the proprietors or usufructuaries of the real estate situate on each side of such streets, public places or squares, in proportion to the frontage of the said real estate respectively; and in the latter case it shall be the duty of the City Surveyor to apportion and assess in a book to be kept by him for that purpose, the cost of the said works or improvements or such part thereof as the said Council may have determined, should be borne by the said proprietors or usufructuaries upon the said real estate according to the frontage thereof as aforesaid, and the said assessment when so made and apportioned shall be due and recoverable, the same as all other taxes and assessments before the Recorder's Court.\nThe interposition of the Recorder's Court is for the sole purpose, as appears by the 88th section, to enable the City Treasurer upon the expiration of fifteen days from demand made upon each proprietor or usufructuary, for the amount so charged to him by the City Surveyor, in case of default being suffered in payment of such demand to obtain a warrant to issue out of the Recorder's Court, authorizing the levy of the amount by seizure and sale of the goods and chattels of the party charged.\nNow, can it be possible that, and must we hold that, when the Legislature authorized the Corporation to impose upon the owners of property in the city, so heavy a tax, as, judging from the amount charged to the plaintiff upon the two streets, upon which the property of which she is usufructuary for life is situate, the tax relied upon in this case as having been legally imposed is, it contemplated that the resolution or order authorizing the construction of the flagstone sidewalks . and assessing the owners of the adjoining properties for the whole of the cost of such sidewalks or for such part thereof as the Council of the city in their discretion should deem proper should be less certain as to the nature and extent of the work authorized and as to the amount of the liability in the nature of a tax to be imposed upon the owners of property in respect thereof than if the work had been authorized and the tax had been imposed by law? In which case the parties would be apprised of the proceedings being taken in the Council to tax them.\nCan it be possible that the Legislature contemplated that the proceedings of the Council to impose a special tax, in the interest of the public, upon a particular portion of the ratepayers of the city, should be so conducted, as to leave it in the power of the City Surveyor, or of any other person or persons other than the Council itself to determine the width and character of the sidewalks to be constructed and to leave it in his or their power to determine and in his or their discretion to vary the amount of the tax for which the owners of property subjected to the special rate should be liable? Can it be possible that the Legislature contemplated that the discretion which the Council was called upon to exercise in order to determine the amount of the cost of a contemplated work to be assessed upon the owners of the adjacent properties, should be exercised without any notice whatever being given to the parties to be affected, informing them of the amount contemplated to be assessed upon them for the work contemplated, so as to enable such parties to press their views before the Council before the resolution binding them should be passed, in order to give a proper direction to the discretion which the Council was called upon to exercise and to enable it intelligently to exercise that discretion?\nCan it be possible that the Legislature contemplated that the Council should have the power of imposing a burthen exceeding, as in this case, $3,200 upon the usufructuary for life, of unproductive property, wholly behind the back of the party to be affected, and by a mode of procedure admirably adapted to keep such party in ignorance of what was being done as affecting his interests until he should be served with a demand irreversible in its nature, which, unless paid would in fifteen days mature into an execution, against the levying under which no cause could by possibility be shown?\nCan it be possible that the Legislature contemplated that a proceeding which was given the force and effect of an irreversible judgment should be taken against any one without any notice whatever being given to such person until after the judgment should be obtained, and that the notice then given should be that an irreversible judgment had been obtained against him?\nIn my humble judgment the language of this 192nd section does not warrant us in imputing to the Legislature an intent so contrary to the plainest principles of natural justice. So autocratic an administration of a democratic institution never could have been contemplated. I profess not to prescribe any particular course of procedure as necessary to be taken by the Council prior to passing a resolution having the effect of imposing so heavy a burthen upon individuals; but, in my judgement, some notcie should be given to the parties to be affected by the resolution about to be proposed of the contemplated intention of the Council which would give to such parties the opportunity to have their views brought under consideration of the Council to guide them in the exercise of their discretion. The case of the present plaintiff is such as to seem to me to give great force to this opinion, for it does seem to be a great hard-ship, and one which by reason of the course adopted by the Council was most probably unknown to them, and which if known, might have affected the conclusion they would have arrived at, that a person being usufructuary only for life of property incapable of being, from the nature of her estate, made productive during her life, should be exposed to so grievous a burthen as that insisted upon as having been imposed upon her by a resolution of the intention to pass which she had no notice and from the effect of which she can have no relief, if the burthen has for its imposition the sanction of law, and this, although she can derive no possible benefit from the work for which she is so called upon to pay, otherwise than as one of the general public having occasion to use the sidewalks of the City of Montreal. But whether a party he or be not peculiarly benefited by such a work, I am of opinion that the passing by the Council of an order or resolution purporting to have the effect of imposing upon proprietors or usufructuaries - of real property in the City of Montreal, the whole or any portion of the cost of making flagstone sidewalks on the streets upon which such property is situate, without some prior notice of the contemplated intention of the Council to make such order or resolution is not in terms authorized by the act and that such a proceeding, is so contrary to the principles of natural justice that a resolution passed without such notice and opportunity being given to the parties to be affected, of being heard upon the matter, cannot, in the absence of express legislation, in unequivocal terms depriving them of their right to have such notice and opportunity, be given in a Court of Justice the sanction and authority of law. But the objections of the learned counsel for the appellant to the validity of the charge sought to be imposed upon the plaintiff do not rest here; his argument as I understood it, raises what appear to me to be two other very important questions, namely: First \u2014What is the proper construction to be put upon the report of the Road Committee of the Council, which is set out verbatim in the declaration? And secondly\u2014 What was the effect of the resolution of the Council which simply adopted that report? The short substance of the report of the committee, appears to me, to be that they believe the time has come when an effort should be made to inaugurate a new system of good and substantial sidewalks in the city and that as it would of necessity require many years before practical effect can be given to such a system, by having the sidewalks laid under it generally throughout the city, they recommend that a commencement be made in the year 1875 by applying the system in the first instance to certain streets named, and that the cost should be defrayed as follows, namely, one half by the Corporation and the other half by the proprietors or usufructuaries of the real estate on each side of such streets by means of a special assessment to be imposed and levied according to law, and in proportion to the frontages of their properties respectively, and they further recommend that an appropriation of $79,633 be made to the committee for the purpose.\nNow, it is an essential element of every good tax that it should be made to bear equally upon all persons similarly situated. When, therefore, the committee recommended that part of the system, which they proposed should be introduced should consist of a tax imposed upon the owners of property abutting on the sidewalks, it was very natural that they should recommend, as the first thing to be done, the adoption or inauguration or introduction by the city council of a new system in conformity with which the making of flagstone sidewalks throughout the city Should be regulated. The committee, however, enters into no details of the system\u2014that is left to the city council if it should be of opinion with the committee, that the time for the inauguration or introduction of a new system had arrived. The report, therefore, makes no suggestion as to what should be the width of the flagstone sidewalks to be laid in some streets and what in others. Naturally some, as for example the most public thoroughfares, would require wide sidewalks; in less frequented streets, narrow ones might be sufficient, and the amount of the tax to be imposed upon the owners of property by the council would necessarily vary in proportion to the width of the flagstone sidewalk ordered in front of his property. The recommendation of flagstone sidewalks being laid, in the particular streets named by the committee, at the charge to the owners of property of one-half of the cost thereof, except as a part of a system to be adopted, which should have the effect of imposing the tax equally upon all persons similarly situated, when from time to time the council should order flagstone sidewalks to be made, would be manifestly unjust. For example if the council in one year should order that a part of a street should have flagstone sidewalks laid at the whole and sole cost of the owners of property abutting on such sidewalk, and the council in another year should order that the flagstone sidewalks should be continued for a further distance on the same street for which the owners of property adjoining should pay only one-fourth of the cost and the council in another year should extend the sidewalks in the same street at the cost to the owners of property along such extended part, of one-half, and the council in another year should extend them still further, and defray the cost of such extension out of the general funds of the city that is to say, at the charge of all the ratepayers of the city; or if the Council should order in one year that in a particular street a sidewalk of stone should be constructed at the sole cost of the owners of the adjacent property on the street and the council in another year should order that in other streets equally public thoroughfares similar sidewalks should be laid at the cost to the owners of property in one street of one-third, in another of one-half and in another of one-fourth of the total cost and the balance to the general ratepayers; and if the council in another year should order that a similar sidewalk should be laid in an equally public thoroughfare, for which payment should be made wholly out of the general funds of the city that is to say at the cost of the ratepayers at large such works could not be said to be done in pursuance of any system, and such a mode of procedure being in its result so unequal in the charge imposed upon the several owners of property in the respective streets, would not have in it the essential element of a just tax; but what the report of the Road Committee contemplates plainly, as it appears to me, is the introduction of a system for the regulation of the laying flagstone sidewalks; that is to say, a plan or method, constant and uniform in its operation, and which, when applied, should bear equally upon all persons similarly situated, upon whom a tax for carrying it into operation should be levied.\nThe recommendation therefore, in the Report of the road committee, as to the streets upon which they suggest that the sidewalks should be made in the year 1875, must, in my opinion, be read as a recommendation that the new system, the inauguration of which they recommend, if, and when, it should be inaugurated by the council, should be applied in the first instance to the streets named, but the inauguration of the system with all its details as to the width of flagstones, accordingly as the streets should be great public thoroughfares or otherwise and all other details are left by the Report of the committee, which is silent upon these points to the J. Council to suggest and adopt.\nThe true construction of the Report, therefore, in my opinion is that it recommends a new system plan or method to be adopted by the council for the regulation in the future of all flagstone sidewalks, to be laid in the City of Montreal, and as part of such system that when it shall be applied to any street, the owners of property on such street shall be assessed for one-half the cost thereof but all other details of the system to be adopted are left to the Council to devise. Such a system should, in my opinion, provide for notice being given to the owners of property on the line of the contemplated improvement, of the nature and cost of such contemplated sidewalk, and of the amount to be charged in respect thereof to such owners for their half share respectively in such cost so as to enable the parties to be affected to be heard in case they or any of them should have any objection to offer to the passing of a resolution bringing the street upon which their property is situate within the adopted system, which objections when heard by the Council might have the effect of causing it in the exercise of its discretion, to defer putting the system into operation in the particular street then under consideration.\nThen secondly what is the effect of the resolution of the Council which simply adopts that report with-out more? Doubtless as is urged by the defendants in their plea all acts of the Council of the City of Montreal as of all municipal corporations authorizing work to be done at the cost of the Municipality, and especially such aots as are intended to have the effect of imposing a special tax or burthen upon a particular portion of the community, are in their nature legislative, and for that reason, to be properly conduced, should be conducted in a manner as analogous as circumstances will admit to that in similar cases adopted in Legislative Assemblies, and where a municipal Council adopts in practice a proceeding taken from the practice of a Legislative Assembly such proceeding should, in the municipal Council, have the the same effect and only the same effect given to it as the like proceeding would have given to it in the Legislative Assemby from whose practice the proceeding is taken. Now, in no Legislative Assembly, as far as I have been able to learn, is the adoption of the report of a committee regarded as a resolution ordering that to be done which the report recommends should be done. It amounts to no more than a concurrence in the recommendation, and an under-taking that the members of the Council adopting the report will pass the resolutions and give the orders and take all proceedings necessary to give effect to the recommendation of the committee. The adoption of a report of a committee by the Council would not as would an order and resolution in due form passed ordering to be done that which was recommended in the report, be binding upon the Council of the next year. The adoption, therefore, by the city Council of 1875 of the report of the road committee in the present case amounts, in my my opinion, to no more than this: that the Council concurred with the opinion of the committee that the time had arrived for the adoption and inauguration of a new system regulating the laying of sidewalks in the City of Montreal; but it left for future consideration what that new system in its details should be. The adoption of the report amounted, also, to a declaration of the concurrence of the council in the recommendation of the road committee that it should be part of the new system, that an assessment should be imposed upon the owners of the property, in the street where sidewalks should be made to the amount of the half of the cost of such sidewalks, and that that system should be first put into operation, and in the year 1875, upon the streets named; but by concurring in the recommendation that the owners of property in the streets named should be assessed for the half of the cost of laying flag stone sidewalks on these streets when such should be ordered, it did not in fact assess such property holders for any amount. By concurring in the recommendation that flagstone side walks should be laid in the particular streets named it did not order that the sidewalks should be made of any prescribed width or at all, and width certainly appears to me to be an essential element in a valid order directing a flagstone sidewalk to be laid, a portion of the cost of which was to be charged to the property owners on the street. By concurring in the recommendation of the committee that the sum of $79623 should be appropriated to the purpose recommended, it did not as it appears to me, make the appropriation so as to recluire the City Treasurer, upon the mere production of the resolution adopting the report of the road committee, to pay over such sum to anyone. By adopting the report of the road committee, the Council did not order the City Surveyor to lay down any sidewalks whatever in the streets named, and the City Surveyor appears to have had no other authority emanating from the Council whatever he may have had from the road committee for laying the sidewalks in question. There is nothing in the resolution adopting the report which can be construed into an order given by the Council for the construction of any sidewalks. In so far as any order of the Council is concerned the City Surveyor might have made the flagstone sidewalks, which he did lay down in the streets named of the width of twelve feet, or of eight feet, or of four feet at his pleasure ', the Council prescribed nothing, and what the 192nd section of the act says is that it shall be lawful for the Council to order by resolution the construction of flagstone side- walks, and that it shall be lawful for the counci to assess the cost thereof in whole or in part upon the proprietors of real estate. The duty of the City Surveyor does not come into action until the Council has by resolution ordered the work to be done and has assessed the cost thereof, in whole or in part, upon the proprietors of real estate. The width of the flagstone appears to me to he an essential element to be stated in a valid order and as to the assessment, the function of the City Surveyor, as it appears to me, is simply to apportion among the proprietors of real estate the proportion of the cost which the Council has by resolution assessed them for and such assessment should not as I have already said, be attempted to be imposed without some previous notice to the parties to be affected, The section which authorizes a thing to be done by resolution, which could only previously be done by by-law, cannot be construed as authorizing the Council to impose a tax upon particular individuals by a resolution of which they have had no notice. Now if the Council had proceeded by By-Law, as they - might have done notwithstanding the 192nd section of 87 Vic. c. 51 the adoption of the report of the road committee, followed by a By-Law read for the first time only, would have no validity to impose a tax upon the plaintiff. How then can the mere adoption of the report, without more, have a greater effect because the Council may under the 192nd section of the above act proceed by resolution instead of by By-Law Surely the power of the Council to order a thing to be done by resolution instead of by By-Law cannot give any additional force to the mere adoption by the Council of, the report of a committee. In my opinion, therefore, the resolution of the Council of the City of Montreal, adopting the report of the road committee as set out in the-declaration, cannot, upon any analogy derived from the proceedings of any legislative body, be said to be an order by resolution within the meaning of the 192nd sec. of 37 Vic., c. 51 authorizing the construction of the particular flagstone sidewalks which have been laid on the streets in question, and an assessment imposing a legal tax or burthen upon the plaintiff for any part of the cost thereof.\nThe only notice of the imposition of the tax, or of any intention to make plaintiff liable for any part of the cost of the sidewalk, which it appears she ever had, was at the foot of the demands served upon her agent after the construction of the sidewalks in the words following, signed by the City Treasurer :\nTake notice that having failed to pay the above mentioned sums within the time prescribed by public notice, you are hereby required within fifteen days from the date hereof to pay the same to me at my office, together with the costs of this notice and service thereof as below; in default whereof execution will issue against your goods and chattels.\nMontreal, 27th Nov., 1877.\nCosts\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026$0 10\nNotice\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..$0 20\n$0 30\n(Signed,) JAMES F. D. BLACK,\nCity Treasurer.\nIn my opinion upon receipt of this notice the plaintiff's agent was justified in assuming, and in fact did assume, that the Council of the corporation had taken all proceedings necessary to impose upon the plaintiff the obligation to pay the amounts demanded, which could and would be enforced as threatened in the notice, unless payment should be made; and having paid under such an impression, which, in my judgment, was for the reasons I have given erroneous, she is entitled to recover back the money which under the influence of such error both of law and fact she paid to the defendants, who, if my judgment be correct as to the invalidity of what is relied upon as an assessment the defendants had no legal right to demand of the plaintiff and as the defendants ought to have known that they had not taken proper proceedings to make the plaintiff liable for the amount demanded, I think she should recover interest from the respective dates of payment. The appeal therefore in my opinion should be allowed with a direction to enter judgment in the Superior Court for the plaintiff for the full amount with interest as above calculated and the costs in all the courts.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Barnard, Beauchamp & Creighton.\nSolicitors for respondents: Rouer Roy.\n[1] 2 Dorion's Q.

Ritchie, C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne, JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nWill, validity of.\u2014Insanity\u2014Legacy to wife,\u2014Error\u2014False cause\u2014 Question of fact on appeal, Duty of Appellate Court.\nP. L., executor under the will of the late W. R., sued W .C. \u00c1. curator of the estate of W. R. during the lunacy of the latter, to compel W. C. \u00c1. to hand over the estate to him as executor.\nAfter preliminary proceedings had been taken, E. R. the appellant moved to intervene and have W. R' s. last will set aside, on the ground that it had been executed under pressure by D. J. M., W. R's. wife, in whose favor the will was made, while the testator was of unsound mind. The appellant claimed and proved that D. J. M. was not the legal wife of W. R. she having another husband living at the time the second marriage was contracted. W. R., who was a master pilot, died in 1881, having made a will two years previously. His estate was valued at about $16,000. On the 4th October, 1878, W. R. made a will by which he bequeathed $4,000 and all his household furniture and effects to his wife J. M., $2,000 to his niece E. R., $1,000 to F. S. for charitable purposes and the remainder of his estate to his brothers, nephews, and nieces in equal shares. On the 8th of the same month he made another will before the same notary leaving $800 to his wife J. M., $400 to each of his nieces M. and E. R. and $400 to his brother with reversion to the nieces if not claimed within a year and the remainder to E. R. On the 27th November, 1878, W. R. made another, which is the subject of the present litigation, and by which he revoked his former wills and gave $2,000 to F. S. for the poor of the parish of St Bocha and the remainder of his property to his \" beloved wife J. M.\" On the 10th January following W. R. was interdicted as a maniac, and a curator appointed to his estate. He remained in an asylum until December, 1879, when he was released, and lived until his death with his niece E. R., sister of the appellant. Chief Justice Meredith upheld the validity of the will, and his decision was affirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada :\nHeld (1) [reversing the judgments of the courts below, Ritchie, C.J, and Strong, J., dissenting,] that the proper inference to be drawn from all the evidence as to the mental capacity of the testator to make the will of the 21st November, was that the testator, at the date of the making of the will was of unsound mind.\n(2.) That, as it appeared that the only consideration for the testator's liberality to J. M. was that he supposed her to be \"my beloved wife Julie Morin\" whilst at that time J. M. was, in fact, the lawful wife of another man, the universal bequest to J. M. was void through error and false cause.\n(3.) That it is the duty of an Appellate Court to review the conclusion arrived at by courts whose judgments are appealed from upon a question of fact when such judgments do not turn upon the credibility of any of the witnesses, but upon the proper inference to be drawn from all the \u00e9vidence in the case ([1]).\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for the Province of Lower Canada (appeal side) affirming a judgment of Chief Justice Meredith, of the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec.\nThis was an action by Pierre Lefran\u00e7ois, one of the respondents as executor to the last will and testament of the late William Russell, of the 27th of November, 1878, against Henry Charles Austin, to account for his administration as curator of Russell's property \"who before his death, had been interdicted for insanity.\nThe appellant, Elizabeth Russell, a niece of the deceased, intervened in the cause, and both as one of his heirs at law and as a special legatee by a former will, impugned the validity of the will of the 27th of November. 1879 on the grounds :\u2014 1st That Russell was not of sound mind when he made this will.\n2nd. That the will did not express his true intentions, but was the result of undue influences exercised by Julie Morin, one of the respondents, who, taking advantage of the testator's mental and physical weakness and incapacity caused this will to be made in her favor.\n3rd. Because the will was made through error as to the quality of the universal legatee, Julie Morin) who was not the wife of Russell but a married woman who lived with him in adultery.\n4th. That the will was against good morals.\n5th That the formalities required by law had not been observed.\nAfter the petition of the appellant to be permitted to intervene had been received Julie Morin, the sole universal legatee named in the will, was made a party to the action, and both she and Lefrancois separately contested the intervention by a general denial of all the allegations of the appellant s petition.\nA great number of witnesses were examined in the cause as to the condition of the testator's mind when he made his will and the Superior Court came to the conclusion that the will was valid, and dismissing the petition of the appellant, it ordered the defendant Austin to render an account of his administration of the testator's estate and property. The will was as follows:\n\" I will and direct that all my just debts be paid and satisfied as soon as possible after my decease.\n1 give and bequeath unto reverend J. P. Sexton, priest of St. Roch of Quebec, to be used as he may deem fit and proper for the benefit of the poor inhabitants of the city of Quebec the sum of two thousand dollars\n\"And as to the rest and residue of my Said estate of which I may die possessed, I give and bequeath the same unto my beloved wife, Julie Morin, as her own absolute property.\n\" I hereby nominate and appoint Pierre Lefrancois, of Levis, culler, as executor to this my last will and testament, in whose hands I do hereby divest myself of the whole of my sail property, giving him power to prolong and carry out the execution of this my said last will beyond the term allowed by law, hereby revoking all former wills and codicils at any time heretofore by me made, and declaring the present to be my only true will and testament.\"\nThe evidence is reviewed at lenghh in the judgments hereinafter given.\nMr. Irvine, Q.C., and Mr. cook for appellants, and Mr. F. Andrews, Q.C., Mr. Bethune, Q.C., and Mr Filzpatr\u00edck for respondents.\nThe points relied on and cases cited, appear sufficiently in the judgments.\nRITCHIE, C.J. :\u2014\nI have given to this case very considerable and anxious consideration, and having had an opportunity of reading the judgment of Mr. Justice Strong, with which I entirely concur, I have come to the conclusion that this appeal ought to be dismissed. I cannot discover anything to justify this court in reversing the judgment of the Superior Court and of the Court of Queen's Bench. On the contrary, I concur with Mr. Justice Strong that on the whole evidence taken together the balance of that evidence is in favor of the capacity of the testator to make the will at the time and in the manner in which he did. I cannot discover from the evidence that the testator was under any delusion that could have influenced the testamentary disposition he made of his estate by his will, nor anything to show that at the time he directed the preparation of the will, and at the time he executed it he was incompetent to manage his own affairs, or that he did not fully understand the character and effect of what he was doing nor can I discover any evidence that Julie Morin exercised any undue control over him or that he was in any way unduly influenced or intimidated; on the contrary, the evidence, I think, satisfactorily shows that the making of the will, and the disposition of his property as contained therein, were his own spontaneous acts, and i think that the strong evidence of the notaries before whom the will was executed (they performing a public duty in the preparation of wills) and the evidence of the other transactions before other notaries and with other persons with whom the testator transacted important business involving large amounts before about the time and after the making of the will, very conclusive.\nOn this point the case has been so fully discussed and the evidence so thoroughly analyzed, that I have only a few words to add.\nI cannot but think that the learned Chief Justice in the .Appellate Court below attaches too much weight to the consideration which seems also to have impressed Chief Justice Meredith, viz. :\u2014 that this will was a very unjust will towards the niece. They do not, it appears to me, give sufficient consideration to the position of Julie Morin in reference to the testator I think there is nothing in this case which could lead the mind of any party to the conclusion that at the time Julie Morin contracted marriage with the testator, either she or the testator had any idea that she was not in a position, free from her previous marriage engagements and in a position to enter into an honest bonu tide and legitimate marriage contract with the testator. I think also they have not thoroughly appreciated the condition of the testator\u2014that he was a man in years and afflicted \"with a serious cutaneous disorder of a very aggravated, painful character\u2014some of the witnesses speaking of his sufferings as intense and his sores something horrible to look at\u2014necessarily therefore requiring a agreat deal of care and attention at the hands of those with whom he was residing They also do not appear to have considered the fact, that when he made his marriage settlement on Julie Morin, he only provided for her receiving $400. I think it not unreasonable to assume in accordance with what is mentioned in several cases, that this small amount was in all probability, fixed with a view, considering the respective ages of the parties, that the wife might be dependent upon the will he would make and not be altogether independent of her husband, with a view of securing that attention and care he so much needed.\nI think also the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Queen's Bench for whose opinion I have the most profound respect, did not consider sufficiently the just claims of the wife, on the one hand, and on the other that the conduct of the niece to this old man was not such as to secure a continuance of his favor but that on the contrary he had ceased to retain his affection for her; and while there is not a particle of evidence in this case to show that there was the slightest unfair control used by Julie Morin over the testator the evidence of the parties as to the execution of the will in favor of the niece shows the direct opposite. The niece on that occasion was received kindly by the uncle, who evidently had if the testimony is true, just cause of complaint against her, because she had, contrary to his commands introduced into his house, as an associate a person towards whom, he, rightly or wrongly, thought he had cause to entertain feelings of great hostility, and who also, no doubt, felt much annoyed at her opposition to his marriage\u2014notwithstanding which, when she comes to him he receives her kindly, gives her $500, and then seeks that she shall become reconciled to Julie Morin, who was living with him and believed by him to be his wife. Instead of responding to the wishes of her uncle, she, on the contrary, exhibits the greatest hostility and reluctance to any compromise or any terms of friendship with Julie Morin, and while apparently Willing to make a will in her favor he did not wish to do so without the consent of his wife.\nNaturally enough, she, for whom provision had been made only to the extent of $400 by the marriage settlement, does not appear to have approved of the contemplated will, but though disapproving, she does not appear to have interposed any obstacle to the execution of the will, or attempted in any manner to control or intimidate the testator.\nMiss Russell's account of what then occurred is as follows :\u2014\nAfter the will had been read to Mr. Russell, he said: \"I must ask my wife's permission to sign it.\" He went into the kitchen and spoke to Mrs. Robitaille. He came back and said, \" She will not permit me to sign that will.\" 1 said, \" What was the use of bringing Mr. Austin here and giving him all that trouble if you did not intend to sign it.\" Be went back again and scpoee to Mrs. Robita\u00eflle. I heard her say to him \" Je ne veux pas, laissez moi tranquille.\" My uncle returned and said she would not allow him. I said \" Well uncle will you not do something for me, you know I am not strong and cannot work \" He then took the pen and said \" I do not care I will sign it.\" My uncle took the pen and signed the will in presence of Mr. Austin and Mr DeBeaumont.\nAfter it was executed, he again tries to bring about a reconciliation between his wife and his niece but the niece shows no disposition to conciliate the old man but actually refuses to shake hands with Julie Morin. Miss Russell's description of the last scene of that interview is as follows :\u2014\nMy uncle went into the kitchen and seated himself alongside of Mrs. Robitaille. He asked me to go into the kitchen and speak to Mrs. Robitaille. I told him I would not. He said: \"Come and speak to her for my sake, for she will punish me for what I have done today.\" I was all alone with my uncle. I went into the kitchen. I found Mrs. Robitaille there, and her sister Madame Roy and also my uncle. He asked me to shake hands with Mrs. Robitaille. I refused. He insisted upon my doing so. I said: \" I will do so to please you.\" Mrs. Robitaille said, reaching out her hand: i On ne refuse pas de donner la main \u00e0 un chien.\" She gave me her hand and I took it. X kissed my uncle and on going away, I said: \" Will you permit me to come back and see you, as you are ill?\" He said, (i I will see.\" That is all that took place in the kitchen.\nIt is not wrong for a person in Julie Morin's position, by reasoning or persuasion, to obtain a will to be made in her favor if she does not coerce the testator, she has a right to exercise legitimate influence by persuasion to induce him to make a will in her favor, though there is no evidence that such took place in this case And was it not more reasonable that a will should be made in her favor than that a will should be made to cat her off with a nominal sum she who for days, nights and years cared for him when suffering from that grievous, loathsome disease, not only painful to him, but trying and offensive to the nurse? Can it be said that a will in favor of a wife so situated was unnatural or unreasonable? Who had the most claim on him the niece or the wife? If there is any balance, in my opinion, the weight is decidedly in favor of the person who believed herself and whom he believed to be his wife and who appears to have faithfully discharged towards him the duties of a wife. 1 think, under all the circumstances, considering the way in which the will was made, not made when she was present, but made before men whose sworn duty it was not to. permit the testator to execute a will if they saw the least sign of insanity or incapacity to make the will, or had any reasonable grounds for supposing that such insanity or incapacity existed, and considering that, although the appellant is now setting up that the testator was incapable to make a will in favor of Julie Morin, she is contending, notwithstanding, that a few days previous he had perfect capacity to make a will and give his property to the niece. when all this evidence, on which they now seek to establish incapacity, was just as patent and known to them as it is today the will may have been the result of regard for Julie Morin, or of gratitude for the care and attention bestowed on him by her, or it may have been the result of persuasion on her part, or possibly all combined; but I can discover no evidence of illegitimate influence or pressure, overpowering or controlling the will of the testator, nor any kind of coercion or fraud practiced on him. On the contrary, he appears to have acted freely and independently, as his own will and pleasure dictated, and while his niece may have had strong claims on his affection and bounty, the disposition in favor of his wife to her exclusion was certainly a will in favor of one having a primary legitimate claim to his gratitude and testamentary consideration and bounty and as Chief Justice Meredith suggests, may be fairly attributable to the care and devotion with which it is proved she nursed, night and day, for a period of more than a year, a person sick and suffering, and whom she regarded as her husband; and such a will cannot be said to have been made to the exclusion of the natural object of the testator's bounty.\nI can come to no other conclusion than that upon the whole testimony, there was evidence of a disposing capacity, and that, at any rate, there is no such overwhelming evidence of incapacity as would warrant this court, under the authorities, in reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, confirmed, as it is, by four out of the five Judges of the Court of Queen's Bench. In addition to this, I agree entirely with my brother Strong, in his view of the law which should govern this case. I think, also, if there was \" error,\" it is not competent on the record in this case for this court now to reverse the judgment on that ground.\nI am sorry to differ with the majority of the court, on a case of this kind, but I must conscientiously express the honest conclusion to which my mind has been brought, after a careful consideration of all the circumstances.\nI do not feel it necessary, as I said before, to refer to any of the other evidence because it has been so elaborately gone into in the curses below, especially by the learned Chief Justice of the Superior Court.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nI am unable to concur in the judgment of the majority of the court. The learned and experienced judge before whom this cause was heard in the court of first instance, and in whose presence several of the witnesses were examined, found that the testator, William Russell when he made the will of the 27th November, 878, which has been impugned by the appellant, was possessed of sufficient mental capacity for the performance of that act, and that the will he then made was not the result of any fraudulent practices, solicitations, or suggestions.\nIn the Court of Queen's Bench that judgment was affirmed by four of the five judges of whom that court was composed The question regarding the testamentary capacity of the testator being entirely one of fact, and depending altogether on the appreciation of the evidence of witnesses whose testimony was conflicting, I am of opinion that we ought not, sitting in a second Court of Appeal, to disturb the finding of the primary court, confirmed, as it has been, by a large majority of the first Court of Appeal. in the case of Gray v. Turnbull, ([2]) Lord Chelmsford most distinctly affirms this principle as one applicable to appeals to the House of Lords in cases from Scotland. He says :\nIf there is to be an appeal on questions of fact (and I regret that there should be such) I think this principle should be firmly adhered to, namely: that we must call on the party appealing to show us irresistibly that the opinion of the judges on the question of fact was not only wrong, but entirely erroneous. .\nIn Hay v Gordon ([3]) the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council recognise the same rule as applicable to that jurisdiction. They say :\nTheir lordships are not unmindful that they have on more than one occasion laid it down as a general rule, subject to possible exceptions, that they should not reverse the concurrent findings of two courts on a question of fact.\nIn Lambkin v. S. Eastern R Co. ([4]), the Judicial Committee re-affirm the same principle as follows\nWith respect to the verdict being against evidence, it appears to their lordships, as indeed they have before intimated, that the question of negligence being one of fact for the jury, and the finding of the jury having been upheld, or at all events, not set aside, by two courts, it is not open under the ordinary practice to the defendants.\nIn the case of the Picton ([5]) the learned Chief Justice of this court in giving judgment states the rule just adverted to with approbation, and applies it in a case not nearly so strong as the present. In that case the Chief Justice also refers to several authorities collected from English reports in admiralty and other appeals, affirming the rule in question. Santacana Y. Aloy v. Ardevol ([6]); Reid v. Steamship Co. ([7]); Penn v. Bibby (7[8]); Bali v. Ray ([9]) The Glannibanta ([10]) Bigsby v. Dick-son ([11]). And in the same case the judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne contains the following passage : Sitting in a Court of Appeal we should be satisfied beyond a doubt of the incorrectness of this finding before we should reverse it\nSuch, an interference upon a second appeal cannot be justified by any presumption that the second appellate court is in any better position to give a judgment than were the two preceding courts, for that presumption is. as regards the original court at least, entirely the other way and therefore the policy of the law should be to discourage appeals on questions of fact, where there is anything like a balance of testimony, as useless and vexatious. Speaking for myself, I recognise in the rule laid down in the cases referred to in the Privy Council and House of Lords, one binding upon this court, and one which I shall feel compelled to follow, until the court of last resort adjudges otherwise The unsatisfactory consequences which a contrary practice may lead to, are sufficiently exemplified in the result of the present appeal. The effect of the judgment now pronounced by this court being that this cause the decision of which depends altogether on the credit to be accorded to one set of witnesses rather than to another, is ultimately decided for the appellant by the judgments of five judges against those of seven (including the judge who presided at the trial) whose finding is in favor of the respondent.\nWhilst relying on the rule I have adverted to I quite agree that there may be cases of gross error in drawing inferences from facts established by evidence beyond dispute, in which even second courts of appeal may be warranted in reversing, but it is only in such a class of cases that the jurisdiction should be exercised. A case, like the present, depending entirely on the weight of evidence when there is anything like a balance of testimony, can never be said to form an exception to the general rule, which has for its support the great weight of authority already mentioned. Further, I am of opinion, after the most attentive consideration which I have been able to give to the facts of the case as they appear Ann proof, taken in connection with the law as laid down in the passages from Laurent and Demolombe referred to in the judgment of Mr Justice Cross, and in the case of Banks v. Goodfellow in the English Court of Queen's Bench ([12]), that the conclusion of the learned Chief Justice of the Superior Court was entirely right, and if I were compelled to try over again the issues of fact, which he had to dispose of, I should unhesitatingly find, as he has done, that the appellant has wholly failed in establishing the testamentary incapacity of William Russell, at the time he made the impeached will of the 27th November 1878.\nBut, entertaining lie opinion already expressed, that we ought not to disturb the judgment of the two courts which have already dealt with the questions of facts involved in the appeal I do not feel called upon to enter upon any analysis of the evidence for the purpose of demonstrating the correctness of these decisions, for I prefer to rest my judgment entirely upon the inadmissibility of any further controversy in this court on the question of the testator's sanity.\nIt is said, however, that independently of the testator's incapacity, the disposition in favor of the respondent as universal legatee is void upon the ground of error or false cause inasmuch as the testator describes her as \u201cJulie Morin, his dear wife \" when she was in truth at that time the wife of another man.\nThis point does not appear to have been seriously urged before the Chief Justice of the Superior Court, though it was taken in the Court of Queen's Bench, where all the learned judges, except the Chief Justice, agreed in repelling it. I am of opinion in the first place that it is inadmissible in the present state of the pleadings. The declaration filed by the appellant, does not libel this as a ground for invalidating the legacy to her neither does it take any conclusions founded upon this pretension of error or false cause, and at this stage of the action I do not think we ought to permit an amendment of the record for the purpose of raisins the objection. Further, it appears to me that the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench was, for the reasons stated in the opinion of Mr. Justice Ramsay, entirely correct. The great preponderance of authority appears to be in favor of the law as stated by Furgole ([13]), who founding himself upon the Digest ([14]), De Con. et Demonstr. \" sed plerumque doll exceptio locum habebit si probetur alias legaturus non fuisse,\" says that when a testator gives a legacy to a legatee or institutes as heir a person whom he describes as a relation (other than in the case of the institution of a son as heir ) it is not to be presumed that the relation or quality of the person was the final or determining cause, and that, therefore, the disposition is not to be considered as null if the person named afterwards turns out not to be related to the testator in the manner described, though it is open to the parties opposing the will or legacy to prove that the erroneous supposition of relationship was the sole determining cause, or, in the words of the text cited, a alias legaturus non fuisse.\" The case of the institution of a son as heir is said to stand on a different ground\nParce quo la fausse opinion de la filiation est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e la cause finale de l'institution, et que sans cette qualit\u00e9 le testateur n'aurait pas dispose en sa faveur [Furgole, loc. cit.]\nThis distinction of the case Of the son is I apprehend to be explained by the consideration, that the Roman Law which was the law of the \"pays de droit \u00e9crit\" with reference to which Furgole wrote, required for the validity of the testament that an heir should be instituted, and further made the testament inofficious, if a son was passed over without being instituted, or in -, express words and for cause disinherited. It is true that Menochius, in his treatise, \" de Presumptionibus,\" to which my brother Taschereau has referred, says presumption of error is applicable in a case exactly like the present, where the testator gives to a person described as his wife who afterwards appears not to have been his wife but the commentators and writers both on the Roman and French law, who state the rule the other way, including Muhlenbruch ([15]), Warnhoenig ([16]), Demolombe, Trait, des Donat. & Test. ([17]), Duranton ([18]) and Troplong ([19]), (who all agree with Furgole), are so clear and decisive in the contrary opinion, and the reasons they give are so strong that, founded as they are on the clear words of the text in the digest the single authority of Menochius ought not to outweigh them.\nThese writers show that it is not to be presumed from the mere statement of the quality of the legatee that it was the sole and determining cause of the disposition or in the words of the law cited from the digest, that otherwise the legacy would not have been given, and further that if the quality is not to be considered as the final cause of the testator's liberality but if that may have been influenced by personal affection or other causes the error is not to be considered fatal. They further establish that in case of doubt the presumption is to be such as will uphold the disposition ut res magis valeat quam pereat.\nTroplong, particularly in his Commentary on Donations and Testaments puss this very clearly in the following extracts: No. 503 : Mais si la qualit\u00e9 n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 la seule consideration determinante, si l'affection personnelle s'\u00e9tait m\u00eal\u00e9e \u00e0 In lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9, on ne pourrait plus dire qu'il y a eu erreur fondamentale dans la disposition.\nNo. 384:\nMenochius sembee croire qu'il suffit que la cause soit exprim\u00e9e pour qu'elle doive \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme finale. Cette opinion est avec raison repouss\u00e9e pal Furgole qui s'appuie sur les termes m\u00eames de la loi 7280 d\u00e9j\u00e0 cit\u00e9e. D'ailleurs, dans le doute il faut toujours se decider pour la parti qui tend \u00e0 faire valoir la disposition. Or, Ia cause impulsive est plus favorable puisque malgr\u00e9 sa fausset\u00e9 elle ne porte pas atteinte aux legs. Il semble donc que la cause doit \u00eatre r\u00e9put\u00e9e impulsive, \u00e0 moins qu'il ne r\u00e9sulte clairement qu'elle est finale.\nApplying these principles of interpretation to the present case we must presume that the proposed relationship was not the sole cause which induced the testator's liberality, but that he was also influenced by his personal affection for the respondent. I come therefore on this part of the case also to the same conclusion as that arrived at by the Court of Queen's Bench. Although I admit English authorities ought not to be decisive on this head, so far as any question of law is involved (for, in that respect, it must of course depend entirely upon the rule of the French as derived from the Roman law,) yet, as it has been shown to be a question of interpretation, rather than one of law, it is not immaterial to notice that the English Court of Chancery has adjudged the question which arises here, the legacy to a person described by the testator as his wife and afterwards proved not to be his wife, in the same way as Troplong decides it, namely: that error is not to be presumed and the legacy is not vitiated by the false description of the legatee. This was the decision of the Master of the Rolls in the case of Re Pett's Will ([20]); See also Schloss vs. Stiebel ([21]) Giles vs. Giles ([22]) Theobald on Wills ([23]). Further, the appellant, Elizabeth Russell, sueing as she does, not as one of the testator's coheirs, but merely as a particular legatee under the will of the 8th October, 1878, is not qualified to raise this objection. A decision in favor of the appellant founded on this pretence of error or false cause alone, of course supposes the will of the 27th November, 1878, to be in other respects a good will, for, on no principle that I can understand could it be said that the invalidity of the disposition in favor of Julie Morin, as universal legatee, contained in the will of the 27th November on the ground of false cause or error rendered the whole of that will null so as to avoid the legacy to the Rev. Mr.. Sexton and the clause of revocation contained in it; certainly the whole will could not for this reason be set aside in the absence of the Rev. Mr. Sexton who is not a party to the action. And if this be so it revokes all former wills, thus leaving this pretension one which can be only set up by the heirs ab intestato. Then it does not appear of what persons this class of heirs is composed and at all events they are not all before the court as they ought to be, before we could declare the nullity of the legacy to the respondent for the cause alleged.\nI am of opinion the appeal should be dismissed with costs\nFOURNIER, J., concurred with Taschereau, J.\nHENRY J. :\nAfter a full consideration of the circumstances in evidence in this case I have arrived at the conclusion that on two issues raised, the appellant is entitled to the judgment of the court. 1 had some difficulty in arriving at that conclusion during the argument; but, after a very careful consideration of the evidence I think that it sustains the position which has been taken by my brother Gwynne, as to the incapacity of the party to make the will in favor of Julie Morin, which is set up in this action. I need not repeat what my learned brother has so well and so exhaustively stated in regard to the position of Russell at and before the time when he made the will. Although on the occasion he appeared to the learned gentlemen in whose office the will was made, as being perfectly sound, he made a remark before he got to his own house, to a party which would show clearly that he was not at all right in his mind. He was asked had he made his will? He said he had. He was asked why he had made it and he answered that if he did not do so his life was not safe. Here is a fact stated immediately on his making the will, which to a certain extent groes to confirm the testimony that is given to sustain the position that when he made it he was not in his right mind or that he was acting under coercion from fear of personal consequences. I take the same view precisely in regard to his conduct in his dealings with St. Michel that my learned brother has taken and taking it in all its bearings, I think that he was not, at the time of making his will, in his right mind. Now, if the evidence ended here, we might possibly entertain some doubt, but when in a very short time afterwards, we find that, on the application of Julie Morin, he was himself taken up as a lunatic and confined as such we can easily trace back from that circumstance to the transactions which he was concerned in previously and come to the conclusion that at the time he made the will he was not in his right mind. It is a principle in the law of evidence, that, if it is once shown that a party is not in his right mind in reference to a future transaction, the onus is thrown upon the party who wants to sustain the validity of that transaction to show that, although not at one time in his right mind, he had recovered and was compos mefitis. Now the evidence on behalf of Julie Morin, not only does not show this but shows the very opposite. I need not repeat what has been so well said in regard to the evidence which has been given on this point.\nIn reference to the other point, viz.: admitting Rus. sell was in his right mind when he made the will is that will binding, and did it convey to Julie Morin the property which she claims under it? - It appears to me, from a reference to the authorities both those that are binding in Quebec and those that have been considered binding in France, and even going back to the Roman authorities that a legacy made to a party whom the testator considered to be his wife at the time but who was not is not valid in law. we are not called upon to decide this case upon any principles of English law, but according to the law in force in Quebec; and I have arrived at the conclusion that according to that law even if the testator were in his sound mind when made his will, and bequeathed a legacy to one whom he honestly believed to be his wife at the time but who was not, such legacy is void.\nFor these reasons, I think the appeal should be allowed, and that the judgment of this court ought to be in favor of the appellant. There are equities in the case in favor of Julie Morin, and a great deal might be said why it would be desirable that our decision should be otherwise but we are not entitled to take them into consideration if we come to the conclusion that the law prevents our consideration of them. TASCHEREAU, J.:\u2014\nL'action en Cette cause fut institu\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e Le Fran\u00e7ois, en sa qualit\u00e9 d'ex\u00e9cuteur du testament du d\u00e9funt William Russell, en date du 27 Nov. 1878, r\u00e9clamant la succession du dit Russell contre Henry Charles Austin, curateur \u00e0 la personne et aux biens du dit Russell qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 interdit pour insanit\u00e9 d'esprit. Apr\u00e8s le retour de cette action en Cour, la pr\u00e9sente appelante obtint la permission d intervenir pour contester la validit\u00e9 du dit testament, et mit en cause par son action Julie Morin, une des intim\u00e9es, qui \u00e9tait institu\u00e9e legataire universelle par ce testament\nLe jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieuee rejeta la contestation de la pr\u00e9sente appelante et d\u00e9clara le dit testament bon et valide. Ce jugement fut confirm\u00e9 par la Cour du Banc de la Reine. Le Juge en Chef Sir A. A. Dorion, diff\u00e9rant.\nLes raisons invoqu\u00e9es devant nous, contre ce testament et le legs universel fait \u00e0 Julie Morin par icelui sont virtuellement r\u00e9duites \u00e0 deux savoir: 1 L'insanit\u00e9 d'esprit du testateur; 20 L'erreur du testateur quant \u00e0 Julie Morin, Russell la croyant lors de la confection de ce testament, son \u00e9pouse l\u00e9gitime, tandis qu'en fait elle ne l'\u00e9tait pas, le premier mari de la dite Julie Morin \u00e9tant alors encore vivant.\nLe legs universel fait par ce testament du 27 Novembre 1878 (et le testament luim\u00eame peut\u00eatre) sontils nuls par erreur? Cest-\u00e0-dire Russell a-t-il test\u00e9 en faveur de Julie Morin parce qu\u2019il la croyait sa femme? At il test\u00e9 en faveur de madame Russell son \u00e9pouse ou bien en faveur de madame Robitaille? A-t-il sciemment donn\u00e9 ses biens \u00e0 Ta femme de Robitaille, commune en biens avec son mari, c'est-a-dire a-t-il voulu donner ses biens \u00e0 Robitaille? E\u00fbt-il, lui, Russell, test\u00e9 en faveur de cette femme, si Robitaille son mari, fut survenu le 27 Novembre an matin? On en d'autres mots quand Russell dii dans son testament : Je donne \u00e0 mon \u00e9pouse bien aim\u00e9e, Julie Morin \" doiton voir la appos\u00e9e a sa lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 Ia condition que cette Julie Morin est vraiment son epouse? Peut-on dire que si cette Julie Morin n'\u00e9tait pas alors et n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 son \u00e9pouse l\u00e9gitime, Russell aurait ainsi test\u00e9 en sa faveur? Il me semble que ces questions doivent se r\u00e9soudre en faveur de l'appelante.\nSans doute comme le disent Furgole et Demolombe, sur l'erreur comme cause de nullit\u00e9 des testaments, on ne peut \u00eatre trop prudent et trop r\u00e9serv\u00e9 pour admission do cette cause do nuflit\u00e9 et ii faut d\u00e9montrer quo le disposant n'aurait pas fait la lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 sil n'e\u00fbt pas \u00e9t\u00e9 dans cette erreur. Mais, ici, il me semble qu'il ressort de toute la cause, et du testament luim\u00eame, que Russell n'a fait cette lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 \u00e0 Julie Morin qu'uniquement paree qu'il la croyait sa femme. Et le fait que lui et elle \u00e9taient lore de la date du testament, de bonne foi, no me parait ici d'aucune cons\u00e9quence. La question do fait \u00e0 \u00e9tablir par l'appelante est l'erreur de Russell sur la qualit\u00e9 do Julie Morin, et qu'il a fait ce testament parce qu'il la croyait sa femme.\nLe faitque Julie Morin \u00e9tait alors aussi dans l'erreur, no peut affecter la cause sons notre droit civil les autorit\u00e9s sont unanimes \u00e0 enseigner que, si, en fait, ii est \u00e9tabli que le testateur n'a legu\u00e9 \u00e0 une personne qu'en consid\u00e9ration d'une qualit\u00e9 qu'il lui supposait, qu'il apparaisse que le testateur \u00e9tait dais l'erreur quant \u00e0 cette qualit\u00e9 do la personne en faveur de qui ii atest\u00e9 la disposition est nulle ([24]). Dans Merlin ([25]) Ia doctrine sur la mati\u00e8re est clairement r\u00e9sumee comme suit.\nApr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9tabli, qu'en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, un legs, accompalli\u00e9 d'une fausse demonstration du l\u00e9gataire, n'est pas rendu nul \u00e0 cause de cette fausse demonstration l'article ajoute :\nLa fausse demonstration pourrait cependant emporter Ia nullit\u00e9 du. Iegs, si elle avait sa source dans une erreur du testateur et b il existait de fortes raisons de croire que celuici aurait dispose autrement dans le cas o\u00f9 il e\u00f9t \u00e9t\u00e9 mieux instruit. 3?ar exemle que Titius, dans la fausse opinion que M\u00e9vius est son fils, lui fasse un legs con\u00e7u en cette forme: \" Je donne et legue telle chose \u00e0 M\u00e9vius \"mon cher fils;\" il est certain que le l\u00e9gataire\u00e6e pourra rien pr\u00e9tendre. parceque le testateur n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 porte \u00e0 disposer en sa faveur, que par la persuasion que c'\u00e9tait son fils, et que cette qualit\u00e9 n'existe pas. C'est la decision expresse de Ia loi 5, C. de testamentis, et de la loi 4 C. De hoeridibus instituendis. La loi 7 de ce dernier titre dispose do m\u00eame par rapport \u00e0 celui qui a institu\u00e9 comme son fr\u00e8re une personne qui ne l'\u00e9tait point; et, ce qu'il y a do remarquable, elle prouve que l'erreur de droit vicie, aussi bien quo la simple erreure do fait, le legs dans lequel elle a caus\u00e9 une fausse demonstration do personne.\nPour concilier ces textes avec ceux qu'on a pr\u00e9cCdemment cites, ii faut, dit Vo\u00ebt, distinguer le cas o\u00f9 le testateur a appeler son fils ou son fr\u00e8re, un l\u00e9gataire qu'il savait bien n'\u00eatre point tel, et qu'il aimait n\u00e9anmoins comme s'il eut \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9ellement d'avec celui o\u00f9 tromp\u00e9 par de fausses apparences, il a gratifi\u00e9 comme son fils ou son fr\u00e9re, uno personne qui n'avait point cette qualit\u00e9 et qu'il aurait pass\u00e9 sous silence s'il avait s qu'elle lui \u00e9tait \u00e9trangCre. C'est au premier cas qu'il faut appliquer los loi 58 \u00a7 1, de Heredibus instituen dis, et 33 D. De condition\u00efbus et demonstrationibus; et c'est au second que s'adaptent les lois 5 C. de testamentis. 4 et 5, 1 C, de Heredibus instituendis.\nFurgole des Testaments ([26]); Troplong ([27]).\nIl me semble clair que d'apr\u00e8s cette autorit\u00e9, le testament de Russell en faveur de Julie Morin ne peut \u00eatre maintenu. Si Ia disposition d'un testateur qui, tromp\u00e8 par de fausses apparences, donne \u00e0 quelqu'un, le croyant son fils ou son fr\u00e9re, uniquement parcequ'il le croyait son fils ou soi fr\u00e9re est nulle et sans effet, pourquoi la disposition de Russell en faveur de Julie Morin ne seraitelle pas aussi nulle et sans effet? Peut-on douter en face des termes de ce testament et des faits de la cause, que c'est \u00e0 sa femme, et \u00e0 sa femme seulement que Russell entendait l\u00e9guer, et que s'il e\u00fbt s\u00fb que Julie R\u00efovin \u00e9tait la femme de Robilaille et non la sienne non-seulement ii ne lui aurait jamais fait cette disposition le 27 nov. 1878, mais l'aurait chass\u00e9e de chez lui et n'aurait plus voulu la voir.\nMr. Sexton n'aurait pas voulu lui administrer les sacrements eut-il su que Robitaille \u00e9tait vivant, avant que cette femme eut \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9conduite de la maison. Une autorit\u00e9 dans le m\u00eame sens se trouve dans Montvalon, Trait\u00e9 des successions ([28]). L'auteur v cite un arr\u00eat de 1727, o\u00f9 un legs, con\u00e7u en ces termes: \" Je l\u00e8gue \u00e0 \"Fran\u00e7ois Benoit, mon petit neveu et filleul \" fut d\u00e9clar\u00e9 nul, ii apparaissant que le testateur s'\u00e9tait tromp\u00e9 en croyant que Fran\u00e7ois Benoit \u00e9tait son filleul. La d\u00e9monstration de filleul fut pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e la cause finale du legs.\nEt Menochius dit que si la cause finale d'un legs, celle en consid\u00e9ration de laquelle ii est fait, se trouve \u00eatre fausse ou ne pas exister, on ne peut douter que la disposition tombe. Menochius, de Presumpt. ([29]). Et plus loin il ajoute, qu'une cause finale d'un legs est quand le testateur l'a fait \u00e0 cause de la parent\u00e9 ou de l'affinit\u00e9 du l\u00e9gataire avec lui i et que s'il est d\u00e9couvert que cette cause est fausse et n'existe pas le legs tombe. Ainsi, si quelqu'un, croyant un tel son fils on son fr\u00e9re, on son neveu, l'institue son l\u00e9gataire, et qu'il se d\u00e9couvre que le testateur \u00e9tait dans l'erreur, et que le l\u00e9gataire n'est pas ou son fils, on son fr\u00e9re, on son neveu, Ia disposition tombe.\nA la premi\u00e8re page, au par. 8., Menochius cite en l'approuvant, le passage suivant de Balde, qui est dune applicaiion remarquable \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente cause. Quod si testator legavit uxori, vet eam instituit, credens esse legitimam uxorem, si apparet deinde matrimonium nullum, dispositio corruit; nam prcesumitur quod si scivisset eam non fuisse uxorem legitimam, non ita legasset, vel hoeredem fessait.\"\nC'est bien l\u00e0 16 cas actuel le cas entre Russell et Julie Morin. Il lui a l\u00e9gu\u00e9, Ia croyant sa femme l\u00e9gitime \" credens esse legitimam uxorem\" Il \u00e9tait dans l'erreur, et elle n'\u00e9tait pas sa femme, le legs qu'il lui a fait est done nul, car ii est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9, et c'est l\u00e0, d'apr\u00e9s Menochius et les autres auteurs cites, une pr\u00e9somption qui ressort des mots \"Je l\u00e8gue \u00e0 mon \u00e8pouse bien-aim\u00e9e\" qu'il ne lui aurait pas l\u00e9gu\u00e9, s'il e\u00fbt su qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas vraiment son \u00e9pouse. Il ressort d'ailleurs ici non-seulement des termes du testament lui-m\u00eame mais aussi de toute la preuve, dans la cause, que c'est \u00e0 sa femme l\u00e9gitime que Russell entendait l\u00e9guer.\nUn article de Claude Henrys, avec des observations par Bretonnier, adopee enti\u00e8rement cette doctrine ([30]). Comme exemple l'auteur dit que l'institution o\u00f9 le legs fait par le testateur \u00e0 un \u00e9tranger qu'il croyait \u00e9tre son fr\u00e8re n'est pas valable, quand l'erreur \u00e9st d\u00e9couverte, comme le dit Godefroi: \" institutus ut frater a fratre a fratre recti non est institutus.\"\nEt Duranton dit ([31]):\nQuoiqu'en principe l'erreur cur la qualit\u00e9 du l\u00e9gataire ne vicie pas le legs, n\u00e9anmoiss si l'on devait pr\u00e9sumer que c'est cette qualit\u00e9, crue vraie pour le testateur qui a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 celui-ci \u00e0 faire la disposition, le legs devait \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9 nul par voie d'exception, comme fait d'apr\u00e9s une fausse cause.\nLes lois 4 C. de Hered. Inst. et 5 C Be Testamentis, nous offrent des exemples de ces cas o\u00f9 le legs est nul, et leur d\u00e9cision serait incontestablement applicable dans notre droit.\nDans ce sens un arr\u00e9t de 1812 dans la succession P\u00e9tiot, cite \u00e0 Dalloz ([32]), a jug\u00e9 que le testateur, qui a institu\u00e9 pour son h\u00e9ritier un enfant apr\u00e8s l'avoir l\u00e9galement reconnu, est cens\u00e9 n'avoir agi ainsi que parce qu'il croyait que c'\u00e9tait son enfant naturel, et que, par suite, l'institution n'est pus valable s ii est reconnu que l'institue n'est pas 1 enfant naturel du testateur.\n\"Mais,\" dit l'intim\u00e9e, \"suivant l'article 163 C C., le mariage, quoique nul, produit les effets civils, s'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 contract\u00e9 de bonne foi, et, en consequence, j'ai droit au legs \u00e0 moi fait par le testament de Russell \" C'est l\u00e0 il me semble une erreur grave. Sont-ce les effets civils de son mariage dont ii s'agit ici i Le testament do Russell est-il un des effets civils de son mariage? Indubitablement non. Or ce sont seulement les effets civils du mariage, c'est-\u00e0-dire, ceux que lui donne son contrat de mariage, ou en l'absence du contrat de mariage, ceux que lui donne la loi, ceux en consid\u00e9ration desquels le mariage putatif a \u00e9t\u00e9 contract\u00e9, qui sont donn\u00e9s \u00e0 la femme putative par l'article du Code. Toullier du mariage ([33]); Boileux ([34]); Pothier ([35]); Marcade ([36]).\nMais ici, son mariage n'est pas son titre, son contrat de mariage n'est pas en question. Ce testament, Russell pouvait le le r\u00e9voquer, s'il n'eut pas perdu la raison, quand il lui aurait plu de ce faire, et ceci, que Julie Morin ou lui fussent de bonne foi ou non sun leur mariage. Et s'il l'eut r\u00e9voqu\u00e9, Julie Morin pourrait-elle dire \" Je r\u00e9clame ce legs Russell n'avait pas le droit de le r\u00e9voquer paree que c'est un des effets civils de mon mariage putatif avec lui?\"\nJe vois que Bretonnier ([37]), adoptant l'opinion d'un commentateur du nom de Mantica, est de l'avis que la femme putative, a, dans ce cas, droit au legs \u00e0 elle fait par son mari, quoique celuici l'ait fait par erreur. Mais je ne puis en venir \u00e0 cette conclusion.\nPour moi ii me semble clair qu'\u00e9tant \u00e9tabli en fait, que Russell n'aurait pas l\u00e9gu\u00e9 \u00e0 Julie Morin s'il e\u00fbt s\u00fb qu'elle \u00e9tait Ia femme d'un autre, en droit la disposition ainsi faite par erreur tombe et doit \u00eatre trait\u00e9e comme non avenue.\nOn pourrait peut-\u00eatre remarquer dans le cas actuel que, comme par l'article 838 C. 0., la capacit\u00e9 de recevoir par testament se consid\u00e8re au temps du d\u00e9c\u00e9s du testateur, Russell ayant l\u00e9gu\u00e9 \u00e0 sa femme, et Julie Morin n'\u00e9tant pas sa femme, m\u00eame putative, lorsque lui, Russ II, est mort, ce legs pour cette autre raison est nuL.\nSi Julie Morin e\u00fbt cess\u00e9 d'\u00eatre sa femme par sa mont naturelle, arriv\u00e9e avant celle de Russell, le legs serait indubitablement nul. Art. 900 C. G. ElIe a cess\u00e9 d\u00eatre sa femme m\u00eame putative et de bonne foi par le retour d\u00e9 son premier mari avant la mort de Russell. Sun le m\u00e9me principe, le l\u00e8gs \u00e0 elle fait par Russell est nul. La dissolution du mariage putatif a eu lieu ions du retour du veritable mari de Julie Morin ([38]). Lorsque Russell est mort, elle n'\u00e9tait done pas m\u00eame sa femme putative. IVIais ii n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire dans cette cause de consid\u00e9rer la question cous ce rapport; ce legs serait nul quand bien m\u00eame Robitaille ne f\u00fbt revenu ou d\u00e9couvert qu'apr\u00e8s la mont deRussell. Ce legs, je le r\u00e9p\u00e8te, ne peut pas \u00eatre un des droits civils resultants \u00e0 Julie Morin de son mariage, un droit acquis par son mariage, puisqu'il ne s'ouvre et n'est un droit qu'apr\u00e8s la dissolution de son mariage.\nLes droits resultants du mariage sont cr\u00e9\u00e9s par le mariage m\u00eame, quoiqu'ils ne s'exercent qu'\u00e0 sa dissolution, Celui-ci a-t-il Ct\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9 par le mariage lore du mariage? Indubitablement, non. Comment peut-on l'appeler un droit civil du mariage, s'il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9 lors du mariage, sil n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 coexistant avec le mariage, s'il n'a d\u00e9pendu, durant le mariage, que de la volont\u00e9 de Russell seul. Si Russell e\u00fbt dit tout simplement: \"Je legue \u00e0 ma veuve,\" Julie Morin e\u00fbt-elle jamais Pu se pr\u00e9tendre l\u00e9gataire en vertu de ces mots? Voir Morin vs. La Corp., des Pilotes ([39]). O\u00f9 sil e\u00e6t seulement diit: \" Je legue \u00e0 ma femme \" sans la nommer, Julie Morin e\u00fbt-elle pu r\u00e9clamer le legs?\nJe ne fais pas allusion au fait que le mariage putatif de Russell avec l'intim\u00e9e na pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 nul par une cour de justice, parce que cette objection n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e par 1 intim\u00e9e en cette cause. Elle n'aurait d'ailleurs pu l'\u00eatre. Mr. le Juge Casault a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 clairement, dans la cause de la pr\u00e9sente intim\u00e9e contre la Corporation des Pilotes ci-dessus cit\u00e9e, pourquoi elle ne peut invoquer un tel moyen, et ce qu'en dit le Juge Casault s'applique enti\u00e8rement \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente cause, o\u00f9 des avant la mont de Russell ,et ce \u00e0 la poursuite de l'intim\u00e9e elle-m\u00e9me, la preuve de la constatation judiciaire de l'existence de son mari a \u00e9t\u00e9 aussi produite. D'ailleurs c'est encore comme \u00e9pouse de ce m\u00eame Robitaille qu'elle est en cause et qu'elle se defend ici; et elle-m\u00e9me, dans cette instance traite son mariage avec Russell comme nul, et n'ayant jamais exist\u00e9\nL'intim\u00e9e a soulev\u00e9 devant nous l'objection que toutes les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es ne sont pas en cause. Cette objection vient trop tard. Comme le dit le juge Loranger, dans la cause de Guyon dit Le Moine contre Lyonais ([40]) :\nLe d\u00e9faut de mise en cause de quelque partie au litige ne peut pas \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9 comme moyen tendant \u00e0 faire rejeter une demande. La partie qui l'invoque ne peut que demander \u00e0 l'autre partie de mettre en cause celle dont l'absence para\u00eet pr\u00e9judiciable \u00e0 l'adjudication sur le litige.\nEt cette objection doit \u00eatre prise in limine. Apr\u00e8s avoir lutt\u00e9 contre l'appelante seule pendant deux ans, devant deux coirs, l'intim\u00e9e a mauvaise gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 vouloir aujourd'hui emp\u00eacher cette cour de juger le fond de la contestation entre elle et l'appelante, sur une objection technique de cette nature. Elle a bien voulu 'engager cette contestation avec l'appelante seule, elle ne peut maintenant se plaindre de l'absence des autres parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es. Il est sans doute regrettable que, dans une affaire de cette nature surtout, on n'ait pas vu \u00e0 faire une cause telle que tout litige ult\u00e9rieur sur ce testament fut impossible. Il \u00e9tait, ii me semble, du devoir de l'ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire de ce faire, et de voir \u00e0 ce que toutes les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es fussent en cause. Faute par lui de ce faire, l'intim\u00e9e pouvait elle-m\u00eame les y appeler. Enfin la cour de premi\u00e8re instance aurait peut-\u00eatre d\u00fb elle-m\u00eame l'ordonner. Nous avons cependant \u00e0 prendre la cause telle qu'elle nous est soumise, et telle qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 devant les deux cours inf\u00e9rieures. Les parties souffriraient une criante injustice si nous refusions maintenant d'adjuger sur le litige pour un tel motif. Dans la cause de Richer v. Voyer ([41]), le Conseil Priv\u00e9 disait sur une objection semblable prise devant lui i\nTheir Lordships would be most reluctant to dismiss this suit for Want of parties at this final stage, unless it was clearly douions trated that they ought to do so.\nIci, ii n'est pas absolument n\u00e9cessaire que toutes les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es \u00e0 cette succession soient pr\u00e9sentes pour que nous d\u00e9cidions de Ia contestation que le demandeur l'intervenante et Ia d\u00e9fenderesse Morin, out bien voulu lier ensemble en l'absence des autres. Notre jugement ne pourra, il est vrai, affecteren loi ceux qui ne sont pas en cause mais ii est a esp\u00e9rer, cependant, qu'il mettra virtuellement fin \u00e0 toute contestation sur ce testament.\nL'objection a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise de la part de l'intim\u00e9e que, si le legs \u00e0 Julie Morin est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 caduc la revocation du testament du 8 octobre falit par le testament du 27 novembre, n'en subsiste pas moins, et qu'alors l'intervenante appelante, Elizabeth Russell, n'a pas de locus standi dans cette cause, parce qu'elle ne repose, dans son intervention, ses droits \u00e0 la succession de Russell que sur le testament du 8 octobre. Ceci est encore une objection que cette cour ne pent que voir que d'un mauvais ceil \u00e0 cet \u00e9tage de la cause. Il serait bien malheureux qu'apr\u00e8s une contestation Si longue et si co\u00fbteuse, le litige entre les parties fut tout \u00e0 recommencer par suite d'une objection de cette nature prise au dernier moment par Julie Morin. Dans la Cour du Bane de la Reine, on semble avoir cru qu'en fait c'\u00e9tait et \u00e0 titre d'h\u00e9riti\u00e8re et \u00e0 litre de l\u00e9gataire que l'intervenante demandait la nullit\u00e9 du testament du 27 novembre. Ceci a Ct\u00e9 ni\u00e9 devant nous par l'intim\u00e9e et en r\u00e9fcrant \u00e0 l'intervention et \u00e0 Ia declaration de l'appelante, il me para\u00eet de fait incorrect. Ce n'est qu'\u00e0 titre de l\u00e9gataire, par le testament du 8 octobre, que l'appelante est en cause. Si n\u00e9cessaire, il faudrait donc lui donner le droit d'amender son intervention et sa declaration contre Julie Morin, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 la mettre dans la cause comme h\u00e9riti\u00e8re en loi de Russell. On bien encore, ii serait possible pour elle de pr\u00e9tendee que l'erreur de Russell quant \u00e0 Julie Morin rend le testament du 27 novembre nul en son entier, et que Russell n'a r\u00e9voqu\u00e9 son testament du 27 novembre, que paree qu'il croyait que cette Julie Morin \u00e9tait son \u00e9pouse l\u00e9gitime. Voir Demolombe ([42]). Cependant, comme j'en suss venu \u00e0 la conclusion que ce testament du 27 novembre est aussi nul sur l'autre chef c'est-\u00e0-dire pour cause d'nsanit\u00e9 du testateur, je ne crois pas n\u00e9cessaire de chercher \u00e0 pr\u00e9voir quelles seraient les consequences dans l'hypoth\u00e8se o\u00f9 il serait conclu que le legs \u00e0 Julie Morin est nul mais non les autres parties de ce testament du 27 novembre.\nUne autre objection soulev\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e est que l'appelante dans son intervention, ses moyens d'inter'-vention ou sa declaration, n'a pas all\u00e9gu\u00e9 l'erreur de Russell sur la qualit\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9e comme sa femme, et n'en a pas faite dans ces documents un de ses griefs contre Jo testament du 27 novembre 1878.\nCette objection ne peut pr\u00e9valoir ici.\nDevant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure (c'est l'intim\u00e9e elle-m\u00eame qui nous le dii,) l'appelante a invoqu\u00e9 ce moyen d'erreur.\nAt the trial, (dit l'intim\u00e9e dans son. factum devant la Cour d'Appel,) the intervening party urged in addition to the question of insanity the three following objections :\n1st\n2nd.\n3rd Assuming Russell believed Julie Morin to be his wife which she knew she was not the will is void for error.\nIl appert aussi, par les notes du savant Juge en chef Meredith, que ce moyen do nullit\u00e9 contre le testament a \u00e9t\u00e9 pris devant lui, et il prononce sur ce moyen. Devant la Cour du Banc de la Reine, le factum de l'appelante, page 107 du dossier ici, invoque aussi clairement ce moyen. Le factum de l'intim\u00e9e, devant la m\u00eame cour, r\u00e9pond \u00e0 ce moyen, sans objecter qu'il n'est pas invoqu\u00e9 dans les documents \u00e9crits. La majorit\u00e9 des juges do la Cour du Bane de la Reine donnent aussi leur jugement sur ce moyen d'erreur. Il y a plus: ici m\u00eame devant cette cour l'intim\u00e9e dans son factum, le traite comme un des points dans la cause, et le discute sans aucune objection \u00e0 son admissibilit\u00e9. Il n'y a qu'\u00e0 l'audition finale quo l'intim\u00e9e a la mauvaise foi de soulever l'objection quo ce moyen n'est paz invoqu\u00e9 par l'appelante dans son intervention et sa d\u00e9claration. Si cette objection eut \u00e9t\u00e9 prise devant Je juge en chef Meredith, l'appelante aurait certainement obtenu Ia permission d'amender son intervention et sa d\u00e9claralion de mani\u00e8re \u00e0. couvrir ce point, Et en vertu du statut qui r\u00e9git cette cour en pareille mati\u00e9re, nous devons ordonner maintenant an amendement dans ce sens, et traiter la cause comme si tel amendement \u00e9tait fait. L'intim\u00e9e ne peut avoir ici une cause diff\u00e9rente de celle qu'elle a ene devant les autres cours. Elle a obtenu un jugement sur ce chef d'erreur des deux cours provinciales, elle ne peut s'objecter \u00e0 ce que cette cour aussi prononce sur ce chef. Ce serait encourager la mauvaise foi dans les proc\u00e8s que de permettre \u00e0 une partie de surprendre son adversaire de cette mani\u00e8re. Ti n'est pas question, je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 remarqu\u00e9, de la bonne foi ou de Russell ou de 1 intim\u00e9e sur leur mariage. Que Russell fut de bonne foi, c'est clair, qu'il fut dans l'erreur, est aussi clair.\nMaintenant, si l\u2019intim\u00e9e eut \u00e9t\u00e9 de mauvaise foi, si elle eut su que son premier mari \u00e9tait vivant, il n'y aurait plus lieu \u00e0 contestation sun ce chef: elle n'aurait droit ni aux droits civils resultant de son mariage, ni \u00e0 un testament qui alors aurait Ct\u00e9 obtenu par fraude. Mais je Ia traite comme si elle avait \u00e9pouse Russell, croyant vraiment que son premier mari \u00e9tait mort et, je dis que m\u00eame, sur ces circonstances, le testament de Russell est nul, parce qu'il ne l'a fait que parce qu'il croyait que l'intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait son \u00e9pouse. Je traite ce testament comme s'il eut dit: \" Je legue \u00e0 Julie Morin, parce qu'elle est mon \u00e9pouse l\u00e9gitime, ou si elle est mon \u00e9pouse l\u00e9gitime.\" Or, il appert que Julie Morin n'\u00e9tait pas son \u00e9pouse legitime. Le fait qu'elle croyait l\u00eatre ne peut affecter le n\u00e9sulatt de la cause. Je le r\u00e9p\u00e8te, c'est parce que Russell \u00e9tait dans l'erreur, et ne lui aurait pas legu\u00e9 s'il n'eut Ct\u00e9 dans l'erreur que l'appelante doit r\u00e9ussir, et le fait que Julie Morin \u00e9tait aussi dans l'erreur n'affecte pas cette cause. Si d'un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, Russell lui, n'eut pas \u00e9t\u00e9 dans l'erreur, s'il e\u00fbt su que Robitaille vivait, il n'y aurait non plus lieu \u00e0 litige, ii aurait bien eu droit de leguer \u00e0 Madame Robitaille et de l'appeler sa femme, quoiqu'il s\u00fbt qu'elle ne l'\u00e9tait pas, et personne ne pourrait sen plaindre.\nJe passe maintenant \u00e0 la question de l'insanit\u00e9 du testateur, invoqu\u00e9e par lappelante contre la validit\u00e9 du testament en litige.\nA la page 641 du dossier, je remarque que l'un des savants juges de la Cour du Bane de la Reine dit sur cette question diinsanit\u00e9;\nAgain it is a question of appreciation of fact wholly in the discretion of the primary tribunal\nEt cite, a 1 appui de cette-proposition, deux arr\u00eats de la cour de Cassation, o\u00f9 ii a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'en France un arr\u00eat qui decide, en fait, qu'un testateur \u00e9taiit ou n'\u00e9tait pas, sain d'esprit lors de la con fection de son testament, ne donne ras ouverture \u00e0 cassation Je crois que c'est une erreur de comparer dans cette cause la juridiction et les devoirs de Ia Cour du Bane de la Reine et ceux de cette cour \u00e0 ceux de la Cour de Cassation, pour la simple raison, qu'en France la Cour de Cassation nest pas une cour dappel sur le fait, mais bien seulement sur le droit, tandis qu'ici, et \u00e0 la Cour du Bane de la Reine et \u00e0 cette cour, appel est donn\u00e9, et sur le fait et sur le droit.\nSans doute, et c'est l\u00e0, j'en suis certain, ce que le savant juge de la Cour du Bane de la Reine, dont j'ai cite les paroles a voulu dire :\nUpon a question of fact, an appellate tribunal ought not to be called upon to decide which side preponderates on a mere balance of evidence. To procure a reversal, it must be shewn irresistibly that the judgment complained of, on a matter of fact, is not only wrong, but entirely erroneous ([43]).\nMais ce dictum, et autres du m\u00eame genre, ne veulent pas dire que, sur une question de fait, une cour d'appel, devra toujours suivre l'opinion du tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance. La loi e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 absurde si tout en donnant droit d'appeler du jugement du tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance sur une question de fait, elle eut dit ou suppose que la Cour d'Appel, sur toute question de fait, s'en rapportera \u00e0 la decision du juge a quo. Aussi, le Conseil Priv\u00e9 disait dans une cause de Canepa v. Larios ([44]) :\nThe judicial committee is not bound by the decision of the court below upon a question of evidence, although in general it will follow it.\nEt dans \" The Glannibanta ([45]), \" la Cour d'Appel disait it\nThat the parties were entitled to have the decision of the Court of Appeal, on questions of fact as well as on questions of law, and that the court could not excuse itself from the task of weighing conflicting evidence and drawing its own inferences and conclusions. Though it should alwavs bear in mind that it has not heard nor seen the witnesses. for which due allowance should be made. The court added that, as a rule, a court of appeal will be disinclined to interfere, when the judge hearing' the witnesses has come to his decision upon the credibility of witnesses as evinced by their demeanor, but otherwise, in cases where it depends upon the drawing of inferences from the facts in evidence.\nEt dans Bigsby v. Dickinson ([46]) la cour decide que;\nAlthough the Court of Appeal, when called on to review the conclusion of a judge of first instance after hearing witnesses viv\u00e2 voce will give great weight to the consideration that the demeanor and manner of the witnesses are material elements in judging of the credi. bility of the witnesses, yet, it will in a proper case act upon its own view of conflicting evidence.\nDans cette derni\u00e8re cause James, L. J disait :\nOf course if we are to accept as final the decision of the court of first instance in every case where there is a conflict of evidence our labours would be very much lightened, but then that would be doing away with the right of anneal in all cases of nuisance for there never is one brought into court in which there is not contradictory evidence, Et Bramwell, L. J., ajoutait :\nThe legislature has contemplated and made provision for our reversing a judgment of a Vice-Chancellor where the burden of proof has been held by him not to have been sustained by the plaintiff, and where he has had the living witnesses and we have not? If we were to be deterred by such considerations as those which have been presented to us, from reversing a decision from which we dissent, it would have been better to say at once that in such cases there shall be no appeal.\nEt dans Jones vs. Hough ([47]), Bramwell et Cott\u00f3n L JJ. disaient :\nFirst I desire to say a word as to our jurisdiction. If, upon the materials before the learned judge, he has, in giving judgment, come to an erroneous conclusion upon certain questions of fact and we see that the conclusions are erroneous we must come to a different conclusion and act upon the conclusion that we come to and not accept his finding.\nI have not the slightest doubt such is our power and duty. A great difference exists between a finding by the judge and a finding by the jury. Where the jury find the facts, the court cannot be substituted for them, because the parties have agreed that the facts shall be decided by a jury; but where the judge finds the facts, there the Court of Appeal has the same jurisdiction that he has, and can find the facts which ever way they like. I have no doubt, therefore, that it is our jurisdiction, our power and our duty: and if, upon these materials, judgment ought to be given in any particular way different from that in which Lindley, J., has given it, we ought to give that judgment.\nDans la pr\u00e9sente cause, aucun des t\u00e9moins de l'appelante n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 entendu devant le savant juge qui a rendu le jugement en cour de premi\u00e8re instance, et ii lui a fallu former son opinion comme nous avons \u00e0 le faire sur la simple lecture des depositions de ces t\u00e9moins. Sous ces circonstances surtout, cette cour si\u00e9geant ici en appel de ce jugement, serait, Il me semble, oublieuse de ses devoirs, si elle n\u00e9gligeait de former son opinion sur les faith de la cause d'aprss la preuve qui se trouve au dossier. Car ii ne s'agit pas ici de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 on non cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moins, mais seulement d'une inference do fait des faits prouv\u00e9s, c'est-\u00e0-dire quo, sur cette issue, la question \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre est; Faut-il inf\u00e9rer des faits prouv\u00e9s le fait quo Russell n'\u00e9tait pas compos mentis lorsqu'il a fait le testament attaqm\u00e9. Nous ne devons pas manquer de prendre en consid\u00e9ration, sans doute, que, sur cette question, l'intim\u00e9e a, en sa favour, l'opinion du savant Juge en Chef do la Cour Sup\u00e9rieuee et de quatre des savants Juges de la Cour du Banc do la Reine. Nous ne pouvons oublier, non plus, qu'il no suffit pas \u00e0 l'appelante de cr\u00e9er des doutes dans notre esprit, mais qu'il lui faut nous convaincre qu'il y a erreur dans le jugement dont elle so plaint. Mais ii n'est pas moins certain, quo si, d'apr\u00e8s nos propres lumi\u00e8res, et d'apr\u00e8s l'examen do la preuve produite, nous en venons \u00e0 la conclusion qu'il y a erreur, l'appelante a droit \u00e0 un jugement en sa faveur de notre part. Le fait quo doux tribunaux ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9cida contre elle no peut nous exempter de la responsabilit\u00e9 de d\u00e9cider d'apr\u00e8s notre propre jugement. Li loi nous en impose lu devoir, en d\u00e9cr\u00e9tant quo, sur une question du fait, il y aura appel \u00e0 la Cour Supreme des jugements de ces deux tribunaux, m\u00eame lorsque tous deux ils en seront venus \u00e0 la m\u00eame conclusion. Elle nous ordonne do rendre ici, sur cette question de fail, le jugement que, dans notre opinion, form\u00e9e d'apr\u00e8s la preuve produite par les parties la Cour du Banc de la Reine aurait d\u00fb rendre quand bien memo l'on trouverait dans la cause contro l'appelante ie jugement du juge de premi\u00e8re instance.\nSur cette question do l'insanit\u00e9 du testateur, lors de la confection du testament en litige, je me contenterai d'adopter en son entier li raisonnement du savant Juge en Chef de la Cour du Bane de la Reine L'expos\u00e9 des faits do Ia cause, tels qu'ils ressortent do Ia preuve, et des puincipes de droit qui r\u00e9gissent la Matiere, est donn\u00e9 si compl\u00e8tement par le savant gauge que ce que je pourrais en dire ne serait qu'une repetition oiseuse.\nJe n'ai donc que quelques remarques \u00e0 faire sur cette partie de la cause.\nLe savant Juge en Chef Meredith dit en terminant son jugement :\nBefore closing these remarks I desire to advert to the statement sworn to by the Plaintiffs, that he and Madame Rob \u00bftaille were anxious that Mr. Russell should make some provision for his n\u00edece. And now that the charge that Madame Robitaile caused the will to be made by fraudulent practices and suggestions has been declared unfounded. I allow myself to hope that they may, if permiteed, give effect to the very reasonable wish so expressed. If not and if Madame Robit<xille should attempt to retain that part of the estate which represents the industry and good management of Miss Russell during the best part of her life, the case will, I presume, be taken before a higher tribunal, and there the adversaries of Madame Robitaille will be able to say that they formed a truer estimate of her character than \u00ce have done\nL'intim\u00e9e en faveur de qui le savant juge a rendu son jugement quoique avec taut de regret et d'h\u00e9sitation, ne peut plus invoquer ce jugement pour se donner un caract\u00e8re de droiture et d'honn\u00eatet\u00e9 et sur l'autorit\u00e9 du savant juge \" Her adversaries are able to say that they formed a truer estimate of her character than he, the learned Judge did.\"\nL'intim\u00e9e a voulu soutenir devant nous pour affaiblir le t\u00e9moignage d'Ellen Russell, que quand ce t\u00e9moin jure que Russell et l'intim\u00e9e out v\u00e9cu en concubinage avant son mariage putatif elle a jur\u00e9 ce qui est faux at n'est pas corrobor\u00e9. Pour ma part je crois que ce qua le t\u00e9moin a dit l\u00e0-dessus eel parfaitement vrai. Il est de-principe que si quelqu'un, int\u00e9ress\u00e9 \u00e0 contredire un fait prouv\u00e9 dans la cause par son adversaire, n\u00e9glige d'amener un t\u00e9moin gui a n\u00e9cessairement une connais. sance personnelle de ce fail s'il existe, ii admet qua ce t\u00e9moin prouvera aussi ce fail, tel que son adversaire la prouv\u00e9, surtout quand ce t\u00e9moin eat son ami on lui est favorablement dispose. Ici Ie demandeur sur l'issus entre lui et l'appelante pouvait amener Julie Morin comme t\u00e9moin et l'examiner sur le fait jur\u00e9 par Ellen Russell. Si Julie Morin e\u00fbt pu jurer qu'elle n'avait pas vecu en concubinage avec Russ Il, Lefran\u00e7ois l'aurait entendue comme t\u00e9moin. C'est paree qu'elle se sentait coupable qu'elle n'a pas Ct\u00e9 amen\u00e9e. L'intim\u00e9e a voulu aussi diminuer la force du t\u00e9moignage d'Ellen Russell en essayant \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer qu'elle \u00e9tait contredite sur llusieurs points par Mr. Sexton. A la simple lecture du t\u00e9moignage do M. Sexton l'on voit quo ce t\u00e9moin a si peu do m\u00e9moire, tout respectable que soil son caract\u00e8re, que son t\u00e9moignage no pout \u00e9tre d'aucun poids dans la cause. Il suffit de remarquer qu'il ne so rappelle pas \u00e0 qui ii a donne le certificat qui so trouve annex\u00e9 au testament du 27 Novembre, et qu'il jure, \u00e0 un endroit, qu'il \u00e9tait an confessional dans la sacristie quand on Fa appel\u00e9 pour lui demander ce certificat, et qu'en un autre eudroit, il jure qu'il \u00e9tait en haut, c'est-\u00e0-dire, chez lui, dans lo presbyt\u00e8re, puisqu'iI dit :\nSome person came and asked for me and I came down stairs.\nPuis, Ia raison qu'il donne pour juror quo ce n'est pas \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 qui il a donn\u00e9 ce certificat pout bien \u00eatre appel\u00e9e pour le moins extraordinaire.\nQuestion.\u2014\u2014 Is it not a fact that Mrs. Robitaille called for that certificate at the church, and informed you that it was for the purpose of being handed to the Notary who was going to draw up the will in her favor?\nAnswer\u2014\u2014.No. 1 do not remember that at all.\nQuestion\u2014Wlll yon swear that that did not occur '!\nAnswer.\u2014 I will form the conclusion that 1 do not know what effect it would have if she had mentioned it?\nQuestion.\u2014That is your only reason?\nAnswer.\u2014yes.\nDans tout son t\u00e9moignage, ce t\u00e9moin ne peut que repondre \" Je no me rappelle pas.' Tant qu'au t\u00e9moin St. Michel, I'on comprend quel inter\u00eat ill-a,' poursa- propre reputation, \u00e0 ce quo Russell, ne soit pas dii avoir 6th fon avant d\u00e9cembre 1878. Cet int\u00e9r\u00eat perce dans tout son t\u00e9moiguage, et le trappe d'in\u00e7r\u00e9dibilit\u00e9.\nIl me para\u00eet impossible do mettre do c\u00f4te le t\u00e9moignage-gnage du Dr. Ruseell le Juge on Chef Dorian me semble l'avoir d\u00e9montr\u00e9 clairement, et ce t\u00e9mo\u00edgnage, \u00e9tant admis, la cause est cause est l'insanit\u00e9 do Russell, et avant et apr\u00e8s et le jour memo do la confection dece testament, est entierement \u00e9tablie.\nC'\u00e9tait d'ailleurs clairement aux intim\u00e9s \u00e0 .prouver que Russell \u00e9tait compos mentis lo jour en question. Qu'il ait. \u00e9t\u00e9.-fou auparavant,. qu'il ait \u00e9t\u00e9.-fou peu do temps apr\u00e8s, ne laisse pas do doute. Or\u00e9sous ces constances, il doit \u00eatre pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 fou ce jour-l\u00e0 jusqu'\u00e0 preuve, du contraire. La regle en pereilcas, en Angleterre comme pour noun, est que :\nIf it be shown that the testator was insane at any time peor t\u00fa the date of the will, or within a few days after that date, the burthen of establishing his capacity to have made the will in question wiii be shifted on the propounding party ([48])e\nTells est aussi la r\u00e8gle-du'droit- fran\u00e7ais: \"Toute fois si le demandeur prouvait que- -soit avant et surtout peu deitemps avant la- disposition, soit temps apr\u00e9s le disposant n'\u00e9tait pas sain d'esprit; n\u00f4tre avis-est que l'espace interm\u00e9diaires'y trouverait compris i car'-enfin, on ne doit-pas non plus exiger l'impossible et la V\u00e9rit\u00e9 \u00ebst qui'l s'eralt souvent impossible. an deman-deur do prouver l'insanit\u00e9 d'esprit du disposant an moment pr\u00e9cis et rigoureux o\u00f9 il a fait la disposition.\n\" Et dans ce cas c'est au d\u00e9fendour qui, soutient la velidit\u00e9 de la disposit\u00edon qu'il incarabe de pro ver qu'elle a\u00e9tC faith par le disposant dans intervalle lucido. Demolombe ([49]), et autorit\u00e9s y cit\u00e9es. Non-setilement les intim\u00e9s nlont pas, tel que le d\u00e9montre le juge Chef Dorion prouv\u00e9 que Russell fut compos, mentis le jour do Ia confection du testament eu question mais l'appelante a \u00e9tabli Positivement qu'il \u00e9tai conyos mentis ce jour-l\u00e0\nIl est \u00e0 remarquer que Julie Morin elle-m\u00eame, dans sa requ\u00eate pour faire interdire Russell, en janvier 1879, all\u00e9gue que los faits qui indiquent l'ins\u00e0nit\u00e9, chez Russell sont quo :\nThat he walks into the street half dressed and desires to be sent to jail, that he continnally speaks of his money losses, his fear of poverly and starvation and fear of eternal damnation; he threatens to destroy every thing in the house, and is continually giving away his wearing appareal and other effects.\nOr, ce sont l\u00e0 pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment les sympt\u00f4mes qui d'apr\u00e8s l\u00e0 preuve existaient en grande partie chez Russell des avant le 27 novembre pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent l'interdiction Il Semble d'ailleurs qu'un. homme qui se prom\u00e8ne dans l\u00eb\u00e9 r'ues avec un certificat dans ses poches qu'il n'est pas fort, on qui a recours a un tel certificat pour faire ses transactions, tel quo Russell a fait le 27 novembre m\u00eame est un fou. Jo n'ai rencontr\u00e9 que due dans une visit\u00eb \u00e0 un asile d'ali\u00e9n\u00e9s, quelqu'un qui m'ait offert un tel certificat. C'\u00e9tait \u00e0 Brattleboro d'un interne qui the suppliait do le faire mettre en libert\u00e9, et appuiyant sa Supplique dune douzaine do certific\u00e1ts qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas fou.\nComme le juge Dorion le remarque, un fon peut bien faire un acte de sagesse et peut bien dissimuler son -insanite. Le fait quo los notaires no so sont pas aper\u00e7us quo Russell Ctait fou lors do la confection du testament en question n'a pas l'importance que l'intim\u00e9e vondrait nous v faire voir\n\"Les notaves n'ont pas de Ia loi l'attribution, le pouvoir, de constrater Ia sanit\u00e9 d'esprit du disposant ([50]). \"Suft\u00edtil done, pour \u00eatre sage, 'disait d'Aguessea \"d'avoir fait un acee de sagesse\" L'intim\u00e9e irait jus-qu'\u00e0 dire que parce qu'un homme met son chapeau pour sortir dans la rue, il n'est pas fon.\nQuand au testament du 27 novembre, comme le Juge en Chef Dorion, et le Juge en Chef Meredith, lui-m\u00eame l'ont d\u00e9montre, loin d'\u00eatre un acte de sagesse, c'est un acte d'inique cruaut\u00e9 envers Ellenl Russelll; c'est un acte si contraire aux intentions si souvent exprim\u00e9es do Russell qu'on ne peut l'expliquer que comme ii l'a explique lui-m\u00eame an t\u00e9moin Brown, quand ii dit: \" I could not help it, because I was frightened she was going to poison me,\" \" Ceci n'est pas vrai, \" dit l'inti-m\u00e9e, \" et ii n'est nullement prouv\u00e9 que j'ai jamais fait aucune menace \u00e0 Russell pour en obtenir ce testament\" Sans doute ii n'v a rien de tel prouv\u00e9 mais le fait quo Russell le croyait, le fait quo ce pauvre homme avait dans l'esprit que sa femme voulait l'empoisonner, quand absolument rien n'\u00e9tait intervenu pour lui mettre une telle chose dans l'id\u00e9e no d\u00e9montre-t-il pas qu'ii \u00e9tait fou hallucin\u00e9, \"non compos mentis\" Et ce t\u00e9moin Brown, un pilote comme Russell, an de ses amis? an homme qui le connaissait parfaitement bien, est an des t\u00e9moins les plus respectables entendus dans la cause, un t\u00e9moin d\u00e9sint\u00e9ress\u00e9, qui lui n'a pas, comme St. Michel, profit\u00e9 do la faiblesse d'esprit do Russell pour s'enrichir Tout ce que t\u00e9moin jure je le crois enti\u00e8rement J'en dis autant du docteur Russell Leurs t\u00e9moignagcs sont intelligents, \u00e9clair\u00e9s, d\u00e9sint\u00e9ress\u00e9s, vraisemblables, et d'ailleurs parfaitement corrobor\u00e9s. Une autre remarque, Brown jure quo Russell a appel\u00e9 l'intim\u00e9e: u a damned prostitute,\" et ceci le 27 novembre m\u00e9me. Russell \u00e9tait alois sobre et no buvait pas depuis longtemps.

Ils se sont ligu\u00e8s contre l'appelante en faveur do cette Julie Morin. Le p\u00e8re n'a de fait pris la pr\u00e9sente action quo pour Julie Morin et dans son int\u00e9ret. L'intim\u00e9e a cite l'article 335 du Code Civil et pr\u00e9tend que ce testament no peut \u00eatre aunul\u00e9 parce que l'insanit\u00e9 de Russell n'existait pas notoirement lorsqu'il a fait ce testament. Ceci est une erreur. Cot article ne s'applique pas an testament ([51]). Il n'y a aucun doute l\u00e0-dessus.\nEn consequence je suis d'avis, avec la majorit\u00e9 de cette cour d'infirmer le jugement dont est appel. L'action do Lefran\u00e7ois sera d\u00e9bout\u00e9e, et celle d'Elizabeth Russell contre Julie Morin maintenue.

Dorion, \u00ce find it to be impossible for me to add anything I desire however in connection with some observations appearing in -the judgment of one of the learned judges of the Court of Queen's Bench in appeals to say that in my judgment this is a case in which there can he no doubt that it is' not only competent for us, bat that it ii \u00e2 duty imposed upon as to form and express our own Independent judgment upon the questions of fact in volved and \u00f9pon the evidence given in relation to those facts; and if that evidence leads our minds to a different conclus\u00eeon from that arrived at by the learned Chief Justice of the Superior Court, it is our duty to give full expression to our opinion. This is not a case 'which, in the judgment of the learned Chief Justice of the Superior Court, who rendered the original judgment in the case, turned upon the credibility of anv of the wttnesses;indeed ail of the witnesses were not examined before him. The case before him turned and still turns, upon a question as to the proper inference to be drawn from all the evidence as to the mental capacity of the testator to make th\u00eb will of the 27th March, 1878, which is impeached. In such a case, to hold that we should be concluded by the judgment of the learned Chief Justice of the court of first instance or by the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench in appeal, affirming his judgment, would be in effect to declare that in such a case there is no appeal.\nSo to hold would have relieved us from much labor and anxiety in this case, but would deprive the parties of a right which the law confers upon them. The fact, that a majority of the learned judges constituting the Court of Appeal, in the province of Quebec has affirmed the judgment of the learned chief Justice of the Supe-\u00eeior Court, only enhances the gravity of the duty imposed \u00e6pon us to take care not lightly to reverse those judgments nor without a thorough conviction in our own. ininds that they are erroneous.\nFully sensible of the great gravity of the duty thus \u00efmposed up\u00f3n me, I am bound to say that the evId\u00e9nce which has been so exhaustively analysed by the learnea Chi\u00ebf Justice of the Court of Queen's Bench in Appeal has convinced my mind that, at the time of the execution by the testator of the will of the 27th November, 1878, he had not that sound and disposing mind and understanding which are necessary to make a good will andl valid in law; indeed I am convinced that his mental incapacity dates back to a period anterior to the transaction between the testator and St. Michel of the 2nd October previous but as there is no issue before us in this case as to the validity of the wills of October, 1878, and as judgment against the validity of the will of November cannot set up, as valid, any previous will, it will be only necessary for us to treat here of the will of the 2 th November, but in so (doing we cannot lay out of our consideration evidence of the acts and conduct of the testator evincing the state of his mind in the month of October If the testimony of Dr. Russell, the only medical man who has been examined upon the subject\u2014for his father only speaks of a much later period\u2014be at all reliable, there seems to me to be no doubt of the testator's incompetency at the time of the execution by him of the impeached will The learned Chief Justice Meredith, in the judgment delivered by him, does not treat the certificate given by Dr. Russell, on 11th November, for the purpose of giving effect to the St. Michel transaction, as detracting from Dr. Russell's credibility upon the ground of its being inconsistent with his oral evidence as to the testator's mental incapscity to make the impeached will; he rather, as it seems to me accepts the doctors explanation of the circumstances attending his giving that certificate and the object of giving it, and proceeds to refer to various business matters transacted by the testator during the month of November and to the impressions as to his capacity formed in the minds of divers persons during that month, and especially in the minds of the notaries who drew and attested the execution of the impeached will for the purpose, as it seems to me, of justifying the conclusion which th.\u00a9 learned Chief Justice arrived at, that at the time of the execution of that will upon the 27th November, the testator had a sufficiently sound and disposing mind.\nThe learned Chief Justice, after referring to the certificate and to the Doctor's explanation of the eircum stances under which it was given says :\nBut whatever may have been D. Russell's intention in giving that certificate, it may be presumed that it would not have been asked for had not grave doubts been entertained as to Russell's sanity in some quarters, at the time: and the same remarks apply to the certificate obtained from the Rev. Mr, Sexton upon the 26th November, the day before the making of the will in question.\nThe learned Chief Justice then proceeds to draw attention to the other matters which led his mind to the conclusion, that on the 27th November, the testator was of a sound and disposing mind, but he admits that, notwithstanding this being his opinion, the case is still not free from difficulty. Some of the Judges constituting the majority of the Court of Queen's Bench in Appeal, seem to have wholly set aside Dr. Russell's oral evidence, treating it as so contradicted by his certificate as to be wholly unworthy of belief. Mr. Justice Ramsay, upon this head, says :\nDr. Russell's int entions mav have been excellent, but I must necessarily set his testimony upon a matter of opinion, so contradicted. entirely aside.\nFrom this remark of that learned Judge I conclude that he entertained the opinion which I confess 1 entertain myself, that unless the testimony of Dr. Russell be wholly set aside and eliminated from the case it is difficult, if not impossible, to maintain the validity of the will.\nBefore wholly eliminating from the case the only medical evidence given upon a subject, which is peculiarly within the range of the studies of the medical profession, we should he well satisfied of the necessity of shutting our eyes to evidence coming from a quarter from which we should naturally expect most light; while we must admit that as a point of casuistry the doctrine that the end justifies the means is unsound, and while viewing the question in that light, as a matter of conscience, it may appear to us, that it would have been better if the doctor had not given this certificate even though his withholding it might, under the circumstances, have hopelessly embarrassed the case beyond all possibility of. being rectified, and might have so affected the weak mind of his patient as to have aggravated his disease and have precipitated his death, still before we wholly reject the oral testimony of the doctor, as so incredibly inconsistent with the Certificate, and so contradicted by it, as to make him unworthy of belief, we should put ourselves in,his place, and judging the matter from his point of view, enquire whether the rejection of all the doctor's evidence as to the testator's mental incapacity is in reality the reasonable and logical sequence of his having given the certificate,\nUpon the threshold of this enquiry, we find the doctor's reason, for interfering at all in the St. Michel transaction was his. confirmed belief in the mental incapacity of his patient, and in the fact that stick incapacity had been taken advantage of by St. Michel. The doctor giv\u00e9s his reasons for his belief in the then mental incapacity of his patient. Russell, and these peasons are confirmed by very many othei persons intimate acquaintances of R\u00fcsse\/\/, of whom St. M\u00edichel himself is one.\nThoroughly convinced in his own mind that tage had been taken of his patient's mental incapacity, the doctor spoke freely upon the subject among Russell's friends and acquaintances, saying :\nSt. Michel has taken Russell's house from him and Russell is out of his mind, it is not a legal transaction.\nThe rumor of the transaction, and of the doctor's observation upon it, having got abroad, brought St. Michel to him, and to an enquiry by St Michel whether he considered Russell to be in a fit state to transact buiness, the doctor replied: : No, that house is not yours.\"\nThereupon St. Michel said that he had paid upwards of $1,000.00 on the building of the house, tIat it was worth about $1,400,00, and he added,\nIf you will give me a certificate to allow this transaction to be completed, \u00ce will give Russell the balan\u00e7e $400,00.\nIn r\u00e9ply to this proposition the doctor assented to give the certificate, upon condition that Mr. Austin, Russell's own notary, should be employed, because the doctor knew that Russell's s interest would be safe in his hands. He felt no doubt that Austin would not assent to the transaction being confirmed, unless the amount to be paid by 67. Michel should be the fair value of the property. The doctor accordingly went to Russeilaud told him of St Michel's offer, and that be would give $400.00 to Russell, if he, the doctor, would give the required certificate. Russell, as the doctor says, was very anxious to get the $400, and that \u00a1the doctor should give the certificate, and he seemed then clearly enough to understand the particular matter so explained to him, by his, medical adviser although for the transaction of business generally, the doctor says, he was not at\u00a1 all sane, and could be easily led in any direction.\nThe papers to give effect to the St Michel transaction having been prepared by M. Austin, and the $400 paid by St. Michel, the doctor, for the sole purpose oil enabling that particular transaction to be perfected, gare the Certificate I, confess. that it appears to me rather singular that a man, so perfectly sane, as to be fit jo, trasact any business should be exceedingly anxious to get the doctor's certificate of his being sane, in order to get a particular transaction completed, which transaction consisted in the enforced rectification in the interest of Russell, brought about by the docto, of a contract of sale, a few days prerviously entered into by Russell, whose inental capacity was; not then sufficient to .enable him to Iook after and protect his own interests. Now, from this evidence, which we must look at for the purposed seeing under what circumstances the certificate was given, it is apparent to my mind, that notwithstanding what is contained in it the doctor was well satisfied that his patient's mind was very seriously discased, and that he was quite incompetent for the management of h\u00eds affairs generally and that he gave the certificate for the special purpose of enabling a transaction to ho consummated so as to secure to Russell the full value of the property in question, and which could not have ' been consummated without the certificate and which if not consummated would have been attended with very great pecuniary loss to St. Michel, and might have involved Russell in a litigation which in his then state of health, might have been disastrous.\nThese then being the circumstances attending the giving the certificate, although in the minds of casuists, and when examined into in foro conscientice the doctor s conduct may be open to censure, I find it impossible to hold, as a legal proposition, that a certificate asked for because of a pretty generally prevailing belief in Russell's mental incapacity, and because of his doctor's remonstrances, that such his mental incapacity had been taken advantage of by St. Michel, and given to pr\u00e9vente St. Michel incurring the risk of losing the $1,000 already paid by him to the builder, or some portion thereof, and the costs of a possibly protracted litigation$ and given, too, upon the express promise and condition that he should pay to Russell, the further sum of $400, which with the $1000 was considered the fair value of the property should be taken as conclusive evidence of the then perfect mental capacity of the person whose alleged mental incapacity and the wrongful advantage taken of such incapacity constituted the moving causes for giving the certificate and that we should therefore reject all the evidence given by the medical man who crave that certificate having a tendency to establish the mental incapacity of Russell to make the will which is impeached, made a fortnight subsequently to the day upon which the certificate was given\nThe doctor in his evidence proceeds to say that immediately after the day on which the certificate was priven Russell got worse daily and that on the 27th November he was quite incompetent to make a will, that he continued growing worse until early in January following he was interdicted and confined in an asylum as insane, the evidence of the doctor himself, that the symptoms of his insanity dated back three months, having been used by Julie Worie (the party maintaining the will of the 27th November) for the purpose of procuring the interdiction.\nIt is not, however, upon the evidence of the doctor alone, that my judgment is based. The evidence given by him, confirmed by numerous witnesses, relates to acts and conduct of the testator betraying unmistakable symptoms of an enfeebled mind such acts and conduct being identical with those which, in works treating of general paralysis of the insane, are declared to be invariable and unmistakable symptoms of the presence of a mental disease which in comparatively modern times has been termed and known as paresis a disease which in its early stages may easily escape the observation of non-professional men, and even of professional men, who have not had much experience of it, and which, although for short periods, and for isolated matters, the patient suffering under it may be able to apply some trifling degree of mental faculty, nevertheless so enfeebles the mind as to deprive it of that comprehensive grasp of subjects, that power of concentration and of continuous thought, the power of comparing, compounding and uniting the several parts of any subject under consideration, in short of that integrity of the mental faculties which is essentially necessary for the conduct of the general business of life and more especially for the sane execution of that last great act of life, the disposition of property by will.\nThe evidence in the case does not appear to have been given with the view of determining, with scientific accuracy, what is the particular medical term for the mental disease under which Russell was suffering \u2014its symptoms singularly correspond with those laid down as unerring symptoms of paresis, but whatever may be the appropriate scientific name of the disease, the evidence leaves no doubt upon my mind, that from at least the period of the St. Michel transaction, the mental capacity of Russell was so enfeebled as to render him quite incapable of managing his affairs, as a sane man, and of making the will which is impeached. The evidence relating to matters transacted by Russell, during the month of November, has no effect upon my mind, some of those transactions are quite consistent with the existence of that feeble condition of mind to which the doctor and other witnesses bear testimony, while as to the moneys relied upon as received by him during the month, we know nothing of their disposition.\nI am more impressed with the significance attaching to the giving to Russell of Mr. Sexton's certificate by the person who obtained it from him. That it was obtained for the purpose of being delivered to Russell to be used in the precise manner in which it was used, we can I think, have little doubt and such use of it appears to me rather to indicate the act of a person under an influence which his feeble mind feared to thwart or resist than of a person in the full possession and enjoyment of his mental faculties unimpaired.\nAppeal allowed with costs out of Estate.\nSolicitors for appellant; W & A.

Ritchie, C.J. and Strong, Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE.)\nAppeal\u2014Judgment by Court of Appeal, partly final partly Interlocutory\u2014Effect of\u2014Experts, reference to.\nSt. L. claimed of S. $2,125.75, balance due on a building contract. S. denied the claim, and, by incidental demand, claimed $6,368 for damages resulting from defective work.\nThe Superior Court, on 27th March, 1877, gave judgment in favor of St. L. for the whole amount of his claim, and dismissing S's. incidental demand. This judgment was reversed by the Court of Review, on the 29th December, 1877. St. L. appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench, and on the 24th November, 1880, that court held that St. L. was entitled to the balance claimed by him from which should be deducted the cost of rebuilding the defectively constructed work, and in order to ascertain such cost, the case was remitted to the Superior Court, by whom experts were appointed to ascertain the damage, and, on their report, the Superior Court, on the 18th June, 1881, held that it was bound by the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, and deducting the amount awarded by the experts from the balance claimed by St, L., gave judgment for the difference. This judgment was affirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench, on the 19th January, 1882.\nHeld, On appeal that the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench of the 24th November, 1880, was a final judgment on the merits and that the Superior Court when the case was remitted to it rightly held that it was bound by that judgment, and that St, L. was entitled to the balance thereby found due to him\nPer Fournier, J.\u20141. That the judgment of the 24th November, 1880, though interlocutory in that part of it which directed the refe- rence to experts, was final on the other points in litigation, and could therefore have properly been appealed from as a final judgment. That although on an appeal from a final judgment an appellant may have the right to impugn an interlocutory judgment rendered in the cause, yet he loses this right if he voluntarily and without reserve acts upon such interlocutory judgment.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) rendered at Montreal, on the 19th of January, 1882, which confirmed partially and varied the judgment of the Superior Court of 18th June 1881 rendered ii favor of the present respondent for $1,515.75, with interest from the 21st July, 1873 and dismissed the incidental demand of said appellant with all the costs.\nThe facts and pleadings sufficiently appear in the judgments hereinafter given.\nMr. Kerr, Q.C., for appellant, Mr. Doutre, Q C., for respondent.\nFOURNIER, J.:\u2014\nL'intim\u00e9 en cette cause demander en cour inf\u00e9rieure, poursuivait l'appelant pour la somme de $2,125755, . balance du prix de certains ouvrages de construction de b\u00e2tisses faits en vertu d'un contract. L'appelant plaida non-seulement qu'il ne devait rien, mais qu'au contraire, l'intim\u00e9 lui devait la somme de $6,368000, dommages lui r\u00e9sultant de ce que les ouvrages entrepris par lintim\u00e9 avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 mal faits. II se portait demandeur incident pour cette somme. Par un premier jugement rendu sur cette contestation par l'honorable juge Caron, l\u2019action de lintim\u00e9 fut maintenue et la demande incidente renvoy\u00e9e.\nLa cause fut ensuite port\u00e9e en revision et jugement de l'honorable juge Garon infirm\u00e9 en entier. Sur appel le jugement de la cour de r\u00e9vision fut infirm\u00e9 par celui de la cour du Banc de la Reine en date du 24 novembre 1880. Les consid\u00e9rants de ce jugement apr\u00e9s la citation du march\u00e8 fait pour la construction des ouvrages qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la contestation, sont comme suit:\u2014\nAnd whereas in the construction of a portion of the said wall, to wit : the south-west gable wall the work was insufficient and it became necessary to demolish and rebuild the same, and Considering, that by law, the said Jean-Baptiste St. Louis, fils, is liable for the insufficiency of the said wall;\nAnd, Considering that the said Jean-Baptiste St. Louis, fils, is not responsible for the cost of the demolition and the re-building of the brick wall constructed on the top of that portion of the said wall constructed by the said Jean-Baptiste St. Louis, fils, which has proved insufficient, or of any damage to spouts or rooting, inasmuch as the said brick wall was not properly built, and should not have been built without first ascertaining the state of said stone wall and its sufficiency, to bear such brick wall.\nAnd, Considering further that the said Jean-Baptiste St. Louis, fils, is not responsible for any loss of rent, inasmuch as the said Henry J. Shaw, in fact, did not suffer any damage, by loss of rent, owing to the acts of the said Jean-Baptiste St. Louis fils.\nAnd, Considering that there is no evidence, in the record, to establish the precise amount which the said Henry J. Shaw has been obliged to pay, for the removing and re-building of that portion of the said gable wall so built by the said Jean-Baptiste St. Louis fils, and that the amount to be refunded by the said Jean-Baptiste St. Louis, fils, the said Henry J. Shaw, or to be deducted from the balance still due him, on his said contract, can only be properly established by expert;\nAnd, Considering that there is error in the judgment rendered by the Judges of the Superior Court, sitting in Review at Montreal on the twenty-ninth day of December, eighteen hundred and seventy-seven.\nComme cons\u00e9quence de ces consid\u00e9rants le jugement ordonne ensuite que par experts \u00e0 \u00eatre nomm\u00e9s en la mani\u00e9re indiqu\u00e9e, apr\u00e8s avoir entendu les parties et leurs t\u00e9moins, il sera fait a la cour Sup\u00e9rieure a Montr\u00e9al rapport sur les faits suivants :\u2014\nWhat is the amount which the said Henry J.

Shaw to rebuild the whole gable wall, the said Experts to make their report to the said Superior Court, as may be ordered by the said Court, or a Judge thereof, in order that further proceedings may be had thereon as to law and justice may appertain.\nEn ex\u00e9cution de ce jugement le dossier en cette cause fut remis \u00e0 la cour de premi\u00e9re instance devant laquelle ii fut proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 la nomination d'experts conform\u00e9ment au dit jugement. Les experts nomm\u00e9s ayant entendu les parties et leurs t\u00e9moins firent leur rapport \u00e0 la cour Sup\u00e9rieure pr\u00e9sid\u00e9e par I'honorable juge Taschereau qui, par son jugement confirma le rapport des dits experts, estimant a $590.000 le montant des dommages que l'intim\u00e9 doit payer a l'appelant. D\u00e9duction faite de cette somme sur le montant de la demande l'honorable juge Taschereau se consid\u00e9rant li\u00e9 par le jugement de la cour du Banc do la Reine ordonnant cette expertise, rendit en cons\u00e9quence jugement pour la somme de $1,515.00 Ce dernier jugement ayant aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9 en appel, ii fut confirm\u00e9 par Ia cour du Banc de la Reine \u00e0 l'unanimit\u00e9 le 19 janvier 1882 sur le principe qu'il \u00e9tait conforme \u00e0 l'interlocutoire (jug. du 24 nov. 1880) rendu par cette cour et devatt par cons\u00e9quent \u00eatre confirm\u00e9.\nC'est de ce jugement que le pr\u00e9sent appeal est inter-jet\u00e9 \u00e0 cette cour. L'intim\u00e9, tout en soutenant le bien jug\u00e9 a soulev\u00e9 deux objections gContre l'existence du droit d'appel de cc jugement : Ia premi\u00e9re, que le montant du jugement \u00e9tant au-dessous de $2,000 ii ny a pas d'appel; la denxi\u00e9me, que le jugement du 19 janvier 1882 n'\u00e9tant que l'ex\u00e9cution du jugement interlo-cutoire du 24 novembee 1880, dont il n'y a pas en d'appel dans les d\u00e9lass prescrits, ce jugement est pass\u00e9 en force de chose jug\u00e9e et qu'il ne pent plus y avoir lieu a reviser les questions qu'il a finalement d\u00e9cidees, oou en d'autres termes, sur l'appel du jugement du 19 janvier 1882, \" l'apellant est-il encore a temps pour faire valoir ses moyens \u00e0 lencontre du jugement inter-locutorre du 24 novembre 1880 ? \"\nLa r\u00e9sponse a la premiere question est que le montant de la demande principale \u00e9tant de $2,105.75, c'est ce montant qui dolt r\u00e9gler le droit d'appel. Cette question de savoir lequel du montant de la demande ou de celui du jugement doit servir \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer la question du droit d'appel \u00e0 cette cour ayant d\u00e9ja \u00e9t\u00e9 plusieuss fois d\u00e9cid\u00e9e, il est inutile d'y revenir.\nLa seconde question est beaucoup plus s\u00e9rieuse et offre plus de difficult\u00e9. Sa solution depend en grande partie du caract\u00e9re que l'on doit attribuer au jugement du 24 novembre 1880. Est.ce un iugement final on un interlocutoire laissant ouvertes et sans pr\u00e9jug\u00e9 les questions pnincipales en contesaation, on bien encore est-ce un jugement tout \u00e0 la fois final dans une partie et interlocutoire dans l'autre ?\nQuoique notre code deprocedure civile n'ait pas, en propres termes, adopt\u00e9 la classification des jugements suivie dans le code fran\u00e7ais, en jugements d\u00e9finitifs, pr\u00e9paratoires et interlocutoires, elle s'y trouve toutefois en substance. Sons cc rapport notre code en diff\u00e8re pen.\nL'art. 1155 C. P. C. dit qu'il y a appel \u00e0 la cour du Bane de la Reine de tout jugement final rendu par la cour Sup\u00e9rieure.\nD'apr\u00e8s lart. 1116 iiy a \u00e9galement appel de tout jugrement intenlocutorre dans les cas suivants : 10. Lorsqu'il decide en partie le litige; 20.Lorsqu'il ordonne qu'il soit fait une chose \u00e0 laquelle il ne peut \u00eatre rem\u00e9di\u00e9 par le jugement final; 30. Lorsqu'il a Teflfet de retarder inutileiment l'instruction du proc\u00e8s\nL'art. 1119 apr\u00e8s avoir present le mode d'appeler dun jugement interlocutoire, declare que \" cette demande doit \u00eatre faite dans le terme qui suit imm\u00e9-diatement la prononciation du jugement et ne peut \u00eatre re\u00e7u ensuite, sauf n\u00e9anmonss a la partie de faire valoir ses moyens \u00e0 l'encontre du jugement interlocu toire, sur appel ou povurvoi contre le jugement final.\nLe jugement final est sans doute celui qui met fin au litige en r\u00e9glant toutes les contestations soulev\u00e9es entre les parties, Carr\u00e9 et Chauveau ([1]), le d\u00e9finit ainsi;\nLe jugement d\u00e9fintif est celui qui statue sur toute Ia cause et la termine. Mais il y a aussi des jugements qui ne la d\u00e9cidant qu'en partie, sont tout \u00e0 Ia fois d\u00e9finitifs et interlocutoires.\nA laquelle de ces cat\u00e9gories appartient le jugement rendu le 24 novembre 1880 ?\nLes questions en d\u00e9bat \u00e9taient la responsabilit\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9 comme constructeur et le montant des dom-mages que pouvait r\u00e9clamer 1 appelant en cons\u00e9quenee de la mauvaise qualit\u00e9 des ouvrages. L'une et l'autre ont \u00e9t\u00e9 formellement decidees,\u2014le jugement declare liintim\u00e9 responsabee pour l'insuffisance du mur (south-west gable) et ordonne que les frais de sa reconstruction seront estim\u00e9s par experts. C'est le seul point sur lequel il restera \u00e0 statuer apr\u00e8s le rapport des experts, \u2014\u2014 tous les autres ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9s finalement. Ainsi il declare que l'intim\u00e9 n'est pas responsabee pour Ia demolition et reconstruction du mur en brique qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 construit sun le mur de pierre \u00e9rig\u00e9 par lui,i ni pour aucun autre dommage soit a la cociverture soit aux dalles. Il est aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l'appelant n'a pas droit a des dommages pour perte de loyer de sa b\u00e2tisse. Tous les points en litige sont d\u00e9cid\u00e9s en fait et en droit, un seul n'est d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'en droit:celui qui reconna\u00eet le droit de l'appelant d'obtenir une indemnit\u00e9 pour la reconstruciion du mur de pierre.\nLa question de responsabilit\u00e9 sous ce rapport est d\u00e9cid\u00e9e en droit,\u2014mais ne lest pas en fait, parce que la preuve n'\u00e9tait pas suffisante. C'est pour cette raison que le jugement est interlocutoire dans la partie ordon-nant l'expertise.\nQue devait faire l'appelant en presence d'un juge-ment qui rejetait toutes ses pr\u00e9tentions, moins une, sur laquelle ii pouvait avoir gain de cause pour une faible partie de sa demande en faisant la preuve exig\u00e9e ? En appeler \u00e0 cette cour, car ce jugement a tout le carac-t\u00e8re d'un jugement d\u00e9finitif. Pouvait-il esp\u00e9rer que la cour du Banc de la Reine reviendrait plus tard sur son jugemennt Certainement non. Il ne pouvait pas de-inander aux juges de cette cour de se d\u00e9juger, ils \u00e9taient functi officio, lls navait plus juridiction sur les points finalement d\u00e9cid\u00e9s par eux.\nLe jugement du. 24 novembre 1880 quoique ne ter-minant pas toute la contestation n'en devatt pas moins \u00eatre trait\u00e9 comme un jugement d\u00e9finitif d'apr\u00e8s l'auto-rit\u00e9 de Carr\u00e9 et Chauveau ([2]) :\nNous avons fait remarquer que certains jugements qui no ter-minent par la contestation peuvent n\u00e9anmoins \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme d\u00e9finitifs, par rapport \u00e0 leur objet et quo tels \u00e8taient par exemple ceux qui prononcent s\u00e9par\u00e9ment sur un incident, une exception, une nullite, une fin de non recevoir, etc. Dans ces cir-constances, en effet, les contestations sur lesquelles le jugement pro-nonce sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme formant autant do proc\u00e8s s\u00e9par\u00e9s qu'il termine.\nQuoique notre code de proc\u00e9dure n'ait pas fait en propre terme la distinction admise par le Code de proc\u00e9dure fran\u00e7ais entre les jugements qui doivent \u00eatre con-sid\u00e9r\u00e9s simplement comme pr\u00e9paratoires et dont ii ne peut y avoir appel avant le jugement d\u00e9fintif, et les jugements interlocutoires dans lesquels cet appel est facultatif, comme dans notre Code, cependant les cas. dans lesquels l'appel est permis par notre art. 1116, seraient tous consid\u00e9r\u00e9s dans le code fran\u00e7ais comme interlocutoires dont il peut y avoir appel.\nLes autres jugements n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 l'insrruction de la proc\u00e9ure, doivent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme pr\u00e9aratoires seulement et trait\u00e9s comme tels. On peut donc dans ces circonstances faire applicaiion \u00e0 notre proc\u00e9duee des ]principes du droit fran\u00e7ais concernant ces jugements. On verra par la definition donn\u00e9e par l'auteur d\u00e9j\u00e0 cite ([3]) que le jugement 24 novembre 1880, n'est pas seulement interlocutoire :\nLe jugement interlocutoire est clone celui qui, sans juger positive-ment la question, laisse entrevoir l'opinion qu'en a con\u00e7ue le juge, et d'apr\u00e8s laquelle ii la d\u00e9cideaa plus tard, non pas cer(ainement, mass probablement.\nL'appel en eat permis avant le jugement du fond parce qu'on peut vouloir \u00e9viter cette tendance qu'on redoute; mais on est admss \u00e0 retarder cet appel parce qu 'on peut esp\u00e9rer que le pr\u00e9jug\u00e9 sera abandnn\u00e9 avant d'avorr produit ses derniers r\u00e9sultats.\nLa difficult\u00e9 se r\u00e9sume donc \u00e0 distinguer le jugement qui juge, de celui qui ne fait que pr\u00e9juger.\nR\u00e9duite en ces termes, elle peut \u00eatre d\u00e9cid\u00e9e par des principes qui nous semblent positifs.\nQu'est-ce qui constitue la chose jug\u00e9e dans une d\u00e9cision \u00e9man\u00e9e des tribunaux. C'est Ic dispositif de leur jugement et pas autre chose. Mass ausii ce que contient ce dispositif ne doit jamais \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme l'expression sans valeur d'une opinion que Von puisse abandonner plus tard. Le dispostif est chose jug\u00e9e sauf lea moyens l\u00e9gaux de r\u00e9formaiion.\nOn voit done qu'il n'y a pas de jugement qui soit purement interlocutoire; car tout jugement a un dispostif, et le dispositif n'est pas un simple pr\u00e9jug\u00e9. C'est une chose d\u00e9finitivement jug\u00e9e sur laquelle le juge ne peut plus revenir. Le caract\u00e8re d'interlbcutoire ne convient qu'a Ia partie du jugement qui offre un pr\u00e9jug\u00e9 sur lea questions non d\u00e9cid\u00e9es. A la page 74 l'auteur conelut ainsi sa dissertation *\nDe tout ce que nous venons de dire sur la distinction des juge-merits interlooutoires et d\u00e9finitifs il est facile de conclure que ceux qui prononcent sur un incident soit en rejetant une exception, soit en annulant un acte do proc\u00e9ure, ou dans toute autre circonstance, sont des jugements d\u00e9finitifs desque!s on peut interjeter appel avant le jugement sur le fond.\nSuit une longue \u00e9num\u00e9ration de jugements interlo-cutoires qui doivent etre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme d\u00e9finitifs. En faisant au jugement du 24 novembre 1880, application des principes developp\u00e9s par Carr\u00e9 et Chauveau, il n'est pas douteux que le jugement doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme d\u00e9fintif et que les juges qui l'ont rendu doivent se consid\u00e9rer comme li\u00e9s par ce jugement.\nIl y a, avons nous dit, (Carr\u00e9 et Chauveau ([4]),) dans tout jugement qui prend le titre d'interlocutoire, deux parties distinctes. le dispositif qui juge, qui par consequent est d\u00e9finitif, qui \u00e9puise le pouvoir du juge en cc qu'il prescrit, sur lequel par consequent, ii ne peut pas revenir, auquel il se trouve in\u00e9vitabiement li\u00e9. Il y a outre cela, la partie qui pr\u00e9juge ce qui n'est pas encore l'objet de Ia sentence, mais qui, ne faisant que le pr\u00e9juger, n'a pas le caract\u00e9re d'un jugement et laisse au juge le droit de revenir sur ce qui n'est que la manifestation anticipee d'une opinion.\nAinsi par quoi le juge est-il li\u00e9 ? Par la partie definitive, par la partie qui porte jugement.\nPar quoi n'est-il pas li\u00e9 par la partie interlocutoire, par la partie qui ne contient qu'un simple pr\u00e9jugC ? * * * * *\nL'intercolutoir ne lie pas le juge. Comment pourrait-il le lieri puisque ce n'est qu'un pr\u00e9iug\u00e9 ? Le juge peut-il \u00eatre li\u00e9 autrement quo par son jugement. Mais le dispositif de tout jugement, quel qu'il soit, lie le juge; car il peut juger qu'une fois.\nVoir aussi Bioche Diet de Proc\u00e9dure ([5]).\nLe m\u00eame auteur ajoute ([6]).\nLe jugement peut \u00eatre mixte; cela arrive lorsqu'il contient des dispositions difinitives et des dispositions inteiiocutoires, par exemple si le tribunal decide qu'il y a soci\u00e9t\u00e9, mais ordonne qu'un compte sera probablement rendu. Le jugement est tout \u00e0 la fois d\u00e9fintif en ce qui touche l'existence de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et interlocutoirutoire quant a la reddition pr\u00e9alable du compte.\n65. Le tribunal qui a rendu un jugement d\u00e9finitif ne peut en g\u00e9n\u00e9rall ni le changer, ni le corriger.\n59. Est definitive 110 le jugement qui ordonne une expertise, pour l'appr\u00e9ciation dun dommage \u00e9ventuel. Cass. 21 juny. 1839, (art. 1562, Pr.)\n60 Celui qui prononce d\u00e9finitivement et explicitement des condamnations formelles en soumettant leur qualit\u00e9 \u00e9ventuelle \u00e0 une expertise. Rennes, 30 mai 1818; Metz 3 juillet 1818, pp. 14, 255, 904.\n61. Peu importe que le jugement impose une condition a remplir par l'une des parties, (Turin, 9 avril 1811, p. 9, 248,) on ne fixe pas le montant des condamnations, et qu'il pr\u00e9serve pour le faire des mesures pr\u00e9paratoires. Nimes Niv. an 13p. 4 342. Ainsi le juge-ment qui ordonee une expertise pour determiner le mode d'exercece d'un droit, et les dommages et interets resultant de sa privation est d\u00e9finitif en ce sens qu'il ne reconnatt l'existence du droit et ne laisse en suspens que le mode do l'exercice. Cass. 12, Germ an 9, 16 avril 1883. Div. 1444 \u2022 387.\nPigeau([7]):\nLe jugement d\u00e9finitif est celui qui lie meme les contestations (definitives qui termine) soit en adoptant les pr\u00e9tentions des parties, soit en les modifiant, soit en les rejetant.\nUn jugement peut \u00eatre d\u00e9fintif que sur un ou plusieurs chefs, et et non sur le surplus.\nUn jugement peut contenir en meme temps une disposition definitive et un avant faire droit\nVorr ausii Bonecenne Th\u00e9orie de la Proc\u00e9dure Civile ([8]).\nLe jugement du 24 novembre 1880 qualifie d'inter-locutorre est donc un jugement d\u00e9fintiff dont ii aurait d\u00fb y avoir appel.\nEn le consid\u00e9rant m\u0152me comme un de ces interlo-cutoires que l'on peut encore attaqurr sur l'appel du jugement final, l'appelant pent-il dans les circons-tances de cette cause \u00eatre admis \u00e0 faire valoir ses moyens contre ce jugement. Il est \u00e9vident que l'art 1199 accorde \u00e0 celui qui n'a pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos d'appeler d'un interlocutoire dans le terme qui a suivi imm\u00e9diate-ment la prononciation du jugement, la facult\u00e9 d'atta- quer encoree ce jugement sur l'appel contre le jugement final. Cette disposition est conforme \u00e0 celle du Code de proc\u00e9dure fran\u00e7ais. et \u00e0 l'autorit\u00e9 de Carr\u00e9 et Chau-veau ([9]) :\nQuand le jugement d\u00e9fintif, est rendu il devient coinme le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de toute Ia procedure qui a eu lieu, les jugements d'instruction qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment rendus ne font qu'un avec celui qui termine la cause. Nous en concluons avec M. Merlin Quest. de Droit vo. Testament \u00a7 XIV, Poncet L. 15 p. 264; Talandier p.121, et avec la Cour de Nancy, 25 mars 1829, 3 Av. L. 37 p. 283, que par l'appll du jugement d\u00e9finitif, le jugement d'avant faire droit se trouve lui-meme implicite-ment soumis a l'examen du juge sup\u00e9rieur, au mioins dans ce quil con-tient d'\u00e9troitement li\u00e9 avec le fond, en ce sens du mioins que le juge Peut ne tenir aucun compte du r\u00e9sultat de la mesure d'instruction qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9e.\nAinsi, en supposant que le jugement du 28 novembre 1880, n'eut pas eu un caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif, il aurait donc pu \u00eatre revis\u00e9 sur l'appel du jugement final, mais encore aurait-il fallu pour cela que l'appelant n'y eut pas acquiesce. Car ii en est de m\u00eame pour un jugement interlocutoire que pour un jugement final,\u2014 pour pouvorr en appeler ii ne faut pas l'avoir ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 volontairement ni y avoir acquiesce d'une mani\u00e8re formelle ou tacite. Dans le cas actuel la partie inter-locutorre du jugement du 24 novembre 1880, celle qui ordonne l'expertise a \u00e9t\u00e9 volontairement ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e par l'appelant. 11 est comparu devant les experss, et y a produit et fait entendre ses t\u00e9moins, sans aucune r\u00e9serve ni protestation quelconque. Apr\u00e8s cette ex\u00e9cution volontaire peut-il se plaindre encore de ce juge-ment ? Cette question de l' acquiescement au jugement interlocutoire et de son effet sur le droit d'appel est trait\u00e9e par les auteurs d\u00e9j\u00e0 cites aux pages 78, 79 et 80. Leur dissertation \u00e0 ce sujet est trop longue pour \u00eatre cit\u00e9e en entier. Je n'en citerai que les conclusions faisant voir que l'acquiescement est un obstacle au droit d'appel A la page 79, voici ce qu'ils disent :\nAinsi nous croyons pouvoir ici nous s\u00e9parer do M. Poncet. quoique son avis suit aussi celui de M. Talandier, ([10]) et d\u00e9cider avec MM. Boitard ([11]) et Thomine Desmazures ([12]) que l'acquiescement et, par cons\u00e9qunt, l'ex\u00e9cution volontaire, pure ot simple, non justifi\u00e9e et sans reserves telle enfin que nous l'avons caract\u00e9ris\u00e9e dans nos observations aux notes do la quest, 1584 rend la partie non recevabee \u00e0 interjeter appel.\nApr\u00e9s avoir signal\u00e9 la difference qu'il y a \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard entre les jugements pr\u00e9paratoires et les interlocutoires, les auteurs continuent ainsi i\nIl n'en est pas do m\u00eame, comme on la d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu plusieurs fois, des jugements interlocutoires; l'art. 451 (dans notie code, art. 1119) prend soin de nous avertir que l'appel peut en \u00eatre interjet\u00e9 imm\u00e9diaeement apr\u00e8s sa prononciation. La partie peut done toujours par cet appel, \u00e9viter l'ex\u00e9cution ou s'y opposer. Si elle ne l'a pas fait, si, au contraire, elle a pr\u00eat\u00e9 les mains \u00e0 celee ex\u00e9cution, et ans faire aucune R\u00e9SERVE, ii est clair qu'elle n'est pas excusable, et qu'elle no peut se sousttaire \u00e0 la pr\u00e9somption d'acquiescement.\nla loi a permis et a d\u00fb permettre quo Ia partie gard\u00e2t le silence sur le jugement interlocutoire d'o\u00f9 r\u00e9sulte contre elle un pr\u00e9jug\u00e9 parce qu'elle peut esp\u00e9rer quo ce pr\u00e9jug\u00e9 n'aura pas do suite;j elle a d\u00fb lui r\u00e9sorvor n\u00e9anmoins le. droit d'\u00e9leyor ses r\u00e9clamations, lorsquo le pr\u00e9jug\u00e9 qu'elle no rodoutait pas a produit dos effets inattendus; mais, silo silence n'emp\u00eache pas de conserver ce droit, la renonciation expresse ou tacite doit le faire perdre.\nOr cotte renonciation r\u00e9sulte, soit do l'acquiescement formel, soit de l'ex\u00e9cuiion qui en a le caract\u00e8re.\nCes autorit\u00e9s sont d'une application \u00e9vidente \u00e0 la position que l'appelant s'est faite en ex\u00e9cutant volontairement le jugement ordonnant l'expertise, et ii doit \u00eatre en consequence consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme n'\u00e9tant plus recevable \u00e0 se plaindre m\u00eame de la partie interlocutoire de ce jugement Ainsi l'appel du jugement du 19 janvier 1882, n'a pu dans aucun cas donner lieu \u00e0 la revision par cette cour des questions d\u00e9cid\u00e9es \"par l'interlocutoire du 24 novembre 1880. Le seul jugement qui puisse nous \u00eatre soumis est celui du 19 janvier 1882 confirmant celui de la cour Sup\u00e9rieure, homologuant le rapport fait par les experts nomm\u00e9s en vertu de l'interlocutoire du 24 novembre 1880. Apres l'examen de ce rapport et de la preuve faite par les deux parties, ii est impossible d'en venir \u00e0 une autre conclusion que celle adopt\u00e9e par la Cour sup\u00e9rieuee et par celle du Banc de la Reine dont le jugement doit \u00eatre confirm\u00e9.\nCe n'est qu'apr\u00e8s avoir form\u00e9 mon opinion sur le m\u00e9rite de Ia cause que j'ai examine les autori\u00e9s sur la question du droit d'appel et que j'en suis venu \u00e0 la conelusion qu'il devait \u00eatre limit\u00e9 au bien ou mal jug\u00e9 sur l'homologation du dernier rapport d'experts. Bien que j'aie adopt\u00e9 une opinion qui doit mettre fin \u00e0 l'appel, je crois cependant devoir dire que sur le m\u00e9rite de la cause, j'aurais \u00e9t\u00e9 plus dispose \u00e0 adopter le premier jugement rendu par la cour Sup\u00e9rieure, en date du 27 mars 1877 que celui de la cour du Bane de la Reine. Car je consid\u00e8re la demolition des contre-forts et des murs de refente comme ayant eu l'effet de relever l'intim\u00e9 de sa garantie comme constructeur. Quant \u00e0 l'effet du climat sur les b\u00e2tisses construites en hiver je ne suis pas pr\u00eat non plus \u00e0 admettre que les cons\u00e9quences en doivent \u00eatre port\u00e9es, dans tous les cas par le constructeur, surtout lorsque c'est le propri\u00e9taire qui, comme dans le cas actuel a insist\u00e9 \u00e0 faire construire en hiver.\nEn r\u00e9sum\u00e9 je suss d'avis que le jugement du 24 nov 1880 quoique interlocutoire dans une partie celle qui ordonne l'expertise est d\u00e9finitif sur tous les autres points en contestation, et qu'il y aurait d\u00e6 y avoir appel du jugement comme d'un jugement final. 2o. Que bien que sur l'appel du jugement final une partie puisse \u00eatre re\u00e7ue \u00e0 se plaindre dun interlocutoire elle perd ce droit si, comme dans le cas actuel, elle a (volontairement et sans r\u00e9serve) ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 cet interlocutoire Pour 06s motifs le pr\u00e9sent appel dol \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nTASCHERAU, J. :\u2014\nOn the 27th March, 1877, the Superior Court gave judgment in favor of the plaintiff St. Louis, for the whole amount of his demand, dismissing is toto Show's incidental demand.\nShaw then inscribed the case for review and the Court of Review, on the 29th December 1877 reversed the judgment of the Superior Court dismissed in toto St. Louis', the plaintiff's claim, based upon his contract for the construction of the said wall and maintained Shaw's incidental demand against the said St Louis for the whole amount he claimed on the said incidental demand, $6,368.\nSt. Louis then appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench from this judgment of the Court of Review, and the said Court of Queen's Bench on the 21th November, 1880, reversed the judgment of the Court of. Review, and determined that Shaw was not entitled to the damages he claimed for loss of rent and the demolition and rebuilding of the brick wall but that as the stone wall built by St. Louis was insufficient and it had become necessary to demolish and rebuild the same, he, Shaw, was entitled to the cost of such demolishing and rebuilding of this said stone wall. The said court further ordered that, as the cost of such demolishing and rebuilding the stone wall could not be ascertained by the evidence on record, an expertise should take place for that purpose, under the authority of the Superior Court.\nThe record was accordingly remitted to the Superior Court, when three experts were appointed, in accordance with the said judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, to ascertain the value of demolishing and rebuilding the stone wall constructed by St. Louis. These experts unanimously reported that the cost of such demolishing and rebuilding amounted to $590.\nThereupon the case was heard before the Superior Court, and on the 18th June, 1881, that court held that, as it was bound by the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench of the 24th November, 1880, it had only to deduct from the plaintiff's demand the sum of $590 reported, by the last expertise, as being the cost incurred by the defendant for demolishing and rebuilding the said stone wall, and then, to give the said plaintiff judgment for the balance, dismissing the defendants incidental demand for loss of rent and for the cost of rebuilding the brick wall, as decreed by the Court of Queen's Bench.\nShaw, the defendant appealed to the Court of the Queen's Bench, from this last judgment of the Superior Court. The Court of Queen's Bench, however, on the 19th January, 1882, dismissed his appeal, on the ground that the Superior Court, having strictly followed what the said Court of Queen's Bench had ordered by its judgment of the 24th November, 1880, had so rendered the only judgment it could possibly give. It is from this last judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench of the 19th January 1882 that Shaw now appeals to this court.\nI am of opinion to dismiss his appeal.\nThe judgment of the Superior Court of the 18th June, 1881, was undoubtedly right. As it holds in one of its consid\u00e9rants, its hands were tied by the previous judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench.\nThough the Roman law says that : \u2014\nIt often happens that the Appeal Court's judgment is the wrong one and that he who judges the last does not always judge the best ([13]), Still it must be conceded that the relative functions of courts of first instance and of appeal cannot be so inverted as to have authorized the Superior Court, in this instance to reverse the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench. It had to, unreservedly, submit to it, as it did and to accordinglv dismiss in toto Shaw's incidental demand and give judgment in favor of St. Lout's for the amount of his demand less the $590 found by the second expertise to have been the cost of the re-building of the stone wall\nIt had no alternative.\nThe maxim \" l'interlocutoire ne lie pas le juge \" cannot have any application to an interlocutory judgment given by an Appeal Court and transmitted to the Superior Court for execution. This maxim applies to the very tribunal that rendered the interlocutory judgment, that is to say, if the Superior Court, for instance, renders a purely interlocutory judgment, it may, in certain cases, at the final judgment, not be bound by this interlocutory.\nBut to extend this doctrine to the judgment of a Court of Appeal, and make it say \" l' interlocutoire de la Cour d' appel ne lie pas le tribunal de prewi\u00e8re instance \" seems to me untenable.\nIl est impossible d'admettre, says Boitard ([14]), que, quand une Cour Jmp\u00e9riale, sur l'appel do l'interlocutoire, aura confirm\u00e9 le jugement do premi\u00e8re instance, le tribunal' reste encore ma\u00eetre de statuer contrairement \u00e0 cot arr\u00eat, et d\u00e9truisant ce qu'il a fait et ce qu'a fait aussi la Cour Imp\u00e9riale, de decider que l'enqu\u00eate n'\u00e9tait pas admissible dans l'esp\u00e9ce.\nUpon this principle, it seems to me clear, the judgment of the Superior Court of 1881 was the only one it could give, as it had to obey purely and simply the judgment of the Court of Appeal, even if that judgment had been of a purely interlocutory nature.\nBut this judgment of 1880, by the Court of Appeal, was even not a purely interlocutory judgment. It was as final as it could ever be as to the dismissal of Shaw's claims for loss of rent and for the rebuilding of the brick wall as well as to the condemnation of Si, Louis for the cost of the rebuilding of the stone wall, though it had to order an expert to ascertain to what sum amounted this rebuilding of the stone wall. The court, it is true, did not, by their judgment, dismiss Shaw's incidental demand, or give St. Louis any judgment against Shaw, but that was because it could not with the evidence in the record ascertain the cost of the re-building of the stone wall It might have happened that the amount accruing to Shaw for such re-building, would have been sufficient to entitle him to the dismissal of the plaintiff's whole action and to a balance on his incidental demand. So the Court of Queen's Bench could not then decide whether St. Louis' action should be maintained or dismissed or for what amount it should be maintained (if any) or whether Shaw's incidental demand should be maintained or dismissed. But what it did decide and finally determine was that Shaw was on the one hand entitled to the cost of the re-building of the stone wall and on the other hand was not entitled to what he claimed for rent the rebuilding of the brick wall. There was no avant faire droit, no jugement pr\u00e9paratire as to this but a final determination : not absolutely final of the action, it is true, but final of all the respective demands and claims of both parties.\nIt is only of the judgements altogether interlocutory that the maxim l'interlocutoire ne lie pas le juge applies, such as for example are described as follows in Ancien Denizart ([15]).\nInterloquer ou rendre une sentence interlocutoire, c'est ordonner qu'une chose sera prouv\u00e9e ou v\u00e9rifi\u00e9e avant qu'on prononce sur le fond de l'aiffaire. Or, Guyot ([16]) :\nC'est un jugement qui n'est point d\u00e9finitif, c'est-\u00e0-dire qui ne decide pas le fond de la contestation, mais seulement ordonne quelque chose pour l'instruction ou l'\u00e9claircissement de cette contestation. Tout interlocutoire est Un pr\u00e9paratoire et un pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 remplir avant le jugement d\u00e9finitif. Mais il diff\u00e8re du simple pr\u00e9paratoire en cc qu\u00e9 celui-ci ne concerne ordinairement que l'instruction, an lieu que l'autre touche aussi le fond.\nIn the present case, for example, the judgment of the Superior Court ordering the first expertise was a jugement pr\u00e9paratoire or purely interlocutory. But the judgment of the Court of Appeal, ordering the second expertise, was apres faire droit, if I may use that expression It settled definitively the contestation between the parties. The amount of the judgment only remained to be ascertained. it was equivalent, for instance, to a judgment in the Admiralty Court, holding a vessel liable for the consequences of a collision but leaving to the assessors to establish the amount of the judgment. it is clear, then, that the Superior Court's judgment of 1881, in submitting to this judgment of the Court of Appeal and executing it, was perfectly right and altogether unimpeachable.\nNow, if that judgment was right, the Court of Queen's Bench last judgment now appealed from, confirming it, must also have been right. A Court of Appeal cannot say : c considering that in the judgment appealed from, there is no error, yet we reverse it,\" and say; \" we proceed to give the judgment which the said court ought to have given,\" when it is of opinion that the said court gave the only judgment it could have given.\nThe Court of Queen's Bench, in 1880, had reversed the judgment of the Court of 1eview, and had dismissed in toto, Shaw's claim for loss of rent, and the re-building of the brick wall. Can it be contended that the same court had the power, at any time afterwards, to entirely reverse its said own judgment of 1880, and, virtually confirming the judgment of the Court of Review, which it had at first so reversed to determine that Shaw was entitled to his said claim for loss of rent and the re-building of the brick wall ? No. Not more than it would have had the right on an appeal by St. Louis from that judgment of 1882, to reverse that part of the said judgment of 1880 determining that Shaw was entitled to the cost of the re-building of the stone wall. The judgment of 1880, by the Court of Appeal, bound not only the Superior Court but the Court of Appeal itself \"which rendered it\nA judgment, in an analogous case, is reported in the first part of first vol. of Deville\u00eeiev\/Ve et Carette ([17]). There the Court of Appeal had, by a first judgment reversed the judgment of the Superior Court and ordered an ex* pertise. Upon the report of this second expertise, the same Court of Appeal, virtually reversing its own judgment, had confirmed the judgment of the Superior Court which it had at first reversed But the Cour de Cassation held :\nAttendu que le tribunal qui a rendu le jugement attaq\u00e9\u00e9, avait par un premier jugement contradictoire et en dernier ressort, infirm\u00e9 le jugement dont \u00e9tait appel, lorsque depuis et par celui dont la cassation est demand\u00e9e, il a confirm\u00e9 ce m\u00eame jugement, et qu'ainsi ii s'est \u00e9lev\u00e9 contre l'autorit\u00e9 de la chose jug\u00e9e * * * Casse, &c. &c\nand the reporter, in a note, says;\nC'est evident : ce serait l\u00e0 de la part desjuges d'appel, se reformer eux-m\u00eames, ce quills peuvent pas faire.\nThe principle by which the Cour de Cassation was guided, in that case, must guide us here, and we have accordingly to hold that the judgment of the Court of Appeal of 1882, now appealed from, is the only one hat could then be given, and consequently that the appeal therefrom must be dismissed. We cannot reverse a judgment which, must be admitted to have been right. When of opinion that the court appealed from erred, we have the power nay, it is our duty, to give the judgment that, in our opinion, ought to have been given but when we come to the conclusion that the judgment appealed from is the only one that could have been given re surely cannot entertain the appeal.\nThe judgment, if any, that Shaw has to complain of, is the judgment of 1850; but, on an appeal from the judgment of 1882, he is precluded from impeaching this judgment of 1880 and this whether or not he had the right to appeal to this court from the said judgment of 1880. If he had no right to appeal there is chose jug\u00e9e; if he had a right to appeal, but did not exercise his right there is also chose jug\u00e9e. There is here no question of a suspended right of appeal, or of chose jug\u00e9e provisionally only. If the judgment appealed from is right, we must confirm it, and it is right because it confirmed a judgment of the Superior Court which is the only one that court could give.\nThe authorities on the questions of law raised here are numerous. I quote the following :\nLes jugements interlocutoires sont tous ceux d'instructions On appelle jugements d\u00e9finitifs, ceux qui d\u00e9cident le fond de la contestation Guyot ([18]).\nLe pr\u00e9teur peut reformer, d\u00e9truire, renouveler les sentences interlocutoires qu'il a prononc\u00e9es. 11 n'en est pas de m\u00eame des sentences ' d\u00e9finitives. ([19])\nNon desunt tamen interlocutorice senientice quce vim definitir\u00e6 dum irreparabile damnum infert earum executio vel defini-tivee ex juris necsssitate ad eas sequi debet * * *\nQuales interlocutorias vim definitiv\u00e6 habentes etiam post pronun-ciationeni corriqi vet retractari non posse, verius est maxime si ab eis appellatum fucrit. ([20]) Cette maxime, que \" l'interlocutoire ne lie pas le juge,\" qu'il peut toujours s'en \u00e9cartor, judex ab interlocutoris discedere potest, n'est vraie qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des simples jugements interlocutoires qui se bornent \u00e0 ordonner une mesure d'instruction pr\u00e9jugeant le fond, et qui ne contiennent aucune decision d\u00e9finitive sur tous ou quelques uns des chefs du d\u00e9bat. Ce sont les Seuls qui no soient pas susceptibles do passer enforce do chose jug\u00e9e. 11 convient done do distinguer entre les divers jugements interlocutoires, et m\u00eame dans chaque jugement interlocutoire proprement dit, les decisions qui n'ont pour objet qu'une simple mesure d instruction, et celles au contraire par lesqueslles ii est statu\u00e9 \u00e0 certains \u00e9gards d'une mani\u00e8re definitive, Les d\u00e9cisions do cette derni\u00e8re esp\u00e8ce passant \u00e0 raison de leur carac t\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif, en force do chose jug\u00e9e, aussi bien quo les jugements ordinaires, qui n'ont aucun caract\u00e8re interlocutoire. ([21])\nTout jugement n'a pas l'autorit\u00e9 do chose jug\u00e9e. La pr\u00e9somption de v\u00e9rit\u00e9 qui est attach\u00e9e aux jugements, implique qu'ils d\u00e9cident une contestation * * *. * Do l\u00e0 la cons\u00e9quence que la chose jug\u00e9e no r\u00e9sulte que des jugements qui statuent d\u00e9finitivement sur la contestation. Il ne faut pas entendre le principe en ce sens quo l'autorit\u00e9 de chose jug\u00e9e no soit attribu\u00e9e qu'au jugement qui met fin au proc\u00e8s. 11 peut, dans une m\u00eame affaire, intervenir plusieurs jugements d\u00e9finitifs, en ce sens, qu'ils d\u00e9cident d\u00e9finitivement cer-tains points d\u00e9battus entre les parties. Tous ces jugements ont l'autorit\u00e9 do chose jug\u00e9e *******\nQuand un jugement, interlocutoire en apparence, decide r\u00e9ellemont un point contest\u00e9 entre les parties, il est d\u00e9finitif, et ii a, par cons\u00e9quent, l'autorit\u00e9 do chose jug\u00e9e ([22]).\nPigeau ([23]) says :\nQuelque fois le Jugement est interlocutoire et d\u00e9finitif en m\u00eame temps, c'est lorsque les juges so trouvent en \u00e9tat do statuer d\u00e9fini-tivement sur un chef et out b\u00e9soin d'\u00e9claircissement sur un autre.\nI refer also to Beriat de St. Brix ([24]), and to Boilard ([25]); Duranton ([26]); Touiller ([27]); Merlin ([28]); Poncet, des jugements ([29]). On the 5th December, 1860, in the Cour de Cassation, re Feesler ([30]), it was held that :\nLe jugement d'une cour de premi\u00e8re instance qui, statuant sur la question de savoir laquelle des deux parties a la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 exclusive ''d'un terrain, d\u00e9cide en premier lieu, que le titre produit par le demandeur \u00e9tablit cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 son profit, mais permet au d\u00e9fendeur de faire la preuve de la possession sur laquelle il appuie un plaidoyer do prescription acquisitive du dit terrain, est d\u00e9finitif sur le chef d\u00e9clarant que le demandeur a \u00e9tabli son titre \u00e0 la dite propri\u00e9t\u00e9, et interlocutoire sur l'admission de la preuve du plaidoyer du d\u00e9tendeur et quo ce jugement, n'ayant point \u00e9t\u00e9 frapp\u00e9 d'appel, a acquis l'autorit\u00e9 do chose jug\u00e9e sur le chef qu'il a jug\u00e9 d\u00e9finitivement ([31]).\nIn another case, cited in Dalloz ([32]), it was held that :\nAttendu que si, en principe, le juge n'est pas lie par l'interlocutoire qu'il a ordonn\u00e9, c'est en ce sens que, quelque soit le r\u00e9sultat do la mesure prescrite avant faire droit, il reste absolument libre sur la decision du fond; mais que les dispostiions d'un jugement interlocutoire n'en sont pas moins susceptibles d'acqu\u00e9rir l'autorit\u00e9 de la chose jug\u00e9e, et par. suite do lier le juge. ([33]) *****\nVoir aussi :\nRe Beaugrand ([34]). Re Abbadie ([35]). Re Vanaud ([36]).\nIn Dalloz ([37]) a note of the reporter is as follows :\nLa jurisprudence a souvent reconnu \u00e0 un m\u00eame jugement le double caract\u00e8re d'une decision d\u00e9finitive et d'une decision interlocutoire; le caract\u00e8re d'une decision d\u00e9finitive en ce sons que le jugement re-conna\u00eet he droit, qu'aucune partie pr\u00e9tend \u00e0 une chose \u00e0 determiner ou \u00e0 une somme a liquider. et le caract\u00e8re d'une decision interbocutoire en ce quo, pour arriver \u00e0 cette d\u00e9termination ou \u00e0 cette liquidation, le jugement prescrit une expertise ou toute autre mesure d'instruction.\nAu point do vue do la chose jug\u00e9e, on distingue les deux decisions que contient ainsi un m\u00eame jugement. La premi\u00e8re lie le juge qui ne peut plus nier le droit qu'il a reconnu, La seconde no lie pas le juge qui peut toujours determiner ou \u00e9valuer l'objet du droit contrairement aux conclusions ce l'expertise * * *\nOn pout dire d'une mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale quo le juge est toujours li\u00e9 par les d\u00e9finitions qu'il donne du droit qu'il reconnait avant d'en, fixer l'\u00e9valuaiion. Tel est aussi le cas des jugements qui determinont les bases du compte ou du partage qu'ils ordonnent (des arr\u00e9ts et autorit\u00e9s sont ici cit\u00e9es par le rapporteur)\nI may add that, by art, 1116 of the code of procedure, it is impliedly admitted that the maxim \" l' interlocutoire ne lie pas le juge \" is not applicable to all interlocutory judgments, since it provides for the interlocutory judgments which cannot be remedied by the final judgments, and which consequently lient le juge. See Cheney v. Frigon ([38]) and also that the second paragraph of art. 1119 evidently it seems to me, must be read as applying only to judgments purely interlocutory.\nI refrain from expressing any opinion as to the various decisions in Wardle v. Bethune ([39]) and the casts of that class They rest entirely on the interpretation to be given to the statutes, or articles of the code, relating to the appeal of interlocutory judgments from the courts of first instance to the Court of Queen's Bench and it is obvious, raise questions the solution of which is unnecessary for the determination of the present cause.\nI may add also that a case of Archie v. Lortie ([40]) has not escaped my attention. It is there said as an obiter dictum, by Chief Justice Meredith that the judge who renders the final judgment can reverse all interlocutory judgments; but this, I have no doubt, the Chief Justice intended to apply to purely interlocutory judgments only. That great lawyer did not, I am sure, mean to say that, for instance, if a dilatory exception asking security for costs is dismissed, the judge, by the final judgment after all the costs have been incurred, after the whole case has been tried, or, the Court of Appeal itself, on an appeal from this final judgment, can review the judgment dismissing this dilatory exception and order security for costs. Neither did he mean to say that the court of first instance is not bound by the interlocutory judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nRitchie, C.

C. art. 1143 Parties.\nS. G. acquired during the life of his first wife, M. A. B., certain immovable property which formed part of the communaut\u00e9 de biens existing between them. At his death, after his marriage with H. S., his second wife, he was greatly involved. His widow, H. S., having accepted sous benefice d'inventaire the universal sus- fractural legacy made in her favour by S. G., continued in pos- session of her estate as well as that of M. A. B., the first wife, and administered them both, employing one G. to collect, pay debts, etc- Shortly afterwards, at a meeting of S. G's. creditors, of whom the respondents were the chief, a resolution was adopted authorizing H. S. to sell and licitate the properties belonging to the estate of S. G. with the advice of an advocate and the cashier of the respondents, and promising to ratify anything done on their advice, and they resolved that the moneys derived from the sale or licitation of the properties should be deposited with the respondents, to be apportioned among S. G's. creditors pro rata. G.continued to collect the fruits and revenues and rents, and acted generally for H. S. and under the advice aforesaid, and deposited both the moneys derived from the estate of S. G., and those derived from the estate of M. A. B., the first wife, with the respondents, under an account headed \"Succession S.G.\" A balance remained after some cheques thereupon had been paid, for which this action was now brought by the heirs and representatives of Dame M. A. B.\nHeld,\u2014Per Strong, Taschereau and Gwynne, JJ., (Ritchie, C.J., and Furnier and Henry, JJ., contra,) that, as between the heirs B. and the bank there was no relation of creditor and debtor nor any fiduciary relation, nor any privity whatever; and as the moneys collected by G. belonging to the heirs B. were so collected by him as the agent of H. S. and not as the agent of the bank, and received by the bank in good faith, as applicable to the debts of the estate of S. G., and as the representatives of H. S. were not parties to the action, the appellants could not recover the moneys sued for.\nAPPEAL from a judgment rendered on the 21st March, 1882, by the Court of Queen's Bench, Montreal, reversing a judgment of the Superior Court, Montreal, whereby appellant's action had been maintained against respondents, for an amount of,$9,933.04 and interest, and dismissing said action.\nThe facts that gave rise to the appellants' action, the pleadings and points relied on by counsel are referred to at length in the judgments hereinafter given ([1]) Mr. Trenholme and Mr. B\u00e9ique, for appellants.\nMr. Globensky, Q. C., for respondents.\nRITCHIE, C. J. :\u2014\nIt cannot be doubted that a portion of the moneys of the heirs Bosna was deposited in the bank under the heading S Succession S. Gtraldi,\" and is still there. The amount is clearly established, and the evidence shows that Dame Henriette Giraidi was entirely incapable of administering the estate that she did not do so and that the cashier of the bank with the legal adviser did administer it. The amounts belonging to the old and new succession were capable of separation and were separated property belonging to the heirs Bosna, and those who were acting for them must reasonably be taken to have known, and must have known had they chosen to make reasonable enquiries and as Louis Guimond unquestionably did know that the half of said revenues belonged to the heirs Bosna. The mere fact of these parties depositing the money in the bank under the heading they did, does not entitle the bank to retain that portion of the moneys so deposited belonging to the heirs Bosna in payment of the debts of the succession Giraldi. There is no principle of law or equity that I am acquainted with that would justify the robbing of one estate to pay the debts of another.\nIt is, to my mind, quite clear that in reference to the administering of this estate Dame Henriette Senecal was a cypher, that the collecting of the debts and rents and revenues of the immoveables, half of which belonged to the heirs Bosna was at the instance of the creditors of said Giraldi (the bank being the largest, in fact the principal creditor), practically and substantially taken out of her hands and confided to the attorney and cashier of the bank with Louis Guimond acting under their directions and orders who deposited the same in the said bank under the heading S Succession S. Giraldi.\" The bank knew full well that the creditors 'of S. Giraldi had no right to be paid out of these moneys\nThe parties must have known that the succession Senecal was only entitled to half of the revenues; that through the cashier and attorney, and Louis Guirnond, employed by them, the revenues were collected and that the other half belonged to the heirs Bosna, and could not legally or equitably be applied to the payment of the debts of the succession Gifaldi,\nThis is by no means the ordinary naked case of banker and customer. It appears to me beyond all question, that from the very moment of the opening of this account the bank knew or had the means of knowledge and must have known but for wilful ignorance, that a portion of the moneys paid into that account arose from the rents and profits of the property of the heirs Bosna, and could make no arrangement with dame Henriette Senecal so as to be at liberty to appropriate such rents towards the liquidation of the debts of the succession S Giraldi, and made no such arrangement; and that no such, arrangement was ever contemplated at the meeting of the 15th March, 1870, at which neither dame Henriette Senecal nor the heirs Bosna were represented.\nEven supposing these amounts were paid in and received by the bank under the impression that they belonged to the succession of S. Giraldi, upon what principle can they, before they had been disposed of or distributed and while still in hands of the bank and when knowledge is brought home to them that they do not belong to the succession S. Giraldi, be permitted to misapply and mis-appropriate them, and apply them to the discharge of S. Girald\u00ef's debts, to the loss and injury of the heirs Bosna, who are in no way liable, legally or equitably, to discharge them; and the only reason the cashier gives why it should be paid to the creditors of S, Giraldi is to be found in his evidence as follows :\nQ. La Banque ne doit-elle pas cet argent aux cr\u00e9anciers, en vertu de l'autorisation a vous donn\u00e9e \u00e0 l'assemol\u00e9e des creanciers? R. R Oui.\nQ. Quand vous dites que d'apr\u00e8s vous, Ia balance en d\u00e9p\u00f4t \u00e0 la Banque Jacques Cartier devrait \u00e9tO pay\u00e9e aux cr\u00e9anciers de feu M!. Giraldi, c'est parceque vous ne connaissez pas les droits des h\u00e9ritiers de Marie Ann Bosna ? R. C'est parceque ie pense tout simplement quo ce serait un acte de justice : mais je ne connais pas les droits des h\u00e9ritiers do Marie Ann Bosna.\nA most singular idea of an act of justice\u2014for what possible right had the creditors of S. Giraldi to authorize the collecting of the revenues of the heirs Bosna to pay these debts ?\nI am of opinion the appeal should be allowed, and the judgment of the Superior Court restored.\nSTRONG, J. :\u2014\nI am of opinion that the proper conclusion from the evidence is that the revenues derived from all the properties, as well those belonging to the estate Bosna, as those belonging to the succession Giraldi Giraldi, were paid by Madame Giraldi, acting through her agent Guimond, into the bank to be ultimately distributed amongst the creditors of the Giraldi succession. It does not it is true, appear from the minutes of the meeting of the 15th March 1870 the resolutions of which have reference exclusively to the sales of the properties belonging to the succession Giraldi and the distribution of the monies arising from those sales that the creditors came to any conclusion as to the disposal of the revenues. It is however a fair inference from the whole course of proceeding, as well as from the evidence of Mr. Cott\u00e9,that the monies were paid into the bank, not upon an ordinary deposit account, bat as funds to be applied to the payment of the debts of the succession. Then, so far as 1 can see, the evidence fails to establish that Guimond was the agent, or mandatary, of the bank. He is not referred to in the minutes of the meeting and it is not shown that he received any express authority from the bank, or from Mr. Cott\u00e9, to receive the rents or to act in any manner as their agent or the agent of the creditors. He had been the agent of Mr. Giraldi, in his lifetime, acting as such in receiving the rents of the properties belonging to the estate Bosna, as well as of those belonging to Mr. Giraldi himself and after the death of the latter he continued to act in the same capacity for Madame Giraldi, and this he continued to do after the creditors' meeting in the same manner as he had formerly done. In effect, therefore, these rents were received by Madame Giraldi through her agent, Guimond, and were by her paid to the bank for the benefit of itself and the other creditors as monies belonging to the estate Giraldi, and were by the bank received in good faith as monies properly applicable to that purpose, and the legal result must be precisely the same as if Madame Giraldi had personally collected the rents and paid the money to the bank. The law applicable to such a state of facts is contained in art. 1143 of the Civil Code of the province of Quebec, That art. (which is identical with art. 1239 C. N.) is expressed in these Words :\nPour paver valablement il faut avoir dans la chose pay\u00e9e un droit qui autorise \u00e0 la donner en paiement.\nN\u00e9anmoins le paiement dune somme en argent ou autre chose qui se consomme par l'usage, ne peut \u00eatre r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 contre le cr\u00e9ancier qui a consomm\u00e9 Ia chose de bonne foi, quoique ce paiement ait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait par quelqu'un qui n'en \u00e9tait pas propri\u00e9taire ou qui n'\u00e9tait pas capable de l'ali\u00e9ner.\nThere is some difference of opinion amongst the commentators as to whether this article applies at all to the action \"which the true owner of the money or thing given in payment institutes for its recovery, and whether it is not confined to the case of the debtor who has unduly paid his debt with the money or property of another seeking a repetition of the payment ([2]). Demolombe, however, shows very clearly that it correctly expresses the law applicable to the action of the true owner and is not restricted in the manner suggested by the other authorities quoted ([3]); and, interpreting it in this sense, it entirely agrees with the English law as expressed in the adage, that \" money has no ear mark\" ([4]).\nThen, applying this article to the facts of the present case as before stated it is clear that the Court of Queen's Bench rightly dismissed the action, for the money was received by a creditor in good faith, it not being suggested that the bank had any knowledge of the rights of the heirs Bosna, unless, indeed, Guimond was their agent, and that he was not their agent appears to be the true conclusion from the facts in evidence.\nThe only other condition requisite to disentitle the plaintiffs to recover is that the money should be \"consumed,\" and the payment of money into a bank and the mixture of it with its other funds according to the ordinary course of business, is equivalent to consumption. That the whole question turns upon the supposed agency of Guimond is conceded by the learned judge who dissented in the Court of Queen's Bench Mr. Justice Tessier, and he only reached the conclusion that the plaintiffs were entitled to judgment by holding that it was proved that Guimond was the agent of the bank, a view of the facts in which I am compelled to differ from him. I am of opinion that the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER J. :\nLe present appel est d'un jugement rendu par la Cour du Bane de la Reine \u00e0 Montreal le 21 mars 1882 infirmant le jugement de Ia Cour Sup\u00e9rieuee pour le District de Montr\u00e9al, par lequel cette derni\u00e8re avait condamn\u00e9 l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 payer aux appelants $9,933.04.\nL'action des appelants est fOnd\u00e9e sur les faits suivants : Feu Seraphino Giraldi, hotelier de Montr\u00e9al, fut mari\u00e9 deux fois; Ia premiere \u00e0 Maris Anne Bosna d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e en 1841; la seconde \u00e0 Henriette S\u00e9n\u00e9col d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e en 1877.\nIly a eu des enfants des deux mariages. 1u premier sont n\u00e9es Marie Anne Giraldi Julie Giraldi et Eliza Giraldi, Avec sa premi\u00e8re femme Giraldi \u00e9tait en communaut\u00e9 de biens. Avec sa seconde une s\u00e9paratonn de biens avait \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenue en justice.\nLes immeubles d\u00e9crits en la declaration en cette cause formaient partie de la communaut\u00e9 de biens qui avait exist\u00e9 entre Giraldi et Marie Anne Bosna Ce fait est constat\u00e9 par l'inventaire fait par Giraldi en qualit\u00e9 de tuteur \u00e0 ses trois filles issues de son mariage avec Marie Anne Bosna, sa premiere femme. Il \u00e9tait encore en possession, par indivis, de ces immeubles \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque 4e son d\u00e9c\u0141s.\nL'action est intent\u00e9e par l'une des trois filles du premier mariage de Giraldi et par lea repr\u00e9sentanss des deux autres. Ii est inutile d'\u00e9noncer ici de nonveau la filiation les titres et qualit\u00e9s des parties on en trouvera un expos\u00e9 complet dans les notes de l'Honorable Juge Tessier sur cette cause.\nLors de son d\u00e9c\u00e8s Giraldi \u00e9tait en faillite; cependant il avait fait Un testament constituant Dame Henriette S\u00e9n\u00e9cal, sa seconde femme, l\u00e9gataire universelle en usufruit, avec pouvoir de vendre ses propri\u00e9t\u00e9s pour payer ses dettes. Ce legs fut accep\u00e9\u00e9 par sa veuve sous b\u00e9n\u00e9fice d'inventaire.\nLes cr\u00e9anciers de Giraldi, au nombre desquels se trouvait l'intim\u00e9e pour le plus fort montant, se r\u00e9unirent le 15 mars 1870 et apr\u00e8s avoir pris communication du testament de feu Giraldi, autorisant dame Henriette S\u00e9n\u00e9cal, sa l\u00e9gataire, de vendre les immeubles pour payer les dettes de sa succession s'en d\u00e9clar\u00e8rent contents et satisfaits Apr\u00e8s quel qu'autres decisions concernant le r\u00e8glement des affaires, ils adopt\u00e8rent, en outre, les resolutions suivantes :-\nIls d\u00e9sirent que sur le tout, ma lame Giraldi prenne, comme par le pass\u00e9, l'avis de F.

Guimond devait agir sous le contr\u00f4le et la direction de M. H. Cotte caissier de la Banque Jacques-Cartier intim\u00e9e) et de M. Francis Cassidy, solliciteur de cette banque.\nGuimond s'est fid\u00e8lement acquitt\u00e9 de ses fonctions. 11 a collect\u00e9 tous les revenus des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de Giraldi, taut ceux des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s dont il \u00e9tait seul propri\u00e9taire, que ceux des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s qu'il poss\u00e9dait par indivis avec les enfants issus de son premier mariage avec Marie Anne Bosna, demandeurs em cette cause. Ces revenus ont \u00e9t\u00e9 indistinctement d\u00e9pos\u00e9s par Guimond \u00e0 la banque Jacques-Cartier, an compte ouvert par celle-ci sous le titre de S Succession Giraldi.\" Il est indubitable que les deniers provenant de la succession Bosna de m\u00eame que ceux provenant des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de Giraldi, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s et confondus sons le m\u00eame litre. La Banque (Intim\u00e9e) \u00e0 qui l'on demande maintenant le remboursement des deniers re\u00e7us de cette mani\u00e8re et sur lesquels elle n'a aucun droit, pr\u00e9tend en justifier 1 appropriation en all\u00e9guant qu'ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s sous le nom de Succession S. Giraldi qu'elle est cr\u00e9anci\u00e8re de S\u00e9raphino Giraldi pour $40,000, qu'elle n'est aucunement tenue de rendre aux h\u00e9ritiers Bosna leurs deniers ainsi re\u00e7us. Elle admet que ces deniers sont encore dans sa caisse, moins deux paiements qu'elle s'est faite \u00e0 elle-m\u00eame. Elle se plaint aussi que les h\u00e9ritiers S. Giraldi ne sont pas en cause.\nQuant \u00e0 ce dernier grief ii y a \u00e9t\u00e9 rem\u00e9di\u00e9 par la mise en cause de Fran\u00e7ois S\u00e9n\u00e9cal, ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire de feu Dame Henriette S\u00e9n\u00e9cal et curateur \u00e0 la substitution cr\u00e9ee en faveur des enfants de feu Z. B. S\u00e9raphino Giraldi, l\u00e9gataire de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9. S\u00e9n\u00e9cal n'a pas contest\u00e9 les droits des Bosna\nCette objection de forme Ccart\u00e9e, ii reste \u00e0 savoir si le fait que les deniers des Bosna out \u00e9te d\u00e9pos\u00e9s \u00e0 la Banque an compte qu'elle a ouvert au nom de S. Giraldi lui forme un titre suffisant pour refuser de les rendre \u00e0 ses \"propri\u00e9taires. Guimond \u00e9tait incontestablement le mandataire de la banque ; il a \u00e9t\u00e9 choisi par elle, et dans tout ce qu'il a fait ii a agi sous la direction de M. Cott\u00e9, son caissier et de Cassidy son solliciteur, Guimond savait que ces deniers appartenaient aux Bosna. et la connaissance qu'il en avait doit \u00eatre cens\u00e9e remonter jusqu'\u00e0 la Banque dont ii \u00e9tait le mandataire. Ind\u00e9pendamment de cette connaissance pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e la resolution cit\u00e9e plus haut, adopt\u00e9e par les cr\u00e9anciers fait voir qu'on n'ignorait pas que des tiers avaient des droits de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 dans les immeubles de la succession Giraldi. Apr\u00e8s avoir ordonn\u00e9 le d\u00e9p\u00f4t des argents devant provenir de la vente de deux propri\u00e9t\u00e9s mentionn\u00e9es dans cette r\u00e9solution, les cr\u00e9anciers ordonnent de plus qu'il en sera de m\u00eame pour les autres propri\u00e9t\u00e9s, apr\u00e8s qu'autorisation suffisante aura \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenue soit pour les liciter volontairement forc\u00e9ment. Avec qui pr\u00e9voit-on qu'on aura \u00e0 liciter quelques-unes des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s. Evidemment, ii n'est pas question l\u00e0 d'une licitation des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s appartenant \u00e0 Gircddi seul. Pour \u00eatre pav\u00e9s de leur d\u00fb les cr\u00e9anciers n'avaient qu'\u00e0 la faire vendre soit en justice soit par Henriette S\u00e9n\u00e9cal qui y \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9e. Il ne pouvait y avoir de licitation \u00e0 moins d'un indivis entre Giraldi et quelques autres propri\u00e9taires dont on connaissait et admettait les droits dans quelques-unes des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s. Quels \u00e9taient ces copropri\u00e9taires ? La r\u00e9solution ne les nomment pas, il est vrai. Mais s'ils ne sont pas nomm\u00e9s n'est-ce pas parce que l'on savait trop bien avec qui ii fallait compter pour proc\u00e9der \u00e0 cette licitation volontairement ou forc\u00e9ment comme le dit la r\u00e9solution. Cette d\u00e9claration n'est-elle pas une admission formelle que l'on savait alors que Giraldi avait des co-propri\u00e9taires dans certaines propri\u00e9t\u00e9s s La banque \u00e9tait donc inform\u00e9e et savait qu'en retirant tous les revenus des propr\u00e9t\u00e9s elle se trouvait \u00e0 retirer en m\u00e9mo temps des argents n'appartenant pas \u00e0 son d\u00e9biteur et qu'en cela elle agissait comme negotiorum gestor des co-propri\u00e9taires de Giraldi. Bien que les Bosna ne soient pas nomm\u00e9s dans cette r\u00e9solution ii n'est que juste de pr\u00e9sumer que la banque agissant par son caissier et par Guimond, qui avaient la direction et la gestion des affaires de la succession Giraldi, savait aussi que les co-propri\u00e9taires dont elle reconnaissait l'existence, \u00e9taient les Bosna* C'est en vain que l'intim\u00e9e essaierait de rejeter sur Ia succession insolvable de Giraldi, la responsabilit\u00e9 de ce qu'elle a fait faire par ses agents Louis Guimond et Henriette S\u00e9n\u00e9cal. Cette derni\u00e8re, surtout, n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 qu'un instrument passif entre les mains de la banque; la seule part qu'elle a prise \u00e0 cette administration a \u00e9t\u00e9 de faire sa marque d'une croix an bas des ch\u00e8ques que le caissier Cott\u00e9 et le solliciteur Cassidy l'induisaient \u00e0 signer dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de la banque. Cette femme n'entendait rien aux affaires et n'a fait en tout ceci que pr\u00eater son nom \u00e0 la banque pour faciliter le r\u00e8glement des affaires.\nLa preuve faite par Guimond a \u00e9tabli de la mani\u00e8re la plus positive quelles sommes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9es pour la succession Bosna et quelles autres sommes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pour Ia succession Giraldi. Ii ne peut v avoir d'erreur sous ce rapport. La banque ayant encore dais sa caisse ces deniers qu'elle sait ne pas lui appartenir, et les Bosna ayant prouv\u00e9 clairement que ces m\u00eames deniers leur appartienment n'y a pas de motif raisonnable qui puisse emp\u00eacher d'en ordonner la restitution.\nToute la preuve faite par l'intim\u00e9e consiste dans une reddition de compte faite en 1872 par Henriette S\u00e9n\u00e9cal aux h\u00e9ritiers Bosna, et dans deux' actes d'acceptation de ce compte par deux des Demandeurs. Elle pr\u00e9tend tirer de ces actes une preuve que les h\u00e9ritiers Bosna ont approuv\u00e9 et sanctionn\u00e9 ce qui \u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 fait par Henriette S\u00e9n\u00e9cal pour le r\u00e8glement de la succession S. Giraldi, que, cons\u00e9quemment, ceux-ci n'ont maintenant de recours que contre Henriette S\u00e9n\u00e9cal ou la succession insolvable de S Giraldi Il est facile de voir en lisant les actes qu'il est impossible de les interpr\u00e9ter de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 soutenir cette pr\u00e9tention.\nD'abord il appara\u00eet \u00e0 la face de cette reddition de compte qu'elle n'a aucun rapport \u00e0 l'administration de Henriette S\u00e9n\u00e9cal,. elle-m\u00eame, des biens de la succession Bosna, depuis l'adoption de la r\u00e9solution des cr\u00e9anciess, l'obligeant \u00e0 d\u00e9poser les revenus de la succession Giraldi, \u00e0 la Banque Jacques-Cartier. Le pr\u00e9ambule d\u00e9clare au contaire que c'est en sa qualit\u00e9 d'administratrice des biens de la succession de son mari, en vertu de son testament qu'elle rend compte aux h\u00e9ritiers de feu Dame Murie Anne Bosna des biens et de l'administration et gestion qu\u2019en a eu le dit feu S. Giraldi Cette d\u00e9claration eat assez pr\u00e9cieuse pour faire voir qu'il ne s'agit aucunement d'une reddition de compte personnellement par la dite Dame Henriette S\u00e9n\u00e9cal. C'est comme l\u00e9gataire en usufruit de son mari qu'elle rend un compte que celui-ci aurait d\u00fb rendre. Elle ne pr\u00e9tend pas rendre un compte de son intervention personnelle dans les affaires de la succession Bosna. Il est impossible de voir en quoi cela peut compromettre les droits des Bosna aux deniers retires par la dite Dame S\u00e9n\u00e9cal et d\u00e9pos\u00e9s par elle dans la caisse de l'intim\u00e9e. Il est vrai que les parties ont admis que dans cc compte se trouvent mentionn\u00e9s les fruits et revenus des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s dont ii est question en cette cause jusqu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de sa date; c'est-\u00e0-dire qu'on en a fait une d\u00e9claration et rien de plus. La rendant compte ne s'en est pas reconnue d\u00e9bitrice et n'a ni pay\u00e9 ni promis d'en payer le montant. Tout au plus ce compte pourrait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un simple \u00e9tat de ce qui \u00e9tait alors d\u00fb pour fruits et revenus \u00e0 la succession Bosna. L'acceptation de ce compte par deux des h\u00e9ritiers ne tire pas plus a cons\u00e9quence que le compte lui-m\u00eame.

Le jugement de la Cour du Banc de la Reine devrait \u00eatre infirm\u00e9 et celui de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure r\u00e9tabli int\u00e9gralement avec d\u00e9pens dans toutes les cours.\nHENRY : \u2014\nThe decision in this case does not, in my view turn upon any delicate points of law, but upon the correct appreciation of the facts arising from two distinct successions. S\u00e9raphino Giraldi was married to Mary Ann Bosna, and between them there was a community of property during their joint lives. She died, and on her death there were two successions the maternal one on her side, and the paternal one, that of her husband's. Her heirs then became entitled to the rents issues and profits of all the immoveable property. After the death of S\u00e9raphino Giraldi, who died intestate, Henriette Senecal his second wife became the executrix of his estates, and being incompetent to manage the business portion of the administration a meeting of the creditors was held at the bank Jacques Cartier and at that meeting the bank was represented by its solicitor and their manager. At that meeting a Mr. Guimond, who had previously managed the estate of Giraldi, was appointed to act for the creditors and for the executors He was authorized to collect the rents to sell movable property, and to administer the estate of S\u00e9raphim Giraldi. In carrying; out his duties in that respect, it became necessary, to a certain extent, to collect the rents due to the two estates from undivided property held by the two successions. In doing so he acted to a great extent under the directions of the bank through their manager and professional adviser. He did so and In collecting the monies he paid them into this bank to the credit of Henriette Senecal, and they could not be withdrawn from that bank, ( which, to my mind, became mere bank of deposit in the interest of the parties whose moneys were deposited there) without the cheque or other authority of the executrix. There was no difficulty in tracing this money, for Guimond distinctly stated the amount that was collected for one interest and for the other. That money being placed there then to the credit of Mrs. Senecal or Mrs. Giraldi it was at her disposal, and she could control the payment of it by her cheque. It was not paid in there for the use of the creditors nor for the use of the bank and there was no appropriation made of it by her until she drew cheques for it. A certain amount was drawn and applied to the debts of the Giraldi succession and the amount now sought to be recovered is the amount that was properly due to the succession Bosna. It was said that Guimond who paid that in, was not the agent of the bank. Whose agent was he, then ? Whom did he act for ? In carrying out the instructions of Cassia and Butt\u00e9 the solicitor and manager of the bank, he was virtually acting so as to bind the bank as fully as if the directors had given positive instructions what to do with the money. That money never became the money of the bank. It was placed in the bank on deposit the same as it would be in any other bank, and dismissing from our minds the fact that the bank were creditors of Giraidi how would it stand if that money had been deposited in that bank for any other estate ? To whose credit was it paid in ? Certainly, to the credit of the executrix, partly for the one estate and as the tutor of the other. She had the right of appropriation of that money. She could apply a portion of it to pay the debts due by one estate, and the other to the payment of the money due to the heirs of Bosna. That money being paid into the bank as a mere bank deposit, what right has the bank to retain it when the true owner of it appears to claim it, and clearly establishes his right to it ? They cannot defend this action because it was not the money of the estate of Giraldi, that remains in the bank as its share had been withdrawn. We are told that there was no agency of the bank shown in Guimond I cannot conceive how an agency can be proved in stronger terms. One party appoints another to do a certain act, and in doing it, it is necessary for him to involve the interests of a third party. It is true he (Guimond) was not directly authorized to collect what was due to the succession Bosna but if it became necessary in carrying out his instructions that that circumstance should arise, his acts became the acts of his principal.\nGuimond paid that money into the bank to the credit of Mrs. Senecal, in the way mentioned, and it remains in the bank still. The bank has never attempted to use that money in any way. It is there to the credit of the executrix of the estate Giraldi, and of the tutor of the estate Bosna. No appropriation of that money has been made; the bank had no power to make any appropriation of it, but if they wished to exercise that power they certainly had many years to do it in. They never made the attempt to do so, and we have the right to conclude that they never considered themselves entitled to make such an appropriation. Under the circumstances, I entirely agree with the judgment of Mr. Justice Tessier in the court below and I have no hesitation in saying that both equity and law are in favor of these parties receiving their money. We have not in this case to strain nice legal points, and give them consideration in favor of the party against equitable rights. I maintain, however, there is nothing on the side of the defendants here as far as the law goes. We have a right then to look at the equity of the case, and see that the money of one party is not taken, as the Chief Justice says, to pay the debts of an insolvent estate to parties who are not entitled to it. I Consider, under these circumstances that the appellants have the right to recover this money. It is a principle of law that whoever receives another man's money through a third party, the owner has a right to go to the party who received it and say \"That is my money; you have received it on my account, and, therefore, I have a right to recover it back \" and the bank has no right, in this case, to say, \"\"We received that money as \u00e0 deposit from one who really did not own it.\" Under these circumstances, I am of opinion with the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Fournier, that the appeal should be allowed. The bank received it merely as a holder of the money in the meantime until it is appropriated by the party who has the right to do so by law. I consider the parties here are entitled in law and equity to recover the money that was paid in to their use.\nTASCHEREAU J. :\nThis most extraordinary action has been rightly dismissed by the Court of Queen's Bench. I cannot help seeing in it a conspiracy, between the Giraildis the Bosnas, and Guimotd, to defraud the bank of a comparatively large amount. On the simple ground alone taken by Gross and Ramsay, JJ., that the late Giraldi is not represented in the cause, the judgment must be confirmed.\nTo say that this estate is represented by the parties\n(I) 26 L. C. J. 114. mis en cause is an error. The estate is vacant. Evidently the plaintiffs must be under the impression that, because Giraldi's succession was accented sous b\u00e9n\u00e9fice d'invenlaire, this gave to his legatee, Henriette S\u00e9n\u00e9cal, the right to appropriate all the revenues of the estate without being liable for the debts. The court below rightly held that Guimond was not the agent of the bank. The meeting of creditors has nothing to do with these revenues, but only with the proceeds of the sale of the immoveables. This is clear on the face of the resolutions. Then it is, in itself, a perfect nullity These heirs Bosna were all of agein 1869, when Giraldi died. Ilenriette S\u00e9n\u00e9cal, with their consent for they never objected to it, took possession of the whole estate, Bosnas' as well as the Giraldis' and had the administration of it. Acting consequently as agent for the Bosnas, the plaintiffs; she employed as a sub agent or accountant a man named Guimond. She received $22,267.77 as revenues of the immoveables Only $9,635599 of this remain in the bank Now it is evident that, the difference, which is the amount drawn by Henriette S\u00e9n\u00e9cal was the plaintiff's monies, and no other. It was the only money which she could draw as their agent. She had no right whatever over the Giraldi succession's monies. And the \"plaintiffs must be presumed to have known what their agent did in the matter. After allowing her to do so, after, perhaps, having benefitted themselves by these monies they, immediately after Henriette S\u00e9n\u00e9cals death (for it is remarkable that as long as she lived they never entered a claim against the bank ) contend that what Henriette Sen\u00e9cal drew from the bank was not their monies but the Giraidi monies Their position is untenable. They may have a claim against Henriette S\u00e9n\u00e9cal\u2019s estate, but they certainly have none against the bank Then in law under art. 1143 0. 0. the plaintiff's action must also fail.\nIt was held, in a case reported, that ([5]) :\nLe paiement d'un somme en argent ne peut \u00eatre r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 contre le cr\u00e9ancier qui l'a re\u00e7u de bonne foi de son d\u00e9biteur croyant que u celui-ci en \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire.\nHere it is clear by Catte's evidence, that the bank was in good faith.\nI am of opinion to dismiss this appeal.\nGWYNNE, J. :\u2014\nAn accurate understanding of the facts is necessary to the due appreciation of the point of law involved in this case and will serve to remove the difficulties which appear to surround it. Mr. S\u00e9raphino Giraldi in the month of January, 1821, married as his first wife dame Marie Ann Bosna, without any marriage contract et sous le regime de la communaut\u00e9; of this marriage there were three children born, namely :\u20141. Marie Ann Giraldi now the wife of Leon Chapdelaine; 2. Julie Giraldi who became the wife of one Alexis Girard and is now deceased; and 3. Eliza Giraldi also now deceased. Dame Marie Ann Bosna died in the month of January, 1841, leaving her surviving and her sole heirs her said three daughters,\nBy an inventory duly talen at the instance of the said S\u00e9raphino Giraldi on the 3rd March 1841 it appears that the assets of the community of property which had existed between him and his deceased wife, comprised three pieces of immoveable property situate in the city of Montreal.\nAfterwards but when in particular does not appear, save that it was prior to the year 1848, the said S\u00e9raphin Giraldi married as his second wife, Dame Henriette S\u00e9n\u00e9cal. Julie Giraldi the wife of Alexis Girard, died in the month of January, 1845, leaving her sole heir a son of her marriage with Alexis Girard, whose name is also Alexis,\nEliza Giraldi, the third daughter and one of the co-heiresses of Dame Marie Ann Bosna, died in the month of July, 1848, after the second marriage of her father, having first duly made her last will and testament, whereby she appointed her step mother Henriette S\u00e9n\u00e9cal, her universal legatee in usufruct, and Seraphino Giraldi issue of the marriage of the said Henriette with Seraphino Giraldi, her universal legatee en propriet\u00e9.\nSeraphino Giraldi, the husband of Henriette S\u00e9necal, died in the month of May, 1869, having first duly made his last will and testament, whereby he made his widow universal legatee in usufruct of all his immoveable property of which he made their son Seraphino universal legatee en propri\u00e9l\u00e9,\nBy the 7th article of his will he authorized his widow to sell any portion of his property for the payment of his debts upon her own sole authority without any autorisation en justice, or any previous valuation and without the consent of any of his legatees. Up to the time of his death the said Seraphino Giraldi was still in possession of the above mentioned landed property, which constituted the community of property that had existed between him and his first wife and in receipt of the rents, issues and profits thereof.\nThe estate of Seraphino Giraldi was at the time of his death in a hopeless state of insolvency, and his widow Henrietta, having accepted sous benefice d'nven-taire the universal usufructuary legacy made in her favor, a meeting of Seraphino's creditors, of whom the defendants were the principal, was held on the 13th March, 1870, at which meeting a resolution was adopted by the creditors, which was put into the form of a deed of deposit of an acte sons seing priv\u00e9 sign\u00e9 et paraph\u00e9 ne varietur before Jobin et Desrosiers, notaries, to the effect following : The creditors, having taken cognizance of the last will and testament of the late Mr. Giraldi made before Mr. J. Belle et Confr\u00e8re, notaries, on the 21st July, 1868, and particularly of the 7th clause of it, by which Madame Giraldi is specially authorized to sell the real estate to pay the debts of the succession, declared themselves to be content and satisfied with it, and they declared themselves satisfied with a contemplated sale of property on rue St. Denis to a Miss Cuvillier for the sum of $7,200, and they authorized Madame Giraldi to complete that sale, and they advised Madame Giraldi to make sale of another property on Dubord street provided that it should not be sold for a less sum than $2,000.\nAnd they desired that above all things, Madame Giraldi should take, as in the past, the advice of F. Cassidy, Esq, advocate, and Honor\u00e9 Cott\u00ea, Esq., cashier of the Bank Jacques Cartier, two of the creditors, and who, even in the time of Mr. Giraldi, were his ordinary advisers, promising to confirm everything which should be done upon the advice of these gentlemen.\n\"And as it is impossible to say yet what is the actual and real condition of the succession, the said creditors declare that they are of opinion, and desire that the moneys arising from tne sale to Miss Cuvillier, as well as that from the sale of the property on Dubord street, and from the other properties, after obtaining sufficient authority for the voluntary or forced licitation thereof, should be deposited in the Jacques Cartier Bank to be apportioned and divided amongst the said creditors pro rata, according to their respective claims against said succession, when the whole shall be realized desiring in the interest of all that every possible precaution be taken to arrive at a good result, and confiding entirely m the said advisers of the dame Giraldi and in those who have in their hands the regulation of the affairs of the succession; the hypothecary and privileged debts being paid before the division L of the said money as aforesaid.\"\nNow, as regards this agreement concluded between the creditors of whom the defendants were the chief G and Mrs. Giraldi as representing the Giraldi succession in her character of universal usufructuary legatee sous benefice d'inventaire, it seems to be appropriate to observe here that its object and effect was clearly, as it appears to me to constitute the fund when created by deposits in the bank, a trust fund of which the bank who were parties to the agreement, and acting on behalf of all the creditors were quasi trustees and as such having imposed upon them the duty to hold the moneys so deposited upon and for the trust purpose declared in the agreement\u2014namely, for the benefit of the creditors generally, to be divided among them pro rata according to the amounts of their respective claims; and therefore that Madame Giraldi could not apply and the bank should not permit to be applied, any part of such trust fund to any other purpose than it was by the agreement intended that it should be applied\u2014 namely division among the creditors of the succession. If any moneys not derived from the property of the succession, but belonging to Mrs. Giraldi in her individual capacity or moneys over which in such her individual capacity she had control, should by mistake and inadvertence be deposited to the credit of the trust fund it should be competent for Mrs. Giraldi to claim the right to withdraw, and for the bank upon being satisfied of the fact relied, upon in support of her claim, to permit her to withdraw, such moneys from the trust fund account as not properly belonging to it. Hence, it follows, as it appears to me, as a clear principle of equity, that if any moneys should be withdrawn from such trust fund when once created by deposit in the bank, which, moneys so withdrawn were not applied, or cannot be shown to have been applied to the purposes of the Giraldi succession, it must be assumed that the moneys so withdrawn were the moneys not belonging to the succession and which had been by inadvertence and mistake, deposited to the trust fund account. Where an act is done which may be rightfully performed, the person doing it cannot be heard to say that it was done wrongfully. So, here, if Mrs. Giraldi had deposited to the credit of the trust fund created in pursuance of the agreement with the creditors of the Giraldi succession, moneys either belonging to herself, or over which, as agent for others, she had control, and not arising from any property of the Giraldi succession, and if she should be afterwards permitted by the bank who, as I have said, were quasi trustees, having control of the fund for the benefit of all the creditors, to withdraw from the fund any money not for the purposes of the succession, she could never be heard as against the bank to assert that the money so withdrawn was not the money which not arising from any property of the succession, had been improperly and by mistake and inadvertence deposited to the credit of the trust fund, but was money rightfully belonging to the succession, and which it had been agreed should remain in the bank for the benefit of and to be divided among the creditors of the Giraldi succession An account kept in the books of the bank in pursuance of the said agreement between the creditors and Madame Giraldi would not be an account whereby, as in the ordinary course of business governing the opening of an account with a customer, the bank would simply become the debtor of the customer for the amounts deposited to his credit, but would be an account special in its character, as to which, for the protection of the fund for the benefit of all the creditors the bank had agreed to assume a fiduciary position.\nThe agreement between the creditors and Madame L Giraldi, apparently contemplating, as it did, an early sale of the real estate of her deceased husband, provided only for the deposit of the moneys arising from such sales; but the sale of the properties constituting the communaut\u00e9 did not take place for some years and as the estate was hopelessly insolvent and the creditors of the estate were the sole persons beneficially interested in it, and the intention of the creditors parties to the agreement clearly was that the assets of the estate should be and remain deposited in the bank for their benefit until the period of division should arrive upon the whole estate being realized, Madame Giraldi appears to have acted in the spirit of the agreement by causing to be deposited in the bank the moneys belonging to the estate derived from the rents of the really and from all other sources. What appeals to have been done was this : Madame Giraldi, immediately after the decease of her husband and the acceptance by her of the usufructuary legacy given by his will, sous b\u00e9n\u00e9fice d'inventaire, being herself an illiterate person and unable even to write her name and quite incompetent to transact business, employed one Guimond who had been a confidential clerk of her husband for ten years previousyy to his death, to get in and receive for her the assets of the estate and she caused to be opened at the bank Jacques Cartier an account in the name of the S Succession SeTdphino Giraldi i to the credit of which account she caused to be deposited all moneys belonging to the succession coming to her hands or received by Guimond for her. Upon this account she was in the habit of drawing cheques, as well to pay the expenses of management as insurance repairs and other purposes.\nTo this account, so opened, she continued, after the agreement between her and the creditors of March 1870, was entered into, to cause to be deposited all moneys belonging to the estate coming to her hands or received by Guimond for her; and on the 1st of April 1870, there stood to the credit of the succession Seraphino Giraldi in the bank the sum of $2440.67. It appears to me to be the reasonable inference to draw from the agreement with the creditors and the facts namely that the estate was insolvent and that the creditors were the sole parties beneficially interested therein, that it was the undoubted intention of all the parties to the agreement of March, 1870 that until sale of real estate, the rents there from and all moneys belonging to the Giraldi succession, from whatever source derived, should thenceforth be deposited in the bank Jacques Cartier for the like purpose as was expressly declared in the agreement in relation to the moneys arising from the sale of the realty. If all the moneys belonging to the Giraldi succession coming to the hands of Madame Giraldi or of her agent, without any deduction for necessary expenses of management, insurance, &c., &c., &c., were deposited to the account in the bank, it would be just that her cheques upon the fund for moneys recurred to pay expenses attending the management of the estate the collection of its assets insurance repairs, and such like, as well as to pay hypothecary and privileged debts, should be honored by the bank, notwithstanding the terms of the agreement entered into with the creditors, but, except for such purposes, the fiduciary position on behalf of all the creditors assumed by the bank was such as to justify it and to require it in the interest of the creditors to refuse to honor any cheque drawn upon the fund by Madame Giraldi, every deposit to the credit of which fund they were entitled to regard as a conclusive appropriation made for the purpose of satisfying their claims, of the benefit of which, when once deliberately made, she could not deprive them against their will.\nIt appears, however, that the bank did not exercise L that strict supervision and power of restraint upon Madame Giraldi which I think it possessed, in virtue of the agreement between her and the creditors, to prevent her withdrawing moneys once they were deposited to the credit of the creditors' trust fund, but that the bank was in the habit of honoring her cheques upon the fund without enquiry as to the purpose for which the moneys drawn out on those cheques were required. By the books of the bank it appears that, including the sum of $240.67, standing to the credit of the fund on the 1st April 1870, the whole amount deposited to the credit of the fund between that day and the 31st of May fol* lowing was $3,258077, and that during the said month of May the bank honored four cheques of Madame Giraldi made thereon, amounting in the whole to the sum of $3,338.99, one of which only, so far as appears in the evidence, amounting to $1,483, was to pay a debt of the succession. Upon the 31st of May the account opened with the bank was thus over drawn to the amount of $80.42. She appeals to have been permitted to continue over drawing the account until upon the 1st of October, 1870, there appears to have been the sum of $215.54 again to the credit of the fund.\nAll prior deposits made by her from the time of her husband's decease in 1869, amounting to $7,410.48, with the exception of this sum of $215.54, were thus wiped out and we have nothing to do with them in this suit. The account, therefore, which has been presented by Guimond, commencing in July, 1869, as a basis upon which to charge the bank is wholly misleading, and considering Mr. Guimond's knowledge of all the transactions of both estates, of which he appears to have had the management, seems to me, I must say, to have been, made designedly so, for Mrs. Giraldi having withdrawn all sums which had been deposited by her previously to the 1st October, 1870, with the exception of this sum of $215.54 then remaining to the credit of the fund, Mr. Guimond's account, prepared by him expressly foi the' purposes of this suit, to have been honest, should not have gone behind that balance.\nFrom that time forth deposits appear to have been made every month to the credit of the fund until the end of the month of June, 1874, when the account was closed. During this period, although there appear to have been twenty-four months, in which nothing at all was drawn from the fund, Madame Giraldi appears to have drawn upon her cheques the amount in the whole of $5,035.92, all other sums spoken of in the evidence as having been deposited by her in the bank and withdrawn therefrom by her cheques occurred before the agreement between her and the creditors was entered into, whereby the account with the bank was effected with a trust in favor of the creditors The balance remaining to the credit of the account at its close was $9,635.59.\nThe question is not now whether, in view of the agreement entered into between the creditors and Madame Giraldi, the bank, in permitting her to draw upon the fund as she did acted in accordance with the duty it owed to the creditors, or properly executed the trust reposed in the bank by the creditors that it would retain all moneys deposited to the credit of the fund, so that they should be forthcoming to be divided among or the creditors pro rat\u00c6 when the whole of the assets of the succession should be realized. No question of that kind arises m this case which only raises the question whether, as between the heirs of Dame Marie AnneBosna and the bank, the relation of creditors and debtor, or any fiduciary relation, or any privity whatever exists, which entitles the former to recover judgment against the latter for the above sum of $9,365.59, or any, and it any, what part thereof?\nIt appears now by the \u00e9vidence of Mr. Guimond, who was so, as aforesaid; appointed by Madame Giraldi to collect and get in the assets of the Giraldi estate that she also authorized him to collect and receive the rents accruing in respect of the Dame Marie Anne Bosna's succession's half share in the property which had consituated the communaut\u00e9 which had existed between the said Dame Marie Anne Bosna and Seraphino Giraldi, in which Bosna estate she herself the said Henriette S\u00e9n\u00e9cal, was beneficially interested in usufruct to the extent of one-third, and Mr. Guimond says that he did accordingly collect such rents, and he now further says that the amounts collected by him for such rents were paid into the bank with the moneys which were the property of the Giraldi succession to the credit of the Giraldi succession fund and he says further that by the books which he kept he is able to tell what amount in the whole so received by him being the property of the Bosna succession were so paid in, and what proportion of the amounts withdrawn are properly applicable to the Bosna succession, but he does not profess to be able to say what particular deposit comprised, or to what amount any deposit comprised, moneys belonging to the Bosna estate. He does not, moreover, profess to say that the bank had, and Mr. Cott\u00e9, cashier of the bank distinctly, swears that it had not, any knowledge that any moneys belonging to the Bosna succession constituted any part of the moneys deposited to the credit of the Giraldi succession fund, and upon this evidence we must take it to be established that the bank had no knowledge that such was the fact. It was argued that by reason of the agreement entered into with the creditors Guimond is to be considered as thenceforth employed by the bank, and that the bank must be affected by his acts and knowledge; but there is not, in my opinion, any ground for holding that Guimond was employed by the bank at all, or otherwise than by Madame Giraldi, in whom the creditors express their confidence, but at the same time agree to be bound only by such acts as shall be approved by Mr. Cassidy and Mr. Cott\u00e9. But even if Guimond is to be considered as employed by the bank, such his employment must be limited to dealing with the property of the Giraldi succession, with which alone the creditors of that succession had anything to do and cannot extend to his dealing's with the Bosna estate, with which they claimed no right of interference; upon no principle, therefore, can the bank be charged with constructive notice of Guimond's acts or knowledge in relation to the Bosna estate, because he may have been employed by the bank in relation to the Giraldi estate. It may be true, as is contended, that the bank knew that the heirs of Madame Bosna were equally interested in the property which constituted the assess of the Giraldi succession, but it was only in respect of the Giraldi succession's interest in that property that the creditors claimed any right to interfere, and their requiring the moneys belonging to the Giraldi succession to be deposited in the bank to a special account for their benefit, constituted no interference whatever with the rights and interests of the Bosna succession in the property in which that succession and the Giraldi were jointly interested. If, indeed, the bank had been aware that moneys belonging to the Bosna estate had been deposited to the credit of the Giraldi succession fund that might have afforded a reasonable explanation of its having permitted Madame Giraldi to draw so freely upon the fund; for in justice, no doubt, the creditors of the Giraldi succession would have had no right to have payment of their claims made out of the Bosna estate, and any moneys belonging to that estate appropriated by mistake to the Giraldi succession fund in the bank it would have been reasonable that the bank should permit to be withdrawn by the depositor, upon J the fact of the mistake being made clearly to appear.\nIt is obvious that Madame Henriette Giraldi upon her husband's decease had no authority whatever, either in the character of his usufructuary legatee, or as administratrix of his property under the directions contained in his will, to collect, or receive, any of that portion of the rents of the real estate which constituted the communaut\u00e9 which had existed between him and his first wife in which the heirs of his said first wife were interested. For the receipts of the Bosna estate by Seraphino Giraldi in his life time the Giraldi succession was debtor to the heirs Bosna. For the receipts of Guimond of funds belonging to the Bosna heirs under the direction of Madame Giraldi after the decease of her husband, she alone, in her individual capacity, was liable to her co-heirs for their two-thirds she herself being interested in usufruct to the other third part.\nIt appears, however, that in the month of October, 1872 in the character of administratrix of the estate of her deceased husband, she rendered an account, as well of the dealings of her deceased husband in his life time as of herself, subsequent to his decease, with the funds belonging to the heirs Bosna, all blended in one account up to the 15th of October 1872. This account is upon its face said to be divided into two parts, ho first terminating on the 1st of August, 1871 and the second upon the 15th October 1872. By the first the total amount due to the heirs of the late Dame Bosna on the 1st of October 1871 is shown to be $6430.34\u00bd; by the second part the sum of $435.00 is added for interest on the above to the 15th of October 18*72, making $6865.34\u00bd. The total receipts from the joint property which had formed the communaut\u00e9 between Dame Bosna and her husband between the 1st August, 1871, and the 15th October 1872 is shown to have been the sum of $5531.12, from which is deducted for disbursements $857.73 leaving a balance of $4673.39, which being divided into two equal parts, show the sum of $2336.69\u00bd as belonging to the Bosna heirs, to which $6865.34\u00bd above mentioned being added makes $9202 44 devisable into three equal parts, namely, to Madame Chapdelaine $3067.34\u00a7-; to Alexis Girard the like sum of $3067.34\u2154; and to Madame Benrietta Giraldi the sum of $3067.34\u2154; as the whole sum due to them respectively upon the 15th October, 1872, save that to the above share of Madame Chapdelaine a further sum of $1465.93, shewn to be due to her for principal received by Seraphino Giraldi in his life time, and interest thereon, was to be added, making the total amount due to Madame Chapdelaine on the 15th October, 1872, to be $1533.27\u2154.\nBy an act of acceptance dated the 19th of October 1872, executed before L. A. Desrosiers, notary public, by Madame Chap delaine and her husband and by Alexis Girard, Madame Chapdelaine and Alexis Girard, two of the co-heirs, (Madame Henriette Giraldi herself being the third,) accepted this account, without prejudice, however, to the hypothecary rights which they had acquired upon the property of the said late Seraphino Giraldi and of his succession for the balance of the said account and all other claims whatsoever, which they reserved the right to retain iri their entirety to exercise them and to make them available as they should be advised. At the time of the rendering of this account Madame Chatelaine and Alexis Girard must have been well acquainted with the manner in which Madame Giraldi had been dealing with their property since the death of her husband and having accepted the account so rendered as one undivided account after having had as the acceptance says, knowledge and communication of the vouchers proving its correctness, they must be taken to have accepted it as it was rendered, as one undivided account, and inasmuch as, with the exception of that portion of the account which relates to the period between the 1st of August, 1871, and the 15th of October 1872 there is no distinction drawn between the receipts of Seraphino Giraldi. in his life time and those of his widow after his decease, and inasmuch as in respect of the receipts by Seraphino Giraldi in his life time the only relation which existed between his succession and the heirs Bosna, at the time of the acceptance by the latter of the account rendered in October, 1872 was that of debtor and creditors, so, as it appears to mel the whole account must either be taken to have been accepted in the like character, and as establishing a debt due by the Giraldi succession to the Bosna heirs as creditors merely subject, of course, to the reservation contained in the act of acceptance whatever the effect of that may be, of all hypothecary rights which the heirs Bosna had acquired upon the property of the said late Mr. Giraldi and his succession and all other claims whatever or the heirs Bosna must assume the position of creditors of the Seraphino Giraldi succession for the amounts received by Seraphino Giraldi, in his life time, and as entitled only to claim from Madame Henriette S\u00e9n\u00e9cal in her individual capacity the respective amounts received by her since the death of Seraphino Giraldi belonging to her co-heirs of the estate Bosna each of such co-heirs having a separate and distinct cause of action for the amount due to each and for which they must each respectively pursue his and her remedies. Unless and until that account shall be avoided for fraud or error, it must, as it appeals to me, prevail to the extent of defining the amount which the account rendered and accepted. acknowledges to be due to each of the heirs Bosna at the time of its having been so rendered and accepted; and even if the bank could be made liable in the present action framed as it is we have no occasion to refer to the account prepared by Mr. Guimond of the receipt by him of moneys belonging to the Bosna estate prior to the rendering of this account; and so, rejecting all prior receipts, we find that between the 15th October 1872 and the closing of the account when the properties were sold, the total amount of receipts from what he calls \" the M. A. Giraldi succession \"\u2014that is, the community property of Dame Marie Ann Bosna and &.Giraldi,\u2014was $2,811.75 from which, according to him, the sum of $1,374.45 is to be deducted for disbursements, leaving $1,437300, which, being divided by two, shows the sum of $718.65, the share of the Bosna heirs one third of which would belong to Madame Henriette Giraldi herself Then, as to the account rendered by Mr. Guimond, which he calls the expenditure common to the succession M.A. Giraldi and the succession S. Giraldi it does not appear how much of this should be charged against the Bosna heirs. It would not, perhaps, be unreasonable to charge to them a proportion which would swallow up the whole of the above sum of $718135, and so there would be nothing due to them by the bank even if this action against it can be at all sustained.\nIt appears to me, I must confess, to be strange how Mr Guimond could present to the court in this case an account so calculated to mislead as that prepared by him for the purposes of this suit when he must have known that an account was rendered to the heirs Bosna up to the 18th September, 1872; when, in fact, that account must have been prepared by himself, and the vouchers and proofs of its correctness must have been supplied by himself. It seems equally strange if, at the time of the sale of the properties in 1874 when the heirs Bosna must have received their proportion of the amount arising from the sale, they had not a final settlement with the Dame Giraldi in respect of the moneys which they knew she had received of the rents x belonging to them, as well as those contained in the account stated and accepted in October, 1872, as those received subsequently thereto; and that they should never, until after her decease, three years later, set up the claim which is asserted in the present action. It is difficult to understand why Madame Chapdelaine and Alexis Girard, aware as they were of all the facts, should have had no settlement, if they had no settlement with her during her life. To hope to arrive at the truth now is vain, when the heir of the accounting party, and those to whom the account should have been rendered, and with whom the settlement should have taken place, appear to have combined together with the assistance of the agent of the accounting party to make the demand made upon the bank in this suit, in which it is the interest of the parties so combining to suppress the truth, if, in truth, a fact which they must know and the bank cannot a settlement had taken place between Madame Giraldi and her co-heirs during her life. The plaintiffs then are in this dilemma, that as to the receipts by Seraphino Giraldi, in his life time, they must present their respective claims against the Seraphino Giraldi succession as creditors of that succession, a proposition which the plaintiffs admit to be correct, and that unless they can claim as creditors also of that succession in respect of the moneys of the Bosna estate received by Madame Henriette S\u00e9n\u00e9cal since the death of Seraphino by reason of the account rendered by her in her character of administratrix of Seraphino Giraldi's will, they must look to her in her individuel character only and to her succession, and not to the Seraphino Giraldi succession at all.\nThe learned counsel for the appellants relied strongly upon Pennell v. Deffell ([6]), as an authority in support of his contention, but the facts of that case were totally different from the present, and, properly understood, the case is rather adverse to his contention.\nIn applying that case to the present we must separate the claim of Madame Henriette Giraldi from that of Madame Chapdelaine and Alexis Girard; and first as to any claim made in the right of Madame Henriette Giraldi as one of the Bosna co-heirs, she must be regarded as having, since the death of her husband, received in her individual character all the moneys belonging to the Bosna succession which she did receive and which are the subject of this suit. In the third of those moneys she was herself beneficially interested and was at full liberty to deal with as she pleased. That third so, belonging to her, it may be admitted that she paid into the bank Jacques-Cartier, not however to her own credit but to a special account, namely, the Seraphino Giraldi succession fund, in which the bank as principal creditor, and as a quasi trustee for the other creditors, had a special interest, and which fund was kept at that bank in pursuance of the agreement entered into between Madame Giraldi and the creditors of Seraphino Giraldi's succession for the special benefit of the latter. The moneys thus deposited to that account constituted trust moneys whereof the creditors of the Giraldi succession were the cesluis que trustent. Having thus blended her Own private moneys with that trust fund, she could not withdraw any thing from the fund, unless at least she could show clearly that the money she might wish to draw out was her own private money, and if permitted by the bank to withdraw any thing from the fund without shewing that the amount was in truth her own private property, she could not afterwards, as against the creditors of the Giraldi succession, who are sufficiently represented by the bank, and of whom the bank was the chief creditor, be heard to say that her own moneys were still remaining in the bank to the credit of the fund and liable to be drawn out by her, and that the moneys which she had already withdrawn were moneys belonging to the Giraldi succession so as aforesaid deposited in the bank for the benefit of the creditors of the succession. This is the effect which the application of the principle involved in Penne v. Deffell would have as regards Madame Giraldi's own share of the Bosna succession moneys deposited to the credit of the Giraldi succession fund. The guiding principle of that decision, as stated in Fifth v. Cortland ([7]) and in Knatchbull v. Hallett ([8]) is that a trustee cannot assert title of his own to trust property. A second principle involved in that case is that if a man mixes trust funds with his own or which is the same thing, mixes his own moneys with moneys belonging to a trust account, the whole will be treated as trust property, except so far as he may be able clearly to distinguish what is his own\u2014that is, the trust property comes first and Firths v. Cortland is an authority that, as between Madame Giraldi and the Giraldi succession, the moneys withdrawn by her must be held to have been her own moneys, intentionally or mistakenly deposited to the credit of the Giraldi succession fund which was a trust fund in which the creditors of that succession alone had any interest\nNow, Madame Giraldi, having withdrawn from the creditors' fund with which she had mixed her own moneys, an amount far in excess of any moneys of her own deposited to the credit of that fund, cannot now, nor can any person in her right, assert any claim against such fund in respect of any private moneys of hers so deposited. Then, as to Madame Chap delaine and Alexis Girard the contention is that in so far as their shares are concerned Madame Giraldi is to be regarded as their agent in receiving their moneys, and that having thus, in a fiduciary character, as regards them, received their moneys and deposited them to the credit of the Seraphic Giraldi succession fund, they can follow their moneys so deposited and recover them from the bank which is the holder of that fund.\nPenne v. Dfftell does not support this contention; the action in that case was not brought by the person claiming the moneys as trust funds against the bank where they had been deposited. The claim was made in a suit duly instituted for the administration of the estate of a deceased trustee, who had deposited the funds of which he had been trustee to the credit of his own private bank account. The contention arose between the executors of a Mr. Green, who, as assignee in bankruptcy, had received large sums of money belonging to the estates of which he was assignee, which he had mixed with his own private moneys in two bank accounts which he kept and his successor as assignee of the bankrupt estate, whose funds he had so deposited to his own private account, claiming payment of the trust funds in preference to his general creditors. Lord Justice Sir J. L. Knight Bruce premises his judgment with the statement that the bank accounts were opened and kept with Mr. Green as a private man merely without any official designation\u2014without any title of a trust without anything to mark that he was not interested in the amount for the time being due to him upon it. And again he says : \" There is here no dis \"pute with either of the two banking establishments; \" each is indifferent as to the contest. Proceeding upon these premises he lays down the principle which is the gist of the judgment in the case, thus : \" When a trustee J \"pays trust money into a bank to his credit, the account \" being a simple account with himself, not marked or d distinguished in any other manner, the debt thus constituted from the bank to him is one which, as long as \" it remains due, belongs specially to the trust as much \" as and as effectually as it would have done had it specifically been placed by the trustee in a particular repository, and so remained;\" that is to say, if the specific debt shall be claimed on behalf of the cestui que trust, it must be deemed specifically there as between the trustee and his executors and general creditors after his death, on the one hand, and the trust on the other.\nNow, if Madame Giraldi, who, it may be admitted for the purposes of this suit, received the share of Madame Chapdelaine and Alexis Girard in the moneys of the Bosno, succession, as their agent, had deposited those moneys to her own private account in the bank on a claim being made by Madame Chap delaine and Alexis Girard against her succession after her death, Pennell v. Deffell would be, it may be admitted, a conclusive authority so long as any part of the debt constituted by such deposit remained due to her from the bank; but here the facts are totally different.\nMadame Giraldi, who, in her private character only received the moneys of Madame Chap delaine and Alexis Girard, did not deposit such moneys to her own private account; on the contrary, she deposited them to a special account impressed with a trust for a special purpose of which trust purpose, and the fund thus constituted, the bank Jacques Cartier were beneficial depositaries. No debt ever became due from that bank to Madame Giraldi. The moneys deposited by her to the credit of the Seraphino Giraldi succession fund did. not constitute a debt due from the bank to her. The moneys so deposited constituted a trust fund specially appropriated for the benefit of the Seraphino Giraldi succession creditors, which moneys, by agreement with the creditors, were to remain in the hands of the bank as holders of the fund until the whole of the estate should be realized, and then to be divided among the creditors, of whom the bank was the largest. Madame Giraldi in her private character had no right to touch any moneys deposited to that fund, at least not without the special consent of Mr. Cassidy and Mr. Cott\u00e9. All moneys,once they were deposited to the credit of that fund, became as much the property of the creditors as ii they had been paid into the hands of a trustee for them, and as much appropriated to their benefit and removed from all power and control of Madame Giraldi over them, as if she had paid them to a creditor of the Seraphino succession in payment of a debt due by the succession, and in any proceeding taken by Madame Chap delaine and Alexis Girard against their trustee or agent Madame Henrietta Giraldi personally, or her succession, (which alone since her death is now accountable to them,) such appropriation to the Seraphino Giraldi succession trust fund in the bank could not be recalled, that succession would have nothing to do with such a suit. The case presented in this case is, in fact the same as if A, as agent of B and C, had received moneys belonging to each, and having spent B's money had appropriated C's to pay B. Neither Pennell v. Deffell, or any other case, is an authority that in such a case C could recover from B the money so paid to him. Upon the merits, therefore, as well as for the imperfection in the frame of the record in not being framed as against the succession of Madame Henrietta Giraldi\u00ab who alone in her life time was in her private character accountable to Madame Chap delaine and Alexis Girard, and in claiming payment out of the Seraphino Giraldi succession trust fund established for the benefit of the creditors of that succession, without bringing a legal representative of that succession before the court, the appeal should, in my opinion, be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed without costs\nSolicitors for appellants: Be\u00efque, McGoun & Emard.\nSolicitors for respondents '.

C. & F. entered into a contract with Her Majesty to do the excavation, &c., of the Georgian Bay branch of the Canadian Pacific Railway. Shortly after the date of the contract and after the commencement of the work, H. C. & F. associated with themselves several partners in the work, amongst others S. & R. (respondents,) and on 30th June, 1879, the whole contract was assigned to S. & R. Subsequently on the 25th July, 1879, the contract with H. C. & F. was cancelled by Order in Council on the ground that satisfactory progress had not been made with the work as required by the contract. On the 5th August, 1879, S. & R. notified the Minister of Railways of the transfer made to them of the contract. On the 9th August the Order in Council of July 25th was sent to H. C. & F. On the 14th August, 1879, an Order in Council was passed stating that as the government had never assented to the transfer and assignment of the contract to S. & R., the contractors should be notified that the contract was taken out of their bands and annulled. In consequence of this notification, S. & R., who were carrying on the works, ceased work, and with the consent of the then Minister of Public Works, realized their plant and presented a claim for damages, and finally H. C. & F. and S. & R. filed a petition of right claiming $250,000 damages for breach of contract. The statement in defence set up inter alia, the 17th clause of the contract which provided against the contractors assigning the contract, and in case of assignment without Her Majesty's consent, enabled Her Majesty to take the works out of the contractors' hands, and employ such means as she might see fit to complete the same; and in such case the contractors should have no claim for any further payment in respect of the works performed, but remain liable for loss by reason of non-completion by the contractor.\nAt the trial there was evidence that the Minister of Public Works knew that S. & R. were partners, and that he was satisfied that they were connected with the concern. There was also evidence, that the department knew S. & R. were carrying on the works, and that S. & R. had been informed by the Deputy Minister of the department that all that was necessary to be officially recognized as contractors, was to send a letter to the government from H. C. & F.\nIn the Exchequer, Henry, J., awarded the suppliants $171,040.77 damages. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada it was\nHeld, reversing the judgment of Henry, J. (Henry, J., dissenting,) That there was no evidence of a binding assent on the part of the Crown to assignment of the contract to S. & R., who therefore were not entitled to recover.\n2. That H. C. & F., the original contractors, by assigning their contract put it in the power of the government to rescind the contract absolutely, which was done by the Order in Council of the 14th August, 1871, and the contractors under the 17th clause could not recover either for the value of work actually done, the loss of prospective damages, or the reduced value of the plant.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of Henry, J., in the Exchequer Court of Canada.\nThe petition of right, the pleadings and the facts are set out at length in the judgment of Henry, J., in the Exchequer Court and in the judgments delivered in the Supreme Court.\nThe suppliants were represented in the Exchequer Court by the Hon. Mr. McDougall, Q.C., and Mr. A. Ferguson, and the respondent by Mr. Lash, Q.C., and Mr. Hogg.\nThe following is the judgment of the Exchequer Court delivered by\nHENRY, J.:\nThe suppliants claim to recover damages under an agreement entered into by three of the suppliants, namely, John Heney, Alphonse Charlebois and Thomas Flood, on the 2nd of August, 1878, with Her Majesty the Queen, represented by the Minister of Public Works of Canada, for \"the excavation, grading, bridging, fencing, track-laying and ballasting of that portion of the Canada Pacific railway known as the Georgian Bay branch and consisting of 50 miles, extending between section O of location of 1877 on the west of South river near Nipissingan post office to the head of navigation on French river\"\u2014the works to be performed as set out or referred to in the specifications annexed to said contract and set out or referred to in the plans and drawings then prepared, and thereafter to be prepared for the purpose of the works, the contractors to execute and fully complete the respective portions of such works and deliver them to Her Majesty, on or before the 1st day of July, 1880.\nThe petition alleges that the total sum agreed to be paid for the performance of said work was about eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.\nFrom the petition and evidence it appears that the site of the railway in question was through an almost inaccessible wilderness, and that it was only accessible during a part of the year, and that in order to put on the ground the necessary supplies of plant, food and other things required the contractors were obliged to spend large sums of money in building and providing a tram railroad, steam and other boats, and other means of communication. That shortly after the contract was entered into they commenced works in that direction and carried them on in such a manner that they were enabled the following spring to proceed with the actual work contracted for. That they had procured and had on the ground in the summer of 1879 large quantities of supplies, horses, machinery and materials necessary for the works and a large number of men employed, and had made a large expenditure in the construction of steam mills, houses, steamers and boats of different descriptions, which, from the rescinding of the contract by the acting Minister of Railways in August, 1879, resulted in a heavy loss to them.\nThe suppliants pray to be paid for all damages arising directly or indirectly in consequence of the cancellation of the contract, as set forth and referred to in the 10th, 11th and 14th paragraphs of their petition, and also for all profits which they were thereby prevented from earning and deriving in respect of the works to be by them performed under the contract, with interest, and also all moneys payable in respect of unpaid estimates in their favor: and they claim two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.\nThe statement in defence put in by the Attorney-General on behalf of Her Majesty in the second paragraph admits the contract as set out in the first, second and fourth paragraphs of the petition.\nThe third paragraph of the statement in defence has no bearing on the case.\nThe fourth, fifth and sixth paragraphs of the statement have reference to the fourteenth clause of the contract, which provides that in the event of the works not being diligently continued to the satisfaction of the engineer for the time being, after six days' notice in writing, to be given by the engineer, Her Majesty might take the works out of the contractors' hands and employ such means as she might see fit to complete the work. No proof was given under the allegations in these paragraphs. In fact, it was shown that no such notice was given, and that at the time of the cancellation of the contract the engineer was fully satisfied with the progress of the works. He himself, in his evidence, says so.\nThe seventh and eighth paragraphs of the defence allege that the cost of the works contracted for would be about $850,000, and that they were to be completed on or before the 1st August, 1880\u2014that for a long time previous to the 30th of June, 1879, the contractors had made default in advancing the works and up to that time had performed work upon the railway only to the amount of $24,800.90 or thereabouts, whereby it became and was impossible for the said contractors to complete the work within the time limited by the contract, and that owing to the default of the contractors in the execution and performance of their said work and the impossibility of their completing it within the time specified in the contract, and time being of the essence of the contract, Her Majesty rescinded the contract on Her part and notified the contractors that it had been cancelled and annulled, and took the work out of their hands. It further alleges that up to the time of the giving of that notice, or soon after, a certain sum was due under the engineer's certificates to the contractors on account of which payments had been made, leaving a balance due them of $13,807.94, which Her Majesty's Attorney was willing to pay and thereby tendered, provided the same should be accepted in full of all demands against Her Majesty in respect of the said contract.\nThe suppliants, as to the last, as also to the sixth, ninth and fourteenth statements of defence, reply that the said contract was not cancelled, or the works taken out of the contractors' hand, for the reasons stated in said paragraphs, or for any of said reasons, but that the contract was so cancelled and annulled and the works taken out of the contractors' hands because of the determination of Her Majesty, long before said cancellation took place, to abandon and proceed no further with the works contemplated and contracted to be done under and by virtue of the contract in question herein.\nI am of opinion that the grounds stated in the paragraphs in question are not an answer in law to the suppliants claim in their petition, unless indeed government contracts are to be construed upon principles wholly different from those between non-governmental parties, which I cannot admit. The contract itself contains no provision for the cancelling of it for the reasons stated. All the contractors bound themselves to do was to complete the contract by a certain time; until that time elapsed there was no breach. The contractors had given security for the due performance of the contract, they had the legal possession of the roadway for the purposes of their contract, and, in the absence of any provision in it to allow of its cancellation and the taking away from them of the road bed during the running of the contract for the particular reason assigned, any person interfering with that possession, even if authorized by the government or the Minister of Railways, would be a trespasser. At the request of the learned counsel who conducted the case on behalf of the defence, and in the absence of any objection from the counsel of the suppliants, I admitted evidence to be given upon the issue raised. A large number of witnesses were examined on both sides as the possibility of the contractors being able to complete the contract within the prescribed time. Most of those for the defence had never been on the ground, or seen the works, or the preparations made to perform the balance undone, and there was hardly any of them went so far as to say that it was impossible to finish the contract by the specified time. It seemed from the language they used that they considered it not impossible with the proper means and appliances to finish the work within the prescribed time, but that it was their opinion that it was doubtful if it could be done. On the other side evidence was given by competent contractors and others who had inspected the works, who had seen the amount of work done and the means and arrangements that were apparent on the ground for the completion of it, that the work could have been fully completed by the specified time, and I feel bound to find in favor of the latter.\nThe ninth paragraph of the defence alleges: \"that by the seventeenth section of the said contract it is provided that the contractors shall not make any assignment of the contract or any sub-contract for the execution of the works thereby contracted for, and in any event no such assignment or sub-contract, though consented to, shall exonerate the contractors from liability under the contract for the due performance of all the works thereby contracted for, and in the event of any such assignment or sub-contract being made without such consent, Her Majesty might take the work out of the contractors' hands and employ such means as she might see fit to complete the same, and in such case the contractors should have no claim for any further payment in respect of the works performed, but should nevertheless remain liable for all loss and damage which might be suffered by Her Majesty by reason of non-completion by the contractors of the works.\"\nThe tenth, eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth paragraphs of the defence allege that certain assignments of the contract and individual interests therein were made at different times, by the last of which, dated the 30th of June, 1879, the sole interest therein became vested in the suppliants, James N. Smith and Josiah D. Ripley, subject to the terms thereof and of the several preceding assignments to them.\nThe fourteenth paragraph of the defence alleges \"that the said several assignments above recited were made without the consent of Her Majesty and in violation of the provisions of the seventeenth clause of the said contract above set out, and Her Majesty, under the powers contained in the said seventeenth clause, took the work out of the said sub-contractors hands by reason whereof the suppliants have no claim against Her Majesty in respect of the works performed, as alleged in the said petition.\"\nThe paragraphs of the defence from nine to fourteen, both inclusive, have reference to the suppliants' claim for the balance due for work done and certified by the engineer. They are, as I read them, inapplicable to the damages claimed for the cancellation of the contract.\nThe fourteenth paragraph is but a statement of the legal result of the statements and allegations contained in the five preceding ones. The defence embodied in the sixth paragraph in question is in substance this: that the assignments were made without the consent of Her Majesty and that for that reason Her Majesty took the work out of the contractors' hands. In construing that clause of the contract it is necessary, first, to consider its object. Any one letting a contract for work has a right to prescribe against an assignment or sub-letting of it without the consent of the party so prescribing\u2014many reasons may actuate such a party. He may have confidence in particular persons capable and willing to perform the work contracted for, whilst at the same time he would not deal at all with others. The right to veto an assignment or sub-letting of the contract is often provided for in agreements. The contractors in this case took the contract with the condition that if they assigned or sub-let it without her consent Her Majesty should have the right to take the works off their hands, and employ such means as she might see fit to complete the same, \"and in such case the contractors should have no claim for any further payment in respect of the works performed.\"\nThe suppliants reply to this fourteenth paragraph of the defence, \"that the said assignments were not made without the consent of Her Majesty, but that Her Majesty had full notice and knowledge before said assignments were made and also immediately thereafter, and before said order in council of the 25th day of July, 1879, was passed, and gave her consent thereto; and after such notice and knowledge Her Majesty recognized the said assignees as contractors under the said contract and allowed them to go on with the work thereunder and to incur a large outlay and expenditure thereupon, on the faith of such assignments, and the recognition thereof by Her Majesty; and the suppliants further say that Her Majesty did not, under the powers and for the reasons alleged in the fourteenth paragraph take the said work out of the contractors' hands.\"\nIf Her Majesty, through the minister of the proper department, or those acting for him, either agreed to the assignments before they were made, or recognized and dealt with the assignees subsequently as the contractors for the completion of the works contracted for, and in that relation allowed them to go on with the work and to incur a large outlay and expenditure thereupon, in the belief that they had been recognized as the contractors instead of the original ones, there is I think no defence under the paragraph in question. If the last assignment, which vested the sole interest in the contract in the suppliants Smith and Ripley, was recognized by the Minister of Railways, or those from time to time acting for him, that virtually recognizes the previous ones, and, if agreed to before such last assignment, the defence must fail under the 17th clause of the agreement. If, however, such was not the case, but subsequently the suppliants last named were recognized by the Railway Department as the contractors instead of the original ones, and were thereby induced to spend large sums of money in the work contracted for, it would be unjust to them to set up that provision of the 17th clause of the contract, and Her Majesty would be estopped from setting up such a defence. It would in this case be inequitable. The evidence shows plainly that the cancellation of the contract was not in the slightest degree decided upon because of the alleged assignments of the contract. The route of the Canada Pacific Railway, of which the work contracted for formed a portion, was decided upon and the contract entered into by one government and the work favorably progressing when a change of government took place. After the formation of the new government it was decided by it to change the route of the railway and abandon the line contracted to be built. An order in council was passed to stop the further progress of the work and to take the same out of the hands of the contractors, and a notice, directed to the original contractors, of the order in council was served upon the agent and manager of the works of and under Messrs. Smith & Ripley, which had the effect of stopping the work on the contract. It is not a little singular that neither the notice nor the order in council should assign any reason for cancelling the contract, and it is but reasonable to assume that if any legitimate reason existed within the terms of the contract the contractors would have been notified of it. It may therefore be fairly concluded that, if at that time there existed any legal excuse for cancelling the contract, such would have been stated, and it is but reasonable therefore to conclude that none existed. I have no reason to say that the policy of the government in changing the route was not a wise one, and I am not called upon to give any opinion on the subject. Assuming, however, that the change was in the public interest, who should bear the cost? No private individual or company should be made to bear the consequences of a mere change of policy of the government; and if it became necessary to make the change solely on the question of route, independently of the position of the contractors as assignees or otherwise, common honesty and equity would call for the necessary contribution from the interests to be benefitted and not from those in no way immediately interested in the route. Whatever may be the legal questions involved and upon which the rights of the parties must be ascertained, there is little doubt that the contractors were induced to go on with the work, and but for the matter of the change of route they would no doubt have been permitted to finish it, and as far as reliable evidence goes would have made a handsome profit from it. It is, therefore, by the decision to change the route and the consequent stoppage of the work that the damage was done to and the loss occasioned to the contractors. Should they be called upon to bear it? or should not the public, who we must assume to have been benefitted by the change of route, bear the cost? Apart from questions as to the legal right of the contractors to recover, they are, in my opinion, equitably entitled to compensation for the losses sustained by the cancelling of the contract. It is therefore necessary to ascertain what under the evidence are their legal rights.\nThe evidence bearing upon the issue in question is chiefly that of Mr. Ripley, one of the suppliants, who says:\nIn September, 1878, I purchased for myself and Smith an interest in the contract from Charlebois, Flood & Co., within 30 days after I saw Mr. McKenzie, Minister of Public Works. He expressed satisfaction that we had become interested with them as he had known us previously, and that there was additional capital and experience added to the contract. I acquainted him with the fact that I had gone into the contract and he expressed pleasure.\nThe work on the contract was commenced after that interview, and some time afterwards he (Ripley) visited Ottawa and saw Mr. Trudeau. He came, as he states, to see the government for the purpose of \"getting a larger interest so that we might make better progress with the work\" He inquired for the Minister, but he was absent, and he says:\nI saw the Deputy Minister, Mr. Trudeau, in his office. I stated to him my views with regard to the work and what I proposed to do at that time. He answered, that the government were very glad to add strength to any contract that they had with any party either by capital or skill. I asked the commissioner Trudeau what would be necessary for me to be recognized by the government. He stated that a simple letter from my partners, Mr. Charlebois and Mr. Flood, who were recognized by the government, would place me the same as themselves with the Government.\nWitness adds:\nThat a simple letter from Mr. Charlebois and Mr. Flood who were recognized by the government would invest me with all the rights they had with the government. I understood him to say that distinctly. In answer to this question, what did you tell Mr. Trudeau was your specific object in coming to visit him on that occasion? the witness said, \"That I had in view the buying out of these parties, I spoke more particularly of Mr. Charlebois. I do not remember the words, but he gave me the impression emphatically that it would be agreeable to the government.\nThe witness returned to Collingwood and bought out for himself and Smith the interest in the contract of Charlebois, Flood and others.\nBefore the interview with Trudeau, the witness stated that he had heard a rumor at Collingwood, and also after he came to Ottawa, that the government had some idea of stopping the works. He stated to Mr. Trudeau what he had heard and \"wanted to know if the government had any thought of stopping the work? He (Trudeau) said there was no foundation for the rumor. That reply satisfied the witness and relying on it, he bought out the whole interest in the contract for himself and Smith. That was in the spring of 1879.\nIt appears in evidence that Messrs. Smith & Ripley had been previously very successful railway contractors, possessing capital, credit and means abundantly sufficient for the purposes of the contract, while the original contractors seem to have been wanting in that respect; and these facts being known, it is not strange that the railway authorities were, not only not opposed to the assignment of the contract, but pleased with it, as the assignees of the contract were so much better able and more likely to complete it satisfactorily than the original parties. The foregoing statements of Mr. Ripley, if not true, could have been contradicted by Mr. Trudeau, but as he was not called for that purpose I feel bound to accept them as reliable.\nIn that evidence there is sufficient to show the consent of the railway department to the assignments to Messrs. Smith & Ripley, and the payment subsequently to them of between $10,000 and $11,000 on account of work done was also evidence of the ratification of the assignment and the recognition of them as the substituted contractors.\nI think the issue raised upon the point in question must be found in favor of the suppliants.\nIt appears to me, too, that the object of the provision was to assure the completion of the works by the prescribed time, and it was made to enable the government to secure that result. It is, to my mind, very questionable if the contract could be legally cancelled when the government had decided to stop the works and change the route.\nThe merits of the case I consider wholly with the suppliants, and the defence, to be effectual, should establish a clear, legal right to avoid the contract within its provisions, which I think it has failed to do.\nThe remaining statements of defence do not raise any issue of importance, and I have now only to consider the question of damages.\nThe evidence as to the total expenditure on account of the contract up to the date of its cancellation is not very satisfactory, but rather confused. Statements were given by the book keepers of the suppliants Smith and Ripley, and the latter also gave evidence as to the expenditure. I have endeavoured to dissect the statements made, so as if possible to obtain a satisfactory result. It appears the whole expenditure for cost of plant and everything was $120,144.04, on account of which the government paid $10,050, and for the plant sold there was got $10,053.27. That would leave a balance of $100,040.77.\nIt is shown that of this balance there was included the cost of the purchase of the assignments of the contract, $29,000.00.\nThe balance for work done and unpaid for therefore is $71,040.77. If entitled to recover at all, it seems clear to me that the suppliants are entitled to be paid this sum under any circumstances. If the government illegally ended the contract, as I think it did, I am of opinion the question of profit and loss on the whole contract does not necessarily arise and that the suppliants to recover that amount need not show how the whole contract would have resulted. It would be only necessary I think to show the balance expended above payments and receipts. That question, however, does not arise in this case, for the evidence largely preponderates to show that had the suppliants been permitted to finish the contract there would have been a profit instead of a loss. There is therefore no reason that the suppliants should not recover that amount. They however claim damages for the loss of the profit they allege they would have otherwise made, and sustained their allegations by a great many witnesses. Those witnesses were all well acquainted with the works done and to be done. They are experienced contractors, the most of them, and capable of estimating the cost of such works. They state that a profit would undoubtedly have resulted, and some estimated it as high as $220,000.\nIt was shown by three or more witnesses that a reliable railway firm (Messrs. Loss & McRae), after a careful inspection of the works, and shortly before the cancellation of the contract, made an offer to Messrs. Smith & Ripley, to take the works off their hands and finish them as required by the contract and pay them a profit of ten per cent. on the work to be done. This would be equal to about $75,000. That offer was refused by Smith & Ripley because, as they allege, they believed they would have made a larger profit by doing the work themselves. Evidence was, however, given on the other side by five witnesses, all of whom are engineers, but only two had been contractors, none of them but one had been on the ground, and their evidence was founded on estimates made from the working plans. Having heard the examinations of all the witnesses I feel that the evidence of the large number of witnesses capable of estimating the cost of the works, and who made the estimates referred to by them from actual and careful personal inspection, who gave evidence on the part of the suppliants, is entitled to much more weight than that of four gentlemen who had never seen the works or the appliances and means at hand for completing them. While some of the suppliants' witnesses estimated the profit on the contract would have been over $200,000, the five witnesses for the defence give it as their opinion that there would have been none. I have no doubt but that the witnesses on both sides gave their opinions on the point conscientiously. I think I could not be expected to trust to the opinion of gentlemen who never saw the locality of the works, in preference to that of double the number who had a thorough knowledge of them. It is not so much a question of credibility as of reliability in the judgment of the witnesses. The evidence taken altogether has left me impressed with the firm belief that a large profit would have resulted, and I am of opinion that the sum of $100,000 is not too high a sum at which to put it according to the weight of the evidence. That sum, added to the sum expended on the works, would amount to $171,040.77, and I assess the damages to the suppliants at the latter named sum and give judgment in their favor for that amount with costs.\nFrom this judgment the respondent appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nMr. Lash, Q.C., for appellant:\nThe contractors were informed of the exact effect of the order in council of the 25th July, 1879, and although the words \"cancel and annul\" are not to be found in the order in council, the effect of the order in council, which was enclosed in a letter, was plainly to inform the contractors that they were to stop work. Upon receipt of this notice the contractors simply stopped work and discharged their hands. The defence raised the point that one of the terms of the contract was, that if contractors made default and continued for a number of days in default, the government could take the contract out of their hands. By clause 14 of the contract this power is given to the government. True, the evidence failed to establish notice in writing, but, in addition to this, the contract provided that the work had to be completed by the 1st July, 1880, and although Smith & Ripley, after the assignment, made large preparations and went to great outlay and could have performed their contract within the delay, still, at that time, the contractors, Heney, Charlebois & Flood, had practically abandoned the contract, they had sold out and by themselves would have been unable to complete it before the time, and, therefore, I submit that the contractors having made default, the Crown had the right to rescind the contract. Then, if my proposition is correct, this contract came to an end on 9th August, 1879, when the Department of Railways notified the contractors, and if at an end, then no action can be brought upon an executory contract, and as it is only upon an executory contract that the suppliants can succeed, the judgment cannot stand. Their answer to this contention is, that the original contractors had the right to assign and did assign their contracts to Smith & Ripley, and the evidence showing that they (Smith & Ripley) had incurred large expenditure to prosecute the work, there was no default by Smith & Ripley, and, therefore, the notice of the 9th August did not cancel the contract. If their premises be correct their conclusion is correct.\n[THE CHIEF JUSTICE. Do Heney, Charlebois & Flood set up that they were carrying out their contract through the instrumentality of Smith & Ripley?]\nNo, my lord, and if they did it could not be supported by the evidence.\nThis brings me to the main point of the defence, viz., the effect of the transactions which took place between the original contractors and Smith & Ripley. [The learned counsel then read clause 17 of the contract.]\nNow, what the Crown says is this: \"You made an assignment of this contract without the consent of the Crown, and, therefore, Her Majesty had the right to take the contract out of your hands and cancel it.\" Their answer is two fold:\n1st. That the assignments to them of the contract were assented to by the Crown.\n2nd. Even though it were assigned without having obtained the assent of the Crown, clause 17 of the contract does not give the right to Her Majesty to take the contract out of their hands, unless it is with the intention of completing the work, and that as in this case the true reason for taking the work out of the contractor's hands was not on account of the assignment, therefore clause 17 cannot be relied on.\nThe first question is: Did Her Majesty assent to the assignment?\nThe first notice which the Crown received of these assignments was by letter of the 5th August, 1879, written by Messrs. Smith & Ripley's attorney. This was answered by a letter dated August 11, 1879.\nNow the order in council ordering the stoppage of the works was passed on the 25th July, and was communicated to them on the 9th August.\nThe evidence relied on by suppliants as proving the Crown's assent is contained in the evidence of Mr. Ripley. The first interview by Mr. Ripley with Mr. McKenzie was in September, 1878. It appears that Messrs. Smith & Ripley had tendered for this work, and, as their tender was too high, they afterwards made overtures to the successful tenderers Messrs. Heney, Charlebois & Flood and took an interest in this contract. On the 14th September, 1878, by a notarial deed a partnership was formed, comprising the original contractors and some others, for the purpose of carrying out the contract, and on the same day Mr. Ripley, one of the suppliants, and others were admitted into the partnership by notarial deed.\nBy this instrument there was no assignment of the contract. Under the terms of the contract there could be no objection to the contractors taking in associates for the purpose of getting capital. Mr. Ripley, therefore, having obtained this interest in the contract came to Ottawa and had this interview, and it is on this interview they rely as bearing out the contention that the government assented to the assignment. [The learned counsel then read part of the evidence which is referred to in the judgments.] Now, this conversation had only reference to the partnership agreement and not to the assignment of the contract, as provided in the 17th clause of the contract.\nThe next interview relied on as containing the assent of the Crown took place between Mr. Ripley and Mr. Trudeau, the Deputy Minister of Public Works, in the spring of 1879. This was when Mr. Ripley came to Ottawa, not for the purpose of taking an assignment of the whole contract, but for the purpose of getting a larger interest in it.\nOn the cross-examination some reference is there made to this conversation. [THE CHIEF JUSTICE; What does Mr. Trudeau say on this point?]\nHe was not called. There is no doubt that what Mr. Ripley states there is correct. At this interview, also, he only refers to getting a larger interest and not a total assignment. That is all the respondents can rely upon as proving an assent on the part of the Crown to the assignment upon which they now base their claim. I submit it cannot have that effect, and if it could be construed to mean an assent or a promise to give an assent, it cannot bind the Crown. Mr. Trudeau's position as Deputy Minister of Public Works did not qualify him to bind the Crown. If he had any authority at all, it was in virtue of his position, and that position, it cannot be denied, does not authorize him to alter a written contract. But it is far better to hold that Mr. Trudeau never did anything of the kind.\n[THE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014If you rely on this, it would have been far better to have the oath of Mr. Trudeau.]\nIf Ripley had proved anything at variance with the contract, it might have been the duty of the Crown to call him as witness, but I submit he did not.\nI now come to the titles of Messrs. Smith & Ripley whereby all interest in this contract became vested in them. The first instrument is a release by John Heney, dated 2nd August, 1878, to the other original contractors Charlebois and Flood, by which the former releases his interest to the latter gentlemen.\nThen, on the 16th May, 1879, Flood, together with others, assign their interest to Smith & Ripley, and finally, on the 30th June, 1879, Charlebois and others assign their interest to Smith & Ripley. At that time the suppliants had obtained the control of all interests in the contract, but inasmuch as there might be some complications in consequence of the numerous transfers, they all joined together; and by a further instrument, made on the 30th June, 1879, the suppliants obtained a complete assignment of the contract. Now, how can it be successfully contended that the conversation which took place with the Minister of Public Works in 1878, constitute the Crown's assent by anticipation to all these transactions?\nThey also allege that because the government had given notice to the original contractors that the work should be stopped, they were debarred from the right of relying upon the covenant in the contract, and of refusing their assent to an assignment.\nIf the notice given had not the effect of cancelling the contract, then the contract remained as it was, and one of the terms of the contract is that if the contractors assigned without the consent of the Crown, it should be null and void. But in addition to this, I also rely upon evidence which, I say, disproves that the Crown knew of this arrangement.\nThe notice was given on the 9th August, 1879, and all payments up to that date had been made to the original contractors by cheques payable to their order, but to the bank of Montreal, who had a power of attorney to receive all moneys coming to these contractors under that contract, and which power of attorney had not been revoked. Then, on the 13th Aug., 1879, the contractors write to the government, showing that they at that time considered themselves the proper parties to be notified.\n[THE CHIEF JUSTICE: \u2014When was the notice of the assignment given to the government?]\nBy letter dated 5th August, 1879. But it is said Messrs. Heney, Charlebois & Flood are suppliants, also, and therefore the suppliants are still entitled to recover.\nI will now deal with the petition, as a petition of the original contractors. I submit, so far as Messrs. Heney, Charlebois & Flood are concerned: (a.) That they cannot recover for balance of work done, because under the terms of the contract they forfeited their claims by assigning the contract.\n(b.) That they cannot recover anything under the contract as an executory contract, because:\u2014\n1. It was rescinded on account of being assigned.\n2. It was rescinded on account of the contractors' default in going on with the work and of their inability to complete the contract on their part.\n3. If not rescinded, there was no breach of any of its terms by Her Majesty by the giving of the notice relied on as such breach.\nDealing as between Smith & Ripley and the Crown, I contend:\n(a.) That they cannot stand in any better position than their assignors, the contractors, and that if the contractors cannot recover, neither can their assignees.\n(b.) That Smith & Ripley have not any right against the Crown, because:\u2014\nThe contract attempted to be assigned to them was one which could not be assigned so as to give them any rights against the Crown under it unless with the consent of the Crown.\n(c.) Any executory rights (if any,) which they may have acquired through the assignment to them expired upon the cancellation of the contract.\nThe statute of Ontario passed in relation to choses in action is not binding upon the Crown, and cannot be relied on in a contract between the Crown and a subject.\nI will now come to another branch of my argument under another clause of this contract, to wit: That the letter of August the 9th, 1879, and the order in council relied upon as being a breach of the contract, did not constitute any breach on the part of Her Majesty. This is a unilateral contract by which the contractors bind themselves to do certain work, for which, when done, they are entitled to receive certain monies. This raises practically the same point as in MacLean v. The Queen[1]. There is, I submit, no express contract on the part of the Crown that the work will be given, the contract only says there shall be certain moneys paid when work done. I admit there would have been an implied contract to give the suppliants the work, in order that they might perform the work and earn the consideration, but for clause 34 of the contract. By this clause:\nIt is distinctly declared that no implied contract of any kind whatever by or on behalf of Her Majesty shall arise or be implied from anything in this contract or from any position or situation of the parties at any time, it being clearly understood and agreed that the express contract, covenants and agreements herein contained and made by Her Majesty, are and shall be the only contracts, covenants and agreements upon which any rights against her are to be founded.\nNow, the only contract of which the letter of the 9th August, 1879, constitutes a breach, must be an implied contract and that contract is expressly excluded by clause 84\nAs to the damages, the learned judge who tried the case gave judgment in favor of the suppliants for $100,040 anticipated profits, and $71,040 outlay incurred in preparing to go on with the works, in all $171,000. I do not find fault with the mode adopted for arriving at this amount, but the evidence does not sustain the amount awarded.\n[The learned counsel then commented on the evidence.] Under these circumstances I submit that the judgment of the Exchequer Court is wrong in awarding to the suppliants $171,040, as the evidence does not sustain such a finding and the suppliants are not in law entitled to it. Mr. Hector Cameron, Q.C., for respondents:\nI will not take up the question of damages, as Mr. McDougall, who was engaged in the case in the court below, will discuss this matter more at length.\nNow, assuming this contract to have been made between a private individual and a corporation to build fifty miles of a railway, it would strike one at first view as strange to find that, on a question of assignment of the contract, the assignees, who at first had been taken in as partners in order to increase the working capital, and afterwards had been induced by the corporation to take a larger interest, and had, as in this case, expended some $70,000, should be met with this answer: \"You are not entitled to any remuneration at all, and, although we gave you work to do, and induced you to put your money in this contract and buy out your co-contractors, now we have changed our minds, we will not pay.\" Such a defence on behalf of a corporation, I say, would almost shock one's ideas of justice, but that such a defence should be put forward by the Crown, because the Crown subsequently refused to consent to the assignment, is, to say the least, singular. Of course there is no merit in such a defence First, it is admitted that Messrs. Smith & Ripley had a perfect right to go in as partners in this contract. They did so, and afterwards, being encouraged by the officers of the Crown to take a larger interest, they brought out their co-contractors, and then they are told: \"Oh! you have taken an assignment of this contract, now, because you have done so, we will not pay you one cent.\" If, I repeat, a corporation came into any court with a defence like that, there would be some very hard language used, and the corporation would be estopped from putting forward such a defence. However that may be, that seems also to have been the view taken by Mr. Sandford Fleming, the Chief Engineer for Government Railways, for, it appears, he advised the Government and reported that Messrs. Smith and Ripley's claim should be considered and be referred to some one in order to decide what compensation should be offered to him; but this course was not adopted, and afterwards, due to some afterthought, the Crown was advised to put in this defence, and finding it there, I must stigmatise it as a dishonest defence.\nThe appellant contends, that under the provisions of the seventeenth clause of the contract, and by reason of the alleged transfers of the interests of the original contractors to the suppliants Smith and Ripley by various assignments, the contract was cancelled and taken from the contractors.\nBy that clause it is provided that the contractors shall not assign, and, even if they assign and government consent, such assignment shall not exonerate the contractors from liability, and, if assigned without Government's assent, then Her Majesty may take the work out of the contractor's hands and employ such means as she may see fit to complete the same.\nIt is a mere covenant, and what is the result? The utmost power given to the appellant is that, upon certain events happening, the Crown may take the work out of the contractor's hands, provided it is \"for the purpose of prosecuting it by some other means,\" and for no other purpose. There is no authority there given to cancel the contract, or permanently to put a stop to the work on account of an assignment. This clause must be construed strictly, and a forfeiture is never favored, and will not be assumed unless expressly declared. The object of this clause, evidently, was not to create a penalty for assignment, nor to provide an excuse for forfeiting the contract should the Government not wish to go on with it, even if it were being ably prosecuted, but to ensure its satisfactory completion by preventing the work from getting into the hands of weak or irresponsible contractors.\nI submit therefore that an assignment without consent under this clause creates no forfeiture, but a mere breach of convenant at the most, for which, if the Grown could have any remedy, it would simply be by action on the covenant. See Paul v. Nurse[2]; Roe v. Harrison[3]; British Waggon Co. v. Lea[4]\nThen I say the suppliants have the right to recover in the name of the original contractors.\nParagraph 5 of the petition alleges that the contractors procured Smith and Ripley to expend the amount for them. But the contract had been assigned, when the order to stop work and cancel the contract was communicated to the contractors on the 9th August. The passing of the subsequent order in council of the 14th August, 1879, alleging the assignments as a reason for the cancellation, could not validate a breach of contract already wrongfully committed. I say the second order in council was a farce. If the first reason given was right, there was no necessity for the second order in council. It was unfair, I contend, on the 14th August to set up this reason, when they had already cancelled it on the 25th July, because it was the policy of the government not to go on with the work. And inasmuch as the previous ground arose from no fault of the contractors, I say it is a technical reason which is now set up and ought not to prevail. The clause now inserted in government contracts is very differently worded, and shows that when the intention of the government to stop work is communicated to the contractor reasonable compensation is provided for. It is an equitable clause and the contractor goes in with his eyes open.\nThere is one case to which I wish to call the attention of the court, in which all the cases bearing on this point are thoroughly discussed, it is McIntosh, et al. v. Samo[5], and establishes clearly the principle that a clause of that kind will not be read to work a forfeiture unless expressly so provided. Then, again, this 17th clause does not provide for a consent to be in writing. It being a mere license under the contract, and not in any way a variation of the sealed instrument, a verbal sanction from the officer representing Her Majesty as Minister, or from the temporary head of the department, would be sufficient. It might be by acquiescence.\n[THE CHIEF JUSTICE: Could there be a consent before there was an assignment?]\nYes, if a contractor came to the Minister of Railways and told him he was going to take an assignment of a contract, and the minister answered he was very glad, and the contractor then asked in what form should he do it, and the proper directions were given, assuming all that, would not the Crown be estopped from saying that the assignment must be treated as a forfeiture of the contract? The Deputy Minister of Public Works, who was then the departmental officer who could give the necessary information to the suppliants, told them what to do, and they complied with his directions. 31 Vic., ch. 12, secs. 2, 4 and 7, specify the powers of the Deputy Minister.\nAs to the contention that the Crown was under no obligation to give the contractors the work to do, because there was no express covenant to that effect in the contract, and therefore Her Majesty committed no breach in stopping the work and cancelling the contract, I submit that there is no necessity on our part to establish that there existed an express or implied covenant, because the moment Her Majesty, through her officers, put the contractors in possession of the location of the work, gave them the requisite plans and bill of works for the execution of the contract, and directed them to commence operations, Her Majesty did all that she would have been obliged to do under an express covenant by her that the contractors would be given the work.\nAlthough there are, in the general description of the subject of the contract above set forth, several different branches or classes of work required, yet they all constitute one entire and undivided undertaking; that is to say, the construction of fifty miles of railway known as the Georgian Bay branch in such a way as to make it complete and ready for traffic\nThis case differs entirely from the case of McLean v The Queen, lately decided in this court, and from the authorities upon which that decision was based.\nIn each of these cases it was necessary to establish, in order that the plaintiff should succeed, that there was an implied covenant on the part of the defendant to give the work in question therein, or to do some other precedent act, and to continue these acts from time to time, because the subject of contract did not consist as in this case of one entire work, but of several separate and distinct undertakings. See McLean v. The Queen[6]; Churchward v. The Queen[7]; McIntyre v. Belcher[8].\nIf, however, it were necessary in order to make the appellants liable in this case, that an implied contract on Her Majesty's part should be established, it is submitted on behalf of the respondents, that the thirty-fourth clause relied upon by the appellants would not prevent such being done. That clause must be construed to mean only that no covenant or contract by Her Majesty should be implied inconsistent with, or further than is necessary to carry out, the intention of the parties to the written contract.\nThe object of the parties in making the contract must be kept in view in construing it, and as provided in the first part of the fourth clause the several parts of the contract must be taken together to explain each other: See Mallan v. May[9] and Ford v. Beach[10].\nThen, as to the question of damages, the learned counsel for the appellants treated all the witnesses on behalf of the respondents as being interested. Now, not one of them had any interest left in this contract, but all of them, from their knowledge of the locality and experience in such matters, could speak with much more weight than any of the witnesses for the defence, not one of whom had been there, except Mr. Lumsden, and against his evidence we have the evidence of contractors who had examined the road and made a bon\u00e2 fide offer of ten per cent. profit on the bulk sum of the contract.\nThen, as to the point whether the contract could have been completed within the time provided for in the contract, to begin with, it is in evidence that the government were themselves in default, and, under clause 29 of the contract, the contractors would have been entitled to further time, and then the evidence for the suppliants clearly proved that with the large outlay that had been made, and considering the position of the suppliants who were practical and experienced contractors with unlimited means, the work would have been completed. There is no doubt of the fact that the suppliants are out of pocket some $70,000, and that in addition to that they would have made a large sum of profits. These profits would have flown from this contract, and the evidence fully sustains the amoun awarded See Mayne on Damages[11].\nHon. Mr. McDougall, Q.C., follows:\u2014\nAs I had to do with the evidence, and have been engaged in the case since the commencement, I would ask your lordships to follow me in order to understand the rationale of the case.\nThe case is important, not only in regard to the amount involved, which is large, but also as regards the position of contractors generally in Government contracts, and will, therefore, justify a careful consideration.\nThis contract was made with the authority of parliament and was for the execution by the contractors of the work described as \"the excavation, bridging, grading, fencing, track-laying, and ballasting of that portion of the Canadian Pacific Railway known as the Georgian Bay branch,\" consisting of fifty miles. Money had been voted by parliament, and I presume it was the lowest tender which was accepted. The contractors, therefore, became entitled to perform their contract and get their pay. I deny, as is contended for by the crown, that this is an unilateral contract.\nThe contract in this case is under seal, signed by both parties and is reciprocal. There are express covenants and agreements by both parties. The performance of the contract by the respondents was dependent upon, and impossible without, the previous performance of certain things by the appellants\u2014such as location of the line, staking out the work, cross-sectioning the cuttings, supplying drawings and plans for bridges, &c.\nThe Crown notified the respondents (9th August, 1879,) to \"cease all further operations,\" and, thereafter, refused to perform the covenants, &c., on its part. The Crown committed a wilful breach and made it impossible for the respondents to proceed with the work under the contract. As under the circumstances they could not compel specific performance, their only remedy was an action for damages.\nIt is a rule of the common, as well as of the civil law, that \"if one man is to pay money to another upon an act being done, and the other is ready and offers to do the act, and the party hinders him, this is tantamount to performance.\" Addison on Contracts[12]; Domat[13]; Tones v. Judd[14]. And the party hindered acquires a complete right to the money, as if the contract on his part had been performed. Pedan v. Hopkins[15]; Shaw v. Turnpike Co[16].\nThe contract contains no provision for the suspension or abandonment of the work. The two clauses referred to by the appellants (14th and 17th) provide for the completion of the works by the respondents in certain events\u2014not abandonment\u2014and are evidently inserted in terrorem, and not to work a forfeiture.\n\"The law does not favour forfeiture. Strict proof of breach of condition or covenant working forfeiture is always required\"[17].\nThe 14th clause requires six days' notice in writing to the contractors before it can be acted upon. The Crown admits that the required notice was never given. This admission disposes, also, of all that part of the defence which alleges \"default or delay in diligently continuing to execute the works.\"\nThe 17th clause restrains the assignment \"of this contract,\" i.e., the entire contract, without consent. It does not, and was not intended to restrain the transfer of an interest to persons of means and skill, who might advance capital or supplies. The universal practice had been and still is, to admit partners to \"strengthen the firm.\" The original contractors and their securities remained liable to the Crown up to the very moment of cancellation or abandonment. But assignment without consent does not work a forfeiture. This clause merely gives an option to the government to take the works out of the hands of the contractors and \"complete the same\" themselves. This is evident from the condition that the contractors shall remain liable for all loss sustained by the government in such case, and shall leave all materials, horses and plant, on the ground for the purpose of, and until, the work is so completed. The option was not availed of, nor was the work completed by the government. The 17th clause, therefore, cannot be invoked by the Crown.\nThe respondents proved an actual consent by the Minister of Public Works, and subsequently by the Deputy Minister, to the partnership arrangements between Smith & Ripley and the original contractors made prior to the 25th July, 1879, the date of the so called concellation.\nThey also proved notice to the Crown of their presence upon and interest in the work as partners of the original contractors. (Evidence of engineer Brunel, Report of Sandford Fleming, admitting that Smith & Ripley had received payments for work executed. Letter of Brunel to Fleming of June 30, 1879.\nThe recognition of respondents by the engineers in charge, by giving them directions as to the work, paying estimates to them instead of the original contractors, as well as the statements of Mr. McKenzie and Mr. Trudeau to Mr. Ripley when he visited Ottawa, before he had concluded negotiations with Charlebois & Co., amount in law to a waiver of the condition of clause 17, even if its breach should be held to work a forfeiture. The government misled the respondents and cannot take advantage of their own wrong. Doe v. Rowe[18]; 1 William's Saunders[19] and cases there cited.\nThat is the character of the contract. While work was progressing, it was discovered on the one hand that some of the contractors had not sufficient capital, on the other that the Government were in default in omitting to do certain things, and a proposal was made by the suppliants to take an interest in this contract. These gentlemen had large capital, extensive plant and machinery and were practical and extensive contractors, and in fact few men were better able to do this work than they were, and labor being cheap, they had the hope of making a handsome profit. The Minister of Public Works, and he surely was capable of binding his department in matters of this kind, knew these gentlemen, and on hearing of their intention, said without hesitation, that he was glad to have such men in the contract. It was then a matter of public policy to build this road, and we can understand how readily the Government acquiesced in having Messrs. Ripley and Smith interested in this contract.\nThere never was, I contend, an assignment of the contract in the sense of the seventeenth clause. First of all Mr. Ripley became a partner of the original contractors. This did not require an Order in Council, nor was it an act of state; every day parties are added to contracts, even banks become interested; in fact public works, which require large outlay and expense, could not be carried on unless this were done, yet I find the Crown in this case objects to pay money justly due. I confess this seems to me unjustifiable. There is a case which came before the Privy Council, Kirk v. The Queen[20], where it was held that the receipt of rents by the Government waived the clause of forfeiture. I refer your Lordships to that case, which shows how such a defence as the one here set up is regarded by the Privy Council. My contention is, that Messrs. Smith & Ripley became parties to this contract with the approval of the Government, and that they have never altered their character in that respect; they simply increased their interest, and that with the Government's assent, so far as was necessary, and therefore, I say, clause seventeen cannot be relied upon by the Crown. Then, if there is no ground for cancelling the contract, under clause seventeen, what is the position of the parties? The Government have assumed to cancel this contract, it may be in the public interest, but then they must pay; in matters of public policy, private individuals should not be made to suffer, the public can afford to pay: no one asks that these gentlemen should suffer, except the learned counsel representing some one behind him. Now, the contract being cancelled, what do these contractors\u2014foreigners to us\u2014do? They put in their claim, and finding they could not have it settled at once, but being still anxious to close up this transaction, they make a proposal to refer their claim to any one of three public officers. I happen to know there was a strong disposition in certain quarters to favor this mode of settlement, but some how or other the matter dragged along, and finally, these gentlemen had to come before the Exchequer Court and got there a verdict which I claim is in accordance with justice and right, and which I respectfully submit should be sustained by this court.\n[The learned counsel then reviewed the evidence, and contended that it fully sustained the verdict.] RITCHIE, C. J.:\u2014\nThe appeal in this case is on behalf of Her Majesty, from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, in the matter of the petition of right of James N. Smith and others, by which judgment the said petitioners are declared entitled to be paid by Her Majesty the sum of $171,040.00, for damages consequent upon the cancellation of a contract for the building of a portion of the Canadian Pacific Railway.\nThe contract in question was entered into on the day it bears date, between the petitioners, Heney, Charlebois and Flood, and Her Majesty, represented by the then Minister of Public Works of Canada, for the execution by the contractors of the work described as \"the excavation, bridging, grading, fencing, track-laying and ballasting of that portion of the Canadian Pacific Railway known as the Georgian Bay Branch, and consisting of fifty miles, extending between Section O.\" of location 1877, on the west of South River, near Nippissigan Post Office, to the head of navigation on French River, in consideration of the covenant for payment on the part of Her Majesty set out in clause 24 of said contract.\nThere are numerous conditions, provisoes and powers mentioned in the contract, all of which are set out in full in the case.\nThe following clauses more immediately bear on this case:\n17. The contractors shall not make any assignments this contract, or any sub-contract, for the execution of any of the works hereby contracted for and in any event no such assignment or sub-contract, even though consented to, shall exonerate the contractors from liability, under this contract, for the due performance of all the works hereby contracted for. In the event of any such assignment or sub-contract being made, then the contractors shall not have or make any claim or demand upon Her Majesty for any future payments under this contract for any further or greater sum or sums than the sum or sums respectively at which the work or works so assigned or sub-contracted for shall have been undertaken to be executed by the assignee or sub-contractor; and in the event of any such assignment or sub-contract being made without such consent, Her Majesty may take the work out of the contractors' hands, and employ such means as she may see fit to complete the same; and in such case the contractors shall have no claim for any further payment in respect of the works performed, but shall nevertheless remain liable for all loss and damage which may be suffered by Her Majesty by reason of the non-completion by the contractors of the works; and all materials and things whatsoever, and all horses, machinery, and other plant provided by them for the purposes of the works, shall remain and be considered as the property of Her Majesty for the purposes and accordiug to the provisions and conditions contained in the twelfth clause hereof.\n18. Time shall be deemed to be of the essence of this contract.\n24. It is distinctly declared that no implied contract of any kind whatsoever, by or on behalf of Her Majesty, shall arise or be implied from anything in this contract contained, or from any position or situation of the parties at any time, it being clearly understood and agreed that the express contracts, covenants and agreements herein contained and made by Her Majesty, are and shall be the only contracts, covenants and agreements upon which any rights against Her are to be founded.\n25. Cash payments equal to about ninety per cent. of the value of the work done, approximately made up from returns of progress measurements and computed at the prices agreed upon or determined under the provisions of this contract, will be made to the contractors monthly on the written certificate of the engineer that the work for or on account of which the certificate is granted, has been duly mentioned; and upon approval of such certificate by the Minister of Public Works, for the time being for the Dominion of Canada, and the said certificate and such approval thereof shall be a condition precedent to the right of the contractors to be paid the said ninety per cent. or any part thereof. The remaining ten per cent. shall be retained till the final completion of the whole work to the satisfaction of the chief engineer for the time being, having control over the work, and within two months after such completion the remaining ten per cent. will be paid. And it is hereby declared that the written certificate of the said engineer certifying to the final completion of said works to his satisfaction shall be a condition precedent to the right of the contractors to receive or be paid the said remaining ten per cent., or any part thereof\n26. It is intended that every allowance to which the contractors are fairly entitled, will be embraced in the engineer's monthly certificate; but should the contractors at any time have claims of any description which they consider are not included in the progress certificates, it will be necessary for them to make and report such claims in writing to the engineer within fourteen days after the date of each and every certificate in Which they allege such claims to have been omitted.\n27. The contractors in presenting claims of the kind referred to in the last clause must accompany them with satisfactory evidence of their accuracy, and the reason why they think they should be allowed. Unless such claims are thus made during the progress of the work, within fourteen days, as in the preceding clause, and repeated, in writing, every month, until finally adjusted or rejected, it must be clearly understood that they shall be forever shut out, and the contractors shall have no claim on Her Majesty in respect thereof.\n28. The progress measurements and progress certificates shall not in any respect be taken as an acceptance of the work or release of the contractors from responsibility in respect thereof, but they shall at the conclusion of the work deliver over the same in good order, according to the true intent and meaning of this contract.\nThe following are the dates respectively of the documents in evidence:\n2nd August, 1878\u2014Contract between Heney, Charlebois & Flood and The Queen.\n14th September, 1878\u2014Jas. Ripley et al obtain a third interest in the contract, Charlebois & Co. having one-third, and Flood & Cooper, the other third.\n19th September, 1878\u2014A new partnership is formed between Charlebois, Flood & Co., and Heney's interest is purchased.\n16th May, 1879\u2014Flood & Co. and Cooper assign their third interest to J. Ripley, acting for Smith & Ripley.\n30th June, 1879\u2014Charlebois & Co. assign their third interest to Smith & Ripley.\nOn same day, 30th June, 1879, a dissolution of the previous partnerships takes places, leaving the Messrs, Smith & Ripley the sole interested parties in the contract. On the same day, 30th June, district engineer informs engineer in chief that Ripley, one of the principal contractors, intends pushing work and buying out minor partners.\nOn the 25th July, 1879, Order in Council passed recommending that the contractors be notified to stop work.\nOn the 5th August, 1879, Smith & Ripley notify the Minister of Railways of the transfer of the contract and their readiness to substitute their security for that given by Charlebois.\nOn the 9th August, the Order in Council of July 25th is forwarded to the original contractors.\nOn the 11th August, Acting Secretary of Department of Railways and Canals acknowledges receipt of Messrs. Smith & Ripley's letter, and informs them that the Crown does not consent to the assignment, and will not consent.\nOn the 13th August, 1879, the original contractors acknowledge the receipt of the letter of the 9th August, enclosing copy of Order in Council of July 25th, 1879.\nOn the 14th August, 1879, Order in Council cancelling the contract with Heney, Charlebois & Flood.\nOn the 27th August, Smith & Ripley acknowledge receipt of letter of 11th August, enclosing order in Council of July 25th, 1879, and state they only received it on 26th August, 1879.\nThen follow letters by Smith & Ripley to the Minister of Railways, dated respectively 20th September, 1879, 30th September, 1879, December 15th, 1879, and November 22nd, 1880.\nI cannot discover a tittle of evidence to show that either before or after the contract was assigned Her Majesty ever consented to such assignments, or had any knowledge of such assignments, or in any way directly or indirectly recognized the assignees as contractors under the said contract, but, as I read the evidence, the very contrary was the case, from the commencement of the work and until the contract was put an end to, the original contractors continued to deal with the government and the government with the contractors under the contract, entirely independent of any third parties whatever. All the payments for work done under the contract before and after the alleged assignments were made to the original contractors, Heney, Charlebois & Flood, on the monthly certificates issued to them in accordance with the provisions of the contract, who, through their duly authorized attorney, received the same and gave receipts therefor, as follows:\nPAYMENTS MADE ON ACCOUNT OF CONTRACT.\nOfficial Cheque (for work done per estimate No. 1 to 31st ult., contract 37, Pacific Railway,) No. 1521, for $550, issued in favor of Heney, Charlebois & Flood and received by A. Drummond, manager of Bank of Montreat, on 20th December, 1878, under power of attorney granted to A. Drummond, manager of the branch of Bank of Montreal, Ottawa, to receive all sums due, or may hereafter become due by the Government of Canada to Messrs. Heney, Charlebois & Flood. The power of attorney is dated and signed 18th December, 1878.\nOfficial Cheque (for work done per estimate, No. 20, contract 673, Pacific Railway,) No. 1985, for $880, in favor of Heney, Charlebois & Flood, received by Mr. Drummond on 20th December, 1878.\nOfficial Cheque (for work done per estimate to 31st December, 1878, contract 37, Pacific Railway,) No. 2335, for $1,600, in favor of Heney, Charlebois & Flood, received by Mr. Drummond on 16th January, 1879.\nOfficial Cheque (for work done per estimate to 31st January, Pacific Railway, contract 37, P.

W. de C. O'Grady on the 16th June, 1879.\nWhen notice that the contract was put an end to, such notice was by the government given to the said original contractors, and on the 13th August, 1879, these contractors (Heney, Charlebois & Flood) write to the Hon. Mr. Pope, acting Minister of Railways and Canals, as follows:\u2014\nHon. John Pope,\nActing Minister of Railways and Canals.\nSIR,\u2014We have to acknowledge yours of the 9th instant covering a copy of an Order in Council of the 25th of July, authorizing you to cancel our contract for the construction of the Georgian Bay Branch of the Canadian Pacific Railway. Also your notice of August 9th to us to discontinue operations under said contract. In pursuance to your notice I immediately transmitted your order to discontinue operations to the parties temporarily in charge of the work by telegraph to Collingwood, the executive office of our firm. Should there be a failure of full compliance to your order by the parties temporarily in charge of the work, on account of certain efforts to negotiate with us, for the entire control of said work; we would hereby inform and notify you, that such negotiations were never completed or deemed sufficiently likely to become so, to cause us to ask your official sanction thereto. Therefore we shall only enumerate, subject to amicable settlement, such charges as have become chargeable to the work previous to the receipt of your notice to discontinue operations.\nWe have the honor to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servants,\nHeney, Charlebois & Flood.\nMontreal, 13 August, 1879.\nThereby entirely repudiating by anticipation the rights of any other parties, and stating why they had never asked any official sanction.\nNor can I find in the case the slightest evidence that Heney, Charlebois & Flood ever directly or indirectly sought the consent of the crown to an assignment by them, or ever intimated to the government that they had parted or desired to part with their interest in the said contract, or that the same had been assigned to Smith & Ripley, or to any other parties. All the transactions with reference to the different assignments and transfers which now appear to have taken place, so far as they actually did take place, were between the parties themselves, without the knowledge or consent of any person whomsoever authorized or empowered by the crown to give such consent. The only evidence relied on of any such consent is that of Ripley himself, which is as follows:\nQ. Did you visit Canada, and, if so, when for the purpose of taking contracts for public works? A. In September, 1878.\nQ. You came to what place? A. To Montreal.\nQ. Was any one associated with you as a railway contractor at that time? A. Yes, Mr. James N. Smith was my partner at that time.\nQ. And had been your partner for some time previously? A. Some ten years or more.\nQ. When you visited Canada did you become aware of a public contract called the Georgian Bay branch of the Pacific Railway contract? A. Yes.\nQ. Did you take any steps to obtain an interest in that contract or to obtain control of it? A. I purchased an interest at that time in the contract.\nQ. From whom? A. From Messrs. Charlebois, Flood & Co.\nQ. Is this document, now produced and fyled as suppliants' exhibit \"B,\" signed by them and by you, in connection with that contract? A. I recognize that as the contract.\nQ. Does this instrument set out the interest which you were to acquire in the contract? As. It does.\nQ. After obtaining an interest in the contract with these parties, as shown in this instrument, did you visit Ottawa? A. I did.\nQ. How long after this instrument was executed? A. I should say within thirty days: I do not remember the exact time. Q. What was your object in coming to Ottawa? A. To acquaint the government with the fact of my becoming interested in this work, more particularly to ascertain if the contract was all right and properly made.\nQ. What was your object in coming to Ottawa, and did you accomplish that object? A. I did. It was to look over the contract and see if it was made as they stated with the government, and also to acquaint the Government with the fact of my having become interested.\nQ. What member of the government did you see? A. I saw, amongst others, Mr. McKenzie, the Premier and Minister of Pubic Works.\nQ. Did you state to Mr. McKenzie what your object was and what you had done? A. I did.\nQ. What did you learn from him? A. He expressed satisfaction that we had become interested with them as he had known us previously.\nQ. Satisfaction that you had done what? A. That we had become interested in the work\u2014that there was additional capital and experience added to the contract.\nQ. He made no objection, did he? A. Not at all. I had made efforts previously to obtain work and had failed, and now I acquainted him with the fact that I had gone into the contract, and he expressed pleasure.\nQ. You had tendered, I suppose? A. Yes.\nQ. Were your tenders too high? A. in all cases.\nQ. Did anything further transpire between you with reference to it? A. Nothing that I remember at that time.\nThe witness then stated that he had seen Mr. Trudeau, the Deputy Minister of Public Works, three or four months afterwards\u2014a different season of the year.\nQ. Then, you visited Ottawa for what purpose on that occasion? A. To see the government with regard to other changes which I proposed making with regard to my partners.\nQ. What were those changes for, speaking generally? For the purpose of getting a larger interest, or what? A. Getting a larger interest so that we might make better progress with the work.\nQ. Did you see the Minister of Public Works on that occasion? A. I enquired for the Minister of Public Works and they stated that he was absent.\nQ. You mean absent from Ottawa? A. Yes, I took it so. I could not see him. Q. Who then did you see? A. I was recommended to see the Deputy Minister, Mr. Trudeau. I did see him. I was introduced, and had a conversation with regard to this work.\nQ. Did he express any opinion or give you any answer to your inquiries on behalf of the government on that occasion? Did you see him in his office? A. I did. I stated to him my views with regard to the work and what I proposed to do at that time, and he answered me that the government always took pleasure in strengthening a contract\u2014in adding strength to it (I think these were the exact terms that he used) and that they were always glad to see additional skill and capital contributed.\nQ. (By Mr. Lash.) What was his reply? A. He answered that the government were very glad to add strength to any contract that they had with any party, either by capital or skill\u2014that I would have no difficulty in satisfying the government with regard to that fact.\nQ. Had you at that time been formally recognized by the government, in the contract, by any writing? A. Not by any writing.\nQ. Were you anxious to be so recognized? A. I was. I asked Commissioner Trudeau what would be necessary for me to become recognized by the government. He stated that a simple letter from my partners, Mr. Charlebois and Mr. Flood, to the government would place me the same as themselves with the government.\nQ. And that the assent of your co-partners would be sufficient to enable the government to recognize you, or that they would recognize you? A. He made that statement\u2014yes.\nQ. Did you make any further efforts to consummate that arrangement at that time? A. I did. I spoke to Mr. Charlebois and Mr. Flood about the letter.\nQ. I am now speaking of your interview with Mr. Trudeau; what was the conclusion of that interview? Was there any definite statement as to your future relations with the government in connection with it, or any reason why he could not do so mentioned? I do not remember. I spoke to him about the stopping of the work at that time.\nQ. What did Mr. Trudeau say to you as the concluding result of your interview with him? You have stated the purposes for which you came and the conversation; what was his final statement\u2014his assurance to you as to your position? A. As I said before, that the government were very glad to strengthen their position in any contract by additional capital or skill.\nQ. And that a simple letter from your partners would\u2014what? A. That a simple letter from Mr. Charlebois and Mr. Flood, who were recognized by the government, would invest me with all the rights they had with the government. I understood him to say that distinctly.\nQ. Did the interview end there? Did you have a second interview with him or any one connected with the Department on that occasion? A. No.\nQ. What did you tell Mr. Trudeau was your specific object in coming to visit him on that occasion? A. That I had in view the buying out of these parties.\nQ. Which parties do you mean now? A. I spoke more particularly of Mr. Charlebois.\nQ. And you wished to know what? A. I wished to know if that would be satisfactory to the government, as I was not acquainted with their method of procedure.\nQ. And was it in answer to that specific statement of yours that Mr. Trudeau made the observation which you have just mentioned? A. I do not remember the words, but he gave me the impression emphatically that it would be agreeable to the government.\nThe witness speaks of a visit to Ottawa in the spring of 1879:\nQ. Did you return to the works after that visit? A. Yes.\nQ. Without anything more definite in the way of writing or contract than you have mentioned? Was there anything put in writing? A. Nothing.\nQ. After you returned to the works? A. Not that I remember.\nQ. (By the Court). Was that before your last purchase of the interest? A. Yes, that was previous to my last purchase.\nQ. You returned, then, under the impression that there was no difficulty whatever, you being strong and experienced capitalists, in securing the sanction of the government? A. Yes, I returned with that impression.\nCROSS EXAMINED.\nQ. You first visited Montreal in September, 1878? A. Yes.\nQ. Had you at that time purchased the interest in the contract? A. I purchased it at that time.\nQ. The exhibit is dated 19th September, 1878: was it before or after that you were in Montreal? A. Previous to that, I had been there several days. I think you will find the twentieth is the latter part of the contract.\nQ. You stated here \"I visited Ottawa within thirty days afterwards to acquaint the government that I had become interested in the contract.\" A. Yes. Q. You had become interested, then, before you visited Ottawa? A. Yes.\nQ. In what way did you become interested before you visited Ottawa? A. By taking a third interest with Charlebois, Flood & Co.\nQ. By this document of the 19th September? A. Yes, and assuming one-third of what they had paid out, or were supposed to have paid out.\nQ. You saw Mr. McKenzie? A. Yes.\nQ. Where did you see him? A. I saw him in the department.\nQ. In his own room? A. In his own room, as I remember, I sent in my card and was admitted.\nQ. What did you tell him? A. I had seen him previously about other work I had tendered for. He was acquainted with our firm.\nQ. What did you state to him when you saw him in his room? A. I stated to him that I had finally secured work with the government by becoming connected with this firm of Charlebois, Flood & Co.\nQ. You did not then produce any document to him? A. Not at all.\nQ. What more did you say to him? Did you tell him the particulars of your agreement with the firm? A. I do not remember all the conversation that we had.\nQ. Did you tell him the particulars of your agreement with the firm? A. I think I told him that I had taken a third interest with the firm.\nQ. Did you tell him that Mr. Smith was with you? A. I did not state that fact\u2014I presume not, I had always represented Smith & Ripley here.\nQ. What did he say in answer to that? A. He expressed satisfaction that we were to be connected with the concern; I cannot give his language.\nQ. Can you not state what he said at all? A. Simply that he was well satisfied that we had become connected with that concern from his knowledge of us.\nQ. How long did your interview with Mr. McKenzie last? A. I think not over twenty minutes or half an hour.\nQ. Was any one else present? A. I do not remember any one else being there. No.\nQ. No writings passed between you at that time? A. No writings.\nQ. You did not ask from Mr. McKenzie any letter consenting to your interest? a. No.\nQ. This was some time after the 19th September, 1878? A. Yes; I do not remember the date?\nQ. Was it in September or October? A. I have an impression it was immediately after. i have an impression it was within a few days afterwards, but I am not satisfied to swear to that.\nAs to his second visit:\nQ. And when you came to Ottawa Mr. McKenzie was not in the city? a. Not that I know of.\nQ. You did not see him on that occasion? A. No.\nQ. You saw Mr. Trudeau? A. Yes.\nQ. In his own room? A. Yes.\nQ. Was anyone present besides yourself? A. Not at the time I was talking to him.\nQ. Tell me what you first said to him? A. I could not give the words, I came for the purpose of explaining to him my position on the work there and what i was about to do.\nQ. That was the purpose you came for: tell me what you said? A. Well, I said, I talked of buying out my partners and also asked him what was necessary in order to have us recognized by the government. I entered into those matters.\nQ. You had not, at that time, bought out your partners? A. No, I had not.\nQ. You contemplated doing so? A. Yes.\nQ. And asked what was necessary to have you recognized? A. Yes.\nQ. And what did Mr. Trudeau say? A. He said very emphatically that the government never objected to strengthening a contract those were the words he used, as i remember, either by capital or skill and that he should be glad to know that the contract had been made better and stronger, and that I would have no difficulty with the government on that ground.\nQ. You did not at that time inform him of the nature of the arrangements which were to be made, of course, because you did not know what arrangements would be made? A. Except that I talked of buying them out.\nQ. But you did not tell him of the nature of the arrangement at that time? A. No.\nQ. How long, do you think, your interview with Mr. Trudeau lasted? A. I should say about an hour?\nQ. There would be a good deal said, then, during the hour? A. Yes.\nQ. Can you not tell us something more about it than what you have said? No; that was impressed, more particularly, on my mind.\nQ. Was the whole hour taken up in just stating what you have told us? A. Oh no. Q. What was the rest of the hour taken up in? A. I do not remember at all.\nQ. You do not remember what happened besides what you have stated? A. No.\nQ. Mr. Trudeau said that a simple letter from your partners would be all that was necessary\u2014necessary for what? A. To place me with the government equal to my partners\u2014to have me recognized in the contract.\nQ. A simple letter from your partners to whom? A. From Messrs. Charlebois & Flood to the government.\nQ. That would be all that would be necessary to have you recognized as a partner? A. Yes, to the contract.\nQ. Did that refer to your then position as a partner? A. Yes.\nQ. So that up to that time you had not been recognized by the government as a partner. A. Not in writing.\nQ. Was that letter sent? A. It was not\u2014not that I am aware of.\nQ. Did Mr. Trudeau tell you anything about what would be necessary in the event of your buying out your partners? A. I cannot remember distinctly but I know that he gave me to understand that I had better have my papers up with the government as soon as possible.\nQ.. What papers? A. Any new papers that I might have.\nQ. With what object were they to be sent to the government? A. In order that we might be properly placed there, in this contract.\nQ. In order that the assent of the government might be got? A. Yes.\nQ. I find that the first agreement which you signed after leaving Mr. Trudeau is dated the 16th of May, 1879. That is the agreement whereby you bought them out. Now, will that fix your mind as to the date of your interview with Mr. Trudeau? A. No.\nQ. Where was that agreement of the 16th of May signed? A. I could only tell by looking at the agreement, I see that it was drawn up and signed in Collingwood. (Document fyled as exhibit \"C-1).\"\nQ. You say that this exhibit C-1, was signed in Sandy Hill, New York state? A. Yes.\nAll this, so far from establishing a consent by the government to any assignment, shows that no application was really ever made for such consent, and that no such consent was ever given. Who were the persons to apply for this consent and to whom to be given but the contractors themselves? And if there could be any doubt that consent was ever asked for or obtained, the letter of Heney, Charlebois & flood of 13th August, 1879, before referred so, and the letter of Smith & Ripley to the Minister of Railways and Canals, dated 5th August, 1879, clearly establish no application was ever made by Heney, Charlebois & Flood, that the letter was the first and only effort made by them to obtain the consent or recognition of the crown to any assignment to them.\nIt is as follows:\u2014\nOttawa, August 5th, 1879.\nTo the Hon. the Minister of Railways and Canals:\nSir,\u2014We have the honor to inform you that we have purchased from the contractors for the \"Georgian Bay Branch\" of the Canada Pacific Railway, all their right, title and interest in said contract and in all monies and benefits payable or receivable and now accrued or to accrue thereunder and that in so far as said contractors had any power or authority to assign said contract and their interest thereunder or to substitute any other person or persons in their place with reference thereto we have been so substituted for said original contractors and have undertaken the burden and execution of said contract. The original contractors have transferred to us, as will be seen by the accompanying documents, all their respective interests in said contract and benefits thereunder, and we have been and now are engaged with a large force in the execution of the works under the contract in question. We beg to forward herewith (5) five original documents, denominated in a memo, endorsed hereon, which documents along with the assignment from Heney, one of the original contractors, to Charlebois & Flood, on file in your Department, shows clearly our title as assignees of the original contractors, and as the only parties now actually interested in the benefits of said contract, we desire to be recognized by your Department as the successors of the original contractors and to be dealt with as such by the Department, as well as to receive instructions in any matter relating to the said contract. You will observe on reference to the agreement \"B\" dated 30th June last, between Charlebois & Co. and ourselves that we undertook to replace the $20,000 cheque deposited by Charlebois & Co., as part security on said contract with your Department, by a security of our own of a similar amount satisfactory to your Department and to get the cheque deposited by Charlebois & Co. released and given up to Charlebois & Co. on or by 1st August instant. In order to carry out our agreement in reference to this matter we applied to your Department on 1st of August, for leave to substitute said security of Charlebois & Co. by security of our own for a like amount, and for the delivery up of said cheque deposited by Charlebois & Co., but we were informed in reply that no answer could be given to our request on that day. We are so far without an answer to the above request and we understand the delay is owing to some change of policy either contemplated or resolved upon by the Government in respect of the works under the contract in question. We would respectfully suggest that in the meantime the return of the security deposited by Charlebois & Co., as above mentioned, would relieve us from liability (if any) in respect of the return of said security, and also from double interest, that is to say, interest on the Charlebois cheque and our own security for a like amount which we are holding in readiness for substitution, and so far as we are concerned such return would not interfere with any future arrangements which may be in contemplation. We would request that if it is not absolutely necessary to retain the original documents sent herewith after recording them in the books of the Department, that they should be returned to us, we having no other copies.\nWe have the honor to be,\nVery respectfully yours,\nRipley, Smith & Co.\nBy A.

Heney, Charlebois & Flood.\nAnd on the 11th August, 1879, the consent is refused to Smith & Ripley, and they are notified of the cancelling of the contract.\nCopy.\nAugust 11th, 1879.\nGENTLEMEN,\nI am instructed by the Minister of Railways and Canals to acknowledge your letter of the 5th inst. with assignment to you by Messrs. Heney, Charlebois & Flood, contractors, of all their right, title and interest in their contract for the Georgian Bay branch of the Canadian Pacific Railway, and to inform you that the contract of Messrs. Heney, Charlebois & Flood had been cancelled before the receipt of your letter.\nI am also to say that by terms of their contract Messrs. Heney, Charlebois & Flood are prohibited from making such assignment without the consent of Her Majesty, and that such consent has not been given nor will be given to any assignment of the said contract.\nI have the honor to be, gentlemen,\nYour obedient servant,\n(Signed; F. H. Ennis,\nActg. Sec.\nMessrs. Smith, Ripley & Co.,\nCare of A. Ferguson, Esq., Ottawa.\nWe have seen by the letter of Heney Charlebois & Flood of 13th August, 1879, their acquiescence in such cancellation of the contract.\nIt is therefore abundantly clear, to my mind, that Smith & Ripley have not and never had any contract whatever with the Queen, nor is there the slightest evidence of any privity of contract between the suppliants Smith & Ripley, and the Crown, nor have Smith & Ripley established any claim against Her Majesty, that this or any other court can recognize; for, to my mind, it is impossible to conceive upon what principle Smith & Ripley can maintain an action against the Crown for plant and materials supplied by them to carry out in the future a contract of Heney, Charlebois & Flood with the Crown, or for anticipated profits by reason of a breach of that contract on the part of the Crown (assuming there has been any such breach). It is clear that at the time the first notice was given, though the government profess to act under the clauses of the agreement relating to the progress of the work which they could not sustain, still a good cause existed to justify the notice; but in this case it is not necessary to inquire whether, though the motive of the government in putting an end to the contract might be because they had determined not to proceed with the work, they could not now rely on a good, though different cause existing at the time, as in the case of a master dismissing his servant, when it is immaterial whether or not it was the best cause of dismissal, for if a good cause existed, though unknown to the master at the time, he would be justified; or as also in the case of a distress where a man may distrain for one cause and avow for another. For in this case, immediately after the notice of the 9th August, 1879, when knowledge of the assignment comes to the government for the first time through the Minister of Railways, the government immediately act and refuse consent, and notify Smith & Ripley that they had put an end to the contract; so that if the first order in council and notice did not do so, this last clearly did; but the original contractors, as has been shown by their letter, appear to have readily assented to a putting an end to the contract, and this equally cuts down and destroys any claim of Heney, Charlebois & Flood, and, indeed, the letter of the 13th August, 1879, assumes the right of the government to stop the work and repudiates anything like the claim now put forward by Smith & Ripley, and which the judgment appealed from adjudges to them, viz., $171,000, for they say\u2014\nShould there be a failure of full compliance to your order by the parties temporarily in charge of the work on account of certain efforts to negotiate with us for the entire control of said work, we would hereby inform and notify you that such negotiations were never completed nor deemed sufficient or likely to become so, to cause us to ask your official sanction thereto.\nThere is no pretence for saying there was any outlay made for preparing to do the work by Heney, Charlebois & Flood, nor do they claim any by their petition, any such outlay is alleged to have been made by Smith & Ripley, which neither Heney, Charlebois & Flood, nor Ripley & Smith can recover\u2014the former, because they did not make the outlay, and under the terms of the contract, after its termination, they cannot recover, if they had; and the latter, for the simple reason that they had no contract with the Queen, justifying the outlay.\nThe case of Robson and Sharpe v. Drummond[21], shows that without any express stipulation, where a contract is a personal one, and one of the parties has by selling his interest in the contract and assigning it to another party become incapable of performing his part of it, the other party to the contract may on that ground treat the agreement as at an end.\nA., a coach maker, entered into an agreement to furnish B with a carriage, for the term of five years, at seventy-five guineas a year. At the time of making the contract, C. was a partner with A., but this was unknown to B., the business being carried on in the name of A. only. Before the expiration of the first three years the partnership between A. and C. was dissolved, A. having assigned all his interest in the business, and in the contract in question to C., and the business was afterwards carried on by C. alone. B. was informed by C, that the partnership was dissolved, and that he (C) had become the purchaser of the carriage then in his (B's) service. The latter answered that he would not continue the contract with C., and that he would return the carriage to him at the end of the then current year, and he did so return it. An action having been brought in the names of A. and C. against B., for the two payments which, according to the term of contract, would become due during the last two years of its continuance, it was held, that the action was not maintainable, the contract being personal, and A. having transferred his interest to C., and having become incapable of per forming his part of the agreement.\nLord Tenterden, C.J.: \u2014\nHere, after the partnership between Robson & Sharpe had ceased to exist, and after Sharpe had ceased to carry on the business of a coach maker, the defendant offered to continue the job with Sharpe, but he replied that that was impossible. Now the defendant may have been induced to enter into this contract by reason of the personal confidence which he reposed in Sharpe, and therefore agreed to pay money in advance. The latter, therefore, having said it was impossible for him to perform the contract, the defendant had a right to object to its being performed by any other person, and to say that he contracted with Sharpe alone, and not with any other person.\nLittledale, J.:\u2014\nI think this contract was personal, and that Sharpe having gone out of the business, it was competent to the defendant to consider the agreement at an end. He may have been induced to enter into the contract by reason of the confidence he reposed in Sharpe; and at all events had a right to his services in the execution of it.\n* * * * * *\nParke, J.:\u2014\nThis appears to me to be a very clear case. The defendant made his contract with Sharpe by name, and not knowing that any other person had an interest in the subject-matter; and although Robson had an interest in it so as to entitle him to sue jointly with Sharpe, the defendant has the same rights against Sharpe and his partner, and may make the same defence to this action brought by them as if he had contracted with Sharpe alone, and the action had been brought by him. The contract was to continue for five years. At the end of the third year there was a dissolution of partnership between Sharpe and Robson, and notice of that dissolution, and of Sharpe having assigned all his interest in the contract to Bobson, was given to the defendant, who said he would not continue the contract with Bobson. The very fact of Sharpens having transferred his interest in the contract to Bobson (a mere stranger as far as the defendant was concerned) was equivalent to saying (that which he did afterwards say) \"I will not perform my part of the contract;\" and that is an answer to the present action brought in the names of Sharpe and Bobson; for the defendant had a right to have the benefit of the judgment and taste of Sharpe to the end of the contract, and which, in effect, he has declined to supply. It is true that the defendant will have an advantage which he would not have had if the contract had continued for the whole five years; for he will have had the use of the carriage during the first three, and will not be bound to keep it during the last two, when it must be worse for wear; but this arises from the default of one of the plaintiffs in not performing his part of the contract.\nPatteson, J.:\nThis case appears to me to admit of no doubt. It is, in substance, a case where a person having made a contract in his own name, attempts to back out of it, and transfer it to a third person. That he had no right to do. The rule for setting aside the nonsuit must be discharged.\nUnder these circumstances I think Smith & Ripley have no locus standi whatever before this court, and therefore this petition should be dismissed. As to Heney, Charlebois & Flood, all they could reasonably ask from the favour of the Crown would be for the amount of work they had done up to the time when the contract was put an end to, and that, I understand, the Crown were willing to allow, and which I hope the Government will not now refuse.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nApart altogether from any objection founded on the 17th clause of the contract, it is plain, on elementary principles of the law relating to contracts, that the suppliants Smith & Ripley are not entitled to recover damages against the Crown for any breach of contract, for the simple reason that no contract ever existed between them and the Crown, unless indeed the evidence shews such an assent on the part of the Crown to their substitution for the original contractors Heney, Charlebois & Flood as was sufficient to constitute a new contract.\nThat a party who enters into a contract for the performance of work is not entitled by a mere assignment to another person to substitute the assignee for himself, so as to delegate to the assignee his own rights and liabilities under the contract, without the consent of the other party to the agreement, is a proposition of law so well established that it requires scarcely any authority to support it. In such a case there is no privity of contract\u2014no contractual relation of any kind\u2014between the assignee and the party for whom the work is to be performed. I will, however, refer to one or two cases which place the law on this head beyond dispute.\nIn the case of Schmaling v. Thomlinson[22], the defendants had employed Aldibert, Becker & Co. to transport goods to a foreign market, who, without the assent of the defendants, delegated the employment to the plaintiff, and the latter having, without the privity of the defendants performed the service contracted for, sued the defendants for the payment of the money which the defendants, had contracted to pay Aldibert, Becker & Co. It was held by the Court of Common Pleas that, there being no privity between the parties, the action would not lie, Gibbs, C.J., saying that the defendants looked to Aldibert, Becker & Co. only for the performance of the work, and Aldibert, Becker & Co. had a right to look to the defendants for payment, and no one else had that right. In the case of Cull v. Backhouse[23] Lord Kenyon, at nisi prius, on a similar state of facts, determined the law in precisely the same way.\nIn Robson v. Drummond[24], A. and B. were partners as coachmakers. C., who knew nothing of B., entered into a contract with A. for the hire of a carriage for five years at so much a year, and A. undertook to keep the carriage in proper order for the whole five years. Before the five years were out, A. and B. dissolved partnership, and A. assigned the carriage and the benefit of the contract relating to it to B. B. gave C. notice of the dissolution and arrangement respecting the carriage, but C. declined to continue the contract with B., and returned the carriage. An action was then brought by A. and B. against C. for not performing the contract, but it was held that the action would not lie, the contract having been with A. alone, to be performed by him personally, and he having disabled himself from continuing to perform it on his part.\nThis doctrine is a necessary consequence of the essential principle of all contracts that a man cannot be made liable ex contractu without his assent, and, as I have said, it is not in any way dependent on such a stipulation as that embodied in the 17th clause of the contract in the present case, since, without any express provision to the contrary, one contracting party has no right to delegate the obligations arising out of a contract made with him personally to another to whom he may think fit to transfer them. But the contract in the present case places the matter beyond all doubt or question, if doubt or question could be possible in so plain a case, by distinctly expressing in the 17th clause what the law would without it have implied.\nNext arises the question, is there evidence of assent on the part of the Crown to the delegation which the original contractors have assumed to make to the suppliants Smith & Ripley, or, in other words, does the evidence establish that there was a novation, a new contract, by which the Crown accepted Smith & Ripley in lieu of the original contractors and entered into a similar contract with them?\nThe elements necessary to constitute novation are thus stated by Mr. Pollock in his work on Contracts[25]:\nAnother branch of the same general doctrine which on principle is scarcely less obvious, is that the debtor cannot be allowed to substitute another's liability to his own without the creditor's assent. Some authorities which illustrate this are referred to in a subsequent chapter where we consider, from another point of view, the rule that a contract cannot be made except with the person with whom one intends to contract. When a creditor assents at the debtor's request to accept another person as his debtor in the place of the first, this is called a novation. Whether there has been a novation in any particular case is a question of fact, but assent to a novation is not to be inferred from conduct, unless there has been a distinct and unambiguous request.\nLord Selborne, L. C., in Scarf v. Jardine[26] thus describes novation:\u2014\nIn the court of first instance the case was treated really as one of what is called \"novation,\" which, as I understand it, means this\u2014the term being derived from the Civil Law\u2014that there being a contract in existence, some new contract is substituted for it, either between the same parties (for that might be) or between different parties; the consideration mutually being the discharge of the old contract.\nHas it then been sufficiently proved that the Crown ever assented to the substitution of Smith & Ripley for the original contractors, and the discharge of the latter from the liabilities which they had undertaken by the contract? The only evidence which can be pointed to as affording the slightest foundation for such a proposition is that contained in the testimony of Mr. Ripley, one of the suppliants, who refers to two conversations which he had at Ottawa, one with Mr. McKenzie, the then Minister of Public Works, and the other with Mr. Trudeau, the Deputy Minister of that department. The first of these conversations with Mr. McKenzie is alleged to have occurred in September, 1878, and what passed between Mr. Ripley and Mr. McKenzie is thus stated by the former. After Mr. Ripley had said that he called on Mr. McKenzie at the department, and there saw him in his own room, the evidence proceeds thus:\u2014\nQ. What did you state to him when you saw him in his own room? A. I stated to him that I had finally secured work with the government by becoming connected with this firm of Charlelois, Flood & Co.\nQ. You did not then produce any document to him? A. Not at all.\nQ. What more did you say to him? Did you tell him the particulars of your agreement with the firm? A. I do not remember all the conversation we had.\nQ. Did you tell him the particulars of your agreement with the firm? A. I think I told him I had taken a third interest with the firm.\nQ. Did you tell him that Mr. Smith was with you? A. I did not state that fact. I presume not. I had always represented Smith & Ripley here.\nQ. What did he say in answer to that? A. He expressed satisfaction that we were to be connected with the concern. I cannot give his language.\nQ. Can you state what he said at all? A. Simply that he was well satisfied that we had become connected with that concern from his long knowledge of us.\nNow, assuming for the present that Mr. McKenzie had power to bind the Crown by a mere verbal assent, there is clearly not sufficient in this evidence to establish the fact of a novation, that is, a consent by the Crown to a delegation by Heney, Charlebois & Flood to Ripley & Smith of their rights and liabilities under the contract entered into by them on the 2nd August, 1878. In point of fact, Messrs. Ripley & Smith did not acquire a complete assignment of the whole interest in the contract in respect of which they now sue until some months afterwards, and it was impossible that, at the date of this conversation, Mr McKenzie could have assented to an arrangement which was not even proposed or suggested to him. Moreover, even had this conversation been subsequent to the final assignment of the contract by Heney, Charlebois & Flood, and had the Minister had authority to waive the rights of the Crown under the contract by a mere verbal assent, there is nothing to show that he ever intended to do so. It is not proved that the clause against the assignment was brought to Mr. McKenzie's notice, or that it was present to his mind, and before we could determine that there was either novation or waiver, we should have to be satisfied of this. In truth the evidence only shows that Mr. McKenzie received the information communicated to him by Mr. Ripley, that his firm had become interested in the contract, by some expression of common courtesy, and altogether falls short of showing that he intended by it to assume the responsibility of altering a solemn contract with the Crown, which had been entered into under the seal of the department and with the sanction of the Governor in Council.\nThe conversation with Mr. Trudeau took place in the spring of 1879. It is said that Mr. Trudeau, who was the Deputy of the Minister of Public Works, had power to bind the Crown under the provisions contained in the 4th section of the Public Works Act, 31 Vic. ch 12. That section is in these words:\u2014\nIt shall be the duty of the said deputy, and he shall have authority (subject always to the Minister) to oversee and direct the other officers and servants of the department; he shall have the general control of the business of the Department, and such other powers and duties which may be assigned to him by the Governor in Council, and in the absence of the Minister and during such absence, may suspend from his duties any officer or servant of the department who refuses or neglects to obey his directions as such deputy.\nI am at a loss to conceive upon what construction of this clause it is contended that Mr. Trudeau, as Deputy of the Minister, has authority to enter into any verbal contracts binding on the Crown, or to alter by verbal agreement solemn formal contracts in writing entered into by the Minister under the official seal of the department, and authorized by order of the Governor in Council. There is no suggestion that any such power has ever been conferred on him by the Governor in Council. The authority to oversee and direct the officers, and to control the general business of the department, is to be subject to the directions of the Minister, and without that condition would be insufficient to empower him to bind the Crown by verbal contracts. The additional powers given to him to act in the Minister's absence are confined to the suspension of officers and servants. It is, therefore, out of the question to say that the Crown could in any way be affected by what Mr. Trudeau may have thought fit to assent to in derogation of the rights of the Crown derived under a formal contract entered into under the seal of the department, and approved by the Governor in Council, at a time, too, when for all that appears to the contrary the Minister of Public Works was present at the seat of government, and possibly in the department itself at the very time this conversation took place.\nBut a conclusive answer to the argument that there was novation founded on any verbal assent, either by the Minister, or the Deputy Minister, is afforded by the 7th section of the Public Works Act. That clause is as follows:\nNo deeds, contracts, documents, or writings, shall be deemed to be binding upon the department, or shall be held to be acts of the said Minister unless signed and sealed by him or his Deputy and countersigned by the secretary. If, therefore, the Minister of Public Works for the time being had written a letter expressly assenting to a substitution of Messrs. Ripley & Smith in the place of the original contractors, it would, by the express terms of this enactment, have been wholly ineffectual to bind the Crown, or to alter the rights or liabilities of the Crown, or the original contractors, under the formal contract.\nAs already stated, an assignment of the contract implies a novation, and novation means a new contract. Then, if such a new contract could not be validly entered into, so as to bind the Crown, by a writing under the signature of the Minister, it is surely idle to contend that an oral agreement of the Minister could have that effect. It is true the 17th clause of the contract implies (for it does not distinctly express it) that there might be an assignment by consent. There was no need for such a provision, for, of course, parties may always by consent alter and rescind their contracts; but although I am at present discussing the case on the general rules of the law of contracts without reference to the 17th clause, I think it right to refer to it here to point out that it does not contain any sanction or recognition of a mere verbal consent to be given by the Minister. The contract was entered into under the authority of the Public Works Act and was executed according to the requirements of that act, and it was beyond the powers of the Minister to provide, even by an explicit stipulation to that effect, that it should be in his power to supersede it by another contract executed without the formalities prescribed by the 7th section of the act. The consent referred to in the 17th clause of the contract must, therefore, mean a consent in writing executed in conformity with the law, and not the mere verbal assent of the Minister, which, in the face of the statute, could have been of no avail, even if the contract had expressly stipulated it should be sufficient.\nI am, therefore, of opinion that on the general principles of law applicable to all contracts, and without reference to the 17th clause, the Crown is right in saying that it never entered into any contract with Messrs. Ripley & Smith, and never came under any liability or obligation to them, and that the petition of right, so far as it is the petition of the last named suppliants, wholly fails.\nThe original contractors, Messrs. Heney, Charlebois & Flood, have however been joined in the petition of right as co-suppliants with Messrs. Ripley & Smith, and even though it appears that the latter may be entitled to no relief, yet if the former can make out a right to recover damages, they are entitled to maintain the petition notwithstanding the joinder of the other suppliants having no interest. We have, therefore, next to enquire if a case is made entitling the original contractors to damages. I am of opinion that the answer to this enquiry must also be in favor of the Crown, and that the objections to the petition, regarding it as the suit of Heney, Charlebois & Flood exclusively, are quite as insurmountable as those which apply to the case made by the other petitioners. Had it not been for the 17th clause of the contract there would have been grounds for saying that the original contractors might have called upon the court to treat the assignment as in the nature of a sub-contract, and to have awarded them damages, upon the same principles as would have applied had they proceeded with the work personally. The general rule for the performance of contracts for work, such as that which is the subject of the contract in the present case, is that in the absence of any stipulation against assignments or sub-contracts, it may be performed by the agency of sub-contractors. If, indeed, it appears that the personal skill or taste of the contractor for the performance of the work has entered into the consideration of the other party, or that he has been chosen for some other personal qualification, he must perform the contract personally. But in building and railway contracts such a delectus person\u00e6 is not presumed, and the substitution of a sub-contractor is, in the case of there being no stipulation to the contrary, considered unobjectionable. This is well shewn by the case of Lea v. British Waggon Co.[27], where it was held that a contract by a waggon company to furnish waggons for a term of years might be assigned to another company, and that on the performance of the contract, the original company, jointly with the assignee company, were entitled to recover the contract price. This decision, as is explained by Cockburn, C. J., in his judgment, proceeded upon the ground that in the absence of any special provision against assignment, it was to be presumed from the nature of the contract that actual performance by the first company was not contemplated.\nThe contractors in the present case are, however, expressly excluded from the right to perform the contract through the medium of assignees or sub-contractors by the 17th clause of the contract, which, as already shewn, in the observations before made on the question of novation, has never been effectually waived or dispensed with, and they are therefore precluded from recovering under the contract, unless they can show personal performance, and this, upon the evidence, is, of course, entirely out of the question.\nThen it does not appear that these suppliants have suffered any substantial loss from the refusal of the Crown to proceed with the contract which entitles them to damages The damages awarded by the judgment appealed from were made up of the value of work actually performed, the loss on the plant provided for the work and the loss of prospective profits, and I quite agree that, if in other respects the suppliants Smith & Ripley had been entitled to recover, the measure of damages adopted by the Exchequer Court was a correct one. But in respect of none of these items of damage can the original contractors pretend to have any right to recover. The work on the contract was not done by them, but by Ripley & Smith, or by the original contractors and several other persons whom they took into partnership with them immediately after the execution of the contract, and who are not before the court as parties to the petition of right, and for this work Messrs. Heney, Charlebois & Flood have been fully indemnified by the money which they received in consideration of the transfer of the contract by them to the other suppliants. As regards the plant, none of it belonged to them, it was the exclusive property of Messrs. Smith & Ripley, who were alone damnified by the loss resulting from its being re-sold or rendered useless by the refusal of the Crown to proceed with the contract. And for the loss of prospective profits, it is clear they can have no claim, since all right to these profits had been absolutely relinquished by them in favor of the assignees of the contract.\nAnother and distinct ground upon which the original contractors must be considered as incapacitated from claiming damages from the Crown is that they had themselves, by the assignment of the contract, voluntarily put it out of their power to proceed to perform their part of the obligations created by it. They could only entitle themselves to damages from the Crown by showing that they were personally ready and willing to proceed in the performance of the contract on their part. Then how can it be said that they have brought themselves within this indispensable condition and shown a readiness and willingness to carry out the contract, when they have entirely abandoned it to other persons.\nAgain, the 17th clause of the contract authorized the Crown, in the event, which had occurred, of an assignment by the original contractors, to rescind the contract absolutely, for, although rescission is not in terms provided for, such is beyond all doubt or question the legal effect of the stipulation on behalf of the Crown contained in that clause; and the order of the Governor in Council of the 14th August, 1879, passed pursuant to its terms, operated as a rescission accordingly. By this clause it was expressly provided, not merely that the Crown should, in the event of an assignment, have power to take the work out of the contractors' hands, but also that, in that case, the contractors should be entitled to no further payments in respect of work actually performed, and further, it was provided that the contractors' plant employed on the work should be liable to be forfeited to the Crown. The Order in Council of the 14th of August, 1879, therefore affords a conclusive answer to any claim for recovery in respect of the three heads under which the damages awarded by the judgment of the Exchequer Court are distributed\u2014the value of work actually done, the loss of prospective profits, and the reduced value of the plant.\nLastly, there can be no right on the part of the original contractors to recover as upon an implied contract for the value of any work actually done by them arising from the benefit accruing to the Crown from work so performed; the case in this respect is exactly analogous to work done under a building contract which has been broken and abandoned by the default of the builder; in that case it has been distinctly held, and is settled law, that the possession of the land does not warrant an inference of acceptance so as to give rise to an implied promise by the landowner to pay on a quantum meruit, without some proof of positive assent or acquiescence[28]. These cases are undistinguishable in all respects from the present in point of law, and it cannot be pretended there ever has been any actual assent or promise by the Crown to pay for any work left on the ground by the original contractors Moreover, the 17th clause by its express terms excludes any such pretence of an implied contract arising from the retention of the work by the government.\nThe case made by the petition of right is not that the contract had been absolutely assigned to. Messrs. Smith & Ripley, but that the moneys to become payable under it had alone been so assigned, thus stating it as the case of an equitable assignment only of the payments to arise from the performance of the work by the original contractors. Had the proof borne out this case, and had it appeared that the assignment was so limited, the suppliants would have been undoubtedly entitled to recover in respect of work actually performed by the original contractors, for such an equitable assignment would have been entirely free from objection, either upon the general law, or upon any provision contained in the contract, and the record would have been properly framed for relief upon such a state of facts. The evidence, however, has disclosed that the assignment made was in fact of a totally different character.\nThe appeal must be allowed with cost, the judgment of the Exchequer Court reversed, and the petition of right dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER, J.:\u2014\nThis is an appeal from a judgment of the Exchequer Court by which the suppliants, J. N. Smith and J. D. Ripley, were awarded $171,040.77 damages in consequence of the cancellation of the contract for the building and construction of that portion of the Canadian Pacific Railway, known as the Georgian Bay Branch.\nBy the agreement entered into by three of the suppliants, namely, John Heney, Alphonse Charlebois and Thomas Flood, on the 2nd of August, 1878, with Her Majesty the Queen, represented by the Minister of Public Works of Canada, the said Heney, Charlebois and Flood agreed and contracted to perform the works \"of excavation, grading, bridging, fencing, track-laying and ballasting\" of said Georgian Bay Branch Railway, in consideration of the fixed prices for said works as provided in the 24th clause of the agreement, and amounting to a total sum of $850,000. The works were to be performed as set out in the specifications, plans and drawings annexed to said contract, and the contractors were to fully complete the respective portions of such works and deliver them to Her Majesty on or before 1st July, 1880. The original contractors, for the purpose of being able to prosecute the works with greater vigor, and to assist them pecuniarily in purchasing the necessary supplies, associated with themselves in said contract other parties, and caused the works to be proceeded with and preparations to be made for the further prosetion thereof, and expended large sums of money, and while the work was so being proceeded with, several progress estimates, as provided by the contract, were made in favor of the said original contractors.\nOn the 30th June, 1879, the suppliants Smith & Ripley, who had made the largest advances on said works, took a transfer from all the parties to the said contract of all their interest, \"subject to the terms set out in the \"said contract and in the said several assignments thereof;\" and previous to this transfer and immediately after the said Smith & Ripley in their behalf as well as in that of the original contractors incurred large expenditure in respect of the construction of steam mills, houses and preparations for future works, and prosecuted the works vigorously and employed a large number of men. They had also made arrangements to complete the works within the time prescribed for the completion of the works by the contract, and had offered to the government good and valid security instead of that given by Heney, Charlebois & Flood, when the latter on the 12th August, 1879, received a notice from the Department of Public Works that the contract had been cancelled and annulled. The petition of right in this case is brought in the name of the original contractors as well as that of Messrs. Smith & Ripley, who had acquired the sole interest in the contract by the indenture of the 30th June, 1879, subject to the terms of the contract.\nThe first prayer of the petition is as follows:\u2014\n1. That it may be declared that the said contractors and your other suppliants claiming through or under them were entitled upon the cancellation of said contract by your Majesty to be paid by your Majesty all damages arising directly or indirectly in consequence of the cancellation of said contract such as are set forth and referred to in the tenth and eleventh paragraphs of this petition, and also for all profits which they, the said contractors, and your other suppliants claiming under them, were prevented from earning and deriving in respect of the works contemplated to be done under said contract and material therefor, and which were lost to them by reason of the cancellation thereof, and to interest upon both damages and profits.\nIn answer to the suppliants Heney, Charlebois & Flood's claim, the Crown sets up that the contract has been cancelled, because they have assigned it to suppliants Smith & Ripley in violation of the provisions of the seventeenth clause of the contract; 2nd, because they did not proceed diligently with the work, and were unable to complete it; 3rd, that the notice given by the Government of the cancellation of the contract was not a breach of the contract; 4th, without admitting any liability to the said contractors, that they had tendered them the sum of $13,807.94, provided the same should be accepted in full of all claims and demands against Her Majesty in respect of the said contract.\nIn answer to the suppliants Smith & Ripley's claim, the Crown alleges that they can be in no better position than the contractors who assigned to them; that the said suppliants have no claim against the Crown under the transfer, because the Crown has refused to consent to such an assignment; if they have acquired any rights under said transfer, they have been forfeited by the cancellation of the contract.\nAdmitting that the suppliants Smith & Ripley are not entitled to recover by petition of right the moneys sought to be recovered by them, because the Crown has not consented, as provided for in the 17th clause of the contract, to the assignment of the said contract by the original contractors to said suppliants Smith & Ripley, are not the original contractors, also suppliants, entitled to recover, and should not the first prayer of the petition be granted?\nThe 17th clause of the contract, which is relied upon by the Crown is as follows:\n17. The contractors shall not make any assignment of this contract, or any sub-contract, for the execution of any of the works hereby contracted for; and in any event no such assignment or sub-contract, even though consented to, shall exonerate the contractors from liability, under this contract, for the due performance of all the works hereby contracted for. In the event of any such assignment or sub-contract being made, then the contractors shall not have or make any claim or demand upon Her Majesty for any future payments under this contract for any further or greater sum or sums than the sum or sums respectively at which the work or works so assigned or sub-contracted for shall have been undertaken to be executed by the assignee or sub contractor; and in the event of any such assignment or sub-contract being made without such consent, Her Majesty may take the work out of the contractors' hands, and employ such means as she may see fit to complete the same; and in such case the contractors shall have no claim for any further payment in respect of the works performed, but shall nevertheless remain liable for all loss and damage which may be suffered by Her Majesty by reason of the non-completion by the contractor of the works; and all materials and things whatsoever, and all horses, machinery, and other plant provided by them for the purposes of the works, shall remain and be considered as the property of Her Majesty for the purposes and according to the provisions and conditions contained in the twelfth clause hereof,\nNow, in order to construe this clause correctly, it is necessary that we should read it very attentively to ascertain what was the real intention of the contracting parties, and the effect which should be given to it.\nIt first contains a stipulation that there shall be no assignment of contract or sub-contract of the work to be performed. \"The contractor shall not make any assignment of this contract, or any sub-contract, for the execution of any of the works hereby contracted for.\" What penalties have been stipulated in reference to this provision? There are several, but nowhere can I discover that the contract shall be cancelled for having been assigned. One of the penalties provided is that the contractors, in the case of an assignment, even with the consent of the government, shall not be exonerated from liability: \"And in any event, no such assignment or sub-contract, even though consented to, shall exonerate the contractors from liability, under this contract, for the due performance of all works hereby contracted for.\"\nThen it is provided that there shall be no claim for the payment of any further sums than the one stipulated in the assignment. \"In the event of any such assignment or sub-contract being made, then the contractors shall not prove or make any claim or demand upon Her Majesty for any future payments under this contract for any further or greater sums than the sum or sums respectively at which the work or works so assigned or sub-contracted for shall have been undertaken to be executed by the assignee or sub-contractor.\" This portion of the clause cannot be said, any more than the first part, to provide for the cancellation of the contract in the event of an assignment of the contract or the giving of a sub-contract.\nTo my mind it is conclusive that the government, knowing that transfers and assignments and sub-contracts were inevitable, took the necessary precautions in order that the due performance of the work should not suffer thereby. It was well known by experience that large public works cannot be completed by the original contractors themselves, and that they must get the services of other contractors to perform certain portions of the work. There is such a variety of work to be performed in the building of a railroad that it must be difficult to find a contractor who can perform all these works. It would almost be necessary for him to be a man proficient in all trades. For this reason, when there is masonry to be done, he will sub-contract with a mason, and if he has stations to put up, he will employ a carpenter or master builder, and thus with the different and varied works which have to be done in completing a railway.\nThe Government has admitted this necessity, but, in order to avoid all inconvenience, has stipulated that in cases of assignments or sub-contracts the Government should only deal with the original contractors. Thus there is a provision, that the contractors shall not be exonerated from liability; that the contractors shall not receive more for the work done than what they get it done for, and this was no doubt in order to prevent parties tendering for public works with the view of speculating by assigning the contract. These provisions therefore, instead of providing for the cancellation of the contract, have, in reality, admitted that transfers and sub-contracts would necessarily take place, and have declared what would be the consequences of such transfers.\nThe 17th clause contains a third and last stipulation in reference to the assignment of the contract, or a subcontract being made, without such consent, and that is, that Her Majesty may take the works out of the contractors' hands (not cancel the contract), and employ such means as she may see fit to complete the same. And in such a case the contractors shall have no claim for further payment, but shall nevertheless remain liable for loss and damage which may be suffered by Her Majesty by reason of the non-completion of the contract. This is certainly not a stipulation that the contract shall be put an end to and cancelled, in the event of an assignment, or of a sub-contract being given subject to the terms of the contract, one of which is the consent of the Government, without having obtained the previous consent of the Government. Then can it be said this option was given to the Government in order that they might arbitrarily cancel the contract, and stop the construction of a public work which had been ordered by statute? For it must be here remarked, that in construing this clause of the contract, this court must take judicial notice of the statute authorizing the construction of this public work, viz.: 37 Vic., ch. 14, and that this branch railway formed part of the Canadian Pacific Railway, and that the only power which was left with the governor in council, after the work had once commenced in reference to this branch of the Canadian Pacific Railway, was to suspend the progress of the work until the then next session. The sections relating to this work are the following:\n37 Vic. ch. 14, sec. 13:\nThe branch railways shall be constructed as follows, that is to say: That section of the first branch extending from the eastern terminus of the first section of the said railway to some point on the Georgian Bay to be fixed as aforesaid, &c., under such contract as may be agreed upon and sanctioned by the Governor in Council.\nSec. 20:\nThe Governor in Council shall have the power to suspend the progress of the work until the then next session of parliament.\nThe option of taking the work out of the hands of the contractors was evidently inserted with the intention of giving to the government and the public further security that the works would be completed with all possible despatch.\nTherefore, if the works are to be taken out of the hands of the contractors at all, after they have given good and satisfactory security for their due completion, it can only be for the purpose \"of employing such means as the Crown may see fit to complete the same,\" and not with the intention of stopping the work altogether.\nThe proper construction to be put on this seventeenth clause, is, in my opinion\u20141st. That the prohibition to assign the contract, or give sub-contracts, is not absolute, but is restricted or qualified as I have stated; 2nd. That in such a case the contractors are not exonerated from liability for the due performance of all the works contracted for; 3rd. That the contractors are not entitled to receive any further or greater sum from the government than they agreed to pay their assignees or sub-contractors; 4th. That Her Majesty may take the works out of the hands of the contractors and complete the same. No words in this clause give Her Majesty the arbitrary right of taking the works out of the hands of the contractors and to cancel the contract. To take the works out of the hands of the contractors and stop the construction of work for other public or private reasons than those provided for, would be contrary both to the spirit and letter of the contract as well as of the statute authorizing the construction of said work. Although adopting this view of the contract, I have no hesitation in saying that the suppliants Smith & Ripley, having taken an assignment subject to the terms and conditions of the contract, one of which was that the consent of the government should be obtained, and another that the security given by the original contractors Heney, Charlebois & Flood, for the due performance of the works, should be replaced by their own security, did all in their power to comply with their agreement. They were led to believe by the principal officers of the department, as well as by the engineer in charge of the works, that the consent of the Crown had been given. Under these circumstances it was not unreasonable for them to think that privity of contract between Her Majesty and themselves existed, but the Crown having denied the giving of said consent, and there being no legal evidence of such consent I must come to the conclusion that no assignment binding on the Crown has been effected. The condition of obtaining the consent of the Crown having failed the transfer must be considered as void and of no effect. The parties thereto are in consequence reinstated in the position in which they stood before such transfer. The contract, therefore, must be considered as having always been and as being still in force, and the original contractors as entitled, not only to be paid for the works done by them selves, but also the price and value of those executed by Smith & Ripley in their stead. At the time of the stoppage of the works and cancellation of the contract, the work was being proceeded with vigorously in accordance with the plans and specifications, and under the direction of the government by the Messrs. Smith & Ripley for and on behalf of the original contractors. This stoppage has not been justified either by the contract or by the evidence of any neglect on behalf of the contractors, and must be treated as a breach of contract on the part of Her Majesty.\nAfter a careful perusal of the evidence I think the amount awarded by the learned judge of the Exchequer Court for work done and received by the government for the benefit of the people of Canada, and also the amount of damages should be paid to the suppliants Messrs. Heney, Charlebois & Flood. The judgment appealed from should, therefore, be varied by awarding the amount to the suppliants Heney, Charlebois & Flood, contractors, reserving to the other suppliants Messrs. Smith & Ripley whatever legal rights they may have against the original contractors under the transfers made to them.\nHENRY, J.:\nHaving given judgment in this case in the Exchequer Court, I have very little to add. The law which has been propounded by the Chief Justice and my brother Strong as to contracts I have never for a moment doubted, but as regards novation I think the evidence in this case was such as would be a proper question of fact to be left to a jury to ascertain whether or not the Department knew of this transfer, had acted on it, and by its action adopted it. It is in evidence, that the head of the department under which this public work was being constructed knew that, after a certain date, the suppliants, Smith and Ripley, were doing all the work; it was known by the chief engineer, under whose immediate direction the works were being carried on; and it is in evidence that it was officially communicated by him to the department, and he, with the knowledge and sanction of the department, continued to superintend the works done by them. Under these circumstances, the law would assume, if such an assumption was necessary, that what was known to these officials was known to the Government. It was perfectly well known that Smith and Ripley were carrying on the works, and although there is no express agreement in writing to show that they had been adopted by the Government as the contractors of that public work, still there is sufficient evidence in the case for a jury to assume that the Government not only knew of the transfer but had adopted it.\nIt is true one man cannot assign work which he has contracted to perform to another man without the consent of the party with whom he has contracted, but if A. transfer to B. work he has contracted to do for C. and C., having been informed of it, allows B. to complete and finish the work A. contracted to do, and makes payment to B. on account of work done by him, would not C. be estopped from saying: \"I have never consented to this transfer, and will not pay B or A.?\" This was exactly the point in this case, and I think that not only law but common sense tells us that in such a case the party is estopped.\nThen the question has been raised as to whether there ever has been an assignment? It must be admitted that no legal transfer could be made without the assent of the government, but if it was withheld, then the original contract remains in force. How, then, do these parties stand? Instead of Heney, Charlebois & Flood doing the work, it was done for them by Smith & Ripley, with the knowledge of the department; for it is in evidence that they knew that Messrs. Smith & Ripley's plant, machinery, supplies, &c., were being put on the ground and the work being done by them. The department must either say, \"we have withheld our assent, and Smith & Ripley are but sub-contractors,\" or we adopt the transfer. It cannot lie in the month of the department to say two things. First, to the suppliants, Smith & Ripley, \"the contract has not been legally transferred, therefore you have no claim;\" second, to the suppliants, Heney, Charlebois & Co., \"you have assigned without our consent, therefore you have no claim.\"\nWould such a defence be considered honorable on the part of an individual? Would a jury say to a defendant, \"you have allowed this work to \"be done, you have accepted it as far as it was \"performed, but you need not pay for it?\" Such a finding could not be sustained, nor would you find a jury so to decide. The contract was not to be affected by an order in council to the extent contended for. The contract was with Her Majesty, represented by the Minister of Public Works. It was with him, as such representative, that the contractor had to deal, and not immediately with the government.\nMy brother Strong has expressed the opinion that the consent of the Minister to the assignment could only be valid when under seal. The order in council authorized the Minister of Public Works to make the contract, and in that contract all I find is that it shall not be assigned without the consent (it does not say in writing) of the Government. It therefore cannot be said it must be in writing and under seal. Reference has also been made to the repudiation of the transfer of the contract by Heney, Charlebois and Flood, after the contract had been cancelled by the Government. The first Order in Council put an end to the contract. This Order in Council was passed on the recommendation of the Minister under whose control the works were being carried on. By comparison of dates, it will be found that the Department of Public Works was aware of this assignment before the Order in Council was passed to determine the contract; still, it was not given as a reason that the transfer of the contract had been made. Now, if the Government had power at all to cancel this contract, the first order took effect, and the second was not necessary or called for. In the first order the reason given is not because the contract had been assigned, nor, indeed, any other, because the Government had come to the conclusion to abandon the line altogether. The reason given in the second order in Council cannot avail, as the contract had already been put an end to by the first order.\nAll the equities of the case are certainly in favor of the suppliants. The law certainly entitles some one to be paid for the work done for and received by the Goverment. How can it be said, under these circumstances, that there has been no novation, and that no payment should be made for these works, or for consequential damages?\nI maintain that if the Government did not assent to the transfer, then Charlebois & Co. are entitled to recover for the work done by Smith and Ripley\u2014and also entitled to recover damages.\nI have listened very attentively to the reasons given by my brother Judges for reversing the judgment, but I have heard nothing to alter my view of the case, and therefore think the appeal should be dismissed.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\u2014\nI find it impossible, for the reasons given at full length by the Chief Justice and by my brothers Strong and Gwynne, to sustain the judgment given by the Exchequer Court in favour of the respondents, or to give judgment in favour of Charlebois, et al., the former contractor, as suggested by my brother Fournier. I have come to this conclusion with great reluctance, for I see that an injustice is done to the respondents by such a judgment. I am sure, however, that the government will not avail itself of this judgment and of the strictness of the law to refuse to the respondents the justice they are entitled to at their hands.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nThe construction which I put upon the pleadings in this proceeding and upon the matters put in issue thereby is different from that put upon them by some of my learned brothers, but nevertheless leads to the same conclusion.\nThe petition of right filed in this case is presented by James N. Smith and Josiah D. Ripley as the sole persons beneficially interested in the several amounts claimed to be recoverable from the government in respect of the matters set forth in the petition, the other persons joined as co-suppliants, being so joined only as being persons through whom Smith & Ripley claim, and because of an apparent doubt in the mind of the pleader whether the claim of Smithy Ripley, being through the other suppliants Heney, Charlebois & Flood, could be sustained unless those original contractors should be joined as co-suppliants with Smith & Ripley.\nThe short material contents of the petition are that by an indenture dated the 2nd of August, 1878, a contract was entered into between Heney, Charlebois & Flood as contractors with Her Majesty, represented therein by the Minister of Public Works for Canada, for the construc-of certain public work therein mentioned. That the said contractors, for the purpose of being able to prosecute such work with greater vigor, and to assist them pecuniarily in carrying on the works required to be done under the said contract, associated with themselves the suppliants James N. Smith and Josiah D. Ripley to assist them by advancing large sums of money for the purposes of said works, &c., &c. That after considerable work had been performed under the contract, and upon the 12th August, 1879, the said contractors received from the Department of Public Works a letter of the date of the 9th August, informing them that by an order in council of the 25th July then last, a copy of which was enclosed, the contract made with the contractors was annulled, and the contractors were thereby notified that the work was taken out of their hands, and that they should accordingly cease all further operations under the said contract. The petition then alleges, in paragraph 11, that the said contractors and the other suppliants on their behalf sustained very heavy damages by the cancellation of the said contract, that of several progress estimates made both before and after the receipt of said notice of cancellation there remained still unpaid, in respect of work done prior to the receipt of such notice, the sum of $13,874.94; that under the said contract there would have been realised by the contractors and the other suppliants large profits, if the said contract had not been cancelled, amounting to $100,000 or thereabouts. The petition then, in the 15th paragraph, sets forth the foundation upon which the claim of the suppliants James N. Smith and Josiah D. Ripley to the relief claimed is rested, as follows: \"That your suppliants, the said Smith & Ripley, being at the time of the receipt by said contractors of the said notice (above mentioned) heavily interested in the said contract under the said contractors, and in the profits to be made therefrom, by virtue of the money advances and pecuniary liabilities incurred by them in respect of the said works, did, for valuable consideration, procure to be assigned and transferred by the said contractors, by an instrument in writing duly executed and dated on or about the 25th day of October, 1879, all their claims, demands, rights, debts and choses in action against Her Majesty in respect of the said contract, together with all moneys payable by or recoverable from Her Majesty in respect thereof, including moneys payable according to estimates made by Her Majesty's engineers in respect of work actually done under said contract, and also all moneys owing by or recoverable from Her Majesty to said contractors for damages and loss of profits in consequence of the cancellation of said contract, to which they, the said contractors, or any person claiming under them, ever were, or could be entitled against Her Majesty, and that they, the said Smith & Ripley, are now solely in equity, if not in law, entitled to said demands, rights, debts and choses in action and to the moneys payable or recoverable in respect thereof.\" Then, in paragraph 16, it is submitted that the suppliants, Smith and Ripley, are entitled to be paid all sums payable to or recoverable by said contractors according to estimates made under said contract, and still unpaid, and also to all damages and loss of profits and interest thereon to which the said contractors, or any of them, or any one claiming under them, ever were or could be entitled in respect of the matters aforesaid; and the petition prayed 1st, that it might be declared that the said contractors and the other suppliants claiming through or under them, were entitled upon the cancellation of said contract by Her Majesty to be paid all damages arising directly or indirectly in consequence of the cancellation of said contract, and also for all profits which the said contractors and the other suppliants claiming under them were prevented from earning in respect of the works contemplated to be done under said contract and material therefor, and which were lost to them by reason of the cancellation thereof, and to interest upon both damages and profits, and 2nd. That the suppliants, the said Smith and Ripley might be declared entitled to be paid, and may be paid all moneys payable by and recoverable from Her Majesty in respect of the matter aforesaid, &c., &c. 3rd. That the sum of $250,000, or such other sum as might, upon a reference for that purpose, be found payable to the suppliants, the said Smith and Ripley, in respect of said matters, and 4th. That, if necessary, a reference might be directed to ascertain the amount of damages caused to the said contractors and the other suppliants claiming under them, arising in any manner, directly or indirectly, in consequence of the cancellation of the said contract, and also to ascertain the amount of profits which could have been earned and realized by said contractors and the other suppliants claiming under them, if the said works contemplated under said contract had been gone on with, and which were lost to said contractors, and the other suppliants claiming under them, in consequence of the cancellation of said contract, and for costs and further relief.\nNow, upon this petition, it is apparent that the foundation upon which the claim of Smith & Ripley is based is the instrument of the 25th October, 1879, executed after the cancellation of the contract for the purpose of assigning to Smith & Ripley all the rights, debts and choses in action of the original contractors Heney, Charlebois & Flood under the contract; in order, therefore, that Smith & Ripley should succeed it was necessary that they should aver and prove what the rights, debts and choses in action of Heney, Charlebois & Flood so assigned, were, but such rights, debts and choses in action are only averred as subsidiary to the right of Smith & Ripley to recover to their own use whatever they may be able to establish such rights, debts and choses in action to be.\nBefore alluding to the answer of the Attorney General for the Dominion filed to this claim, it will be necessary to draw attention to certain matters constituting a portion of the defence set up in such answer. By a letter dated the 5th August, 1879, addressed to the Minister of Railways by Smith & Ripley by their attorney, A. Ferguson, they inform the minister that they had purchased from the contractors for the Georgian Bay branch of the Canadian Pacific railway all their right, title and interest in said contract, and in all moneys and benefits payable or receivable and now accrued or to accrue thereunder,\nAnd that in so far as said contractors had any power or authority to assign said contract and their interest thereunder, or to substitute any other person or persons in their place with reference thereto, we have been so substituted for said original contractors and have undertaken the burthen and execution of said contract. The original contractors have transferred to us, as will be seen by the accompanying documents, all their respective interests in said contract and benefits thereunder, and we have been and now are engaged with a large force in the execution of the works under the contract in question. We beg to forward herewith five original documents, which documents, along with the assignment from Heney, one of the original contractors, to Charlebois and Flood, on file in your department, show clearly our title as assignees of the original contractors, and to be dealt with as such by the department as well as to receive instructions in any matter relating to the said contract. You will observe on reference to the agreement \"B,\" dated 30th June last, between Charlebois & Co. and ourselves, that we undertook to replace the $20,000 cheque deposited by Charlebois & Co. as part security on said contract with your department by a security of our own of a similar amount satisfactory to your department, and to get the cheque deposited by Charlebois & Co. released and given up to Charlebois & Co., on or by 1st August instant. In order to carry out our agreement in reference to this matter, we applied to your department on 1st of August for leave to substitute said security of Charlebois & Co., by security of our own for a like amount, and for the delivery up of said cheque deposited by Charlebois & Co., but we were informed in reply that no answer could be given to our request on that day.\nWe are, so far, without an answer to the above request, and we understand the delay is owing to some change of policy either contemplated or resolved upon by the government in respect of the works under the contract in question. We would respectfully suggest that in the meantime the return of the security deposited by Charlebois & Co., as above mentioned, would relieve us from liability (if any) in respect of the return of the said security, and also from double interest; that is to say, interest on the Charlebois cheque and our own security for a like amount, which we are holding in readiness for substitution, and so far as we are concerned such return would not interfere with any future arrangements which may be in contemplation. We would request that, if it is not absolutely necessary to retain the original documents sent herewith, after recording them in the books of the department, they should be returned to us, we having no other copies.\nWe have the honor to be, &c.,\nRipley, Smith & Co.,\nBy A. Ferguson, their attorney.\nIt is unnecessary to refer to all the points of defence raised in the answer of the Attorney General, for it was admitted, after the argument, that the evidence failed to establish that the contractors had made such default in proceeding with the work as justified the taking the contract out of their hands under a clause in the contract to that effect, and the defence was rested upon the fact of the assignment of the contract by the original contractors to Smith & Ripley contrary to an express provision of the contract. The defence upon this point commences at paragraph 9 of the answer, wherein the Attorney General alleges\u2014that by the seventeenth section of the contract it is provided that the contractors should not make any assignment of the contract or any sub-contract for the execution of any of the works thereby contracted for, and in any event no such assignment or sub-contract, even though consented to, should exonerate the contractors from liability under the contract for due performance of all the works thereby contracted for, and, in the event of any such assignment or sub-contract being made without such consent, Her Majesty might take the work out of the contractors' hands and employ such means as she might see fit to complete the same, and that in such case the contractors should have no claim for any further payment in respect of the works performed, but should nevertheless remain liable for all loss and damage which might be suffered by Her Majesty by reason of the non-completion, by the contractors, of the works. The tenth paragraph then alleges the execution of the indenture under seal, dated the 2nd day of August, 1878, the day upon which the contract was entered into, whereby Heney assigned, transferred and set over unto Charlebois and Flood all his interest in the said contract. In the eleventh paragraph the Attorney General alleges that by an instrument or agreement which the Attorney General cannot particularly set forth the said Flood assigned and transferred to George Shannon, Daniel M. Monty, John C. Monty and William B. Cooper, some part or interest in the said contract, and that by the indenture bearing date the 15th of May, 1879, the said Flood, Shannon, Daniel M. Monty, John C. Monty and William B. Cooper assigned and transferred to the suppliant Josiah D. Ripley all their interest in the said contract, and all right, title and interest in the benefits and advantages to the derived thereunder. In the twelfth paragraph it is alleged that by some instrument or agreement, the particulars whereof Her Majesty's Attorney General has been unable to ascertain, the said Alphonse Charlebois, assigned and transferred to Edward Shanly and Louis Th\u00e9ophile Mallette some part or interest in the said contract, and by an indenture bearing date the 30th day of June, 1879, the said Charlebois, Shanly and Mallette transferred and assigned to the suppliants Smith & Ripley all their right, title and interest in the said contract, together with all powers, privileges and emoluments derivable or to be derived from the said contract. In paragraph 13 it is alleged that by certain agreements, the particulars of which Her Majesty's Attorney General has been unable to ascertain, the said Charlebois, Flood, Heney, Shanly, Mallette, Shannon, Dl. M. Monty, John C. Monty and William B. Cooper did assign and transfer to the suppliants James N. Smith and Josiah D. Ripley all their respective rights and interests in the said contract, and to further evidence and define the rights and interests of all parties with respect to the said contract the said contractors, that is to say, Heney, Charlebois and Flood, and the said Shanly, Mallette, Shannon, Dl. M. Monty, John C. Monty and William B. Cooper did by indenture, dated the 30th June, 1879, among other things in effect declare that the sole interest in the said contract was then, at the date of the said indenture, absolutely vested in the suppliants James N. Smith and Josiah D. Ripley, subject to the terms of the said contract. Then, in the 14th paragraph, the Attorney General alleges that the said several assignments were made without the consent of Her Majesty, and in violation of the provisions of the 17th section of the said contract, and Her Majesty, under the powers contained in the said 17th section, took the work out of the said contractors' hands, by reason whereof the suppliants have no claim against Her Majesty in respect of the works performed, as alleged in the petition. The answer then admitted that, according to the estimates of the engineer, the work done prior to the work being taken out of the contractors' hands amounted to $24,807, of which $11,000 had been paid to the contractors, leaving a balance of $13,807.94, which, however, the Attorney General insisted was not, under the circumstances, payable to the contractors. However, notwithstanding that he insisted it was not recoverable, he thereby offered on behalf of Her Majesty, and without prejudice to Her Majesty's position and defence to the said petition, and without admitting any liability in the premises, to pay, provided it should be accepted in full of all claims and demands against Her Majesty in respect of the said contract.\nTo this answer, besides joining' issue upon the statements by way of defence therein alleged, the suppliants reply that the contract was not cancelled, or annulled, or the works taken out of the contractors' hands, for the reasons stated in the answer, or for any of such reasons, but that the said contract was cancelled and annulled and the work taken out of the contractors' hands because of the determination of Her Majesty, long before said cancellation took place, to abandon and proceed no further with the works, contemplated and contracted to be done under the contract; and for a further replication, the suppliants say that the said assignments were not made without the consent of Her Majesty, but that Her Majesty had full knowledge before said assignments were made and also immediately thereafter, and before the said Order in Council of the 25th July, 1879, was passed, and gave her consent thereto, and after such notice and knowledge Her Majesty recognised the said assignees as contractors under the said contract, and allowed them to go on with the work thereunder and to incur a large outlay and expenditure thereupon on the faith of such assignments and the recognition thereof by Her Majesty; and the suppliants further say that Her Majesty did not under the powers and for the reasons alleged in the fourteenth paragraph, take the said work out of the contractors' hands.\nIssue was joined upon these replications.\nThis replication displays a singular departure from the claim as set up in the petition. There the claim of Smith and Ripley is based upon an assignment of the rights, debts and choses in action, whatever they were, of the original contractors executed to Smith and Ripley, in October, after the cancellation of the contract which is complained of, whereas in this replication the claims of Smith and Ripley are based upon an absolute assignment of the contract itself, together with the rights of the original contractors thereunder, coupled with an averment that such assignment was assented to by Her Majesty, who accepted Smith and Ripley as the contractors in lieu of Heney, Charlebois and Flood, long before the alleged cancellation, and so that the cancellation did not take place for the reason alleged in the 14th paragraph of the statement, by way of defence, namely, the assignment to Smith and Ripley without the consent of Her Majesty.\nNow, as to all of the assignments spoken of in the statement by way of defence and in the evidence, it may be here observed that it is not necessary to refer to any of them except that to Smith and Ripley, perfected by the indentures of the 30th June, 1879, for, upon production, it appeared that none of the others purported to assign the contract itself, but merely to transfer to the assignees thereof certain shares and interests in the profits and loss of the work in partnership together with the original contractors; but as to the assignment to Smith and Ripley in June, 1879, there can, I think, be no doubt that it was such an assignment as is pointed at in the 17th paragraph of the contract, in the event of which being made without the consent of Her Majesty, it became competent for Her Majesty to take the contract out of the contractors' hands, and that thereupon the provision that in such case the contractors should have no claim for any further payment in respect of work performed would come into operation. Upon the assignment becoming known it was competent for the government to assent thereto or under the provision of the 17th section to take the contract out of the contractors' hands, and to annul it in so far as to deprive them of all benefit thereunder, while their liability to the government for all loss or damage, if any, which might be occasioned to the government by reason of the non-completion of the works by the contractors would still remain. The evidence, I think, leaves no doubt that the fact of the assignment of the 30th June, 1879, first became known to the government by the letter of the date of the 5th August, 1879, addressed to the Minister of Railways by Mr. Ferguson as attorney of Smith & Ripley. Then it appears that on the 9th of August the acting Minister of Railways, the minister himself being absent, laid a report before the Privy Council of the Dominion in which he alleges that subsequently to the passing of the order in council of the 25th July, 1879, referred to in the petition of right, it came to his knowledge that prior to the said 25th July, namely, on the 30th June, 1879, the contractors Heney, Charlebois & Flood had without the knowledge or consent of Her Majesty, or of the Minister of Railways and Canals acting in that behalf for Her Majesty, assigned and transferred the said contract to Messrs. Smith, Ripley & Co. That he was not aware when he recommended the order in council of the 25th of July that such assignment had been made in contravention of the 17th article of the contract, that on the 5th of August he was notified by letter purporting to be signed by the said Messrs. Smith, Ripley & Co., that said assignment had been made to them, and at the same time a paper purporting to be an assignment of the said contract duly executed was deposited in the Department of Railways and Canals. That such assignment was never assented to by Her Majesty, or by the Minister of Railways and Canals, acting for Her Majesty, and he, therefore, recommended that the contractors Heney, Charlebois & Flood should be notified that the said contract is taken out of their hands and annulled. Upon this report action was taken by the Council on the 14th August, and an order in council was passed in pursuance thereof authorizing the taking the contract out of the hands of the contractors accordingly. It was contended upon the part of the suppliants that this assignment to Smith & Ripley was not in fact the true cause for the passing of this order in council, and that the true cause was that the government had changed their policy with respect to the work in progress, and intended to go no further with it. With the motive of the government in passing the order we have nothing to do, and cannot inquire into it. The fact of the assignment, of which the government were not aware at the time of the passing the order in council of the 25th July, when it came to their knowledge, authorized them, in the terms of the contract, to rest upon it as affording sufficient ground for taking the contract wholly out of the contractors' hands, notwithstanding the passing the previous order; and the assignees of the contract who, without the consent of the government, can derive no benefit from the assignment, can have no locus standi to call in question the motives of the government, so neither could the original contractors, who, for valuable consideration, had parted voluntarily with all their interest therein. There can, therefore, I think, be no doubt that the government can, as a defence to this petition, rest upon the assignment without their consent, as terminating all interest of the contractors, and of Smith & Ripley as claiming through them, under the contract.\nIt is, however, not improper, I think, that we should say that the evidence seems to establish the most perfect integrity and good faith upon the part of these gentlemen, and such as to entitle them to expect and to receive the most favorable consideration of their claims by the government\u2014unless, indeed, good faith upon their part may be said to be the cause of the loss occasioned to them by the consent of the government to the assignment to them being withheld; that they were influenced in taking the assignment by encouragement held out to them, or what they not unreasonably believed to be encouragement held out to them, in conversation with persons supposed by them to have authority, there is reason, I think, to believe, and that they bon\u00e2 fide believed that by taking the assignment they were promoting the objects the government had, or were believed to have in view, as well as securing their own interest there can, I think, be no doubt; so that, in view of all the circumstances attending their acquiring the assignment, and their frankness and good faith in communicating it to the government, which they did in the hope, and not unreasonable expectation, that it would be without hesitation assented to by the government, although they cannot succeed upon their petition in this case by the judgment of the court, they certainly appear to be entitled to the most favorable consideration of their claim out of court.\nThe Attorney-General, in his answer upon behalf of the Government, has, without admitting any liability, submitted to pay $13,807.94, the unpaid balance of the progress estimates, up to the time of the contract being taken out of the contractors' hands. We might award this sum to be paid upon this submission, but that would be only on the condition of its being accepted as tendered in satisfaction of all claims. The suppliants may, perhaps, prefer to urge their whole claims upon the favorable consideration of the Government unembarrassed by the acceptance of the above sum on such conditions. If, however, the suppliants should be willing to accept the amount as tendered in the answer a decree, in my opinion, may be made for that amount, but it would have to be without costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: O'Connor & Hogg.\nSolicitor for respondent: A.

Ritchie, C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne, JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE JUDGMENT OF THE JUDGE IN EQUITY OF THE PROVINCE OF NEW BRUNSWICK.\nObstructions in tidal and navigable rivers\u201445 Vic. ch. 100 (N. B.) ultra vires\u2014B. N. A. Act, 1867, sec. 91.\nProfessing to act under the powers contained in their act of incorporation, 45 Vic., ch. 100 (N. B.), the Q. R. B. Co. erected booms and piers in the Queddy river which impeded navigation\u2014the locus being in that part of the river which is tidal and navigable.\nHeld,\u2014(Affirming the judgment of the court below,) that the Provincial Legislature might incorporate a boom company, but could not give it power to obstruct a tidal navigable river, and therefore the Act 45, ch. 100, N. B., so far as it authorizes the acts done by the Company in erecting booms and other works in the Queddy river obstructing its navigation, was ultra vires of the New Brunswick Legislature.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Palmer, J., the Judge in Equity of the Province of New Brunswick.\nThe plaintiff in this case filed a bill for an injunction to restrain the defendants from erecting and maintaining piers and booms in the Queddy river, and alleging that by erecting the said piers and booms and filling the stream with logs, the said plaintiff was prevented for a length of time from having access to the shore and using the stream for the purposes of navigation. This coming on for argument on demurrer, it was agreed that the only question that should be raised upon the argument should be the authority of the Provincial Legislature under the provisions of the B. N. A. Act, 1867, to pass the Act incorporating the said company, and to confer the powers contained therein, and that all other matters stand to the hearing; and for the purpose of raising the question relating to the said Act the following case was agreed upon between the counsel for the respective parties:\u2014\n\"1. The plaintff is the owner of certain lands situate at the outlet or mouth of the Queddy river, which empties into the Bay of Fundy. The said river is situate in the parish of St. Martins, county of St. John, in the province of New Brunswick.\n\"2. The Queddy river is a public navigable river; the tide ebbs and flows for about a mile and a half from the mouth or outlet; and schooners or boats can, at the proper time of tide, go up to the head of the tide. The stream above the flow of the tide is and can only be used for floating and driving logs when the water permits.\n\"3. The rise and fall of the tide is about thirty feet, and at low tide the water is very low in the stream, almost dry, and vessels can only ascend it under and at certain states of the tide.\n\"4. The said river flows through the plaintiffs land for the distance of a mile from its mouth, he owning the shore on either side.\n\"5. The defendants, Robertson and Bevan, own or control lands at the head waters of the river adjacent thereto, from which they cut logs and drive them down the stream\u2014the only practicable mode of getting them to market.\n\"7. The defendants, the Queddy River Driving Boom Company, is a company incorporated by an act passed at the last session of the legislature of the province of New Brunswick, intituled 'An Act to incorporate the Queddy River Driving Boom Company'[1].\n\"8. In pursuance of and professing to act under the powers contained in the said Act, the said company have erected and placed piers and booms in the said river attached to the shores at the places on map annexed hereto at the points marked A, B, C, D.\n\"9. These booms as erected under the Act impede navigation, but at the times when the tides serve they are capable of being swung open to admit rafts passing down or craft up stream.\n\"10. The plaintiff has erected a steam saw mill on his land at the point marked.\n\"11. Without booms being placed in the river at some point in the tide-way near the mouth, logs driven down the stream or a great portion thereof, would escape into the bay, and be practically lost and swept out to sea.\n\"12. The defendant company claim the right to erect the piers and booms as shown on the plan, and maintain the same under the powers contained in the said Act, and that the said booms are erected there in accordance with the powers given by the said Act.\"\nThe questions for the opinion of the court are:\u2014\nFirst, can the legislature of the province of New Brunswick give the powers claimed by the defendant company under which they have erected and maintain the said piers and booms?\nSecond, are the acts done by the company, as above set out, within the powers given by the said Act.\nIf these questions are answered in the affirmative, then judgment to be given for the defendants; but if in the negative, then the demurrer to be overruled.\n\"13. It is admitted that the plaintiff has sustained such special and particular damages by the operations of the company as would entitle him to an order of injunction restraining the proceedings of the company and the other defendants if the above powers conferred by the Act of the legislature of New Brunswick are ultra vires.\"\nThe Supreme Court of New Brunswick delivered judgment in favor of the plaintiff; and in reply to the first question declared that the powers conferred by the Act of the legislature of New Brunswick upon the defendants authorizing them to erect piers and booms and maintain the same as stated in the special case is ultra vires and beyond the powers of the legislature of the province of New Brunswick; and as to the second question in the said special case declared it was unnecessary to answer it in view of the decision upon the first question.\nMr. Weldon, Q.C., for appellants:\nIt is contended for the respondents that the legislation incorporating this company is ultra vires of the legislature of New Brunswick, as being legislation indirectly controlling navigation and shipping.\nIt cannot be disputed that at first sight it would so seem, but it is submitted that it is not, but an exercise of a power necessarily vested in the legislature to carry into effect the requisite legislation to incorporate this company, being a matter within the class over which it has legislation.\nLegislation, whether of the Dominion or Provincial legislatures, over certain classes or subjects falling within the classes respectively assigned them, in order to be effective must, in many cases, not only apparently but actually trench or infringe upon matters exclusively assigned to the other legislature, and that the power to do this arises by necessary implication. The instance of bankruptcy and insolvency is perhaps the most familiar.\nApplying the principle laid down by Sir Montague E. Smith in delivering judgment in the case of Gushing v. Dupuy[2] to the classes assigned to provincial legislation it would seem to be a necessary implication that when it is necessary to render the legislation effective and of value and benefit to the people of the province, or a portion of it, that it was intended to confer on it legislative power for that purpose, even if to some extent it apparently infringes upon classes of subjects exclusively assigned to the Dominion Parliament.\nBy the 10th sub-section of section 92, local works and undertakings, such as certain classes of railway, canal, telegraph and other works, are, upon the principle inclusio unius exclusio alterius, within the power of the local legislature.\nAgain, works of a local character, for instance, bridges to connect the great or bye-roads and to facilitate local communication through the province and to open it up for settlement, it must be conceded are within the legislation of the provincial legislature. Many of these bridges necessarily cross rivers within the flow of the tide below the head of navigation; in fact many do, as may be instanced upon the rivers flowing into the bay of Fundy, such as the Musquash in the county of St. John, the Petitcodiac and Memramcook in the county of Westmoreland\u2014over the latter not less than three bridges below the head of navigation,\u2014the bridges over the Shediac, Cocagne, Buctouche, Richibucto and Miramichi rivers, flowing into the Gulf of St. Lawrence, are all below the head of navigation, many of these erected since the union, and are constructed with draws to enable vessels to pass up and down, but necessarily to some extent interfere with the navigation. If the local legislature have no authority to authorize such an erection or bridge, then it would be \"illegal and a nuisance.\" Hole v. Sittingbourne and Sheerness Railway Co.[3]. Angell on Watercourses[4]. \"All hindrances to navigation, whether by bridges or in any other manner, without direct authority from the legislature, are public nuisances.\" See also Original Hartlepool Collieries Co. v. Gibb[5].\nIf in the course of navigation a vessel injured such bridge or boom, if illegal, no action would be maintainable. Colchester (Mayor, &c.) v. Brooke[6].\nI submit that the legislation complained of by the respondent is legislation affecting property and civil rights, and falls within that class. L'Union St. Jacques de Montreal v. Belisle[7].\nThe judgment of the judicial committee of the Privy Council in the case of Queen Ins. Co. v. Parsons[8] supports the principle I am now contending for, and applying the rule there laid down, to ascertain the intention of the framers of the Act of Union, legislation of the provinces prior to the union is to be looked to. The legislation of the province of New Brunswick on the subject will be found in the 3rd Vol. Public Statutes, under the head of boom companies, and all the subsequent statutes up to 1867.\nWhile it may be contended that the relation of the dominion to the provinces is not in entire analogy to that of the United States with the respective states of the union, yet it is only in the decisions of their courts we can find the question of conflict of legislation discussed, and principles of constitutional law discussed and expounded, and considering that from the same source as ourselves the common law of our mother country, the federal courts, and as a general rule the state courts, derive their principles of jurisprudence, and also taking into consideration the similarity of circumstances in each federation, it may be fairly urged that even if their decisions are not followed in their entirety, they may afford light and information upon these questions discussed before their courts.\nIn Harrigan v. The Connecticut Navigation Company[9], the court illustrates the regulation of rivers even navigable as in the analogous case of highways. (See judgment delivered by Lord, J.)\nAfter the decision in Gibbons v. Ogden[10], the question arose before the same judges in the case of Wilson v. The Blackbird Creek Marsh Co.[11], where the doctrine of the several rights of the Congress and the State is discussed by that eminent jurist Chief Justice Marshall.\nSubsequently in the Supreme Court of the United States in State of Pennsylvania v. Wheeling Bridge Co.[12], where Chief Justice Taney delivered a dissenting opinion. The following decisions of State Courts were also referred to: Nelson v. Cheboyan Nav. Co.[13]; County of Mobile v. Kimball[14].\nDr. Barker, Q. C., and Dr. Tuck, Q. C., for respondent:\nThe question involved in this appeal is whether the act of the Legislature of New Brunswick, 45 Vic., ch. 100, intituled \"An Act to incorporate certain persons to be known as The Queddy River Driving and Boom Company,\" is ultra vires, so far as it authorizes the acts done by the Company in erecting booms and other works in the Queddy River, obstructing its navigation and preventing the respondent from having access to his lands fronting on the river. The powers conferred upon the Company to which exception is taken will be found principally in the 3rd and 4th sections of the Act. The construction of the works thus authorized, we contend, must interfere with the public right of navigation, and that in reference to a navigable river, such as the one in question, the local legislature has no power to confer the right professed to be given by this act.\nBy section 91 of the B. N. A. Act, the right to legislate on the subject of navigation and shipping is given to the Dominion Parliament; and if the powers conferred belong to any of the classes of subjects in section 92 of that Act, or are included in any of them, the local legislature has, to that extent, exceeded its powers, even though the act may relate in other respects to some subject comprised within section 92. It is contended by the appellants that the act in question relates solely to a local work and undertaking, and to matters of a merely local or private nature, and as such it comes within section 92 of the B. N. A. Act. This contention cannot prevail. In the first place it cannot be said that the construction of works which in their intended use necessarily take away or abridge a right in the public, such as that of navigation, is in any sense a matter of a merely private nature; and in the second place, any work or undertaking local in its nature ceases to be such in the sense in which the term is used in section 92, when its use or the result of its operation, is to interfere with any right which is included in a subject-matter within the legislative authority of the Dominion Parliament. For while the latter Parliament has, by force of the concluding clause of section 91, in addition to its express powers, such an implied legislative authority over the subjects mentioned in section 92 as may be requisite for complete legislation in reference to the subjects mentioned in section 91, there is no such implied authority in the local legislature in reference to the classes of subjects mentioned in section 91. Any such implied authority would obviously lead to conflict, and it is contended that except in the cases provided for by sections 94 and 95 of the B. N. A. Act, there is no concurrent power of legislation in the two parliaments.\nThe cases decided by this and other courts in reference to the powers of the respective legislatures, so far as they bear on the subject under discussion, are as follows:\u2014City of Fredericton v. The Queen[15]; Cushing v Dupuy[16]; Citizens' Ins. Co. v. Parsons[17]; Russell v. The Queen[18]; See also The Queen v. Burah[19].\nAdmitting for the sake of argument that the Act in question prim\u00e2 facie, as Sir Montague Smith, in The Citizens' Ins. Co. v. Parsons[20], says, falls within one of the classes of subjects enumerated in section 92, does it not, or do not the powers conferred on the appellant company fall within the subject of navigation, inasmuch as they interfere with the public right in reference to it. If the Dominion parliament enacted a statute simply authorizing A to enter upon and occupy the land of B, to his entire exclusion, it could scarcely be contended that this was not legislation as to the civil rights and property of B, and therefore ultra vires of that parliament. Why? Not because it in words took away B's right of enjoying his own premises, but because that was the natural and necessary result of acting on the authority conferred. So in this case, the prevention of the public in the enjoyment of their right of navigation and its incidents; is the natural and necessary result of the use of the powers conferred. The legislation therefore does fall within the subject of navigation, and by all the authorities is void on that account.\nThe Dominion Parliament in its legislation has acted on the principle contended for by the respondent, and though this fact could in no way confer a right not given by the constitution, it is a question which, in such a case as the present, \"may,\" as Sir Montague Smith, at page 116 of the case last cited, says, \"properly be considered.\" These statutes are numerous and refer, as will be seen, to almost every description of work which might interfere in any way with the rights of the public in navigable rivers. These statutes are as follows:\u201432-33 Vic., ch. 42; 35 Vic., ch. 94; 36 Vic., ch. 65; 37 Vic., ch. 29; 39 Vic., ch. 15; 42 Vic., ch. 9; 43 Vic., ch. 44; 43 Vic., ch. 61; 43 Vic., ch. 29, s. 2, art. 27; Sec. 71 of Railway Act\u201442 Vic., ch. 9.\nThe provision in the Act, section 22, that the works shall not unnecessarily interfere with navigation, admit that the right of navigation will necessarily be abridged, but beyond that it has no bearing on the case. Who is to judge of the necessity, or how is it to be determined? Is it by the quantity of logs to be taken care of? If so, then it follows that if the quantity of logs to be boomed requires the whole river to be occupied by the company's works, the right of navigation is taken away altogether and necessarily so.\nThen, it was argued in the court below that at all events the legislation in question was good until some act conflicting with it had been passed by the Dominion parliament, and cases decided by courts in the United States were cited in support of this contention.\nUnder the British North America Act the only question that can arise is one simply of construction, and the power of either the Dominion Parliament or a provincial one to legislate on any subject is defined and limited by the act itself, and must be determined by the rules of construction applicable to any other case where the meaning of a statute is to be settled.\nMr. Weldon, Q.C., in reply.\nRITCHIE, C. J.:\u2014\nPiers and booms may be very useful on the Queddy river, may, in fact, be almost essential for the preservation of logs driven down the river, to prevent their escaping into the bay and swept out to sea. But that cannot affect the legal question in this case, which is, to which legislative power, that of the Dominion Parliament or the Assembly of New Brunswick, belongs the right to authorize the obstruction by piers or booms of a public tidal and navigable river, and thereby injuriously interfere with and abridge the public right of navigation in such tidal navigable waters. It is not disputed that this legislation interfered with the navigation of the river, indeed this appears clearly from the language of the Act itself which says[21]:\nIt shall be the duty of the said company to place and maintain all their works upon the said river in such a way as not to unnecessarily interfere with the navigation of the same.\nI think there can be no doubt that the legislative control of navigable waters, such as are in question in this case, belongs exclusively to the Dominion Parliament. Everything connected with navigation and shipping seems to have been carefully confided to the Dominion Parliament, by the B. N. A. Act. Thus, in addition to \"Navigation and Shipping,\" generally, we have \"beacons, buoys, lighthouses, and Sable Island;\" then we have quarantine, and the establishment and maintenance of marine hospitals; and lastly we have in the list of provincial public works and properties which are to become the property of Canada, canals with lands and water power connected therewith, public harbors, lighthouses and piers, and Sable Island, steamboats, dredges and public vessels and rivers and lakes improvements. All this seems to me to indicate very clearly that the words \"navigation and shipping\" are to be read in no restricted sense. The question of the interference with the navigation of public tidal waters is by no means matter of purely local or private concern, it affects the shipping of the Dominion generally, as indeed also foreign as well as domestic; and, therefore, in view of the general scope of the Act, legitimately belongs to the Dominion Parliament rather than the local legislatures.\nThe objects of incorporation of companies with power to interrupt, impede, or abridge the rights of foreign or domestic shipping in the navigation of any of the tidal navigable waters of the Dominion cannot be said to be provincial any more than the works and undertakings under such powers can be called local; on the contrary, though the corporation may be private, the object to be accomplished affects the public as well within as without the province.\nBut if the objects of the incorporation could strictly speaking be called provincial, or the works and undertakings local if thereby navigation and shipping, and the legislative powers conferred on the Dominion Parliament are interfered with, then by virtue of the latter clause of section 91, they are not to be matters coming within the class of matters of a local or private nature, comprised in the enumeration of the classes of subjects assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces.\nIf the Provincial Legislature can authorize the obstruction of the navigable tidal waters at the mouth of the Queddy River, why may they not do the same at the mouth of the other large rivers of the Dominion, as in New Brunswick the mouth of the St. John, at the head of the St. John harbor, and so prevent or impede the free navigation of that great river by the numerous steamboats, wood boats and seagoing craft that daily navigate from the sea to St. John and from St. John and Indian Town to Fredricton, or that large and important river Miramichi, navigated for miles from its mouth by sea-going ships to the towns of Chatham and Newcastle? And if they have the right to interfere with and abridge the rights of navigation, why should they not be able to authorize total obstructions? for, if they can authorize partial obstructions, I can see no reason why they might not authorize obstructions which would render any navigation impossible, the question not being one of degree, but whether they can or cannot interfere at all.\nAnd these views are, in my opinion, strictly in accordance with the principles heretofore enunciated in this court, and sustained by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.\nI think, therefore, this appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nThere cannot, in my judgment, be any doubt as to the correctness of the decision of the court below, and I should have been prepared to have dismissed the appeal without hearing counsel for the respondent. The Queddy river is shewn to be a navigable tidal river, and the appellants have obstructed the navigation and thus committed an act which is prim\u00e2 facie a public nuisance, and which the respondent shows to be specially injurious to him as a riparian proprietor. The respondent was therefore entitled to an injunction to restrain the continuance of the obstruction, unless the appellants were able to show some legal justification for the interference with the navigation of the river, caused by the construction and maintenance of these booms. They, however, show nothing but an act of the Provincial Legislature of New Brunswick incorporating them as a boom company (which so far was entirely within the powers of that legislature), and which also assumed to confer power upon the company so incorporated to obstruct the navigation of the Queddy river. The powers so conferred are, in my opinion, in excess of the authority given to local legislatures by the British North America Act. This is a conclusion which requires no elaboration of argumentation for its demonstration, for no one can deny that by sub-sec. 10 of sec. 91 of the British North America Act, exclusive power to legislate respecting navigation is conferred on the Parliament of Canada, and as little is it open to any one to dispute that this power respecting navigation includes the exclusive right to legislate so as to authorise an obstruction in a navigable public river where the tide ebbs and flows. A much less distinct power given by the United States Constitution to Congress to legislate respecting interstate commerce, has, as is well known, been held to include the power to control the use of navigable waters on which inter-state commerce is carried on. And the powerful reasoning of the great judges who decided these cases, would, if there could be any doubt upon the point now presented, be conclusive in the present case.\nEven if the provision in sub-sec. 10 of sec. 91 had been omitted, I should have thought that the authority of the Wheeling & Bridge Company case[22] would have been sufficient to show that under sub-sec. 2, giving Parliament power to regulate trade and commerce, the Act of the New Brunswick Legislature in question here would have been an encroachment on these exclusive powers of the Dominion, and so void.\nFor these reasons, which are substantially the same as those assigned by the Chief Justice for the same conclusion, I concur in the deposition of this appeal which has been proposed.\nFOURNIER, J., concurred. HENRY, J.:\nI entirely concur in the views expressed by the Chief Justice and my learned brother Strong. The legislature of New Brunswick, of course, had the power to incorporate the company for a local object, but the question is raised here whether they had the right to confer on the company so incorporated the right to place obstructions in tidal navigable waters. My opinion is, that under the constitution they have no such right. If a local legislature could interfere to the extent of one quarter of a mile in tidal water, they might interfere to the extent of a mile, and there would be no limit. The maritime provinces are so situated that the inhabitants on one side of the bay of Fundy are entitled to navigate the other side, and vice vers\u00e2. If one province, therefore, had the right to interfere with navigable tidal waters they would interfere with the rights of the other province. I do not undertake to say whether that power is inherent in the Dominion Parliament either. There may be cases even in which the Dominion Parliament could be restrained. There are certain rights of fisheries which are common, not only to the province in which they are, but to all the British public and some foreigners, and if the right is conceded to a province to interfere with navigable waters by allowing companies to place obstructions in them, they might largely interfere with rights outside of the province altogether. I have no doubt the local legislature does not possess that power, it has only the power given to it under the Confederation Act, which gives them no power to interiere with tidal waters. The whole power of the local legislature is shown to be restricted. They have the power of organizing companies for local objects alone, but it must be taken into consideration that these local objects shall not interfere with public rights outside. I consider, therefore, under all the circumstances of the case, that the Boom Co. had no authority by the act to place obstructions in the place they did on this navigable river where the tide ebbed and flowed, and where parties were in the habit of taking vessels up and down. My judgment is to dismiss the appeal with costs, and to confirm the judgment that was given by the court below.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\u2014\nI will not dissent from the judgment of the majority of the Court, but I have great doubts on the question submitted. There are very strong grounds, it seems to me, in support of the contention that this boom is a local work or undertaking in the Province of New Brunswick. Navigation and shipping are left under the control of the Federal authority, it is true, but this, under sub-sec. 10 of sec. 92 of the B. N. A. Act does not extend to, for instance, a line of steamers or other ships entirely within the province, that is to say, plying from one part of the province to another part of the same province. That would, I presume, be a local undertaking under the control of the local legislature. May it not be said that the boom in question is also a local undertaking?\nCan it be said that the incorporation of this company was for federal objects? If it was for Provincial objects was it not legally incorporated by the New Brunswick Legislature?\nGWYNNE, J., concurred with the Chief Justice.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants\u2014The Queddy River Driving and Boom Co.: Charles H.

Ritchie, C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne, JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nWill, construction of\u2014Executor, powers of\u2014Prohibition to alienate\u2014Art. 972 C. C., P. Q.\u2014Document not proved or produced at trial\u2014Inadmissible on appeal.\nBy the 3rd clause of her will, H. M., the testatrix, disposed of all her property, movables, and immovables, in favor of her children as universal legatees. The legacy was subject to the extended powers of administration conferred by the 5th clause of the will (referred to in the statement of the case) and also to the power to alter the disposition in favor of the testatrix's children given by the same clause to her husband H. L., the executor, and also by the will the executor was exonerated from the obligation of making an inventory and rendering an account. H. L., in his quality of testamentary executor and administrator to the estate of the said H. M., endorsed accommodation promissory notes signed by C. L., one of his children, and \"The M. Bk.\" (respondent), as holder thereof for value, obtained judgment against both the maker and indorser. An execution was subsequently issued against H. L., \u00e8squalit\u00e9, and certain real estate of the late H. M., which he detained in his said capacity was seized and advertized for sale. J. D. L. et al (the appellants), who are the only children of the defendant H. L., and his wife, opposed the sale of the property seized on the ground that the said property was insaisissable.\nHeld (reversing the judgment of the court below, Taschereau and Gwynne, JJ., dissenting)\u2014that the endorsements were not authorized by the will, and that the clause in the will, exempting the property of the testatrix from execution, is valid, and must be given effect to. Art. 972, C. C.\nHeld also: That a document which has not been proved nor produced at the trial cannot be relied on or made part of the case in appeal.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side)[1], confirming the judgment of the Superior Court, dismissing the appellants' opposition.\nThe respondents, the Molson's Bank, obtained judgment against the maker and the endorser of certain promissory notes drawn by E. H. Charles Lionais, and endorsed by Hardoin Lionais, in his quality of executor to the last will and testament of his deceased wife, Henriette Moreau, mother of said E. H. Charles Lionais, the amount being for $8,963.83, besides interest and costs.\nOn the 25th February, 1879, the bank sued out a writ of execution, and under it seized certain properties pertaining to the estate of Henriette Moreau.\nThe appellants, J. D. E. Lionais and others, the only children of the marriage of Hardoin Lionais and Henriette Moreau, made an opposition to this seizure, claiming the properties as theirs under their mother's will, which, besides constituting them universal legatees, provided that the properties should be insaisissable, and not liable for any debts created by the said Hardoin Lionais, nor for any debts whatsoever, save those which had been created by the testatrix herself under her own signature, and concluded for the nullity of the seizure.\nThe respondents contested the opposition, alleging: That the will of Dame Henriette Moreau, besides investing Hardoin Lionais with the powers of an administrator, confers on him certain other powers of division of the property which are described in the will. And the respondents further alleged: That for thirty years past, Hardoin Lionais has, by unlawful and fraudulent means, put out of the reach of his creditors all what he owned, and that acting in concert with his wife he has transferred to the latter all the profits on the speculations which he has made, and which constitute the forty-nine fiftieths of the property left by Mrs. Henriette Moreau. That the latter's intention in making her will was to practically leave to her husband the control of her property, but in such a manner as to prevent her husband's creditors from seizing it de pleno jure and without discussion. That the clause of non saisissabilit\u00e9 is therefore without importance, and that the property may be seized on Hardoin Lionias himself as if he was the lawful owner and the universal legatee of said estate.\nThe appellants answered: That the property left by Dame Henriette Moreau belonged to herself in full ownership, and is insaisissable under the terms of her will. That the allegation of fraud and complicity of fraud between the testatrix and her husband, is false, ill-founded and expressly denied, and made through malice, and the opposants reserve their right to have it struck out from the proceedings.\nIssue being joined, the parties went to proof, and the respondents made the following admissions:\u2014 1st. That the appellants were the only children of the late Mrs. Henriette Moreau.\n2nd. That the said Mrs. H. Moreau is deceased.\n3rd. That her last will fyled has been duly registered with a declaration of her death.\n4th. That the debt for which the judgment in this case has been rendered was contracted by Charles Lionais, after the death of the said dame Henriette Moreau.\n5th. That the real estate or immovable property seized in this cause formed part of the estate belonging to the said Mrs. Henriette Moreau.\nThe appellants' opposition was dismissed by judgment of the Superior Court on the 13th September, 1880, and that judgment was affirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side).\nThe material provisions of Henriette Moreau's will are in the terms following:\u2014\n\"Article 3me.\u2014Je donne et je l\u00e8gue tous mes biens, meubles et immeubles, propres et acqu\u00eats, meubles meublant, argenterie, dettes actives, cr\u00e9ances, actions ou parts de banques, deniers comptants, valeurs, c\u00e9dules et obligations et toutes autres choses g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement quelconques que je delaisserai \u00e0 mon d\u00e9c\u00e8s, sans en rien excepter ni r\u00e9server, de quelque nature qu'ils soient, et en quelque lieu et endroits qu'ils se trouvent dus et situ\u00e9s, aux enfants issus de mon mariage avec le dit Hardoin Lionais, mon \u00e9poux, et en cas de pr\u00e9d\u00e9c\u00e8s d'aucun d'eux, aux enfants n\u00e9s du ou des pred\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e8s en l\u00e9gitime mariage, par r\u00e9pr\u00e9sentation.\n\"A l'effet de quoi, je les institue mes l\u00e9gataires Universels en propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et jouissance, sujet, toutefois, aux restrictions et conditions exprim\u00e9es en l'article 5me ci-apr\u00e8s.\n\"Article 4me.\u2014Et pour ex\u00e9cuter mon pr\u00e9sent testament je nomme et choisis le dit Hardoin Lionais, mon \u00e9poux, mon ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire, \u00e8s-mains duquel je me desaissis de tous mes biens, lui en donnant la saisine durant et audel\u00e0 de l'an et jour, et pendant tout le temps que durera l'administration de mes dits biens, sans \u00eatre tenu de donner un cautionnement, ni de faire inventaire, ni m\u00eame de rendre compte.\n\"Article 5me.\u2014Je nomme mon dit \u00e9poux, Hardoin Lionais, administrateur de tous mes dits biens, tant en propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qu'en usufruit, avec pouvoir de les vendre, c\u00e9der, \u00e9changer, hypoth\u00e9quer, ali\u00e9ner ou autrement en disposer, soit en propri\u00e9t\u00e9, soit en usufruit, fruits et revenus, l'autorisant \u00e0 faire, signer, et ex\u00e9cuter tous billets, ch\u00e8ques, obligations, re\u00e7us, quittances et tous autres actes et documents requis et g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00e0 faire tous actes de la plus enti\u00e8re administration, sans qu'il soit besoin, en aucun cas, d'autorisation pr\u00e9alable des cours de justice, ni du consentement ni de l'intervention de mes h\u00e9ritiers ou aucune d'eux.\n\"Et pour les fins de cette administration, je veux et entends que mon dit \u00e9poux, \u00e8s-dites qualit\u00e9s, soit rev\u00eatu et je le rev\u00eats et l'investis des m\u00eames droits, pouvoirs et autorisation qui lui sont conf\u00e9r\u00e9s dans et par la procuration g\u00e9n\u00e9rale que je lui ai accord\u00e9e le sept de juillet mil huit cent cinquante-quatre, par acte re\u00e7u devant Mtre L.

Whether the property seized belonged to the defendant Hardoin Lionais himself, or to the opposants, J. D. E. Lionais et al., children of Hardoin Lionais and Henriette Moreau, deceased, and\n2. Whether, if not the property of Hardoin Lionais, it could be affected by endorsement of his, in his quality of executor upon promissory notes, drawn by E. H. Charles Lionais?\nMr. Barnard, Q.C., on behalf of the respondents, applied for leave to produce, as forming part of the case, a copy of the power of attorney mentioned in the will for the purpose of showing that the power of endorsing notes was one of the powers specially contained in it. The court held that as it did not form part of the proceedings in the court below, it could not be made a part of the case on the present appeal. Mr. Doutre, Q.C., for appellants; and Mr, Barnard, Q.C., and Mr. Creighton, for respondents.\nThe arguments of counsel sufficiently appear in the judgments hereinafter given. In addition to the cases referred to in the judgments the learned counsel for the appellants cited and commented on the following cases and authorities:\u2014Troplong on Donations[2]; Strep[3]; Furgole[4]; Demolombe[5]; Aubry & Rau[6]; Esdaile v. Lanouze[7]. And the learned counsel for the respondents cited and relied on the following cases and authorities:\u2014The Ontario Bank v. Lionais and Lionais opposant[8]; The Union Bank v. Lionais and Leman et al T. S.[9]; Ricard on Donations[10]; Delvincourt[11]; Demolombe[12]; Aubry & Rau[13]; Demolombe[14]; Hutchinson v. Tenant[15]; Rolland de Villargucs Substitutions Prohib\u00e9es[16]; and in Thomson's Estate, Herring v. Barrow[17].\nRITCHIE, C. J.:\u2014\nThe judgments of the dissentient judges in the Court of Queen's Bench, particularly that of Mr. Justice Cross, commend themselves to my mind. My brother Fournier has kindly permitted me to peruse the judgment he is about to deliver and with which I entirely concur. I feel that I can add nothing with advantage to the points discussed by him.\nIf we look at the plaintiff's pleadings we find that the first contention is, that the property was really the property of the father colorably and fraudulently in the hands of the wife to keep it from the hands of the husband's creditors this was abandoned. Then, that by the will the husband was the absolute proprietor, his wife having made him son legataire universel purement et simplement. This Mr. Justice Fournier has conclusively disposed of. Then, that this was an administration authorized by the will in accordance with the provisions of the will; this has likewise been conclusively disposed of by Mr. Justice Fournier. These then are all the objections set up in the pleadings. It is now said that the opposants should have produced the power of attorney, as it may have authorized the father to endorse and bind the succession. In addition to the fact that plaintiff does not in his pleadings take this ground, nor rely on anything in the power of attorney to justify the endorsement, nor even refer to it, the objection is to my mind conclusively met by referring to the terms of the will which provide with reference to the power of attorney that it is given only for the purposes of the administration, the words are:\u2014\nEt pour les fins de cette administration je veux et entends que mon dit epoux \u00e8s-dites qualit\u00e9s soit rev\u00eatu, et je le revets et l'investis des m\u00eames droits, pouvoirs et autorisation qui lui sont confer\u00e9s dans et par la procuration g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, que je lui ai accord\u00e9e le sept de juillet mil huit cent cinquante quatre par acte re\u00e7u devant Mtre, L. A. Moreau et son confr\u00e8re notaires.\nAs Mr. Justice Fournier says, these endorsements were not authorized by the will and were clearly not made with a view or in course of administration of the estate, and the power of attorney could give no such power as to enable the executor to bind the estate for matters dehors the estate and its administration, as to do so would be directly contrary to the provisions of the will and misappropriation of the funds of the estate.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nIt seems very clear that the appellants were not bound to proceed by way of \"ti\u00e8rce opposition\" attacking the judgment. They were neither parties to the action in which the judgment was recovered nor were they represented in that action. The judgment is therefore as regards them res inter alios acta and, as it has been said, no more affects their rights than a piece of blank paper would have done[18].\nThey are to all intents and purposes \"tiers\" as regards this judgment, which has not the effect of chose jug\u00e9e, as regards them, and they are therefore like every third party, whose property is seized under an execution founded on a judgment to which he is not either personally or by representation a party, entitled to maintain an opposition to the seizure in order to have it annulled. No doubt Art. 910 C. C. P. of Quebec would have authorized an opposition to the judgment, but the very terms of that article show that it is facultative and not restrictive. This point was not taken in the factum of the respondent and it was not insisted on by the learned judges in the court below, but as it is considered fatal by some of my learned brothers in this court, it was incumbent on me to consider it, which I have done, with the result just indicated.\nUpon the merits I have come to the same conclusion as that arrived at by the dissenting judges in the Court of Queen's Bench. The question to be decided is entirely one of interpretation. By the 3rd clause of her will the testatrix disposes of all her property, moveables and immoveables in favor of her children as her universal legatees. This legacy is, however, subject to the extended powers of administration conferred by the 5th clause of her will, and also to the power to alter the disposition in favor of the testatrix's children given by the same clause to her husband, Hardoin Lionais, the executor. It is clear, however, that if the executor should not exercise the power of making a different division of the property from that made by the testatrix herself in the third clause, but should die without having either by act inter vivos or by testament altered that disposition, the children will take the property in equal shares by force of the direct gift thus made to them by the testatrix herself.\nI cannot agree that the executor has anything more than powers of administration, greatly extended, no doubt, beyond those which the law would have given him, but still powers of disposition and administration merely, as distinguished from either property or usufruct in himself. It is impossible, therefore, consistently with this view to concur in the opinion of those who hold that Hardoin Lionais had the right to dispose of the property of the testatrix beyond the express power of disposition in favor of his children given him by the will. It is true that the will exonerates him from the obligation of making an inventory and rendering an account. But these dispensations are insufficient to constitute a gift of the property in his favour, they do not make him a legatee. Although relieved from the obligation of furnishing an account, he would still be liable to the heirs or universal legatees, if he made any fraudulent disposition of the property, and would be bound at the close of his administration to hand over the residue of the estate to those beneficially entitled[19].\nThen the question arises, whence is the power derived to bind the estate to the prejudice of the heirs by the endorsements which Hardoin Lionais made for the accommodation of his son Charles? Not from the law, for it is clear that no such authority is incidental to the powers conferred by the articles of the code, which define the authority of testamentary executors. If any such power exists, it must, therefore, be found in the express provisions of the will. Then to which of these provisions is it to be referred? It is out of the question to say that it is comprised in the duty which the testatrix has devolved upon the executor of providing for the subsistence, education and establishment of the children. Endorsing accommodation bills is surely not within any of these provisions. The establishment of a child means setting him forth in the world, and Charles Lionais was a man already extensively engaged in business on his own account, when his father endorsed the notes in question. Further, the pledging the credit of the estate contingently and conditionally, by a cautionary obligation, such as that undertaken by an accommodation endorser, cannot possibly be considered as a proper mode of establishing or advancing a child, and cannot therefore be presumed to have been contemplated by the will.\nThere only remains the power to make a division of the property which is contained in these words:\nEt subsidiairement, je d\u00e9sire que mon dit \u00e9poux \u00e8s-qualit\u00e9s, apr\u00e8s mon d\u00e9c\u00e8s, fasse la disposition et le partage de la totalit\u00e9 ou de partie de mes biens, tant en propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qu'en usufruit, fruits et revenus, comme il le jugera convenable et dans le temps qui lui para\u00eetra opportun, lui donnant toute la latitude possible dans et pour l'administration de mes dits biens, et leur ali\u00e9nation et disposition, et laissant enti\u00e8rement \u00e0 sa discr\u00e9tion la mani\u00e8re de retirer et percevoir, placer et employer les fruits et revenus et int\u00e9r\u00eats provenant de mes dits biens ainsi que les capitaux d'iceux, et le soin de pourvoir comme il l'entendra au soutien, \u00e0 la subsistance, \u00e0 l'\u00e9ducation et \u00e0 l'\u00e9tablissement de tous ou aucun de mes enfants, et lui donnant l'autorit\u00e9 et le pouvoir de l\u00e9guer et partager mes dits biens pu portion d'iceux, selon ce qu'il jugera \u00e0 propos, \u00e0 et entre tous mes dits h\u00e9ritiers eu aucun d'eux soit par testament, donation entre-vifs ou autre disposition testamentaire ou autrement \u00e0 sa discr\u00e9tion; ma volont\u00e9 \u00e9tant que mon dit \u00e9poux \u00e8s-qualit\u00e9, ne soit aucunement li\u00e9 dans ses op\u00e9rations et dispositions par les termes dans lesquels est con\u00e7u l'article troisi\u00e8me ci-dessus \u00e9crit, lequel article ne peut et ne pourra en aucun cas, \u00eatre interpr\u00eat\u00e9 comme conf\u00e9rant un droit absolu d'h\u00e9r\u00e9dit\u00e9 en faveur d'aucun de mes dits h\u00e9ritiers, mais uniquement un droit \u00e9ventuel, sujet aux dispositions libres de mon dit \u00e9poux, \u00e8s-qualit\u00e9.\nEn sorte que mes dits h\u00e9ritiers ne pourront, en tout \u00e9tat de choses, pr\u00e9tendre qu'\u00e0 ce que mon dit \u00e9poux, \u00e8s-qualit\u00e9, d\u00e9cidera de leur accorder respectivement on \u00e0 aucun d'eux si toutefois il juge \u00e0 propos de le faire, dans la proportion qu'il jugera convenable, et \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque qu'il croira la meilleure, \u00e0 sa discr\u00e9tion, sans que mes dits h\u00e9ritiers ou aucun d'eux ne puissent jamais r\u00e9clamer et revenir contre les actes, op\u00e9rations et dispositions de mon dit \u00e9poux \u00e8s-qualit\u00e9, que je laisse enti\u00e8rement libre sous tous rapports.\nEt ma volont\u00e9 est que mes dits biens, tant en propri\u00e9te qu'en usufruit, capitaux, fruits et revenus tant meubles qu'immeubles soient et restent insaisissables et ne puissent \u00eatre saisis, vendus et d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9s, ou l'un ou l'autre, que pour les dettes propres de ma succession, c'est-\u00e0-dire, celles auxquelles j'ai ou aurai souscrit ou suis ou serai partie, et pour nulles autres dettes.\nThe fair meaning and interpretation of the provision of the will appears to me to authorize only a direct disposition in favour of the children of the testatrix, either by testament, donation inter vivos, or in some analogous manner, and if it stood alone, and the construction which I put upon it was not, as I think it is, greatly strengthened by other parts of the will, I should be prepared to hold that the executor was not empowered to carry out the dispositions which the testatrix left him free to make by undertaking cautionary obligations for the benefit of one of the children.\nWhen I find, however, that the testatrix has explicitly declared that her property, moveable as well as immoveable, shall not be liable to execution for any debts except the proper debts of her succession, which she further explains to be those which she shall have herself subscribed, or to which she was or should become a party, it seems to me that she has by express words prohibited her executor from conferring benefits on the children or any of them in the indirect manner insisted on by the respondent here, viz.: by the endorsement of accommodation bills to be paid out of the funds of the estate, in case the party principally liable should make default in paying them; for it is impossible to give effect to this provision of the will without accepting it as equivalent to a declaration that such endorsements as those in respect of which this judgment was recovered should not bind the estate. But even granting that the pretentions of the respondents were so far well founded as to require us to hold that an indirect benefit of this kind was intra vires of the executor, I should still be unable to acquiesce in the result at which the courts below have arrived.\nIt would even in that case still be necessary to show that the executor intended to exercise the power to give conferred upon him. But how could it be said that any such intention is apparent in the present case? There is no pretence for saying that the executor ever made any express declaration of an intention to execute the bounty of the testatrix in this irregular manner. Nor is anything shown to warrant the presumption of fact that the executor in endorsing the notes in question intended conditionally or contingently, in case he was called upon to pay them, to appropriate a portion of the estate corresponding in amount to Charles Lionais. In point of fact no such intention could be presumed, for the plain reason that the notes were endorsed in reliance on the credit and solvency of Charles Lionais, and in the expectation that he would pay them; and it was not contemplated that the estate would be called upon to make good the undertaking of the executor. As to any legal presumption of such an intention, none can be suggested sufficiently supported by either principle or authority to call for any argument in refutation. Then a fair test by which to ascertain whether the endorsements were, in fact, made with the intention of exercising in favour of Charles Lionais the liberality with which the testatrix had entrusted her executor, is to ask this question; could Charles Lionais, if his father had thought fit to pay and to retire the notes, and had so done, and had then sued him upon them, have opposed any defence founded on the will to such an action by the executor? It is manifest from the facts in evidence that he could not, but on the contrary that Charles Lionais would, if the notes were to be now taken up by the executor, be liable to have judgment recovered against him by the executor for their amount\u2014at least so far as such an action has not been prescribed. This consideration, seems to me, to show conclusively that the endorsement can not be considered as a donation to Charles Lionais out of the testatrix's estate to the amount of the notes, and if it cannot be said to be a donation or exercise of liberality authorized by the will, the executor had no more power to bind the estate for debts of Charles Lionais than for those of any stranger.\nTherefore the direct proof being all against the existence of any such intention, there is nothing to show that the executor, even if he had had power to give in such an indirect manner, ever intended so to exercise the powers conferred on him by the will.\nLastly, I am of opinion with Mr. Justice Cross that Art. 972, by itself and independently of the preceding considerations as to the powers of the executor, is a sufficient ground for maintaining this opposition, and that, by force of the express terms of the article referred to, the clause in the will exempting the property of the testatrix from execution is valid and must be given effect to.\nAs regards the power of attorney. That is not proved nor produced, and it is out of the question to say that it can make any part of the case against the present appellants upon the opposition which they have formed to the seizure. The judgment itself is res inter alios acta as regards them, and if they are not bound by the judgment, they certainly cannot be bound upon the mere presumption as to the terms of a document not to be found in the record of which the judgment forms part. Had the opposants been put in cause in the original action, and had this power of attorney been traced to their possession, then on their refusal to produce it, a presumption as to its contents might perhaps have been made against them, but it does not appear ever to have been in their possession, and if it was they have never declined to produce it. Had it been proved on the contestation of the opposition, it might, if its terms had been sufficiently extensive, have warranted the Court in maintaining the seizure, but no reference appears to have been made to it, so I regard it as entirely out of the case.\nI am for reversing the judgments appealed against with costs in both the Courts below, and for maintaining the opposition with costs.\nFOURNIER, J.:\u2014\nBien que dans cette cause il ne s'agisse que d'une question d'interpr\u00e9tation de quelques clauses d'un testament, il est cependant n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 cause d'une objection faite \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure adopt\u00e9e par les appelants, de donner un expos\u00e9 des plaidoiries au moyen desquelles les parties ont li\u00e9 contestation, afin de s'assurer si les questions a d\u00e9cider ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement soumises.\nLa Banque Molson, intim\u00e9e, a obtenu contre le d\u00e9fendeur en cette cause, Hardoin Lionais, un jugement pour la somme de $8,963.83, montant de certains billets promissoires qu'il avait endoss\u00e9s en qualit\u00e9 d'ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire et administrateur de la succession de dame Henriette Moreau, son \u00e9pouse d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e,\u2014ainsi que contre E. M. Charles Lionais, le faiseur de ces billets. En ex\u00e9cution de ce jugement, l'intim\u00e9 a fait saisir sur le d\u00e9fendeur Hardoin Lionais des immeubles dont il est en possession en sa qualit\u00e9 susdite.\nLes appelants, seuls enfants du d\u00e9fendeur Hardoin Lionais et de son \u00e9pouse, dame Henriette Moreau, ont par opposition demand\u00e9 la nullit\u00e9 de cette saisie en se fondant sur le testament de leur m\u00e8re contenant les clauses suivantes qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la contestation en cette cause[20].\nLes appelants all\u00e8guent que dame Henriette Moreau est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, le 21 d\u00e9cembre 1874, sans avoir r\u00e9voqu\u00e9 son testament, lequel a \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9 avec un certificat de son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, le 30 d\u00e9cembre, m\u00eame ann\u00e9e.\nQu'en sa qualit\u00e9 d'ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire et d'admimistrateur, le dit Hardoin Lionais a pris possession de toutes les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s d\u00e9laiss\u00e9es par sa dite \u00e9pouse et les a administr\u00e9es,\u2014que dans le cours de son administration, il a outre pass\u00e9 ses pouvoirs, et qu'il a sans autorit\u00e9 endoss\u00e9 les billets promissoires sur lesquels a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu jugement en cette cause contre lui;\nQue la dite Henriette Moreau n'a jamais endoss\u00e9 les dits billets,\u2014ni contract\u00e9 les dettes pour laquelles les dits billets ont \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9s,\u2014que les dites dettes, non plus que les dits billlets, n'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits pour l'avantage de sa succession, mais bien au contraire \u00e0 son d\u00e9triment.\nQu'ils sont l\u00e8s seuls enfants issus du mariage de dame Henriette Moreau avec Hardoin Lionais, et, par cons\u00e9quent, les seuls l\u00e9gataires universels en pleine propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et en usufruit de sa succession, int\u00e9ress\u00e9s \u00e0 la conservation des dits biens et \u00e0 faire d\u00e9clarer que la saisie d'iceux est nulle et ill\u00e9gale, attendu que les biens de la dite succession sont, par les termes de son testament d\u00e9clar\u00e9s insaisissables, et qu'ils ne peuvent \u00eatre saisis et vendus que pour les dettes contract\u00e9es par la dite Henriette Moreau elle-m\u00eame, ou pour l'avantage de sa succession, tandis que la dette pour laquelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu le jugement sur lequel est fond\u00e9e la saisie n'est pas une de ces dettes.\nL'intim\u00e9e a plaid\u00e9 \u00e0 cette opposition que le testament de dame Henriette Moreau, en outre des pouvoirs d'ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire et administrateur, conf\u00e8re \u00e0 Hardoin Lionais le pouvoir de disposer de sa succession en la mani\u00e8re indiqu\u00e9e dans les clauses ci-dessus cit\u00e9es. Elle all\u00e8gue de plus que pendant au moins trente ans Hardoin Lionais a, par des moyens frauduleux, mis ses biens \u00e0 l'abri des recherches de ses cr\u00e9diteurs, en pla\u00e7ant au nom de sa femme tous les profits des sp\u00e9culations qu'il faisait et qui composent aujourd'hui en grande partie la succession de sa femme. Que cette derni\u00e8re en faisant son testament avait l'intention de laisser \u00e0 son mari le contr\u00f4le de ses biens de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 emp\u00eacher les cr\u00e9anciers de son mari de les saisir. Qu'en cons\u00e9quence, la clause d'insaisissabilit\u00e9 est sans effet, et que les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s peuvent \u00eatre saisies comme appartenant \u00e0 Lionais lui-m\u00eame, et comme s'il \u00e9tait le l\u00e9gataire universel de la succession.\nLes appelants ont r\u00e9pondu sp\u00e9cialement que les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s saisies appartenaient en pleine propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 leur m\u00e8re qui les avait, en vertu de son testament, d\u00e9clar\u00e9es insaisissables. Ils niaient aussi sp\u00e9cialement l'all\u00e9gation de fraude en se r\u00e9servant le droit de la faire dispara\u00eetre du dossier.\nLa preuve sur la contestation ainsi li\u00e9e consiste dans les productions faites par les parties et dans l'admission de faits qui suit:\nQue les dits opposants sont les seuls enfants tous majeurs, issus du l\u00e9gitime mariage du d\u00e9fendeur et de son \u00e9pouse, feue dame Henriette Moreau.\nQue la dite dame Henriette Moreau est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al le 21 d\u00e9cembre 1874. Que le testament de la dite dame Henriette Moreau, a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7u par C. A. Terroux et coll\u00e8gue, notaires, le 18 juillet 1868, qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment enregistr\u00e9 avec une d\u00e9claration du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de la dite testatrice.\nQue la dette pour laquelle le jugement en cette cause a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu, a \u00e9t\u00e9 contract\u00e9e par Charles Lionais, apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de la dite dame Henriette Moreau.\nQue les immeubles saisis en cette cause, font partie et d\u00e9pendent de la succession de la dite dame Henriette Moreau.\nL'admission de fait consentie par l'intim\u00e9e que les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s saisies en cette cause formaient partie des biens de la succession de dame Henriette Moreau, met \u00e0 n\u00e9ant cette partie de son ploidoyer all\u00e9guant fraude de la part de Hardoin Lionais pour mettre ses propri\u00e9t\u00e9s \u00e0 l'abri des poursuites de ses cr\u00e9anciers. Cette question \u00e9cart\u00e9e, il ne reste \u00e9videmment que la question d'interpr\u00e9tation du testament. C'est maintenant la seul contestation entre les parties. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9e contre eux par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure dont le jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par une majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc de la Reine. C'est de ce dernier jugement dont ils appellent. Avant d'entrer dans la consid\u00e9ration du m\u00e9rite de cet appel, je dirai quelques mots de l'objection soulev\u00e9e contre la proc\u00e9dure. L'intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend que les appelants auraient d\u00fb attaquer par le moyen de la tierce opposition le jugement rendu contre Hardoin Lionais, au lieu de s'opposer \u00e0 son ex\u00e9cution en le consid\u00e9rant quant \u00e0 eux comme res inter alias judicata. Il n'est pas douteux qu'ils auraient pu adopter cette voie; et l'intim\u00e9e pour \u00e9viter de voir plus tard son jugement attaqu\u00e9, aurait sans doute mieux fait de faire juger la question de l'\u00e9tendue des pouvoirs de Hardoin Lionais contradictoirement avec ses enfants en les mettant en cause avec lui.\nCes derniers n'ayant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en cause \u00e9taient-ils oblig\u00e9s, pour attaquer le jugement d'employer la voie de la tierce opposition? Non. Ce mode d'attaque \u00e9tant facultatif, ils ont pu l\u00e9galement renouveler la contestation sur une question qui n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e avec eux. Les autorit\u00e9s suivantes font voir que la voie adopt\u00e9e par les opposants leur \u00e9tait ouverte.\nL'article de notre Code de proc\u00e9dure au sujet de la tierce opposition est au m\u00eame effet que celui du Code Napol\u00e9on[21].\nToutes personnes dont les int\u00e9r\u00eats sont affect\u00e9s par un jugement rendu dans une cause o\u00f9 ni elle ni ceux qui la repr\u00e9sentaient n'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9s, peut y former opposition.\nCode Napol\u00e9on[22]:\nUne partie peut former tierce-opposition \u00e0 un jugement qui pr\u00e9judicie \u00e0 ses droits, et lors duquel, ni elle ni ceux qu'elle repr\u00e9sente n'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9s.\n\"L'art. 474[23] dit bien qu'une partie peut former tierce-opposition, etc., mais il ne dit pas qu'elle est tenue de prendre cette voie; il ne lui \u00f4te pas la facult\u00e9 de se borner \u00e0 dire que le jugement qu'on lui oppose, n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu avec elle; qu'il lui est \u00e9tranger; que ce jugement est \u00e0 son \u00e9gard comme s'il n'existait point: que c'est, en un mot, res inter alios acta.\n\"Ainsi la tierce-opposition est purement facultative, et si nous avons dit sur la quest. 1682, que l'on peut forcer d'intervenir celui qui aurait droit de se rendre tiers opposant \u00e0 un jugement \u00e0 rendre, on ne peut en conclure qu'il ait besoin d'user de ce droit pour emp\u00eacher que le jugement ne produise ses effets contre lui; le droit de le contraindre \u00e0 cette intervention n'est \u00e9tabli qu'en faveur de la partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e \u00e0 ce que le jugement qu'elle poursuit soit rendu contradictoirement avec lui[24].\" On peut donc l'attaquer pour cause de fraude, de collusion, etc., ou faire juger qu'il est res inter alios acta.\n\"Ainsi celui qui n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 partie \u00e0 un jugement qui pr\u00e9judicie \u00e0 ses droits, peut en pr\u00e9venir l'ex\u00e9cution \u00e0 son \u00e9gard, en l'attaquant par tierce-opposition, soit principale, soit incidente.\n\"Mais il n'est pas tenu de prendre cette voie; l'art. 474, C. Pr., ne lui \u00f4te pas la facult\u00e9 de se borner \u00e0 invoquer la maxime res inter alios judicata aliis non nocet.\n\"Ainsi jug\u00e9 que la tierce-opposition n'est point n\u00e9cessaire contre un jugement dans lequel on n'a point \u00e9t\u00e9 partie; cons\u00e9quemment, une demande en partage contre laquelle on oppose un jugement rendu avec une autre partie, doit \u00eatre appr\u00e9ci\u00e9e, nonobstant le rejet de la tierce-opposition.\" Bioche[25].\nInd\u00e9pendamment de la facult\u00e9 qu'avaient les appelants d'adopter l'un ou l'autre des moyens, qui leur \u00e9taient ouverts, il faut remarquer que l'intim\u00e9e ni dans ses plaidoyers ni dans son factum devant la Cour du Banc de la Heine, ni devant cette cour, n'a fait objection \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure adopt\u00e9e par les appelants. Elle les a suivis sur le terrain qu'ils avaient choisi et elle a li\u00e9 contestation avec eux. Cette contestation est l\u00e9galement li\u00e9e comme on le voit par les autorit\u00e9s ci-dessus cit\u00e9es.\nIl ne doit en cons\u00e9quence rester pour l'examen de cette cour que les questions d\u00e9cid\u00e9es par les deux autres cours, savoir:\u20141\u00b0 Si Hardoin Lionais, en vertu des pouvoirs qui lui sont conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par le testament, peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme ayant autorit\u00e9 pour lier la succession de Dame Henriette Moreau par des endossements consentis en sa qualit\u00e9 d'ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire et d'administrateur de cette succession en faveur de Charles Lionais, un de ses fils, sans avoir re\u00e7u aucune valeur ou consid\u00e9ration pour les endossements 2\u00b0 Si les biens que Lionais est charg\u00e9 d'administrer comme ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire ont \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9s insaisissables.\nLa solution de ces questions d\u00e9pend uniquement de l'interpr\u00e9tation \u00e0 donner aux clauses ci-dessus cit\u00e9es de ce testament.\nL'hon. juge Sicotte qui a rendu en premi\u00e8re instance le jugement en cette cause, a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9, ce testament comme donnant \u00e0 Hardoin Lionais un droit absolu de propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Dans une autre cause o\u00f9 la m\u00eame question a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e, l'hon. juge Jett\u00e9 a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que Lionais ayant le droit de disposer des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s pour l'\u00e9ducation, le soutien et l'\u00e9tablissement des enfants, cela devait comprendre le droit d'endosser des billets pour aider Charles Lionais dans son commerce; de plus, qu'ayant par le testament le pouvoir de disposer des biens en faveur des enfants ou de l'un d'eux, \u00e0 son gr\u00e9 soit par testament, donation entrevifs ou autrement, ces pouvoirs devaient aussi comprendre celui de donner les endossements qu'il avait consentis en faveur de Charles Lionais.\nDans une autre cause, l'hon. juge Papineau a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 la m\u00eame chose. Il y a encore une cause cit\u00e9e dans le factum de l'intim\u00e9e o\u00f9 la question d'insaisissabilit\u00e9 des m\u00eames biens a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e; l'hon. juge Johnson a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans cette m\u00eame cause que comme il s'agissait d'une dette de la succession m\u00eame, la question ne pouvait pas alors \u00eatre soulev\u00e9e. Cette d\u00e9cision n'affecte pas les questions soumises sur le pr\u00e9sent appel. Dans la Cour du Banc de la Reine les opinions ont aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 partag\u00e9es. Les autres d\u00e9cisions portent sur le m\u00e9rite de cette cause.\nEst-il vrai, comme l'a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 l'hon. juge Sicotte, que Hardoin Lionais est propri\u00e9taire absolu, malgr\u00e9 le legs universel de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 fait en faveur de celui ou de ceux des enfants de la testatrice qu'il lui plaira d'indiquer.\nLe testament donne, \u00e0 la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, des pouvoirs tr\u00e8s \u00e9tendus \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire. Usant de la facult\u00e9 que donne au testateur l'art. 921 du Code Civil, la testatrice a, par l'art. 4 de son testament, autoris\u00e9 son ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire et administrateur \u00e0 vendre et hypoth\u00e9quer les biens de la succession, les c\u00e9der, \u00e9changer, hypoth\u00e9quer, ali\u00e9ner ou autrement en disposer, soit en propri\u00e9t\u00e9 soit en usufruit, etc., l'autorisant \u00e0 faire, signer et ex\u00e9cuter tous billets, ch\u00e8ques, etc., et tous autres documents requis; et g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00e0 faire tous actes de la plus enti\u00e8re administration. Tous ces pouvoirs ne sont donn\u00e9s que pour des fins d'administration. La d\u00e9claration en est plusieurs fois r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e par la testatrice. Dans la 5me clause, elle d\u00e9clare lui donner toute la latitude possible dans et pour l'administration des dits biens. Encore dans cette m\u00eame clause en parlant de la dur\u00e9e des pouvoirs conf\u00e9r\u00e9s, la testatrice dit \"cette administration et ex\u00e9cution, mon dit \u00e9poux les conservera sa vie durant.\" Si \u00e9tendus qu'ils soient ces pouvoirs ne sont \u00e9videmment que des pouvoirs d'ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire et d'administrateur; ils ne sont nullement ceux d'un propri\u00e9taire. Il n'y a pas une seule expression dans ce testament qui conf\u00e8re \u00e0 Hardoin Lionais, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ou m\u00eame l'usufruit des biens en question. C'est en s'appuyant sur l'\u00e9tendue des pouvoirs m\u00eame que l'on essaie d'en tirer l'induction qu'en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 il en est non seulement l'administrateur, mais le propri\u00e9taire Cette induction serait juste si l'on pouvait consid\u00e9rer les pouvoirs donn\u00e9s en faisant abstraction de la qualit\u00e9 d'ex\u00e9cuteur. Lionais a droit de vendre, c'est vrai, mais comme administrateur et ex\u00e9cuteur son pouvoir de vendre est limit\u00e9 par sa qualit\u00e9 d'ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire. Il ne peut pas vendre personnellement, pour son profit et avantage. Il ne pourrait donner un titre valable.\nChaque fois qu'il exerce un des nombreux pouvoirs conf\u00e9r\u00e9s, ce doit \u00eatre en sa qualit\u00e9 d'ex\u00e9cuteur. La testatrice se sert plusieurs fois de cette expression pour d\u00e9signer l'exercice par son mari de ses fonctions d'ex\u00e9cuteur testamemtaire. Il ne peut pas agir en autre qualit\u00e9, et dans l'appr\u00e9ciation des actes qu'il fait on ne doit jamais perdre de vue qu'il n'a le pouvoir de les faire que \u00e8s-qualit\u00e9. Alors il ne peut plus \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme propri\u00e9taire absolu; les termes du testament s'y opposent.\nPar l'art. 4me, Lionais est aussi dispens\u00e9 de faire inventaire, et m\u00eame de rendre compte. Le 5me, le dispense aussi de rendre aucun compte de sa gestion ou de ses op\u00e9rations, tant envers les h\u00e9ritiers de la testatrice qu'envers toutes autres personnees que ce soit. On s'est encore appuy\u00e9 sur ces exemptions pour en conclure que Hardoin Lionais doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme propri\u00e9taire des biens. Ces exemptions sont autoris\u00e9es par l'art. C. C. 916. Le testateur peut limiter l'obligation qu'a l'ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire de faire inventaire et de rendre compte de l'ex\u00e9cution de sa charge, ou m\u00eame l'en dispenser enti\u00e8rement. Quant \u00e0 l'effet de cette dispense, j'adopte \u00e0 ce sujet l'opinion que l'honorable juge Cross a exprim\u00e9 dans ses notes sur cette cause en l'appuyant des autorit\u00e9s qu'il a cit\u00e9es. Il peut sans doute r\u00e9sulter de cette dispense un avantage pour l'ex\u00e9cuteur, mais cela ne peut le constituer l\u00e9gataire de ce qui reste. La suite de cet article (911) en contient une d\u00e9claration expresse en ces termes: \"Cette d\u00e9charge n'emporte pas celle de payer ce qui lui reste entre les mains, \u00e0 moins que le testateur n'ait voulu lui remettre la disposition des biens sans responsabilit\u00e9, le constituant l\u00e9gataire, ou que les termes du testament ne comportent autrement la d\u00e9charge de payer.\" Dans le cas actuel on ne peut pas dire que la testatrice ait voulu remettre ses biens \u00e0 son ex\u00e9cuteur, ni en faire son l\u00e9gataire, puisqu'elle l'a charg\u00e9 d'en faire lui-m\u00eame la distribution, et qu'elle a institu\u00e9 des l\u00e9gataires universels par la disposition suivante:\nArticle 3me.\u2014Je donne et l\u00e8gue tous mes biens, meubles et immeubles, propres et acquets, meubles meublants, argenterie, dettes actives, cr\u00e9ances, actions ou parts de banque, deniers comptants, valeurs, c\u00e9dules et obligations, et toutes autres g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement quelconques, que je d\u00e9laisserai \u00e0 mon d\u00e9c\u00e8s, sans en rien excepter ni r\u00e9server, de quelque nature qu'ils soient, et en quelques lieux et endroits qu'ils se trouvent sis et situ\u00e9s, aux enfants issus de mon mariage avec le dit Hardoin Lionais, mon \u00e9poux, et en cas du pr\u00e9d\u00e9c\u00e8s d'aucun d'eux, aux enfants n\u00e9s du ou des pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9s, en l\u00e9gitime mariage par repr\u00e9sentation.\nA l'effet de quoi je les institue mes l\u00e9gataires universels en propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et jouissance, sujet toutefois, aux restrictions et conditions exprim\u00e9es en l'article 5 ci-apr\u00e8s.\nLa testatrice a apport\u00e9 il est vrai des restrictions \u00e0 cette institution, en chargeant son ex\u00e9cuteur par l'art. 5 de faire lui-m\u00eame le partage et la disposition de la totalit\u00e9 ou de partie de ses biens, comme il le jugerait convenable, s'en rapportant seulement \u00e0 lui pour la subsistance, l'\u00e9ducation et l'\u00e9tablissement de leurs enfants; lui donnant le pouvoir de partager et l\u00e9guer ses biens ou portion d'iceux, etc., lorsqu'il le jugerait \u00e0 propos, ou entre tous ses h\u00e9ritiers ou \u00e0 aucun d'eux, ajoutant que sa volont\u00e9 \u00e9tait que son dit \u00e9poux es-qualit\u00e9, ne f\u00fbt aucunement li\u00e9 dans ses op\u00e9rations et dispositions par les termes de l'article troisi\u00e8me, lequel ne pouvait en aucun cas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme conf\u00e9rant un droit absolu d'h\u00e9r\u00e9dit\u00e9 en faveur d'aucun de ses enfants, mais uniquement un droit \u00e9ventuel, sujet aux dispositions libres de son dit \u00e9poux \u00e8s-qualit\u00e9.\nSi la disposition donnant \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cuteur le droit de faire le partage des biens est l\u00e9gale, elle doit avoir son effet, rien dans le testament ne s'y oppose; il n'y a pas d'autre disposition de la pleine propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des biens que celle faite par l'art. 3, sous les restrictions ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9es\u2014les autres ne concernant que l'administration. Il n'y a aucune contradiction entre ces clauses, elles ne sont pas incompatibles et doivent par cons\u00e9quent recevoir leur ex\u00e9cution.\nQuant au pouvoir de la testatrice de charger son ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire de faire la distribution de ses biens, il n'est aucunement contraire \u00e0 la facult\u00e9 illimit\u00e9e de tester, et sa l\u00e9galit\u00e9 en est parfaitement d\u00e9montr\u00e9e par l'honorable juge Cross, aux notes duquel je r\u00e9f\u00e8re, ainsi qu'aux autorit\u00e9s qu'il a cit\u00e9es, ainsi qu'\u00e0 celles cit\u00e9es dans le factum des appelants. Cette question ne peut faire difficult\u00e9.\nDe ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je conclus que Hardoin Lionais n'est ni l\u00e9gataire ni propri\u00e9taire absolu, qu'il n'est qu'ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire et administrateur avec des pouvoirs tr\u00e8s \u00e9tendus, c'est vrai, mais pour g\u00e9rer et administrer seulement.\nD'apr\u00e8s le code, les pouvoirs de l'ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire sont assimil\u00e9s \u00e0 ceux du mandataire\u2014ce sont par cons\u00e9quent les principes du mandat qui doivent r\u00e9gir la conduite de l'ex\u00e9cuteur.\u2014Sur ce point la cause n'offre pas de difficult\u00e9.\nLa divergence d'opinion s'\u00e9l\u00e8ve sur l'\u00e9tendue des pouvoirs conf\u00e9r\u00e9s. Si consid\u00e9rables qu'ils soient, comportent-ils l'autorit\u00e9 en faveur de Hardoin Lionais de consentir des endossements de billets comme il l'a fait, sans consid\u00e9ration, pour Charles Lionais? Le testament lui donne bien le pouvoir de faire, signer et ex\u00e9cuter des billets, mais il est tout-\u00e0-fait silencieux \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des endossements. La diff\u00e9rence entre ces deux sortes d'actes est essentielle Dans le premier, le faiseur du billet agit pour son int\u00e9r\u00eat personnel, et il est cens\u00e9 avoir re\u00e7u valeur ou consid\u00e9ration pour l'engagement qu'il signe. Dans le second, il donne simplement un cautionnement pour la dette d'an autre sans en retirer aucun avantage. L'autorisation de signer un billet comme faiseur ne peut pour cette raison comporter celle d'endosser. La responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e9tant beaucoup plus consid\u00e9rable dans le second cas, que dans le premier; un ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire ou autre mandataire ne pourrait lier la succession ou son mandant sans une autorisation sp\u00e9ciale, car le mandataire doit se renfermer exactement dans les bornes de son mandat. Pothier[26]. Il en sortirait \u00e9videmment en donnant un cautionnement ou endossement sans consid\u00e9ration, quand il n'est autoris\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 signer un billet pour valeur re\u00e7ue et pour des fins d'administration seulement.\nOn trouve au 5me vol. L. C. Rep.[27], une cause qui a beaucoup d'analogie avec celle-ci, c'est celle de Castle v. Baby. Dans cette cause il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'un agent rev\u00eatu du pouvoir de vendre, \u00e9changer, conc\u00e9der les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s mobili\u00e8res et immobili\u00e8res, de composer, ref\u00e9rer \u00e0 arbitres, etc., enfin d'agir aussi amplement et effectivement que la mandante elle-m\u00eame aurait pu le faire en personne, n'avait cependant pas le pouvoir de faire et escompter des billets promissoires comme agents.\nLa Cour du Banc de la Reine a maintenu cette m\u00eame doctrine dans deux causes rapport\u00e9es dans le 21 vol. L. C. J.[28], Serre dit St. Jean v. La Banque Metropolitaine, et dans celle de Symes contre la m\u00eame banque[29].\nDans Parsons[30], on trouve cit\u00e9es plusieurs causes dans lesquelles il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l'autorit\u00e9 de faire des billets ne comporte pas celle d'en endosser.\nL'intention de la testatrice de ne conf\u00e9rer que des pouvoirs d'administration, et non des droits de paiements \u00e0 Hardoin Lionais, est encore d\u00e9montr\u00e9e par la pr\u00e9caution qu'elle a prise de d\u00e9clarer tous ses biens insaisissables, par la clause suivante: \"Et ma volont\u00e9 est que mes dits biens, tant en propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qu'en usufruit, capitaux, fruits et revenus, tant meubles qu'immeubles, soient et restent insaisissables, et ne puissent \u00eatre saisis, vendus et d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9s ou l'un ou l'autre, que pour les dettes propres de ma succession, c'est-\u00e0-dire: celles auxquelles j'ai ou aurai souscrit, ou suis ou serai partie, et pour nulles autres dettes.\" La testatrice pouvait l\u00e9galement attacher cette condition d'insaisissabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 sa lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9[31]. En d\u00e9clarant que ses biens ne pouvaient \u00eatre saisis que pour ses propres dettes et pour nulles autres dettes, n'\u00e9tait-ce pas clairement limiter les pouvoirs de l'ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire \u00e0 ceux d'administrateur seulement? Si elle avait eu l'intention de lui donner le pouvoir de lier sa succession d'une mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, elle n'aurait certainement pas pu imposer cette condition d'insaisissabilit\u00e9; car on ne peut s'affranchir du paiement des dettes que l'on a contract\u00e9es ou que l'on autorise \u00e0 contracter. L'imposition de cette condition fait voir la limite impos\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9tendue des pouvoirs. Elle ne peut \u00eatre dans le cas actuel consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme un simple conseil donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cuteur, puisqu'il n'est pas l\u00e9gataire. En vue du legs universel, elle doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme impos\u00e9e en faveur des l\u00e9gataires universels auxquels elle voudrait faire parvenir ses biens.\nMais on r\u00e9pond \u00e0 cette observation en disant que ceux-ci n'ont qu'un droit \u00e9ventuel. L'honorable juge Tessier a fait justice de cet argument par un raisonnement si fort et si juste que je crois devoir le citer en entier:\u2014\nIl est vrai qu'il est dit que le droit des enfants n'est qu'\u00e9ventuel, mais ceci s'applique au droit r\u00e9serv\u00e9 au p\u00e8re de partager et donner ces biens \u00e0 ceux des enfants qu'il choisira; c'est l\u00e0 la seule \u00e9ventualit\u00e9, il n'a pas le droit d'en disposer en faveur d'\u00e9trangers. Le legs est absolu en faveur d'un, ou de deux, ou de trois, ou des quatre enfants, mais le p\u00e8re peut disposer du tout en faveur de l'un, c'est \u00e0 cause de cela que le droit devient \u00e9ventuel pour les autres, d\u00e9pendant de cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement, mais s'il n'en dispose pas en faveur des uns au pr\u00e9judice des autres enfants, ils restent en parts \u00e9gales l\u00e9gataires absolus en propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et en usufruit.\nPour justifier les endossements en faveur de Charles Lionais, l'intim\u00e9e invoque aussi la disposition du testament donnant pouvoir \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire de pourvoir \u00e0 la subsistance, \u00e0 l'\u00e9ducation et \u00e0 l'\u00e9tablissement de tous ou chacun des enfants de la testatrice. Si la preuve \u00e9tablissait que l'ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire a exerc\u00e9 ces pouvoirs en endossant pour son fils Charles, toute difficult\u00e9 cesserait; mais c'est tout le contraire qui est prouv\u00e9. Charles Lionais \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9tabli lorsque son p\u00e8re a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 endosser pour lui. Il ne l'a fait, comme il le dit dans son t\u00e9moignage, que dans le but d'aider son fils \u00e0 passer quelques \u00e9poques difficiles dans ses affaires; mais toujours avec la certitude que celui-ci paierait ses billets. Il ajoute que s'il avait cru que Charles Lionais n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 capable de payer ses billets, il ne les aurait pas endoss\u00e9s. Il d\u00e9clare aussi qu'il n'a jamais eu en cela l'intention de lui faire aucune lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 en vertu du testament, les endossements ne peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme une donation. L'ex\u00e9cuteur ne pouvait donner qu'une chose qui existait dans la succession et en observant les formalit\u00e9s voulues en pareils cas C.C. art. 776, et en se d\u00e9partissant de son droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 dans la chose donn\u00e9e, art. 777 C.C. Quel droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 pouvait-il avoir dans les fonds emprunt\u00e9s par son fils de la Banque Molson? Aucun. Il n'avait fait qu'encourir avec lui l'obligation de rendre ces fonds \u00e0 la Banque. Il est en cons\u00e9quence impossible de consid\u00e9rer ces endossements comme lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9s faites en avancement d'hoirie. La nature de la transaction et la preuve s'y opposent. En r\u00e9sum\u00e9 je suis d'opinion que la contestation a \u00e9t\u00e9 bien soulev\u00e9e par les plaidoiries et qu'il y a lieu de d\u00e9cider les questions jug\u00e9es en premi\u00e8re instance.\nQue Hardoin Lionais n'est pas propri\u00e9taire absolu des biens mentionn\u00e9s dans le testament de dame Henriette Moreau, son \u00e9pouse, qu'il n'avait pas le pouvoir de consentir les endossements des billets sur lesquels a, \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu le jugement en cette cause, le condamnant \u00e0 payer $8,963.83.\nQue la clause d'insaisissabilit\u00e9 est l\u00e9gale et que les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s appartenant \u00e0 la succession de Henriette Moreau, saisies en cette cause, sont exemptes de saisie et ne peuvent \u00eatre vendues pour le paiement des endossements en question.\nL'appel doit \u00eatre allou\u00e9.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nI am of opinion that, under the will, Lionais had no power to bind the estate by becoming endorser for one of his sons. It was not carrying out the objects of the will. Although power is given to him to manage the estate in any way he likes, still he has to do it with a view to dividing it amongst the children of the party who made the will. He was not required to account to them, but it was clearly the intention of the testatrix that the children should have the benefit of the property. He was restricted by the terms of the will in such a way that he could pay nothing and become answerable for nothing, except what was really a debt due by the succession. He then undertakes to bind the estate as surety for his son, and it is stated that that is giving to the son an advance in pursuance of the will. But he swears that he never expected to pay the notes, and the evidence shows that he only pledged the security of the succession as security, and he expected that the son would pay the debt at maturity. Surely then, that cannot be taken as an act of an executor in pursuance of the terms of the will, or looked upon as an advance in favor of one of the legatees.\nThen, as to the question whether the parties could make opposition in the way in which they have done? I can see no difficulty at all in their doing so. They had no notice of the suit in which the judgment was taken, and I can find nothing in the code of procedure to prevent them from doing so. They are coming in and showing that the judgment is wrong and should never have been given against the estate so as to bind the property of the succession. I think they can do so at any time, when that property is subject to seizure or about to be seized. I fully concur in the views that I have heard expressed by my learned brother Fournier on all the points of the case. It is unnecessary for me to repeat them. After a full consideration of the case, I think the appeal should be allowed, and the judgment of the court below reversed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\u2014\nThe respondents (The Molson's Bank) have obtained a judgment for the sum of $8,963.83 against the defendant, Hardoin Lionais, in his quality of testamentary executor and administrator to the estate of his wife, the late Mrs. Henriette Moreau, for the amount of certain promissory notes made and signed by Charles Lionais, one of his children, and endorsed by the said defendant, Hardoin Lionais, in his said quality.\nAn execution was issued against the said defendant es-qualit\u00e9, and certain real estate of the late Mrs. Henriette Moreau, which he detained in his said capacity, was seized and advertised for sale by the sheriff of the district of Montreal.\nThe appellants, who are the only children of the defendant Hardoin Lionais and his said wife Dame Henriette Moreau, opposed the sale of the property seized by an opposition in which they allege:\n\"That by her testament and last will dated 18th July, 1878, received before Mtre C. A. Terroux and colleagues, notaries, in the city of Montreal, Dame Henriette Moreau, the wife of the defendant Hardoin Lionais, bequeathed all her property, moveable and immoveable, in ownership and in usufruct to the children born of her marriage with the said Hardoin Lionais, appointing them her universal legatees, and in the event of the decease of any one of them, his share to revert to the survivors.\n\"That by the said will, the said Hardoin Lionais was appointed testamentary executor and administrator of the said estate.\n\"That by a clause (5) of her will, the said Dame Henriette Moreau decreed and ordered that all her property, whether moveable or immoveable, the principal, the usufruct and the rents and revenues thereof shall be and remain insaisissable and could not be seized nor sold, save and except only for the personal debts of the said testatrix, viz.: for those debts only which she should have herself subscribed during her life time, and for no other debts.\n\"That the said Dame Henriette Moreau departed this life at Montreal, on the 21st December, 1874, without having revoked her said will, which has been duly en-registered according to law, with a certificate of her death, on the 30th December, 1874.\n\"That in his capacity of testamentary executor of the said Dame Henriette Moreau, and as administrator to her estate, the said Hardoin Lionais has taken possession of all the property and has administered it, but that he, the said Hardoin Lionais, although acting in good faith, has nevertheless outgone the powers conferred upon him, and without any authority has endorsed without receiving any value or consideration therefor, certain promissory notes, to wit: those for which the judgment in this cause has been rendered.\n\"That the said Dame Henriette Moreau has never subscribed to, nor been a party to the debt for which the said promissory notes have been given; that the said debt was not contracted nor said notes given for the advantage or benefit of her estate, but on the very contrary, said debt is onerous and detrimental to its interests.\n\"That the said opposants are the only children, issue of the lawful marriage of the said late Dame Henriette Moreau with the said Hardoin Lionais, and they are consequently the only universal legatees as well in ownership as in usufruct of the property of the said estate, and that they are all interested in the safe-keeping and conservation of said property, and in having it declared that the seizure made in this cause of part of the real estate left by the said Dame Henriette Moreau, is null and illegal and must be set aside, in as much as said real estate is exempt from seizure by the terms of the will, insaisisable, and can only be seized and sold for debts subscribed to by the said Dame Henriette Moreau herself, or for the benefit of her estate, whereas the debt for which judgment has been rendered and said seizure made, is not one of those.\n\"Wherefore the said opposants pray that the said seizure of the said immovable property be set aside and annulled, and that it be declared that the said immovable property cannot be seized in execution of the judgment rendered in the present cause against Hardoin Lionais in his said quality of executor and administrator to the estate of the late Dame Henriette Moreau.\"\nIssue having been joined by the bank with the opposants on the said opposition, the Superior Court dismissed the opposition and held that the said immovables could be seized in execution of the judgment rendered against Hardoin Lionais in his said quality, that is to say, against the estate. On appeal, the Court of Queen's Bench confirmed the judgment of the Superior Court. The opposants now appeal to this court.\nI am decidedly of opinion to dismiss their appeal. The features of this case are such that I do not hesitate to say I would have been very sorry indeed to find myself obliged to come to a different conclusion. One of the opposants is the same Charles Lionais for whom these notes were endorsed and who, upon the security of these endorsements, got the bank to advance him the amount it endeavors to recover in the present case. Here is a man who went to the bank with certain endorsements, obtained money on the security of these endorsements, and who, now, that the bank exercises its action against the endorser, claims the right to intervene, and, on the ground that his endorser had not the right so to endorse for him, tries, with the assistance of his brothers, the other opposants, and with the connivance of his father the defendant and the said endorser, to hinder and stop the execution of the judgment obtained by the bank on such endorsements. Can such a contention, on his part, be entertained? Is he not estopped from taking such a position?\nAs I have already remarked, the judgment is not against Hardoin Lionais, personally, but against him as administrator and executor of the said estate. It follows, of course, that it is not executory against any property of Lionais himself other than the property coming from his wife. If executory at all, it must be so against the estate only. This seems to be undeniable. Then so long as the judgment stands against the estate, it must be executory against the estate. It follows that it is the judgment that the opposants should have impugned, either by requ\u00eate civile or ti\u00e8rce opposition\u2014if, as they contend, their father had no authority to bind the estate by endorsing notes in the name of the estate. Their allegation, in the opposition, that their father had no authority to endorse notes in the name of the estate would be perhaps a sufficient ground of opposition to the judgment, but it is not a valid ground of opposition to the seizure. As long as the judgment stands and is allowed to stand against the estate, it is chose jug\u00e9e that their father had a right to endorse notes in the name of the estate as he did.\nI cannot, however, leave the appellants under the impression that they might with any chance of success attack the judgment. I am of opinion with the two courts below that Hardoin Lionais had full power and authority to endorse notes for one of his sons as he has done, and to bind the estate thereby. The appellants, it seems to me, fall into the error of treating this case, as if Hardoin Lionais had so endorsed not for one of his sons, but for a third party, a stranger. That would be a different case, and would raise different questions which we have not to determine here. The endorsements made by Hardoin Lionais in his quality of executor and administrator of his wife's estate have been made to assist one of his and the testatrix's sons in his trade and business. He certainly had the power to do so under the will. He had the power to give even all the estate to this son, Charles, and this, either by \"donation \"entre-vifs ou autrement \u00e0 sa discr\u00e9tion:\" he had the power to borrow from the Bank any amount, one, two, three hundred thousand dollars to mortgage all the estate for it, and place the sum, in Charles's busines, either as a loan or a gift to him. Gould the appellants then have contended, that though their father had clearly the right to give such a mortgage, yet the Bank could not have recovered upon the mortgage because the will says that all the estate is to be insaisissable. That is what he did virtually here: he did not grant a special mortgage to the Bank\u2014a mortgage is only a cause of preference between creditors\u2014but he borrowed from the Bank in the name of the estate to assist his son: all the estate then has become le gage de la cr\u00e9ance, because the debt itself is the debt of the succession. Hardoin Lionais could even have sold any part of the estate, or even the whole of it, and have put the proceeds into Charles's business. The clause of insaisissabilit\u00e9 clearly cannot apply to a debt contracted for the estate or in the name of estate, and authorized by the will. Mr. Justice Tessier admits this, though the learned judge differed as to the right of Hardoin Lionais to endorse for his son.\nI am of opinion with the two Courts below, and the six judges out of eight who have had this will under consideration, that Hardoin Lionais had full power to so endorse for one of his sons, and that by doing so he bound the estate. The judgment dismissing the appeal should therefore be confirmed.\nGWYNNE, J.:\nIn the judgment of my brother Taschereau I fully concur, but I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed, and the contestation of the opposants fail upon this single ground, that upon them is cast the burthen of establishing beyond all doubt, and by the most conclusive evidence, that the estate of a testator is not liable to be seized and sold upon an execution issued to enforce a judgment obtained against his executor in the character of executor. In this case the estate of the testatrix is prim\u00e2 facie liable to satisfy the judgment recovered against the administrator of her will in his character of administrator; the opposants can only displace this prim\u00e2 facie liability by clear proof of the contrary, and such proof must be complete in omnibus. They profess to do so by producing the will of the testatrix, by which, however, it appears that she declared her will and desire to be, that her husband, whom she made administrator of her will, besides the special powers conferred upon him as named in the will, should be clothed for the purpose of administration of the testatrix's estate, and she, by her will, clothed and invested him, with all the powers, rights and authority which she had conferred upon him by a power of attorney, which she had granted to him the 7th July, 1854, executed before Mr. Moreau et son confr\u00e8re, notaries, and that in as perfect a manner as if all and each one of the clauses inserted in the said power of attorney formed an integral part of her last will and testament, her desire being that under the title of testamentary administrator and executor he should continue to exercise after her death the same rights and powers which he had in virtue of her said power of attorney, which she, by her will, ratified and confirmed in every particular, as well all the acts, transactions and matters, and generally everything which he had already done, and everything which he shall do in the future, both before and after her decease, in virtue of that same power of attorney and of her said will.\nNow, until the opposants produce, and they have not produced, this power of attorney so confirmed with the powers therein contained made part of her will, it cannot be said that the testatrix's administrator had not full power and authority to do the very act for the doing which the judgment recovered against him in his character of administrator was recovered. The opposants therefore have failed to prove the issue, the whole burthen of proving which, is cast upon them, and which they have assumed to prove.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Doutre & Joseph.\nSolicitors for respondents: Barnard & Beauchamp.\n[1] 26 L.

J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry Taschereau and Gwynne, JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND.\nPromissory Note\u2014Notice of dishonor by post sufficient\u201437 Vic., ch. 47, sec. 1 (D).\nThe Merchants Bank of Halifax (appellants) as holders of promissory notes endorsed by McN. (respondent) brought an action against him for their amount. The notes were dated at Summerside, and were payable at the agency of the Merchants Bank of Halifax, Summerside. The defendant resided at the town of Summerside, and his place of business was there. Notices of dishonor were given to defendant by posting such notices, addressed to the defendant at Summerside, at 1 o'clock p.m. on the day after the day on which the notes matured, the postage on such notices being duly prepaid in both cases. There is no local delivery by letter carriers from the post office in Summerside. No evidence was given by defendant that he did not receive the notices of dishonor, nor was any evidence given by the plaintiffs that the defendant had received them. The jury found for the defendant, contrary to the charge of the learned judge. A rule nisi having been granted to set aside this verdict, and for a new trial, the court discharged this rule nisi and directed the verdict to stand, on the ground that the posting of the notices of dishonor to the defendant was not sufficient notice of dishonor, inasmuch as both plaintiff and defendant resided in the same town, and the notices of dishonor should have been delivered to the defendant personally, or left at his residence or place of business.\nHeld, (reversing the judgment of the court below), that since the passing of 37 Vic. ch. 47, sec. 1, the notices given in the manner above set forth were sufficient. APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island.\nThe following was the special case stated for the opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada.\n\u201cThis cause came on for trial before Hensley, J., and a common jury, at Summerside in Prince County, at the term of the court held there in June, 1882.\n\"At the trial it appeared that the defendant duly endorsed to the plaintiffs the promissory notes mentioned in the first and second counts of the declaration, and that these notes were discounted at the agency of the plaintiffs' bank at Summerside.\n\"The maker of these promissory notes made default in payment of them as they respectively became due, and notices of dishonor were given to the defendant by posting such notices, addressed to him at Summerside aforesaid, at one o'clock p.m. on the day after the day on which the notes matured, the postage on such notices being duly prepaid in both cases.\n\"The defendant resided at the town of Summerside, and his place of business was there. There is no postal delivery by letter carriers.\n\"No evidence was given by the defendant that he did not receive the notices of dishonor, nor was any evidence given by the plaintiffs that the defendant had received them.\n\"The judge, at the trial, directed the jury to find a verdict for the defendant on the first count of the declaration, he being of opinion that a chattel mortgage (referred to in his judgment) was a discharge to the defendant of his liability upon the note mentioned in that count, inasmuch as time was given to the maker; but as regards the note mentioned in the second count, their verdict should be for the plaintiff for the amount of that note and interest. \"The jury found a verdict for the defendant on all the issues.\n\"In Trinity Term, 1882, a rule nisi was granted to set aside this verdict and for a new trial.\n\"This rule nisi was argued in Michaelmas Term, 1882, and judgment delivered in Hilary Term, 1883, discharging this rule and directing the verdict to stand on the ground that the posting of the notices of dishonor to the defendant was not sufficient notice of dishonor to the defendant, inasmuch as both plaintiffs and defendant resided in the same town, the court holding that the notices of dishonor should have been delivered to the defendant personally, or left at his residence or place of business.\n\"The judgment of the court was delivered by Hensley, J., a copy of which forms part of this case.\n\"It is agreed that the only question intended to be raised on the present appeal, is\u2014\n\"Were the notices of dishonor sufficiently given by addressing the same to the defendant at Summerside in the manner before set forth?\n\"If the court should be of opinion that these notices were sufficiently given, it is agreed that the appeal should be allowed, the verdict of the jury in the court below set aside, and a new trial ordered.\nE. J. Hodgson, Q.C., for appellants, contended:\n(1) The notices of dishonor were sufficiently given pursuant to the provisions of the 37th Vic., ch. 47.\n(2) Even independent of this statute, the posting of a notice through the post office is sufficient. Chalmers on Bills of Exchange ([1]); Slocken v. Collin ([2]) ; Woodcock v.Houldsworh ([3]); Mack'ay v. Judkins ([4]); Cosgrave v. Boyle ([5]). L. H. Davies, Q.C., for respondent:\n\"Where the holder and endorser of a promissory note reside in the same town and there is no postal delivery in such town by letter carrier, the simple posting of a notice of dishonor in the post office addressed to the endorser is not sufficient notice unless proof is given that he received it on the day after the dishonor of the note, and the law is not altered by 37 Vic., ch. 47, sec. 1.\nHe cited, inter alia, Story, Prom. Notes ([6]); Story, Bills of Exchange ([7]); Daniel Neg. Instruments ([8]); Chitty on Bills ([9]); Crosse v. Smith ([10]); Stocken v. Collin ([11]).\nRitchie, C.J.:\u2014\nThis was an action against defendant as indorser of two promissory notes. Maker made default. The notes were dated Summerside, and were payable at the agency of the Merchants Bank, of Halifax, Summerside. The defendant resided at the town of Summerside, and his place of business was there. Notices of dishonor were given to defendant by posting such notices addressed to the defendant at Summerside, at 1 o'clock p.m. on the day after the day on which the notes matured, the postage on such notices being duly prepaid in both cases. There is no local delivery by letter carriers from the post office in Summerside. No evidence was given by defendant that he did not receive the notices of dishonour, nor was any evidence given by the plaintiffs that the defendant had received them. The jury found for the defendant, contrary to the charge of the learned judge. A rule nisi having been granted to set aside this verdict, and for a new trial, the court discharged this rule nisi and directed the verdict to stand, on the ground that the posting of the notices of dishonour to the defendant was not sufficient notice of dishonour, inasmuch, as both plaintiff and defendant resided in the same town, the notices of dishonour should have been delivered to the defendant personally, or left at his residence or place of business.\nThe only question raised on this appeal is, were the notices of dishonour sufficiently given by addressing and posting the same to the defendant, or in the manner before set forth.\nDefendant's contention is, that as the plaintiffs carried on business, and the note became due and payable, in Summerside, and the defendant also resided in Summerside, the notice should have been served personally, or at the place of the indorser's abode or business.\nPlaintiffs contend that, whatever the law formerly might have been, it is now, since the passing of the Dominion statute 37 Vic., ch. 47, sec. 1, quite sufficient, even where the parties do reside in the same place, to give notice as done in the present case, through the post office.\nThe words of the section in question, are as follows:\nNotice of the protest or dishonour of any bill of exchange, or promissory note, payable in Canada, shall be sufficiently given if addressed in due time to any party to such bill or note entitled to such notice, at the place at which such bill or note is dated, unless any such party has, under his signature on such bill or note, designated another place, when such notice shall be sufficiently given if addressed in due time to him at such other place; and such notices so addressed shall be sufficient, although the place of residence of such party be other than either of such before-mentioned places.\nThe word \u201caddressed\u201d in this statute refers to the place at which a letter directed to the indorser will find him; the place to which it is addressed need, by no means, be either the place of his residence or of his business; it is fixed without reference to either by arbitrarily dating the note at any given place. The simple addressing the note to the indorser, if nothing more was done, would amount to no notice; it must be put in the way of reaching the indorser. What is the usual way of transmitting a letter so as to reach a stranger, but through the post office? The holder having received a note dated at a particular place, what is there in the statute to require him to seek out the actual place of residence, or place of business, of the indorser, with which the statute intended he should have nothing to do, and of which he may be entirely ignorant? It was not, in my opinion, the intention of the statute that he was to deal with the notice, addressed in accordance with the provisions of the statute, in one way if he discovers the indorser lives in the same town or city, as he, the holder, and in another manner if he lives a mile or so outside of the town or city at which the note is dated. Suppose the holder and indorser, as in this case, were at Summerside, but the note should have been dated Charlottetown, surely a notice addressed to the indorser at that place and mailed, would be sufficient, or if the parties resided in Charlottetown and the note was dated Summerside, a notice addressed and mailed to the indorser there, would be likewise clearly sufficient; then what possible objection can there be to an indorsee addressing the notice and mailing it at Summerside, having pre-paid all postage that could be exacted? I can find nothing in the statute to indicate that any duty of making inquiry as to the residence of an indorser, before determining how the notice should be given, is imposed on the holder; on the contrary, I think the object of the statute was to relieve holders from the necessity of making any such inquiry, and to prevent any such issue being raised as that on which this case was decided in the court below, and simply to enact that if you date a note at a particular place, a notice addressed and mailed to you there, without reference to your actual place of residence or business, shall be sufficient. If you wish a notice sent or mailed to any other place, you must under your signature on such note designate it. The principles enunciated in the case of Cosgrave v. Boyle ([12]), as to the object and policy the legislature had in view in passing this statue are, in my opinion, quite as applicable to this case, as to that case, though it is very true the point then before the court was not the same, and as I thought in that case, so I think in this case, we should give full force and effect to this enactment and not unnecessarily limit its operation, and thereby necessarily hamper commercial and banking operations, which it was obviously the object of the legislature to simplify.\nStrong, J., concurred.\nHenry, J.:\u2014\nThe inconsistency of the position taken by the defendant in this case, the respondent now, is, that admitting the law to be that if this note fell due in Charlottetown, the bank there could post a letter to him at Summerside. It would go to the same office at Summerside as the notice that was posted in this case; but he says that although the law may be that you can post a notice in Ottawa to my address in Summerside, if the note falls due in the same town you cannot proceed in the same way. There is no reason at all, I think, to support such a contention. If the law allows the holder of a note to give notice through the post office 1,000 miles away, is that notice the less perfect because it is put in the identical way office in the village when the note is payable in that village? It appears to me the very moment we decide that under the Act, a notice posted from Charlottetown to Summerside would be good, we must decide that a letter by any means put into the way office or post office at Summerside is also regular. I can see no more reason for personal service where the parties reside in the same town than if he lived in another. I think, not only in the decision in the case referred to, but in others that have come before this court, according to all the authorities the contention cannot be sustained, and therefore the appeal ought to be allowed with costs.\nFOURNIER, TASCHEREAU and GWYNNE, JJ., concurred in allowing the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: E.

During the continuance of the policy the company notified A. that the insurance would be terminated, and advised him t\u00f2 insure elsewhere. Such notice also stated that unearned premiums would be returned, but no payment or tender of same was made according to conditions of policy. A. took policy to agent of insurers, who was also agent of the W. Ins. Co., and left it with him, directing him to put risk in latter company. No receipt was given, and property was destroyed by fire immediately after. Company resisted payment on th\u00e8 ground that policy was surrendered, arid contended on the trial) in addition, that C had parted with his interest in the property by giving a deed to one B. who had re-conveyed to C.'s wife, and that proper proofs of loss had not been given, claiming, in reply to a plea of waiver in regard to such proofs, that such waiver should have been in writing, according to a condition in the policy. They had refused to return policy on demand.\nHeld\u2014reversing the judgment of the court below, Fournier J. dissenting, that C. had an insurable interest in the property at the time of the loss, as the husband of the owner in fee and tenant by the courtesy initiate, and having had also an insurable interest when the insurance was effected, the policy was not avoided by the deed to B. That the company, by wrongfully withholding the policy, were estopped from claiming that proofs, of loss had, not, been given according to endorsed condition, and were equally estopped from setting up the condition requiring waiver of such proofs to be in writing if such condition applied to waiver of proofs of loss.\nThat the measure of damages recoverable by tenant for life of the insured premises is the full value of sub promises, to the: extend of the sum insured.\nPer Fournier J. dissenting, that the sending of the circular by the company, and; compliance with its terms, by the assured in giving up the policy to the company's agent, was a surrender of said policy, and plaintiff therefore could not recover.\nUnder the practice in Nova Scotia, where the wife is improperly joined as co-plaintiff with the husbands the suit: does not abate) but the-wife's name must be struck outs of the record and the case determined as if brought by the husband alone.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, setting aside a verdict for the plaintiffs and ordering a non-suit. The facts of the case are fully stated in the judgments delivered by the court.\nJ. Gormully for the appellants:\nThe respondents are estopped from setting up the defence of want of proof of loss within time specified. First, by their wrongful act in withholding our policy. They cannot take advantage of a, delay caused by their own delay. Secondly, having based their refusal to pay upon the ground of cancellation, of the policy they cannot now resist on other grounds. Dimock v. New. Brunswick Mar. Ins. Co.[1]; Bowes v. National Im. Co.[2].\nIf the defence is open to them, it was waived by agent asking appellants to delay putting in proof, and court below was wrong in deciding that waiver: should have been in writing. Post v. Etna Ins. Go[3]; Bowes v. National Ins. Co.[4]; Van Allen v. Farmer's Ins. Co.[5]; Priest v. Citizen's Mur. Fire Ins. Co.[6]. The twelfth condition does not affect proofs of loss. Priest v. Citizen's Ins. Co.[7]; Bowes v. National.\nThe damages were not excessive. Woodhouse v. Whitley[8]; Alsager v. Parker[9]. If they were the court below should not have considered them, the ground not being in the rule nisi.\nP. B. Casgrain Q.C. for respondents:\nBy the deed from Caldwell to Bayers his interest in the property insured ceased and never revived. The contract being one of indemnity, is strictly personal. Wood on Fire Ins.[10]. The policy does not attach to the building, but merely secures the owner from damage by fire.\nAt the time of the loss Caldwell held only in right of his wife, and could neither have insured himself or continued the original insurance. Wood on Fire Ins.[11]. It may be claimed that Caldwell had a life interest as tenant by the courtesy, which is insurable. Admitting that to be so, it was not the interest insured by the respondents. Caldwell having been divested of his interest in the property during the continuance of the policy, it could only revive in his own name and favor. Res perit domino is the maxim applicable to the case. McCarty v. Commercial Ins. Co.[12]; Wood on Fire Ins.[13] and cases there cited.\nBut in any case the respondents are not liable. The act of Anderson in giving the policy to Greer with instructions to put it in the Western, was a release of any claim against the respondents and an acceptance of another company as insurers. The contract with the Western was complete. Robertson v. Dudman[14]. We rely too on the failure to give proofs of loss within five days. The agent had no authority to waive a forfeiture. Wood, sec 393.\nThe appellants claim that having refused payment on a special ground, we must be held to waive other objections. I submit that is not so. Wood, p. 723, sec. 417; p. 705, sec. 414.\nThe action should have been brought by Anderson either in his own name or in the name of Caldwell for his benefit. The latter would be the best course. Wood, p. 818, sec. 88.\nThe damages are excessive. At the most the appellant only had a life interest in the policy, and evidence of value of that interest should have been given to the jury. The judgment of the court below should be sustained.\nJ. Gormully in reply.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C. J.\u2014This was an action upon a policy of insurance under seal against fire, dated 10th August 1875, whereby defendants' company, after reciting that Samuel Caldwell had paid them $25 for insuring against loss by fire $4,000.\nOn a one and a-half storey wooden building, situate on the west of the Kempt road, at corner of the street leading to Willow park, in the city of Halifax, N.S., owned and occupied by the assured as a dwelling, in the sum of four thousand dollars.\nThe building is isolated, being over 100 feet to nearest building.\nLoss, if any, under this policy payable to George K., Anderson, Esq. Halifax N. S., for a year from the said tenth day of August 1875; and had agreed to pay to the company on the 10th day of August in every succeeding year during the continuance of said policy the like sum of twenty-five dollars; it was declared that subject to the conditions endorsed on said policy and which constituted the basis of said insurance, the said Samuel Caldwell, should be paid out of the capital stock and funds of said company, and the funds and property of the said company, except the funds for the time being of the life department thereof as defined by the Act of incorporation, should be subject and liable to pay and make good to the said Caldwell the amount of all such loss or damage by fire as should happen to the property in the said policy mentioned, not exceeding the amount insured thereon as aforesaid, during the said year from the said tenth day of August A.D. 1875, or at any time afterwards, so long as the plaintiffs should pay the said sum of twenty-five dollars yearly as aforesaid, and the directors of the said company for the time being should accept the same.\nAnd the declaration alleged:\u2014\nThat the only condition on said policy endorsed, material to the plaintiff's cause of action or essential to the said contract of insurance, is as follows:\u2014\"All persons insured by this company sustaining any loss or damage by fire, are immediately to give notice to the company or its agents, and within five days after such loss occurred are to deliver as particular an account of their loss or damage as the nature of the case will admit of, and make proof of the same by their declaration or affirmation and by their books of, account, or by such other proper evidence as the directors of this company or its agents may reasonably require, and until such declaration, account and evidence are produced the amount of such loss, or any part thereof, shall not be payable or recoverable;\" and that the plaintiffs at the time of the making of the said policy, and thence and until and at the time of the damage and loss hereinafter mentioned were, or one of them was, interested in said premises so insured as aforesaid to the amount so insured thereon, and after the making of the said policy and whilst it was in force the said premises so insured as aforesaid were burnt, damaged and destroyed by fire, whereby the plaintiffs suffered, damage and loss on the said dwelling-house to the amount insured on as aforesaid, and all conditions, were fulfilled and all things happened and all times elapsed 5necessary to entitle the plaintiffs to maintain this action, and nothing happened or was done, to prevent the plain tiffs from maintaining the same.\nThe conditions of the policy as set put in the case, are as follows:\u2014\nNo. 2. And if by reason of such, alteration or addition, or from, any other cause whatever, the company or its agents shall desire, to terminate the, insurance effected by this policy, it shall be lawful for, the company or its agents so to do by notice to the insured or his representative, and to require this policy to be given up for the purpose of being cancelled, provided that in any such case the company shall refund to, the insured a ratable proportion for the unexpired term thereof of the premium received for the insurance.\nNo. 8, Damage to buildings not totally destroyed shall be appraised by disinterested men mutually agreed upon by the assured and the company or its agents, and where merchandize or other personal property is partially damaged the assured shall forthwith cause it to be put in as good order as the nature of the case will let, assorting and arranging the various articles according to their kinds, and shall cause a list or inventory of the whole to be made naming the quantity and cost of each kind. The damage shall then be ascertained by the examination and appraisal of such damage on each article by disinterested appraisers mutually agreed upon, whose detailed report in writing shall form a part of the proofs required to be furnished by the assured, who shall pay all fees and expenses incurred in the substantiation of the claim. A copy of the written portion of this policy to be given in the affidavit of the assured in all cases.\nNo. 9. All persons insured by the company sustaining any loss or damage by fire, are immediately to give notice to the company or its agents, and within five days after such loss or damage has occurred are to deliver as particular an account of their loss or damage as the nature of the case will admit of, and make proof of the same by their declaration or affirmation, and by their books of accounts or such other proper evidence as the directors of this company or its agents may reasonably require 5 and until such declaration or affirmation, account and evidence are produced, the amount of such loss, or any part, thereof, shall not be payable or recoverable; no profit or advantage of any kind is to be included in such claim; and if there appear fraud in the claim made for such loss, or false declaring or affirming in support thereof, the claimant shall forfeit all benefit under the policy.\nNo. 11. It is furthermore hereby expressly provided that no suit or action against the company for the recovery of any claim upon, under, or by virtue of this policy-shall be sustainable in any court of law or equity, unless such suit or action shall be, commenced within the term of six months next after any loss or damage shall occur; and in case any suit or action shall be commenced against the company after the expiration of six months next after such loss or damage shall have occurred, the lapse of time shall be taken and deemed as conclusive evidence against the validity of the claim thereby so attempted to be enforced.\nNo. 12. None of the foregoing conditions or stipulations, either in whole or in part, shall be deemed to have been waived by or on the part of the company, unless the waiver be clearly expressed in writing, by endorsement upon this policy signed by the manager of this company for Canada. Second count that defendants converted the policy to their own use.\nTo this declaration the defendants pleaded thirteen pleas:\u2014\n1st. Non est factum, to first count.\n2nd. Non assumpsit, to first count.\n3rd. That house was not burnt, to first count.\n4th. That plaintiffs were not, nor was either of them interested in house as alleged, to first count.\n5th. And for a fifth plea to said count, defendant company says that the said insurance was effected, and the said policy applied for by the said Samuel Caldwell, who was then owner of said dwelling house, and the loss, if any, under paid policy, was by said policy made payable to one George R. Anderson, and that after the date of said policy and before such alleged loss the said Samuel Caldwell conveyed all his interest in said dwelling house to one Thomas Bayers, and the defendants had no interest therein and sustained no loss or damage from the burning of said dwelling house as alleged.\n6th. That plaintiffs did not within five days deliver account of loss according to conditions.\n7th. That the plaintiffs delivered a false and fraudulent account.\n8th. False representations on application for insurance.\n10th. That before loss defendants by notice terminated insurance according to conditions.\n11th. Same as last, and that plaintiffs delivered up policy to be cancelled, and it was cancelled before loss.\n12th. Numbered 13 in case. Plea to second count that defendants did not convert policy.\n13th. Numbered 14 in case. Plea to second count that policy was not property of plaintiff, but of defendants.\nReplication:\u2014\n1st. To all pleas plaintiff joins issue.\n2nd. To fifth plea.\n2nd. And for a second replication to the fifth plea by like leave, plaintiffs say that they or one of them was at the time of their making said insurance the owner of said house and premises, and although the said building and premises were afterwards formally conveyed to one Thomas Bayers, yet before the said loss the said Thomas Bayers reconvened the same to the said Sarah Caldwell, then and still being the wife of the said plaintiff, Samuel Caldwell, and the said Sarah Caldwell from thenceforth and from the making of said policy, and until and at the time of the said fire and the said loss was the owner thereof and interested therein.\n3rd. As to sixth plea plaintiffs say that defendants waived and dispensed with further or more particular account of loss.\n4th. As to sixth plea plaintiffs did furnish due proof of loss, which defendants accepted as sufficient.\n5th. To sixth plea defendants, by their agent, for good consideration, waived necessity to furnish within five days from loss particular account of said loss, and defendants accepted as sufficient the account furnished within a reasonable time and notified plaintiffs that they would resist loss solely on the ground that the policy had been cancelled.\nRejoinder:\nThe defendant company, as to the replications of said plaintiffs, joins issue thereon.\nAnd for a second rejoinder as to the second, third, fourth and fifth replications, defendants say that the alleged waivers were not clearly expressed in writing by endorsement on said policy, signed by the manager of said company for Canada, as required by the conditions endorsed on said policy.\nThis second rejoinder has no application to the second replication.\nSurrejoinder:\nAnd the plaintiffs join issue upon the second rejoinder to the second, third, fourth and fifth replications, pleaded to the defendants fifth and sixth pleas.\nAnd for a second surrejoinder to the defendant's said second rejoinder, plaintiffs say that the defendants at the time of the happening of the loss of the premises in the declaration mentioned, were in possession of the policy of insurance in this action declared on and kept and detained the said policy ever since, and retest to,, deliver up the same, although the plaintiff demanded, the, same, within the time limited to make and give the proofs of Lost herein, and for the purpose of enabling the plaintiffs to \u0448\u0430ke and furnish the said proofs, and plaintiffs; were: not aware of the conditions on said policy endorsed requiring waivers of proof of loss to \u042c\u0435\u043b\u0430 writing endorsed on said policy, and signed by the manager of the defendant company for Canada, and they were prevented, by reason, of the wrongful detention ot said, policy by the defendant company, from acquiring knowledge of the said conditions, and from complying therewith.\nNor has the surrejoinder any application, so that, in fact, the fifth plea remains unanswered, except by the second replication to that plea, which is clearly bad, and upon which no issue is joined.\nThe following entry appears at the end of Greer's evidence. \"I offer to allow plaintiff to file surrejoinder. Accepted But I \u0441\u0430n find in the case no surrejoinder filed, nor any intimation of the nature of the surrejoinder which the judge says he allowed to be filed.\nAt the end of the case I also find this: \"I allow and minute amendment.\" But I cannot find in the case the amendment or any minute thereof.\nMotion for non-suit on the following grounds:\u2014\n1. Anderson should have been plaintiff.\n2. Policy cancelled under condition 2.\n3. No interest in plaintiff, Caldwell-had-conveyed.\n4. Ninth condition not complied with. Proof not put in in time.\n5. None of these can be waived\u2014waiver not in writing.\n6. Under 11th condition, six, mpnths: a bar actiqn not brought for a year or more.\n7. Under 9th condition, affidavit of Caldwell not true as to ownership, also as to amount of loss.\nThe dates are as follows:\u2014\nSuit commenced 15th February 1878. Tried on May 1880. Judgment for plaintiffs. Policy dated 10th August 1875. Loss, 4th Jul\u0443 1877.\nDeed McKenzie to Caldwell 26th Nov. 1874. Registered 27th Aug. 1875. Deed of confirmation, Letson to Caldwell, dated 26th Aug. 1875, and recorded 27th Aug. 1875.\nDeed from Caldwell to Bayers 2nd Feb. 1876. Registered 14th Feb. 1876.\nDeed from Bayer to Sarah Caldwell, wife of Samuel Caldwell, dated 3rd Feb. 1876. Registered 10th April 1877.\nRenewal receipt on policy from 10th Aug. 1876, to 10th Aug. 1877.\nFrom these dates it appears that the renewal of the policy for the year in which the premises were destroyed was after the deed to Caldwell's wife, though before the same was registered, and, therefore, while Caldwell was interested by reason and in virtue of his marital rights.\nOn the 28th June 1877, the following circular was sent to Anderson, the mortgagee, to whom the insurance money was payable in case of loss, and who had effected the policy for and at the instance of Caldwell.\nHalifax June 28 1877.\nSir:\nI have no inform you that the Stadacona Insurance Company has ordered Site to notify policy holders to insure elsewhere, as the company has decided to wind up. You will, therefore, take notice that your policy of insurance is cancelled from this date. Unearned premiums will be returned hereafter.\nYours, &c.,\n(Sgd.) Gr. M. Greer,\nAgent.\nIt is abundantly clear that this did not terminate the insurance effected by the policy, being neither in accordance with the letter or spirit of the condition, which expressly provides that \"in any such cas\u00e9 the company shall refund to the insured a ratable proportion for the unexpired, term thereof of the premium received for the insurance\" which was by no means complied with by inserting in the notice to insured \"unearned premiums will be returned hereafter,\" instead of paying or tendering them.\nBut it is contended that Anderson, after receipt of this notice, having left the policy with Greer, the agent of the defendants, and likewise the agent of the Western Insurance Co., that this was an acceptance of the special condition and amounted to a surrender of the policy.\nWith respect to this Greer,. Anderson, and Caldwell thus speak.\nGreer, agent of the defendant, says on this point:\nImmediately after the fire all the papers in my possession were sent to head office at Quebec. After fire M. H. Richey called and asked for policy. Anderson came also and demanded it. Caldwell was with him. I asked local board after fire if I should give it to them, and they referred me to head office. I applied by writing, to head office. They did not answer, but the manager came down. I submitted all the facts to him, and asked him if I should give up the policy, and he said \"we must hold on to it and not give it up.\" His name was George J. Pyke. He took it away with him, and I never saw it until to-day. Letter from Pyke, 14th December 1877, put in and read, marked J. A. J.\nI think the only ground urged was that it was transferred to the Western. Pyke said to me \"we are not liable, it is transferred to the Western,\" or to that effect. The company did not object to the proofs of loss. I don't remember if the proof of loss came to me before Pyke left. He was off and on here a few weeks after the fire. The St. John fire was 28th June. I received the proofs of loss and did not object to them. I know of no other objection except the transfer. My agency continued a month or two months after proofs were received. I made no objection to them.\nWhen he brought the policies there was no return premium paid, nor at any time to my knowledge. Return premiums were paid 12 or 18 months after. Can't say Anderson got any. The only reason for sending the notices, so far as I know, was that company were in financial difficulties.\nGeorge R. Anderson.\u2014I received this circular 28th June, 1877, This was before, and on same day I took the policy there.\nCross-examined, Rigby\u2014I insured premises under authority of Caldwell, and charged him premium. Never authorized me to surrender policy. Never agreed to surrender it. I left it with Greer to enable him to take description of property, not for purpose of surrendering it. Never informed Caldwell up to time of fire of the notice I had received. After fire, probably next month, called on Greer with Caldwell. I told him he held policy in trust for Caldwell and me. I demanded it first and he refused to give it up. No. return of premium offered me before action. I received this paper from Greer 9th April 1878. Before that I received no offer of return premium.\nRe-examined, Ritchie\u2014I told Greer when 1 got notice he was acting unfairly by compelling us to change the policies on a half holiday. I said I must have them changed; he said the Western was the best office in Canada. I told him I would leave the policies for him to get the description. I did not get the other Stadacona policies back. Did not ask for them. I am positive I told Greer I left policies for him to get description.\nCaldwell says:\nMr. George R. Anderson effected the insurance for me. I authorized him to do so. I never instructed any person to put an end to the insurance. I did not know the policy had been handed to the company until after the loss. Anderson had a mortgage on the property. I told him to insure in any office he wished; gave him no other instructions.\nRe-examined.\u2014I knew before fire that it was insured in Stadacona. Anderson had whole management of insurance. I did not interfere.\nGeorge M. Greer, agent of defendant company\u2014Remember fire. Was agent then and for about two months after. I was then and am still agent of Western Insurance Company. There was a board of local directors for defendant company. John S. McLean and H. H. Fuller were two of them. 1 issued this policy, I think. I sent it to Mr. G. Anderson. Just before fire on 30th June 1877, I obtained the policy from Mr. Anderson's own hands. I sent him a notice on 28th. He came to my office with this and two other policies, and said, \"Put those in the Western.\" That was all he said. It was not put in Western before fire. Gave no receipt or policy and received no premium. Made no contract. This was the only conversation with him before fire. No conversation with Caldwell until after fire. Sent no notice to Caldwell same as I did to Anderson mentioned above. Did not know Caldwell in the transaction, but knew, of course, that his name was in policy and who he was.\nM. H. Richey, sworn\u2014Was retained to collect the insurance after fire. Immediately after. Waited at once on Greer to ascertain position, as policy was not in the hands of plaintiff, and found that Greer had already notice of loss. He said he supposed I had called on him in reference to that. I gave him notice. Asked him if he had policy. He said he had. I asked him to give it to me to make the necessary proofs. He declined, without communication with his directors, and requested me to wait as there was no necessity for my doing so. At his request I delayed making any proofs until he should communicate with his directors. I called very shortly again, and was informed by him that the directors h\u00e8re would riot authorize delivery without communicating with the head office at Quebec. I called frequently to ascertain the decision of the head office, and deceived no satisfactory answer, until finally thinking sufficient time &ad been afforded, i put in such proof as I could without the policy, did not put the proof in before because I was awaiting the decision of head office whether the defendant company would return the policy to us or not, or whether the transfer of the risk to the Western was effected. I did not receive payment of the claim; payment was refused on the ground that the company had ceased to be liable, not on any other ground. I conversed with others beside Mr. Greer. I conversed with H. H. Fuller and J. S. McLean. Had no direct communication with general manager, except by a letter. This is the letter I received from torn. Date, 14th Dec. 1877. Letter read. No objection was ever offered except that contained in the letter.\n* * * * Greer asked me to delay putting in proofs. He said, I had better wait until he had corresponded with the company the ground of delay was largely to hear whether the Western would recognize the claim so as to know what company to put it into.\nFrom all this it is, I think, abundantly clear that the policy never was surrendered. In the first place, while Anderson had authority to effect the insurance, he had no authority to destroy it, and in the second place, it is, I think, quite clear that the policy was only left with Greer, the agent of both companies, to get the description so as to put the risk in the Western, and when so placed, it was, no doubt, the intention that the risk in the Stadacoha should cease; but I fail to see the slightest evidence of any intention that the liability of the Stadacona should be at an end until the risk was assumed by the Western; in other words, that it was ever contemplated by any party that the property should, for a moment, be without insurance.\nThen, the policy never having been cancelled or surrendered, as to the objection that the proofs of loss required by the conditions of the policy were not put in within the time limited, it is abundantly clear that this was not by or through the act or default of the plaintiffs or their agents, but their not being put in, was at the instance of the defendants and their agents, and the plaintiffs were hindered and prevented from putting them in by the defendants and their agents withholding the policy from the plaintiffs, when they had no right to do so, claiming that the same was cancelled and surrendered, and resting their sole objection to pay the claim on this ground; for which reasons, in my opinion, the defendants were estopped by their own acts and conduct and those of their agents in preventing and hindering the plaintiffs from making and putting in the proofs in accordance with the conditions, and cannot set up the failure to comply with the conditions, caused by their wrongful acts, as a non-compliance with such conditions. But defendants contend that none of the conditions can be waived by reason of the waiver not being in writing, and they invoke the twelfth condition, which says:\u2014\nNo. 12. None of the foregoing conditions or stipulations, either in whole or in part, shall be deemed to have been waived by or on the part of the company, unless the waiver be clearly expressed in writing, by endorsement upon this policy, signed by the manager of this company for Canada.\nAnd the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia rest their judgment on this, that though they think there was evidence of a waiver, a conclusion fully justified by the conduct of the company through their agents, yet they thought a parol dispensation would not answer to act as a waiver against a written condition of the policy.\nBut if condition No. 12 applied to the conditions, as to proofs of loss, I think the court erred in treating this as a waiver, but should have held the defendants estopped by matter in pais from setting up the non-compliance with the condition.\nThere can be no doubt that a husband has an insurable interest in his wife's property. The husband has a freehold estate in the land and the exclusive right of occupation; an indefeasible title to the land which no one can defeat or disturb, which gives him a full and perfect title to the rents and profits of his wife's real estate during the covertures, and, in the event of the birth of a child, after the death of his wife during his life, and he is the proper party to insure the property, for the wife can make no contract in her own name to her own use, and if she could insure the property, in case of loss the insurance money, so soon as paid, would belong to the husband, inasmuch as the wife can acquire no personal property in her own right, as any she may obtain becomes immediately the property of the husband.\nAll that is required is that the insured should have an interest at the time of the insurance and at the time of the loss; and as to that interest, while there can be no doubt the party insured must have an insurable interest in the subject insured, or he can sustain no loss, and therefor if the insured parts with his interest before loss happens so that he has no interest left at the time of the loss, he cannot recover, yet if, pending the continuance of the policy and before loss, he acquires an interest, the policy suspended while he had no interest revives.\nAnd as to the nature and extent of the plaintiff's interest, it need not be stated when the risk is taken.\nIn Crowley v. Cohen[15] Lord Tenterden O.J. said:\nThat in a policy of insurance, although the subject-matter of the insurance must be properly described,' the nature of the interest may in general be left at large.\nLittledale J. makes the same observation.\nParke J. says: The particular nature of the interest is a matter which only bears on the amount of damage; it is never specially set out in a policy.\nAnd Patteson J. says:\nIt is only necessary to state accurately the subject-matter insured, not the particular interest which the assured has in it.\nIn Simpson v. The Scottish Union Fire and Life Insurance Company[16], Sir W. P. Wood V.C. says:\nIt appears to me that a tenant from year to year, having insured his premises for 500. has, if his house is burnt down, a right to have the \u00a3500 applied in rebuilding, for the purpose of reinstating him in premises which have a value to him, as distinguished from their value to his landlord. He may have a good trade, and there may be a number of other things which concern him, and which render the premises worth to him the amount for which he has insured them. It does not appear to me that I ought to contract his rights to the narrow interest that he may be supposed to have merely as tenant of so many buildings from year to year, but that I ought to consider him as having a substantial right to stand upon the policy, and insist upon having the house rebuilt. Beyond this, the landlord has a right, in respect of the tenants interest, to have the property, which the latter insured, rebuilt, in order to avoid the possible consequence of fraudulent insurance contemplated by the statute.\nAnd in Collingridge v. Royal Exchange Ass. Co.[17], (when the terms of the policy were, that the corporation should be liable to pay to the assure any loss or damage by fire to the buildings which should or might happen before 25th March then next ensuing \u00a31,600.)\nLush L. J. says:\u2014\nThe contract is not to make good any loss to the plaintiff, but any damage to his building.\nBut whatever may be said as to the insurable interest of a yearly tenant, there is a great distinction between a tenant from year to year, or for years, and a tenant for life in this that in the case of the former he is in no sense the owner of the property, while, in the latter case, the tenant for life during the continuance of the tenancy, is the absolute owner entitled for the time being to the whole interest in the property, and the rents and profits thereof, and if so, the observations in Laurent v. Chatham Fire Ins. Co.[18], which states the effect of the contract, when the owner insures, would apply; in other words, the whole interest and possession for the time being is in the tenant for life.\nThere certainly is nothing unjust or inequitable in holding the insurers liable for the value of the building to the extent of the sum insured; the insured has paid the premium on the whole sum, and he insures for the entire risk of the property to that amount during the whole term of the policy.\nThis is in no way analogous to the case of a mortgagee, who merely insures his own interest in the property, that is, his debt. In this case there was no specified interest. Here the party insured was, for the time being, interested in the property not only as tenant for life, but as mortgagor to Anderson, and the contract was neither confined to his interest as owner or mortgagor liable for the payment of the debt secured by the mortgage, but the insurers for the consideration of the premium on $4,000 have covenanted if the property is destroyed to pay the amount insured, whereby the assured may indemnify himself by restoring the building, and thereby replacing himself in the exact position he stood in relation to the property, and the full enjoyment of his rights therein that he had before and at the time the fire occurred.\nIt cannot be denied that a tenant for life receives a substantial benefit from the continued existence of the property, and I know of no law prohibiting him from protecting by insurance his interest in the preservation of the buildings erected on the property in which he has an actual interest, or securing their re-erection by the proceeds of such insurance, the interest being \"a real interest in, and issuing out of, the thing insured, and so connected with it as to depend on the subject matter of the thing insured and the risk insured against,\" and which it would require the amount insured to restore to the condition it was at the time of the fire, whereby he would be placed in a position to receive the rents and profits of the property as he was doing before the fire.\nAs to the question of damages, as Mr. Mayne remarks, there is a great dearth of authority in the English reports, but not so in the American reports. In the latter, cases can be found deciding that a lessee of a house from year to year, or for years, cannot recover its entire value on its destruction by fire upon a policy insuring it for its value. In England the same view does not seem to prevail to the same extent, for the contract of insurance being in no way limited either as to nature or amount of interest, when the assured establishes an insurable interest in the property, he is entitled to recover the amount assured, and he is entitled to receive what would restore the property and make it what it was when he insured it, or at any rate what it was at the time of the loss, or as near as the amount insured will do it.\nI am of opinion the appeal should be allowed.\nStrong J.\u2014This was an action in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia brought by Samuel Caldwell and his wife against the Stadacona Assurance Company. The policy of insurance sued upon as originally issued was for one year, namely, from the 10th August, 1875, to 10th August, 1876, but, as is proved by the renewal receipt in evidence, it was subsequently renewed and continued until 10th August, 1877. It was under the seal of the respondent company, and purported to be effected in favor of the appellant, Samuel Caldwell. It contained, however, a provision in the following words: \"Loss, if any, under this policy,: payable to George R. Anderson, Esq., Halifax N.S.V. The policy was subject to conditions, of which those material to the questions which have arisen in this action are the following. The second condition provides that the company might require the policy \"to be given up for the purpose of being cancelled, provided that in any such case the company shall refund to the insured a ratable proportion for the unexpired term thereof of the premium received for the assurance.\"\nThe 9th condition requires particulars and proofs of loss to be delivered \"within five days after such loss or damage has occurred;\" and it also provides that \"if there appear fraud in the claim made for such loss, or false declaring or affirming in support thereof, the claimant shall forfeit all benefit under the policy.\"\nBy the 11th condition \"any action to be brought on the policy is required to be commenced within the term of six months next after any loss or damage shall occur.\"\nThe 12th condition is in these words:\nNone of the foregoing conditions or stipulations, either in whole or in part, shall be deemed to have been waived by or on the part of the company, unless the waiver be clearly expressed in writing by endorsement on this policy, signed by the manager of this company for Canada.\nThe declaration, in addition to a count framed in the usual manner in covenant for the recovery of the amount of the loss, contained a count in trover for the policy. The defences pleaded were, substantially, that the amount of loss was payable to Anderson; that there had been a breach of condition requiring proof s of loss to be delivered within five days; that the proofs of loss were false and fraudulent, within the meaning of the 9th condition; that the plaintiff had, on his application for the policy, been guilty of misrepresentation as to the value of the house; that the policy had been delivered up and cancelled, and the risk terminated. And to the count in trover the defendants pleaded not guilty and not possessed.\nTo the plea of non-delivery of proof according to condition the plaintiff replied a waiver of the condition in that respect, to which the defendants rejoined that the waiver was not in writing, as required by the conditions. Upon the other defences issue was taken.\nAt the trial before Mr. Justice James without a jury the following facts appeared in evidence: On the 2nd February, 1878, the appellants conveyed the property on which the insured building was erected to Thomas Bayers in fee, who, on the next day, conveyed the same to the appellant, Sarah Caldwell, in fee. On the 30th June, 1877, the respondents' agent at Halifax, George M. Greer, sent to Anderson, who held the policy for his security as mortgagee, a circular to the effect that the company had cancelled the policy, adding that \"unearned premiums will be returned hereafter.\" Upon receiving this notice, Anderson, without any communication with Caldwell, handed the policy to Greer, and the respondents from that date held it, until it was produced by them on the trial, having, although it was frequently demanded by Caldwell's attorney, positively refused to deliver it, insisting that it was cancelled. The unearned premium was never returned or offered to be paid to either Anderson or Caldwell. Anderson positively swears that his object in leaving the policy with Greer was to enable him to get the description of the premises, so as to enable him to effect a new policy in the Western Insurance Company, for which Greer was also the agent. Greer does not prove that the policy was delivered up by Anderson for the purpose of cancellation, or that anything was agreed to, either as surrender or cancellation. The proof was also clear and distinct that the delivery of the policy by Anderson to Greer was wholly unauthorized by Caldwell, and without the knowledge of the latter. There was no evidence of any misrepresentation of value by Caldwell in his application for the policy. Greer himself says that Anderson told him that the house cost Mr. Fishwick, a former owner, $6,000, and there is nothing to show that this statement was untrue. The house insured was destroyed by fire on the 4th July, 1877. Notice of a total loss was promptly given to the agent of the company at Halifax, and application was made to him to J deliver up the policy which was in his possession, and for instructions as to the proof of loss required. At his suggestion the putting in of proofs was deferred, to allow him time to communicate with his head office regarding the policy, and ultimately, on the 25th of July, the proofs of loss were furnished by the appellant's solicitor to the agent, who received them without objection, and retained them. Accompanying the proof of loss was a letter from the appellants' attorney, Mr. Ritchie, to Mr. Greer, the respondent's agent, in which he wrote as follows:\nHerewith I hand you proof of loss in the case of Samuel Caldwell, prepared with as close conformity to the requirements of your office as we can attain without the policy, which is now, I understand, in your custody, and I have thus far been unable to obtain it. It is, however, not convenient for my client to longer delay making his claim in this formal manner, and I shall be obliged by your acquainting me, on receipt of this, whether any objection exists to either the claim or the form in which it is prescribed.\nNo objection was ever made, in any particular, to the proofs of loss furnished, and the only contention ever raised by respondents prior to their pleadings to the action was, that they were not liable, because the policy had been cancelled. A letter, dated the 11th December, 1877, from Mr. W. J. Pyke, the general manager of the respondent's company, to Mr. Richey, the plaintiff's attorney, which was put in evidence, leaves no doubt of the fact that this was the only ground on which the company based their denial of liability.\nThe refusal of the respondents to give up the policy for the purpose of preparing the proofs, upon an application being made to their agents for that purpose, was proved by Mr. Richey, the plaintiffs attorney, and also by Mr. Anderson, and the fact was admitted by the respondents' agent, Mr. Greer. Evidence of the value of the house was given by the appellant, Samuel Caldwell, and also by Anderson, who staled that he had advanced $4,500 on mortgage on the property on a valuation of the land at $2,000 and the house at $4,500. There was no testimony to contradict this evidence, and consequently, nothing to establish the alleged fraudulent over-valuation in the proofs of loss.\nA non-suit having been moved for on several grounds included in the numerous list of objections hereafter to be considered, it was refused by the learned judge, who thereupon found a verdict for the plaintiff for $4,000 and interest. A rule nisi, which was granted to set aside this verdict, on the general ground that it was against law and evidence, and on the specific points which were urged at the trial on the motion for nonsuit, was, after argument before the court in banc, made absolute.\nThe judgment of the court below, in granting this new trial, appears to have been founded exclusively upon the single ground that, although a waiver of the requirements of the 9th condition as to delivering proofs or particulars of loss within five days, had been sufficiently made out, if parol evidence had been admissible, yet, that the 12th condition, requiring waiver to be expressed in writing, by endorsement on the policy, applied to and excluded all proof to that effect other than such as was required by the terms of the condition referred to. Upon this appeal no less than nine distinct objections to the appellant's rights to recover have been set up. These may be stated as follows\u20141st. It is said the action should have been brought by Anderson. 2nd. That the misjoinder of the appellant's wife is fatal to the action. 3rd. That the appellant had been guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation as to the value of the assured house in his application for the policy, 4th, That the action not having been brought within six months after the loss, the stipulations of the 11th condition constituted a bar to the appellant's right to recover. 5th. That there was fraudulent over-valuation in the appellant's affidavit delivered to the respondents' agent as proof of loss. 6th. That the appellant Caldwell had not at the time of loss any insurable interest in the property, or had, by reason of his change of interest arising from the alienation in favor of his wife, by means of the conveyance to Bayers, and the re-conveyance of the latter, become disentitled to the benefit of the policy. 7th. That the policy had been duly cancelled and rescinded, pursuant to the terms of the 2nd condition. 8th. That the proof had not been furnished within the five days, as required by the 9th condition, and that all evidence of waiver, otherwise than in writing, was excluded by the 12th condition. Lastly, it was said that, failing all other defences, the measure of the damages which the appellant Samuel Caldwell was entitled to recover, was not the intrinsic value of the house, but only the actual value of his estate or interest during the continuance of the marriage, and subsequently, in the event of., his surviving his wife, as tenant by the courtesy; and that as no proof had been given of the value of such interest, there must, in any event, be a new trial, for the purpose of ascertaining what amount the appellant was entitled to recover in respect of it. Some of these objections were urged as grounds for the non-suit at the trial, but others appear to have been raised for the first time, either in the respondents' factum or on the argument of this appeal; and as the judgment under appeal was on an application for a new trial, it may therefore be doubted if any objection not taken at the trial is now admissible. As it appears, however, that the appellants will not be prejudiced by a consideration of the several points taken on their merits, I proceed to consider them.\nThe first six objections are so ill-founded\u2014some in point of fact, others in point of law\u2014that it is not too harsh a criticism upon the line of defence adopted by the respondents to say that they are frivolous.\nThe policy contains, it is true, the provision already mentioned, that the loss shall be payable to Anderson, but the contract of insurance is in terms embodied in a covenant under seal with the appellant; and the old and well known rule is, therefore, exactly applicable, that if a person covenants with another to pay money to a third person not a party to the covenant, the covenanted alone can sue; and the person to whom the money is payable, being a stranger to the covenant, can maintain no action. It is true that there are some American authorities which, in cases where the policy is not under seal, have recognized a right of action in the person to whom the loss is payable, but these have proceeded upon the principle, inapplicable here, that the person to whom payment is appointed to be made is to be considered a party to the contract. The joinder of Mrs. Caldwell as a co-plaintiff, could only be taken advantage of by a plea in abatement, and constituted no ground of non-suit. The action is to be regarded as that of the husband alone, and the judgment to be entered must be for or against him, disregarding the wife, whose name must be struck out of the record. The defence set up by the eighth plea, that the appellant misrepresented the value of the insured premises in his application for insurance, as I have already pointed out, fails for want of proof. The only evidence in this respect is that of Greer, the agent, who swears that the appellant told him that the house had cost Fishwick $6,000, and there is nothing to show that this statement was not perfectly true. It appears, therefore, that the charge of fraud contained in this 8th plea, was too lightly made by the respondents. The failure to bring the action within six months, as required by the 11th condition, has not been pleaded, which is alone conclusive against such a defence. Moreover, it is apparent that the respondents have, by their conduct in withholding the policy, and insisting on the surrender, estopped themselves from insisting on the benefit of any defence founded on this condition. At all events, it is sufficient to say that the defence is one which should have been pleaded, that the respondents have not asked to be allowed to amend the record by adding the plea, and even if they had, no court, in view of the course of conduct they pursued in the interval, between the loss and the commencement of the action, could, with justice to the appellants, grant them such an indulgence. The allegation of fraudulent over-valuation in the appellant's affidavit delivered in proof of loss, is not only unsubstantiated by any proof on the part of the respondents, but is conclusively disposed of by the evidence of Anderson, who swears that he lent the appellant $4,500, on a valuation of the land and house apportioned as already mentioned. The contract of fire insurance being one of indemnity requires that the insured should have an interest at the date of the insurance, and also at the time of the loss. In the absence of any express stipulation or condition against alienation, there is, however, nothing to invalidate the contract in the fact that, during the currency of the risk, the insured has alienated his interest, provided he has acquired it again before the loss. There is nothing in such a temporary alienation which can, in any way, injuriously affect the rights of the insurers\u2014their liability is, as it has been observed, made less burdensome, as for a portion of the time for which they have been paid the premium, they are without any risk[19]. In no way has any greater liability been imposed upon the respondents by reason of the change of interests in the present case; and as to the argument founded on the delectus persona, there is no room for its application. The appellant, under the conveyance from Mr. Bayers to Mrs. Caldwell, which was to the latter in fee, without any limitation to her separate use, became also seized of an estate in fee simple in right of his wife, which estate he became entitled to during the continuance of the covertures, and was actually in the enjoyment of it, and in possession by his tenant, when the loss occurred; so that in all respects material to the interests of the respondents, the appellant stood in the same relation to the property at the time of the loss, as he did at the date of the insurance. I am not prepared, however, to accede to the proposition, that insurance is so far a personal contract that any change in the possession and control of the property will vitiate the policy. No authority can be produced to show that a policy effected by the owner of the freehold in possession would, in the absence of any condition providing against a change of possession become void, merely because during the pendency of the policy, the property has been demised to a tenant, in whose occupation it remained at the time of the loss. Such cases must be, and are, of frequent occurrence, yet no one ever heard of a mere change of possession being admitted as a good defence to an action on the policy, There is, therefore, no pretence for saying, in the present case, that the appellant had not at the time of the loss, an interest in the insured property covered by the policy. Next, it is insisted that there was a good surrender or cancellation of the policy under the 2nd condition. The material words of that condition have been before stated. There can be no question as to the proper construction of this provision. The condition is a most unreasonable and one-sided stipulation, as it enables one party to a contract to rescind or put an end to it at his pleasure, whilst the other party is not entitled to a like privilege. Moreover, it is grossly unfair, in not providing that notice should be given a reasonable time before the cancellation should take effect, so that the assured might have the opportunity of covering himself by another insurance. These considerations alone ought to induce a court to construe so unjust and harsh a condition with more than ordinary strictness. It is, however, doing no violence to the language of the condition itself, to hold that the repayment of the unearned proportion of the premium is to be a condition precedent to the exercise of the right of rescission, which the company, at its own arbitrary election, is entitled to subject the assured to. The words are in the form of a proviso, which ordinarily imports a condition precedent. And the language thus permitting it, no one could hesitate to adopt a construction which has at least the merit of attributing to the cancellation the character of a rescission, by requiring that the insured shall as nearly as possible, be put in statu quo, rather than that of a forfeiture, which it would be, in fact if not in form, if the condition justified a cancellation such as that\n[Page 239\nproposed by the circular sent by the respondents' agent to Anderson, namely, a cancellation taking place at the arbitrary will of the company, without any return of premium, the insured being bound to rest content with the assurance that \"unearned premiums will be returned hereafter.\" That the effect just attributed to this second condition is its true meaning, is so clear, that authorities need scarcely be referred to to justify that interpretation. It may be as well, however, to refer shortly to a standard treatise on the law of insurance, and a few decided cases, to show that I have not placed an unduly strict construction on the terms of the condition. Mr. May, treating of this question of cancellation in the last edition of his work[20] says:\u2014\nAnd the right can only be exercised by a strict compliance with the terms and conditions upon which it is admissible. If refunding the premium, or a portion of it, be one of the terms, there must be a payment or tender. An agreement with the insured, that he shall return his policy to be cancelled and receive his premium, is no cancellation.\nIt is, therefore, abundantly clear that there never was a cancellation in the present case, for the reason that the terms of the condition were never complied with, for it is not pretended that there was any payment or tender of the premium, the intention being as stated by Mr. Pyke, the general manager of the respondents' company, in his letter of the 14th December, 1877, to Mr. Richey, that the premium should be returned \"hereafter.\" Further, it cannot be said that Mr. Anderson had any power to dispense with the preliminary of repaying the premium, thus accepting what Mr. Pyke is pleased to call a \"special condition,\" whatever that may mean, for it is distinctly sworn to by Anderson that the appellant never authorized him to surrender the policy. Again, Mr. Anderson also states that he never did surrender the policy under the condition in question, but merely handed it to Greer to get the description from it, in order to effect a new policy in the Western Company, and the evidence of Greer in no way contradicts these statements. The result is, that the ground upon which the respondents, up to the date of the action, placed the denial of liability, was without foundation, and that there never has been any surrender, cancellation or rescission of the policy, which is therefore, still a valid and subsisting instrument.\nThere is as little color for the next pretension of the company as there was for the last. The 9th condition requires proofs of loss to be put in within five days, another very rigorous and unreasonable stipulation. It as however, only upon a strict enforcement of this very illiberal provision as to time, that the appellants have been able to succeed in the court below.\nIt was contended by Mr. Gormully, on behalf of the appellant, that the condition requiring waiver to be in writing did not apply to the provision limiting the time for the delivery of preliminary proofs, but only to such conditions as were essentials of the contract.\nSome American cases may at first sight, seem to countenance this objection, but it will be found, on careful examination, that they turned on the construction of words referring to the conditions generally as the \"conditions of the policy,\" and not to specific conditions endorsed, but in the present case, in the body of the policy, the liability of the company is expressly made subject \"to the conditions herein endorsed;\" and endorsed upon the policy, under the heading \"conditions on which this policy is granted,\" appears this 9th condition, requiring the delivery of proofs within five days. It is therefore plain that the right to recover is as much subject to a compliance with this condition, as if it had been incorporated in the policy itself, instead of being endorsed as a condition of liability. Again, I think no legal importance is to be attached to the fact that the proofs were not objected to as being after time, or to the objection to pay being confined to the surrender. It is no doubt the law, as decided by several American authorities, that if imperfect proofs are filed before the expiration of the time allowed, and no objection is made to them until the prescribed time is elapsed, but the refusal to pay is put on other grounds, that constitutes an estoppel, as the imperfections might have been remedied in due time if the objection had been promptly made; but here the proofs were not presented until long after the lapse of the time fixed by the conditions.\nIt was further argued that the respondents were estopped from insisting on the 9th condition, and this appears to be the true ground on which to rest the defendant's right to be relieved from any obligation to comply strictly with its terms. The evidence of Mr. Bichey, the appellants' attorney, shows that the policy was demanded by him from Greer immediately after the fire, he thinks the next morning that Greer refused to deliver it, that he demanded it for the express purpose of preparing the proofs, and that Greer was told at the time that it was required for this purpose. The witness says: \"I asked him to give it to me to make the necessary proof;\" and he adds that Greer asked him to delay putting in the proofs. Mr. Kichey also says that he was under the impression that a much longer time than five days was allowed for the purpose.\nThese statements, so far from being contradicted, are corroborated by Greer's evidence. Upon these facts it is plain that the illegal retention of the policy by the respondents, and the conduct of their agent in reference to it, were the true and only reasons why the proofs were not furnished in due time. Had Mr. Richey known the terms of the condition, as he would have done if the policy of which his client was entitled to the possession had not been wrongfully withheld, it must be presumed against the respondents that the proofs would have been furnished within the prescribed time. Again, had Greer, instead of misleading Mr. Richey, by asking that the proofs should be delayed, stated to him that the condition required their presentation within five days, it must be presumed that a similar result would have followed. This conduct, therefore, constitutes an estoppel, and disentitles the respondents to the benefit of the 9th condition, which must, for the purposes of this action, be considered as struck out of the policy. This is, of course, an entirely distinct ground from that of waiver under the 12th condition. Had the appellant had the policy in his possession, or had the facts regarding the limitation of time been truly stated to his attorney by Greer, the mere request of the latter that the proofs should be delayed would have been nothing more than a dispensation with the terms of the condition, by agreement, which would have required endorsement on the policy in the terms of the condition excluding proof of waiver unless so evidenced. As it is however, it is apparent that the respondents, by their unjustifiable conduct, caused the noncompliance with the terms of the policy, which they now insist on as constituting a defence to the action. To allow them thus to avail themselves of their own wrong, would be to assist them to commit a fraud, and whenever such is the case an estoppel arises.\nThere remains only the question of damages. Whatever doubts may be raised by text writers, it is clear, from the language of judges used in delivering judgments in cases of authority, that provided the assured had an interest at the time of the execution of the policy, and at the date of the loss, he is entitled to recover upon a fire policy the full value of the property destroyed, provided the whole interest in the property was insured, although his interest may have been a limited one merely.\nIn the case of Franklin Insurance Company v. Drake[21], the facts were similar to those in the present case. A husband had insured houses of which his wife was sized in fee, and in which his own interest was like that of the present appellant's, a right to the permanency of the profits during the covertures, and an estate in the courtesy, if he should survive the marriage. The court says:\u2014\nIt the assured had an insurable interest at the time of the assurance, and also at the time of the loss, he has a right to recover the whole amount of damage to the property, not exceeding the sum insured, without regard to the value of the assured's interest in the property. The amount of the recovery will depend on the interest intended to be insured, provided it is covered by the policy. A mortgagor who has mortgaged to the full value of the property, and whose equity of redemption has been sold under execution, provided he has, at the time of the loss, a right to redeem; or a lessee for years, whose lease is upon the eye of expiring at the time of the loss, is entitled to recover the full value of the property destroyed, not exceeding the sum insured.\nIn Simpson v. Scottish Union Insurance Company[22], Vice-Chancellor Page Wood says:\u2014\nI agree that a tenant from year to year, having insured, would have a right to say that the premises should be rebuilt for him to occupy, and that his insurable interest is not limited to the value of his tenancy from year to year.\nAnd in Waters v. Monarch Insurance Company[23], in an action upon a fire policy on goods in the plaintiff's warehouse described as \"goods in trust or on commission therein,\" it was objected that the plaintiff could only recover in respect of goods of which they were thus bailees to the extent of their lien and liability over to their bailors. The court refused so to restrict the right to recover.\nLord Campbell says:\u2014\nThe last point that arises is, to what extent does the policy protect those goods? The defendants say that it was only the plaintiffs' personal interest. But the policies are in terms contracts to make good \"all such damage and loss as may happen by tire to the property hereinbefore mentioned.\" That is a valid contract, and as the property is wholly destroyed, the value of the whole must be made good, not merely the particular interest of the plaintiffs. They will be entitled to apply so much to cover their own interest and will be trustees for the owners as to the rest. The authorities are clear that an assurance made without orders may be ratified by the owners of the property, and then the assurers become trustees for them.\nWightman J. also says:\u2014\nThen comes the question, can the plaintiffs recover their value? It seems to me that they may, unless there be something making it illegal to insure more than the plaintiffs own interest.\nMr. Lush does not contend that any statute applies:\nIt has been decided that, if no statute applies, a person insured may recover the amount contracted for, and that being so, I think the plaintiffs entitled to recover the whole value.\nThe policy in the present case covers \"all such loss or damage by fire as shall happen to the property above mentioned,\" and upon the authorities quoted the appellant is, therefore, entitled to recover the full amount of loss caused by the destruction of the property, and is not limited to the value of his life interest. A contrary conclusion would cause great inconvenience to insurer of property, the title to which is, as in the present case, in the wife in fee simple, the husband having merely his marital interest, with the contingency of being tenant by the courtesy if he should survive his wife. If the law were not as we find it to have been settled to be by the above cited authorities, it would be requisite, in all such cases, to effect two separate contracts of insurance, and pay two premiums, although nothing in the policy or the law would have called for such a distinction, and although, upon a loss happening, the money recoverable under the wife's assurance would belong to the husband. I am of opinion that the appeal must be allowed, and the rule for a new trial in the court below discharged, with costs to the appellant in both courts.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I think that the sending of the circular by the company, and the compliance with the terms of such circular by the assured in giving up the policy to the company's agent, was a surrender of the policy, and the appeal should therefore be dismissed.\nHENRY J.\u2014The court below, apparently in very few words, gave judgment against the plaintiff in the action on the ground that there was not a legal waiver of the fifth condition, and that the damages were excessive. Now, if we look at the issues to be tried, I think it will be seen that the interest of the plaintiff Caldwell is admitted by the pleadings at the time of the policy. There is no plea denying his right at the time he obtained the policy, and I think the fifth plea, when criticized, raises the only issue:\u2014\nAnd, for a fifth plea to the said count, the defendant company says that the said insurance was effected, and the said policy applied for, by the said Samuel Caldwell, who was then the owner of the said dwelling-house, and the loss, if any, under said policy was made payable to one George Anderson, and after the date of said policy, and before such alleged loss, the said Samuel Caldwell conveyed all his interest in said dwelling-house to one Thomas Bayers.\nThat is merely pleading evidence so far, but the whole substance of the plea, and the issue raised under it, are as follows:\u2014\nAnd the plaintiffs had no interest therein and sustained no loss or damage from the burning of the said dwelling-house as aforesaid. We are to consider whether the plaintiffs or either of them\u2014for under the law of Nova Scotia either of the plaintiffs can recover\u2014had any interest at the time of the loss, and I think that Samuel Caldwell had an insurable interest, as the husband of Mrs. Caldwell; that he held the fee, and he held an insurable interest; and, if no policy had issued, he would have been entitled to ask for a policy from an insurance company for the full value of the property, and according to the English authorities, that title would have been good for him to obtain a policy for the full value of the house that was insured, and entitled him to have recovered for the loss of that house. He had, then, under the evidence in this case, at the time of the issuing of the policy, a title; we need not enquire what it was, if it amounted to an insurable interest. The parties granted a policy upon it, and it was for them to allege and prove that he had not an insurable interest at the time he effected the policy. This they have not done. On the contrary, they admit he was the owner. But, they say, afterwards he transferred the property, and at the time of the loss had no interest therein. That is the sole question, and it is not necessary for us to enquire and trace out was done with the property through half a dozen different transfers, and this policy might have stood there for years and the party might not have had a right to recover because he had not an insurable interest at the time of the loss. If it were burned at the time when the title was out of him, of course he could not recover, but the only issue for the jury to try was: Had he any interest at the time of the loss? I think he had a good interest. Then one of the conditions required that proof should be put in within five days. What is the evidence? That it was not put in till from fifteen to sixteen, or eighteen days after the time. But, when we look at the circumstances of the case, we find the real defence and objection to pay was not for want of preliminary proofs. It was in the very first start the plaintiff was told, \"Your policy is cancelled.\" That is the defence; and if you look at the letter of Mr. Pyke, the general agent of the company, he puts it altogether on that. He says: \"Whether you are insured with the Western or not, I am certain you are not with us, because your policy is cancelled.\" I do not think it was the intention of Anderson, when he went there, to cancel that policy. There is no evidence of the payment of the premium by the company, or when it was to be paid back, or that it was offered to be paid back, and Mr. Pyke says it was to be paid some time thereafter. No time was settled or arranged for. We can then fairly conclude that the parties were bound to return the premium when they attempted to cancel the policy on a certain day. It might have been only a few dollars or several hundred dollars, according to the value of the property insured, but law and justice require them to pay back the unearned premium, just as much as it did the other parties to respect their right to cancel the policy. I dispose of that by saying that the policy was not cancelled. Further, that policy was delivered to Greer, as the agent of the Western Insurance Company. Anderson knew the position of the Stadacona Insurance Company, and it was not as the agent of that company that he placed the policy in Greer's hand, but as the agent of the Western. Then there is not the slightest ground for saying the policy was cancelled. If it was not done, then, by the act of Caldwell, it could not be done by anybody. Now, although Anderson was the agent of Caldwell to effect the insurance, there is no evidence whatever that he authorized him to cancel that policy. Caldwell would not be bound. True, Anderson was his creditor, and there was an arrangement that the money should be paid to him in the case of loss, but the action must be brought in' the name of Caldwell, who is entitled to the whole amount; and then his liability to Anderson arises. There are some cases to support the opposite view, but I think it is confined to the case when it is stated in the body of the instrument that the party mortgaged all the property to the extent of his interest in the policy and the value of the property. Under the circumstances then, I am of opinion that Anderson had no authority whatever to cancel the policy.\nThen we come to the story of the waiver. I do not consider the matter as a matter of waiver at all. I think from the evidence of what took place, that the particular special objection that was made to the settling of this policy was that it was cancelled. They would give no satisfaction, and put it upon that ground, and I think they had no other ground in view, or they might take it to lead the party off the track, as has been done since I have had the honor of a seat on this bench; plead one thing, and then come in and prove another. Whether it was in time or not, it would operate fraudulently against the interests of Caldwell. I think the parties, after placing their defence solely on the ground of the cancellation of the policy, should not be allowed to come in now and say, you did not produce the proofs in proper time. Moreover they had the policy in their possession, and Mr. Richey had not the means of making out the claim. I think the parties are estopped from setting this up. There are other issues raised-\u2014fraudulent loss, the insurance company to have an account, and so on. There is no evidence, to my mind, that creates any difficulty against the plaintiff's right to recover. We have a replication here, the second replication to the plea I have just been referring to\u2014the fifth plea. The plaintiffs say:\nThat they or one of them was, at the time of their making said insurance, the owner of said house and premises, and although the said building and premises were afterwards formally conveyed to one Thomas Bayers, yet before the said loss the said Thomas Bayers reconveyed the same to the said Sarah Caldwell, then and still being ! the wife of the said plaintiff Samuel Caldwell, and the said Sarah Caldwell from thenceforth and from the making of said policy, and until and at time of the said fire, and the said loss, was the owner thereof and interested therein.\nThat brings back the title in answer to this plea, and sufficiently specifies the legal requirements to entitle the parties to recover. I think, therefore, the judgment ought to be in favour of the appellant Of course the wife's name, if necessary, may be struck out of the record.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This is an action wherein Samuel Caldwell and Sarah his wife declare as plaintiffs upon a policy of insurance against loss or damage by fire, executed under the common seal of the defendant company, whereby the defendants insured the plaintiff Samuel Caldwell against loss or damage by fire to a certain dwelling-house described in the policy. The policy contained the following clause: \"Loss, if any, under this policy, payable to George R. Anderson Esq., Halifax N.S.\" The declaration contained also a count that the defendants wrongfully deprived the plaintiffs of the use and possession of the policy, and the plaintiffs claimed $5,000, the amount insured by the policy being $4,000.\nTo this declaration the defendants pleaded several pleas, and the parties having eventually joined issue, the record came down for trial before Mr. Justice James without a jury. The material points, relied upon by the defendants against the plaintiff\u2019s recovery at the trial were:\u2014\n1st. That Anderson, to whom the loss, if any, was declared by the policy to be payable, was the person insured, and that he should have been the plaintiff. 2nd. That the policy had been cancelled before loss under the provisions of a condition in that behalf endorsed on the policy.\n3rd. That Samuel Caldwell named in the policy had no interest in the property insured at the time of the loss, having sold the property, whereby, as was contended, the policy became void.\n4th. That proof of loss was not put in within the time prescribed by a condition in that behalf endorsed on the policy. The plaintiffs contended that this condition was waived, but in answer to this contention the defendants insisted that the waiver was not in writing endorsed on the policy and signed by the company's manager, as alleged to be required by a condition endorsed on the policy. The plaintiffs also insisted that they were entitled to recover the full amount of the loss under the second count, upon the ground that the defendants had wrongfully deprived plaintiffs of the policy and prevented their making proof as required by the conditions endorsed thereon.\nThe learned judge before whom the case was tried without a jury, rendered a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs for the whole amount of the policy and interest thereon.\nA rule nisi having been obtained to set aside this verdict as against law and evidence, and upon the points taken at the trial upon motion for a non-suit, the Supreme Court of the Province of Nova Scotia made the rule absolute upon the ground, that although the court was of opinion that a waiver by the defendants of the obligation upon the plaintiffs to make proof of their loss within five days, as required by a condition on the policy, had taken place, still that such waiver was ineffectual as not being in writing endorsed on the policy as required by the twelfth condition in that behalf, and that for this reason the plaintiffs could not recover. Against this rule absolute the present appeal is brought, and the whole matter has been opened before us, and a point has been made, which does not appear to have been suggested in the courts below, namely, that Sarah, wife of Samuel Caldwell, is improperly joined as plaintiff, she not having been named in the policy, and having, in fact, acquired any interest she has in the property insured subsequently to the execution of the policy. This objection, however, is disposed of by the ninety-fourth section of the revised statutes of Nova Scotia, 4th series, ch. 94, which provides that the joinder of too many plaintiffs shall not be fatal to any action, but the plaintiff or plaintiffs entitled may recover. We may treat the action, therefore, as having been brought in the name of Samuel Caldwell alone.\nNow, that Samuel Caldwell, and not Anderson, was the person insured by this policy, and that he, therefore, was the proper person to sue upon the policy, cannot, in my opinion, admit of a doubt, and in fact this court has so decided in McQueen v. The Ph\u0153nix Insurance Co.[24] A case was cited from the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in support of the contrary contention, Brush v. \u00c6tna Insurance Co.[25]. Whether or not we should concur in that decision if the precise point before the court should arise, it is not necessary to express any opinion, because the material facts upon which, in that case, the judgment of the court was rested, do not exist in the case before us. That was an action of assumpsit, and not, as this is, an action of covenant upon a policy under seal, and the expression in the policy upon which the right of the plaintiff there to sue turned was\u2014\"loss if any payable to the order of Peter Brush (the plaintiff), his interest therein being as mortgagee,\" and it appeared that the policy was obtained by the mortgagor in pursuance of a covenant entered into by him with Brush, that he, the mortgagor, should insure the premises in the name of and for the benefit of Brush. These circumstances were rested upon as distinguishing that case from Nevins v. Rockingham fire Insurance Co.[26], cited by the court as deciding that where a policy provides that the insurance, in case of loss, shall be paid to a third person, that is, not describing him as mortgagee, the action should be in the name of the party to the policy. The case of Brush v. \u00c6tna Insurance Co is therefore quite distinguishable from the present case. It is clear to me, also, that the defendants must fail upon their contention that the policy was cancelled before the loss occurred. By the second condition endorsed on the policy, it was provided, that if from any cause whatever the company or its agents should desire to terminate the insurance effected by the policy, it should be lawful for the company or its agents so to do by notice to the insured or his representative, and to require the policy to be given up for the purpose of being cancelled, provided that in any such case the company shall refund to the insured a ratable proportion, for the unexpired term, of the premium received for the insurance. On th\u00e8 28th June, 1877, while the policy was in full force, the company's agents sent to Mr. G. Anderson, the person named in the policy, as the person to whom the loss, if any, was to be payable, a circular in the words following:\u2014\nHalifax, June 28th, 1877.\nMr. I have to inform you that the Stadacona Insurance Company has ordered me to notify policy holders to insure elsewhere, as the company has decided to wind-up. You will, therefore, take notice that their policy of insurance is cancelled from this date 5 unearned premiums will be returned hereafter.\nYours &c.\n(Sgd.) C.M. Greer,\nAgent. No circular was sent to Caldwell. Anderson, to whom the above circular was sent, and who had no instructions from Caldwell authorizing him to surrender the policy, although he had authority to effect insurance upon the property, upon receipt of the above circular took the policy, which, from the time of its being effected, was in Anderson's custody, and left it with Greer, who was also agent of the Western Insurance Company, for the purpose, as I think may be inferred from the evidence, of enabling Greer to take a description of the property, so that he should transfer the policy from the defendants to the Western, upon which being done, the cancellation contemplated by the defendants' circular might be consummated, but no proportion of the premium for the unexpired term having been paid or tendered, and no substitutional policy in the Western having been effected and accepted, it is plain that no cancellation of the policy executed by the defendants ever was; consummated, even assuming Anderson to have been competent to bind Caldwell by accepting a policy in the Western in lieu of that in the defendant company[27].\nAs regards the point of waiver, the ninth condition endorsed on the policy provides that:\u2014\nAll persons insured by the company sustaining any loss or damage by fire, are immediately to give notice to the company, or its agents, and within five days after such loss or damage has occurred, are to deliver as particular an account of their loss or damage as the nature of the case will admit of, and make proof of the same by their declaration or affirmation, and by their books of account, or such other proper evidence as the directors of this company or its agents may reasonably require, and until such declaration or affirmation, account, and evidence are produced, the amount of such loss, or any part thereof, shall not be payable or recoverable.\nAnd the twelfth condition provides that\u2014\nNone of the foregoing conditions or stipulations, either in whole or in part, shall be deemed to have been waived by or on the part of the company, unless the waiver be clearly expressed in writing by endorsement on the policy signed by the manager of this company for Canada.\nIt was contended upon the authority of Blake v. Exchange Mutual Insurance Co., decided by the Supreme Court of the State of Massachusetts[28], that the twelfth condition endorsed on the policy, related to a waiver of provisions of the contract, and not to a waiver of the performance of provisions, which a waiver of proofs of loss is, and so that in this case a verbal waiver, which was abundantly proved, was sufficient. I do not think it necessary to express any opinion upon this point. It would be unreasonable and unjust in the extreme that the defendants who by their agent refused, immediately after the occurrence of the loss, to return to the insured his policy for the purpose of enabling him to see, and comply with, its provisions as to proof of loss, and who have ever since insisted upon their right to retain the policy as cancelled before the loss occurred, should be heard to insist that the policy was not cancelled, but made void by default of the assured in making proof of his loss within five days, a default which but for the defendants wrongful detention of the policy might never have occurred; a stronger case could not, I think, be well conceived for a good answer by way of estoppel in pais to a pleading setting up such a defence, and this is what is in substance done by the surrejoinder, to which the defendants do not demur, but merely join issue in fact, an issue, which, upon the evidence, must be found against them. I am, moreover, of opinion that the defendants' wrongful, detention of the policy entitles the plaintiff to recover to the full amount of his loss within the amount insured by the policy, under the count for wrongfully depriving the plaintiff of his policy. If, upon the demand made by Mr. Richey upon behalf of the plaintiff, immediately after the occurrence of the loss, the defendants had given up the policy to the plaintiff, the latter could, by giving proof of his loss within the time prescribed by the condition in that behalf upon the policy, have entitled himself to recover, and could have recovered under the policy, the amount of his loss within the amount insured by the policy, and such amount as it appears to me upon the authority of Woodhouse v. Whitely[29], (which, although a nisi prius decision, seems a sound one,) is the proper measure of damages recoverable under the second count, if, which is really the sole material point in this case, the plaintiffs interest in the policy did not absolutely cease and determine upon the sale by him of the insured premises to Bayers by the deed dated 2nd February, 1876. By deed of that date Samuel Caldwell, the plaintiff, conveyed the insured premises in fee simple to one Bayers, who, by deed dated the 3rd of February, 1876, conveyed the same premises in fee simple to Sarah, the wife of the assured, who then had and still has living, a child born of her marriage with the plaintiff. These conveyances have the appearance of having been adopted merely as means of transferring the property from Samuel Caldwell to his wife Sarah in fee, but whether that was their object, or that the deed to Bayers was intended to operate as conveying, as it purports, the beneficial interest as well as the legal to him absolutely, and that the conveyance by him to the plaintiff's wife was a wholly independent sale, subsequently contracted for, the evidence fails to give any indication; nor is it necessary that it should for the purposes of the defendants' contention, which is that immediately upon the execution of the deed of the 2nd February, 1876, to Bayers, all the plaintiff's interest in the policy ceased, and that he cannot recover thereunder for the loss subsequently occurring to the insured property.\nThe usual mode of averring the interest of the insured in a declaration upon a policy of insurance against loss by fire is:\u2014\nThat the plaintiff, at the time of making the policy, and thence until and at the time of the damage and loss hereinafter mentioned, was interested in the said premises so insured as aforesaid to the amount so insured thereon.\nBut in no decided case is it held that the interest which the assured had at the time of the insurance being effected continued thence continuously until the loss, should appear in evidence to entitle the assured to recover. In Sadlers Co. v. Badcock[30], Lord Hardwick held merely that the insured should have an interest in the property at the time of insuring, and at the time the loss happens, and the usual form of plea to the above averments of interest in the declaration traversing such interest is, as is the fourth plea to the declaration in this case, that the plaintiff was not at the time of the alleged damage and loss interested in the said dwelling-house as alleged.\nThe question as to the revival of a policy in favor of the assured upon a reconveyance to him after a sale by him of the insured property does not appear, so far as my research has enabled me to find, ever to have come up for decision in the English courts. 1 he case of Reed v. Cole[31], cited in the argument before us, is not the case of a revival of a policy upon a reconveyance after a sale by the assured, but of an interest reserved by the assured at the time of the sale, which the court held to be sufficient in that case to enable him to recover under the policy, notwithstanding the sale. The action was one upon the case upon articles of agreement constituting a society for the mutual assurance of each other's ships, and which was executed by the plaintiff and the defendant, whereby the parties thereto engaged that when and so often as any of the ships wherein any of the members of the society had property should be lost, the rest should contribute to such loss. Every member was obliged to prove a property of \u00a3500 in the ship, and if he would cease to be a member, he was obliged to give six months' notice. The defendant pleaded that the plaintiff had parted with his interest in the ship before the loss happened. To this plea the plaintiff replied that by articles of agreement with the purchaser of the ship, the plaintiff had agreed to pay \u00a3500, if a loss happened within three months, and therefore that he was interested during the voyage in which the loss occurred; to this the defendant demurred, and it was held, that in virtue of this agreement, the plaintiff still had an interest in the safety of the ship, and that he had not parted with all his interest in it, but continued to be interested quoad his loss; and that, as he continued contributory to the losses of others at the time when his loss happened, it was but just and equitable, and within the words and meaning of the agreement, that they should contribute to his.\nThe American courts do, however, furnish cases bearing upon the question.\nNow, the policy declared upon in this case upon its face, is stated to be \"upon a building \"owned and occupied by the assured as a dwelling,\" but there is nothing in the terms of the policy, or in the conditions endorsed thereon, to the effect that in the event of any alienation, sale or transfer of the property insured, or any change in the title thereto, the policy shall become void; the case stands, therefore, upon the general law affecting a contract of insurance against loss by fire, without any such stipulation expressed therein, and the obligation of the contract is to make good to the assured any loss or damage to the property by fire occurring within the time for which the policy protects it, within the amount named in the policy, and such loss or damage, as is laid down in Laurent v. The Chatham Insurance, by the Superior Court of the state of New York[32], is to be estimated according to the actual value of the property at the time the loss occurs, and not upon the probable value to the plaintiff of his enjoyment of his interest in the property.\nIn Phillips on insurance, paragraph 93, it is said that mortgaging the insured premises is not an \"alienation\" within the provision of the charter of an Insurance Co. making void an alienation by sale or otherwise, citing as authority Conover v. Mutual Insurance Co., of Albany[33], in which one ground stated for the decision is that the assured still retained his insurable interest to the amount of the full value; and in paragraph 187, Phillips says that a change of an absolute ownership to an interest as mortgagee or other interest, not required to be specially described in the policy, does not defeat a policy on the subject which does not specify the kind of interest which is insured, and he gives the case in Burrowes above noted and Stetson v. Massachusetts Mutual Fire Insurance Co.[34], as authority for this proposition. The latter case was one where, to an action upon a fire insurance policy, the defendants pleaded that the plaintiff, being the owner of a dwelling-house, insured it in the defendant company (of which by insuring he became a member), and that after effecting the policy, and before the fire, he conveyed one-half in value of the dwelling-house to one T. H. to hold in fee simple, saving a term of seven years which the plaintiff reserved therein, which term he immediately assigned to the said T. H. and one L. G., so that at the time the house was consumed, he, the plaintiff, was not the owner of the house according to the form and effect of the policy and the rules of the company. To this plea the plaintiff replied that at the time of making the deed to T. H., he, the said T. H., conveyed back the same premises to the plaintiff by way of mortgage conditioned for the payment of a sum of money which the plaintiff averred was not paid pursuant to the condition, nor at any time. The plaintiff then set forth a lease from him to T. H. and L. G. of the premises comprised in the mortgage for the term of seven years, reserving a rent to be paid quarterly, with a right of re-entry reserved in case of non-payment; to this replication the defendants demurred, and it was held that taking all the writings together, the sale of the moiety was substantially to be considered as a conditional sale after the expiration of seven years, and it was held that the replication was a good answer in law to the plea, and that the plaintiff was entitled to recover the full value of the building destroyed, within the amount for which it was by the policy insured. In Bell v. Firemens Insurance Co.[35], the Supreme Court of Louisiana in 1843 seems to have entertained a contrary opinion, but in the same case, upon its coming up again on a bill of exceptions after a second trial, and in Bell v. Western Marine and Fire Insurance Co. of New Orleans[36], which was an action upon a policy covering the same property, the court cites and follows the cases above cited[37] and expressly held that it is not necessary that the interest of the insured at the time of the insurance, and at the time of the loss, should be identical, when the policy contains no clause forbidding sale or change of interest without the assent of the insurers. In the same court in 1841, in the case of Macarty v. The Commercial Insurance Company[38], where the owner of property insured had made a donation inter vivos of the insured property by authentic act in full property to the donee without any restriction or qualification whatever, except against alienation otherwise than by last will and testament, it was upon a very clear principle decided that evidence could not be received to show that it was agreed orally between the donee and the donor that the latter was to receive and enjoy the rents and profits of the premises during his lifetime, pay the taxes, and make all necessary repairs, with a view to establishing that he had a qualified interest or right of property amounting to an insurable interest sufficient to enable him to recover, under a policy effected before the donation, for a loss by fire occurring after it. The court, however, proceeded to say,, that even if the evidence could have been received, the right to receive the rents which it was said the donee had agreed to let the plaintiff enjoy was an interest of a character and value so different from that which the assured had at the time of the insurance being effected, that he could not recover under the policy, at least, not to the full amount of the damage done to the insured property: whatever weight we should feel disposed to give to this expression of opinion is materially diminished by the consideration that it was quite unnecessary to the determination of the case before the court, which proceeded upon the inadmissibility of the evidence which was offered to contradict the authentic instrument, and which evidence had been, and rightly as the court held, rejected. The opinion seems at variance with the rule as laid down by Mr. Phillips in his 187th paragraph above quoted, and with the cases cited by him in support of that rule, and with other cases, for a reservation of a right to receive and enjoy the rents, issues and profits of an estate for the life of the grantor of the fee simple to a stranger, subject to such reservation effected by a legal instrument, seems to entitle the owner of the estate so reserved for life, to insure to the full value of the property; and to recover upon a policy which had been effected by himself, when seized in fee ( simple, equally as in the case of a change from absolute ownership to an interest as mortgagee, or to any other interest not required to be specifically described in the policy.\nIn Franklin Insurance Co. v. Drake[39], the Court of Appeal for the state of Kentucky, in 1841, held that a husband, having by his wife a living child, had a right to insure in his own name a building of which his wife was seized in fee, and upon loss by fire occurring, to recover the full value of the building destroyed not exceeding the amount insured by the policy. The court said:\nDrake (the husband) had unquestionably an insurable interest and a right to effect the policy 5 he had a right to the use and enjoyment of the premises or their rents during the joint lives of himself and wife, and he would be tenant by the courtesy after the death of his wife. If the assured had an insurable interest at the time of the insurance, and also at the time of the loss, he has a right to recover the whole amount of the damage to the property not exceeding the amount insured, without regard to the value of the assured's interest in the property.\nWorthington v. Bearse[40], decided by the Supreme Court of the state of Massachusetts in 1866, is an express authority that in the case of an absolute sale of property insured, and the subsequent reconveyance of the property to the assured, a policy effected before the sale becomes revived upon the reconveyance so as to entitle the person insured by the policy to recover for a loss occurring after the reconveyance. The property ensured in that case was a ship, and Bigelow C.J., delivering the judgment of the court, declares the law to be that, although for a time, namely, while the property in the vessel should be in another, the assured had parted with his insurable interest, still his rights to recover on the policy was not gone for ever, that it was only suspended during the time that the title, of the vessel was vested in the vendee, and was revived again on the reconveyance to the assured during the term specified in the policy. Although that was the case of a reconveyance of the same estate as had been previously sold by the assured, and it is contended here that the estate of the assured at the time of the loss was quite different from that which he had at the time the insurance was effected, still, the reasoning upon which the judgment in that case was rested, appears to be equally applicable to the present case. The Chief Justice there says:\nThe insurance was for one year. There was no stipulation or condition in the policy that the assured should not convey or assign his interest in the vessel during this period. The contract of insurance was absolute to insure the interest of a person named in a particular subject for a specific time\u2014for this entire risk an adequate premium was paid and the policy duly attached, because the assured at the inception of the risk had an insurable interest in the policy. So too at the time of the loss all the facts necessary to establish a valid claim under the policy existed. No fact is shown from which any inference can be made that by the alienation of the title to the vessel, the risk of the insurers upon the subsequent re-transfer of the vessel to the assured was in any degree increased or affected, or that any loss, injury, or prejudice to the underwriter was occasioned by the fact that the absolute title to the vessel was temporarily vested in a third person.\nAnd again:\u2014\nThe sole effect would be to suspend the risk for the time during which, by reason of the transfer, the assured had no interest in the subject insured and to revive it as soon as the original interest was re-vested in him. The transfer of the vessel rendered the policy inoperative not void. It could have no effect while the assured had no interest in the subject insured; but when this interest was revived or restored during the term designated in the policy without any increase or change of risk or other prejudice to the underwriter, there seems to be no valid reason for holding that the policy has become extinct\u2014inasmuch as neither the person nor the subject insured is changed and the risk remains the same, the intermediate transfer is an immaterial fact which can in no way affect the claim under the policy.\nIn the case before us it is however contended that, although neither the person nor the subject insured is changed, still the interest of the person in the subject was wholly changed, and became of quite a different character from what the interest of the assured was when the policy was effected; but the interest of Samuel Caldwell, after the re-conveyance by Bayers to Samuel's wife, Sarah, was of such a nature as entitled him to insure to the full value of the property, and he retained such interest at the time of the loss. There is nothing in the evidence from which any inference can be drawn that, nor is there any suggestion even that, the risk was increased after the transfer to the wife, nor that the insurers had not the same security arising from the nature of the interest of Samuel Caldwell after the execution of the deed to his wife by Bayers that he would use all the precautions to avoid the calamity insured against equally as if his interest had remained identically as it was when the policy was effected. The insurable interest, then, of Samuel Caldwell in the property insured after the conveyance to his wife by Bayers, being such as to entitle him to ensure to the full value of the property equally as the interest which he had when the policy was effected, and such interest existing at the time of the loss, and there being nothing in the policy prohibiting any change of title during the time designated in the policy for its continuance, the condition of the policy was, as it appears to me, satisfied, and there being no suggestion of any increase of risk or prejudice to the insurers by reason of the change which has occurred in the interest of the assured, as well upon principle as upon the express authority of Worthington v. Bear se, which appears to me to be founded on sound reason, and upon the authority of the text of Phillips, supported as it is by authority, I am of opinion that the plaintiff, Samuel Caldwell, is entitled to recover, under the policy to the full value of the house destroyed within the amount insured. He was entitled to the uncontrolled possession and enjoyment of the property, or of its rents and profits, during the joint lives of himself and his wife, and he was tenant by the curtesy initiate, and entitled to payment of the full amount of damage done to the property insured by the risk ensured against within the amount stated in the policy, unless the defendants should avail themselves of the benefit of the condition endorsed on the policy, enabling them to re-instate the house so that the insured should have the full benefit of his right of possession and enjoyment.\nAs to the contention of the defendants, that the policy is avoided by fraudulent representation of the value of the house and of the amount of loss, I can see nothing in the evidence in support of this contention. What the plaintiff paid for the house, where it stood upon the lot from which he removed it, can afford no criterion of its value as it stood upon the lot where it was rebuilt. The learned judge before whom the case was tried, without a jury, does not appear to have thought the amount stated in the policy to be in excess of the value of the house destroyed, nor does such a contention appear to have been brought under his notice at the trial, and in the rule taken out in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia to set aside the verdict, the ground that the verdict is for excessive damages, is not taken. I see no sufficient reason, therefore, \\o justify the setting aside of the verdict and sending the case down for a new trial. I think, therefore, that this appeal should be allowed with costs, and that the rule nisi for a new trial in the court below should be discharged with costs, and that the name of Sarah Caldwell as a plaintiff should be erased from the record, and judgment entered for Samuel Caldwell as sole plaintiff.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: M.

Ritchie C J., and Strong, Founder, Henry. Taschereau and Gwynne JJ. 26\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA, (APPEAL SIDE).\nPlea of tender and payment into Court acknowledgment of liability Agent\u2014Contract by, for undisclosed principal\u2014Sale with privilege of taking bill of lading, or reweighing at seller's expense Pleading\nAn action was instituted by the Canada Shipping Co., to recover $3,038.43, being the price of 810 tons, 5 cwt. of steam coal sold by their agents, Thompson. Murray & Co. through T. S. Noad, broker, as per following note: No. 3, 435. Montreal, 13th Aug., 1879.\nMessrs. Thompson, Murray & Co.:\u2014\nI have this day sold for your account, to arrive, to the V. Hudon Cotton Mills Company, the 810 tons 5 cwt. best South Wales black vein steam coal, per bill of lading, per ' Lake ' Ontario,' at $3.75 per ton, of 2,240 lbs , duty paid, ex ship; ship to have prompt despatch.\nTerms, net cash on delivery, or 30 days, adding interest, buyer'so option.\nBrokerage playable by you, buyer to have privilege of taking bill of lading, or reweighing at seller's expense.\nThe defendants pleaded, 1st that the contract was with Thompson, Murray & Co., personally, and that the plaintiffs had no action: and by a second plea that the cargo contained only 755 tons, 580 lbs. the \"orice of which was $2,868.72, which they had offered Thompson, Murray & Co., together with the price of 10 tons more, to avoid litigation, in all $2,890.72, which they brought into court, without their acknowledging their liability to plaintiffs, and prayed that the action be dismissed as to any further or greater sum.\nHeld, per Ritchie C.J. and Taschereau and Gwynne JJ., that that it was unnecessary to decide the question as to whether the action could be brought by the undisclosed principal, for by their plea of tender and payment into court the defendants had acknowledged their liability to the plaintiffs, although such tender and deposit had been made li without acknowledging their liability; \" Fournier and Henry JJ. dissenting\nPer Strong J. \u2014That the action by respondents (undisclosed principals) was maintainable.\nPer Fournier and Henry JJ, that the action by respondents (undisclosed principals) was not maintainable and that the appellants Were not precluded from setting up this defence by their plea of tender and payment into court\nAt the trial it was proved that the defendants agreed to take the coal as per bill of lading without having it weighed. They, however caused it to be weighed in their own yard, without notice to the vendors, and the cargo was found to contain only 755 tons 580 lbs. About three weeks after having received the bill of lading, when called upon to pay, they claimed a reduction for the deficiency.\nHeld, Fournier and Henry JJ. dissenting, that the appedants had no right to refuse payment for the cargo on the grounds of deficiency in the delivery) considering that the weighing was made by the defendants in the absence of the plaintiffs and without notice to them and at a time when the defendants were bound by the option they had previously made of taking the coal in bulk.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) ([1]) reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, dismissing the plaintiff's (respondents) action. The facts and pleadings are fully stated in the judgments hereinafter given.\nBeique and Trenholme for appellants:\n1st. As to compatibility of pleas:\nSee C. P. C. art. 146. DeMontigny v.

C and Davidson Q. C. for respondents, relied on Arts: 1701, 1716 and 1735 0. C.; Pothier Mandat No 88 and other authorities referred to in the judgments of this court.\nSir W J. Ritchie C J.\u2014Was of opini\u00f3n that the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by Taschereau J.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I am for affirming the judgment upon the following grounds; First, that the action is maintainable by the respondents. Arts. 1716 and 1727 of the Civil Code which make the principal liable to third persons, even although the agent may have contracted in his own name, and as a principal, thus assimilating the law of Quebec to the English law, must, I think be considered by an extensive construction as also making third persons so contracting with the agent liable reciprocally to the principal, since it must proceed on the implication that in such a case a contractual obligation between the principal and the third person shall be considered to have been created by the contract of the agent. From the terms of the articles and from the report of the commissioners, it appears to have been intended to make this provision accord with the doctrine of Pothier Mandat ([21]); see also Molitor, Droit Romain ([22]), and the corresponding rule of English commercial law which as is well known differs in this respect from the modern French law As to the right to compensation or recoupement in respect of shortage, I am clearly of opinion that all right to this was waived by the appellants when they received the coal without insisting on its being weighed at the ship's side. They thus got the chance of any advantage which might accrue to them from overweight, audit would be out of the question now to say that they should, after having declined a weighing according to the ordinary course of business, in the presence of the respondent, be entitled to claim an allowance for shortage which they allege they have found on an ex parte weighing made in their own yard, after having taken delivery in the manner before mentioned. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER, J. Les faits qui out donn\u00e9 lieu au present litige sont en r\u00e9sum\u00e9 comme suit:\u2014\nLe 13 ao\u00fbt 1879, J. S. Noad, courtier, de Montr\u00e9al vendit \u00e0 l'appelant pour le compte de Thompson, Murray et Cie., marchands, une cargaison de charbon alors \u00e0 bord du vaisseau des intim\u00e9s, appel\u00e9 le \"Lake Ontario,\" attendu d'un jour \u00e0 l'autre \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. Cette vente fut faite \u00e0 raison de $3.75 par tonne de 2,240 livres, et de plus aux conditions not\u00e9es comme suit sur le carnet du courtier:\nTo wit.\nNo. 3435.\nMontreal. 13th Aug., 1879.\nMessrs. Thompson, Murray & Co.,\nI have this day sold for your a\/c to arrive, to the V. Hudon Cotton Mills Co., the 810 tons 5 cwt. best South Wales black vein steam coal per bill lading; p. Lake Ontario, at 3.75 p. ton of 2240 lbs duty paid ex ship, ship to have prompt despatch.\nYour obedient servant,\nJ. S. NOAD, Broker.\nTerms net cash on delivery or 30 days adding interest. Buyer's option.\nBrokerage playable by you.\nBuyer to have privilege of taking B\/L or reweighing at sellers expense.\nUn m\u00e9moire de cette vente fut remis \u00e0 Messrs Thompson, Murray & Co., et un autre \u00e0 l'appelante. A l'arriv\u00e9e du \" Lake Ontario \" celle-ci au lieu de prendre livraison du chargement apr\u00e8s avoir fait peser de nouveau, accepta la quantit\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9e dans le connaissement.\nCependant comme la livraison se faisait aupr\u00e8s de sa manufacture, l'appelante fit peser la cargaison avec soin, et avec des balances v\u00e9rifi\u00e9es, mais sans avis aux intim\u00e9s. Le r\u00e9sultat constata qu'il v avait cinquante-cinq tonnes de moins que la quantit\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9e dans le connaissement. Avis de ce deficit fat donn\u00e9 \u00e0 Thompson, Murray & Co., avec offre du prix de la quantit\u00e9 de tonnes re\u00e7ues, et de plus le prix des dix autres tonnes. Ces offres furent refus\u00e9es et les intim\u00e9s intent\u00e8rent leur action pour la quantit\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9e dans le connaissement.\nL'appelante r\u00e9pondit \u00e0 cette action: 10 qu'elle avait contract\u00e9 avec Thompson, Murray & Co., personnelle ment et que les intim\u00e9s n'avait aucun droit d'action contre elle. 20 que la cargaison ne contenait que 755 tonnes et 580 livres dont le prix se montant \u00e0 $2868 72 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 offert \u00e0 Thompson, Murray & Co , avec en outre le prix de dix tonnes de plus, en tout $2,890722. Cette somme fut d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en cour mais avec d\u00e9claration sp\u00e9ciale que c'\u00e9tait sans admettre aucune responsabilit\u00e9 envers les intim\u00e9s. to l'appelante invoquait l'usage du commerce an sujet du d\u00e9ficit ou surplus dans les ventes faites diapr\u00e9s la quantit\u00e9 port\u00e9e an connaissement comme suit:\u2014\nThat in purchasing said cargo of coal and. in making option to receive the same as per bill of lading instead of having said coal weighed at the expense of the vendor, the said defendants never agreed or intended, and could never have been understood, according to the custom and usage of trade, to have agreed or intended, to flssume the risk of a deficiency in said coal of more than ten tons\nEnfin l\u2019appelante plaidait fraude, en all\u00e9guant que l'intim\u00e9 savait que le commandant du \" Lake Ontario o \u00e9tait dais l'habitude de signer des connaissements contenant de fausses d\u00e9clarations de quantit\u00e9s.\nL'intim\u00e9 r\u00e9pondit sp\u00e9cialement que le connaissement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement sign\u00e9, les droits de douane pay\u00e9s suivant la quantit\u00e9 vendue, que la charge avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e par l'appelante, qui n'avait jamais offert de la rendre. A cette derni\u00e8re all\u00e9gation l'appelante r\u00e9pondit qu'elle n'avait du faire la remiso du charbon parce qu'il se trouvait m\u00eal\u00e9 avec d'autre, et que d'ailleurs elle n'\u00e9tait pas oblig\u00e9e de le rendre.\nApr\u00e8s enqu\u00eate et audition au m\u00e9rite, l'action fut renvoy\u00e9e par le jugement de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure.\nLes questions soulev\u00e9es par les faits de cette cause sont 1o Le commettant peut-il porter une action sur un contrat fait personnellement par in agent qui n'a pas fait conna\u00eetre le nom de son commettant?\nLa deuxi\u00e8me question ne devrait pas \u00eatre seulement de savoir si l'appelante est oblig\u00e9e de payer la quantit\u00e9 de charbon mentionn\u00e9e dans le connaissement, on bien si elle a droit \u00e0 une diminution de prix en proportion du d\u00e9ficit constat\u00e9 par le pesage qu'elle a fait faire. En vue du plaidoyer invoquant l'usage du commerce, ne devrait-on pas se demander, de plus, si une vente faite dans les circonstances de celle dont ii s'agit ne se trouve pas tacitement sujette \u00e0 certaines conditions accept\u00e9es par l'usage g\u00e9n\u00e9ral di commerce concernant le surplus ou d\u00e9ficit dans la quantit\u00e9 sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9e dans des ventes de cette nature?\nQuant \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re question la mani\u00e8re dont s'est op\u00e9r\u00e9e la vente en question fait voir bien clairement que les parties au pr\u00e9sent proc\u00e8s, n'ont jamais fait ensemble le contrat sur lequel l'action est fond\u00e9e Ce contrat a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait par l'interm\u00e9diaire de J S Noad entre Thompson, Murray & Co., d'une part, et l'appelante de l'autre, ainsi qu'il est constat\u00e9 par les \u00e9crits \u00e9chang\u00e9s entre eux \u00e0 ce sujet, exhibits 12 et 14. Ces \u00e9crits ne font aucunement voir que Thompson, Murray & Co, n'\u00e9taient que des agents de l'intim\u00e9 dans cette transaction. Il est vrai que celle-ci a produit un. m\u00e9moire de cette vente dans lequel le mot agent a \u00e9t\u00e9 ins\u00e9r\u00e9; mais il est \u00e9vident que cette addition a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite apr\u00e8s coup dans le but, sans doute, de faire dispara\u00eetre une difficult\u00e9 que l'on appr\u00e9hendait sur l'existence du droit d'action. Cette addition qui ne se trouve pas dans le m\u00e9moire livr\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appelante ne pent aucunement affecter sa position Il r\u00e9sulte certainement de ces \u00e9crits que le contrat a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait entre Thompson, Murray & Co., et l'appelante, et non pas entre celle-ci et l'intim\u00e9. Il n'y a partant aucun lien de droit entre elles et cons\u00e9quemment pas de droit d'action de la part de l'intim\u00e9 contre l'appelante. Indubitablement Thompson, Murray & Co., parties au contrat, avec l'appelante ont droit de r\u00e9clamer d'elle l'ex\u00e9cution de ce contrat et aucune action n'aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre intent\u00e9e sans les mettre en cause afin d'\u00e9viter \u00e0 l'appelante les dangers d'une seconde action.\nMaintenant les faits n'\u00e9tant pas douteux que la vente en question a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par Thompson, Murray & Co., sans divulguer leur qualit\u00e9 d'agents, la loi reconna\u00eet-elle \u00e0 leur commettante l'intim\u00e9e) le droit d'intenter une action sur un contrat auquel elle n'\u00e9tait pas partie? A cette question, deux r\u00e9ponses contradictoires se pr\u00e9sentent L'une, d'apr\u00e8s le droit anglais, est dans l'affirmative, l'autre d'apr\u00e8s le droit fran\u00e7ais dans la n\u00e9gative. Il est clair que ce n'est pas dans le droit anglais que l'on doit chercher la solution d'une telle question. Ce droit n'est pas en force dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec en mati\u00e8re de contrat.\nLes r\u00e8gles de la preuve en mati\u00e8res commerciales seulement y ont \u00e9t\u00e9 admises. Adopter en mati\u00e8re de contrat un principe tire du droit anglais, diff\u00e9rant du droit fran\u00e7ais sur le m\u00eame sujet, ce ne serait plus une application de la loi, une interpr\u00e9tation, mais ce serait un acte l\u00e9gislatif, substituant un syst\u00e8me de droit \u00e0 celui qui est en force dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Quelqu\u2019avantageux que puisse \u00eatre sous certains rapports la solution offerte par le droit anglais, elle ne peut \u00eatre accept\u00e9e sans violer l'esprit du code civil. Il est donc tout \u00e0 fait inutile daller chercher de ce cot\u00e9-l\u00e0 des autorit\u00e9s sur cette question. C'est uniquement dans le droit fran\u00e7ais que nous devons en trouver la solution.\nLes autorit\u00e9s ne manquent pas sur le sujet.\nDans le droit romain le mandataire traitait toujours en son propre nom, et le mandant n'avait pas d'action contre les tiers ni ceux ci contre le mandant. Plus tard, une action \u00e9quitable fat accord\u00e9e par le pr\u00eateur contre le mandant, en faveur des. tiers; mais la r\u00e9ciprocit\u00e9 ne fat pas admise en faveur du mandant. Dans le droit fran\u00e7ais, tel qu'expos\u00e9 par Pothier, Mandat ([23]), cette r\u00e9ciprocit\u00e9 n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 admise non plus. Le droit d'action est reconnu en faveur du tiers contre le mandant dont le mandataire n'a pas divulgu\u00e9 le nom. Mais ii n'est pas accord\u00e9 an mandant dans le m\u00eame cas. Les codificateurs du Code Civil de la Province de Qu\u00e9bec ont adopt\u00e9e la doctrine du Pothier et l'ont consign\u00e9e dans les articles 1716 et 1727. Mais ils n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 plus loin. Ils n'ont pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos d'accorder an mandant dont le nom n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 aux tiers une action contre ceux-ci. Il eut peut-\u00eatre \u00e9t\u00e9 plus logique d'admettre le r\u00e9ciprocit\u00e9 du droit d'action en pareil cas,\u2014mais puisqu'ils n'ont pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos d'en faire m\u00eame la suggestion \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislature, les tribunaux peuvent-ils suppl\u00e9er \u00e0 cette omission? Sans doute que non. Ce serait peut-\u00eatre une am\u00e9lioration mais nous n avons pas le pouvoir de la d\u00e9cr\u00e9ter, A l'origine ii n'y avait aucun droit d'action parce que le mandataire traitait toujours en son propre nom, plus tard l'action fut accord\u00e9e aux tiers contre le mandant, \u2014 c\u00e9tait une am\u00e9lioration, un progr\u00e8s,\u2014c'en e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 un autre, Si l'action e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e an mandant contre les o tiers; mais elle ne la pas \u00e9t\u00e9 comme on pent s'en assurer par le rapport des codificateurs \u00e0 ce sujet ([24]).\nIl y a cinq articles dans cette section, le premier num\u00e9rot\u00e9 '23, roclame la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la responsabilit\u00e9 du. mandant et diff\u00e8re peu de l'article 1998 du code Napol\u00e9on. Troplong cependant interpr\u00e8te de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ne pas lier le mandant lorsque le contrat est au nom du mandataire sans d\u00e9claration du nom da principal, except\u00e9e dans quelques cas particuliers. Cette interpr\u00e9tation est en harmonic avec la doctrine du droit romain; mais elle est en opposition directe avec celle de Pothier, qui est d'accord avec les lois anglaise \u00e9cossaise et am\u00e9ricaine. L'article soumis est bas\u00e9 sur l'expos\u00e9 de la r\u00e8gle de Pothier et comprend tous les actes du mandataire soit qu'il ait agi en son propre nom ou en celui du mandant. Les seuls cas except\u00e9s sont ceux mentionn\u00e9s dans l'articl\u00e9.\nOn voit que les codificateurs n'ont adopt\u00e9 que l'opinion de Pothier qui reconna\u00eet le droit d'action des tiers contre le mandant et rien de plus. Les articles de notre code ne diff\u00e8rent pas en principe de ceux du code fran\u00e7ais, on peut citer l'opinion des commendations sur ce dernier comme applicables \u00e0 la solution de cette question.\nTrop long, Du Mandat ([25]).\nVide aussi Nos. 523 & 535\nLe mandataire agissant en son propre nom s'oblige directement, avons-nous dit. A cette proposition viennent se joindre deux r\u00e8gles que je trouve constat\u00e9es par les monuments los plus importants de la jurisprudence.\nSavoir: Quo le silence garde sur l'existence du Mandat, fait lo. Que le mandant n'a pas d'action contre les tiers; 2\u00b0. Que les tiers n'ont pas d'action contre le mandant.\nQuando manda\u2019arius, says Casaregis, simplicities con trahit, non expressio mandato, adeo in eo redica tur contractus ut mandanti amplius contra tertium nulla competere possil actio.\nEt plus has ii ajoute ces paroles remarquables: Respectu habito ad tertium, mandans consideratur ut persona extranea.\nAinsi point d'actions contre les tiers do la part du mandant. Laurent ([26]):\nQuels seront dans cette hypoth\u00e8se (dans le cas o\u00f9 le mandataire a trait\u00e9 en son nom personnel avec les tiers, sans dire qu'il agit comme mandataire) les rapports du mandant avec les tiers? Il n'y a aucun lien entre le mandant et les tiers, puisque les tiers n'ont pas trait\u00e9 avec le maniant: celui-ci \u00e9tant \u00e9tranger \u00e0 la convention, ii ne peut s'en pr\u00e9valoir contre les tiers, de m\u00eame que les tiers ne peuvent s'en pr\u00e9valoir contre lui.\nSebire &c. Carteret ([27]); DeLamarre & Le Poitvin ([28]); et aussi Duranton ([29]):\nIl n'est pas douteux, quand le mandataire a trait\u00e9 au nom du mandant, que celui-ci peut agir directement contre le tiers avec lequel le mandataire a trait\u00e9, et, r\u00e9ciproquement, que le tiers peut agir directement contre le mandant, mais il nlen est pas de m\u00eame quand le mandataire a trait\u00e9 en son propre nom, ainsi que ' cela avait constamment lieu chez les Romains, et comme on le voit parfois chez nous en mati\u00e8re de mandat ordinaire, et presque touj'ours quand c'est un commissionnaire qui traite. Dans ce cas, le mandant a besoin, pour agir contre le tiers, de se faire c\u00e9der l'action du mandataire contre le mandant, pour agir contre cc dernier; autrement l'un et l'autre n'exercerait que l'action g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l'art 1166, et au nom de leur d\u00e9biteur.\nJe n'en rep\u00e9terai pas ici toutes les citations; je me contenterai de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer aux notes du Juge en Chef, Sir A. A. Dorion qui en contiennent une longue \u00e9num\u00e9ration, ainsi qu'au factum de l'appelante qui en contient plusieurs autres. Pour les raisons adopt\u00e9es par l'Honorable Juge en Chef et par i\u2019 Honorable Juge Ramsay je suis d'opinion avec eux que l'intim\u00e9e n'a pas droit d'action contre l'appelante en vertu de la vente faite \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re par Thompson, Murray & Co.\nUn des motifs du jugement de la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du B. R., est que l'appelante ayant offert $2,390.72, seul montant d\u00fb, d'apr\u00e8s le contrat, suivant elle, s'est par cette offre d\u00e9sist\u00e9 de son objection contre lexistence du droit d'action. Cette proposition serait juste, si l'offre e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 faite sans r\u00e9serve.

Dans l'ordre des plaidoyers c'est la question de l'existence du droit d'action qui dolt \u00eatre d\u00e9cid\u00e9e la premi\u00e8re. Si elle est d\u00e9cid\u00e9e en faveur de l'appelante, elle met fin \u00e0 la contestation et l'action doit \u00eatre r\u00e9nov\u00e9e. Ce n'est que dans le cas o\u00f9 la d\u00e9cision est contraire \u00e0 l'appelante que le second plaidoyer dolt \u00eatre examine et qu'il peutt y avoir lien de d\u00e9clarer Si les offres sont suffisantes on non. Cette mani\u00e8re de \"olaider est d'ailleurs conforme an Code P. C. et \u00e0 la pratique suivie dans la cour de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, et no peut pas \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e contre l'appelante comme une r\u00e9nonciation de sa part \u00e0 son premier plaidoyer. Elle est aussi conforme \u00e0 l'autorit\u00e9 de Carr\u00e9 et Chauveau. En traitant de l'ordre des plaidoyers ii s'exprime ainsi ([30]):\nLa premi\u00e8re c'est qu'on peut se borner \u00e0 ne pr\u00e9senter que les exceptions de proc\u00e9dure, en se r\u00e9servant toutefois de proc\u00e9der au fond au cas qu'elles fussent rejet\u00e9es \u2022 et alors c'est au d\u00e9fendeur \u00e0 plaider le premier, parce qu'il est demandeur en exception: Reus excipiendo fit actor. La seconde c'est que les exceptions de proc\u00e9dure doivent n\u00e9cessairement \u00eatre oppos\u00e9es avant les exceptions de droit, qui. elles-m\u00eames, doivent \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es avant les moyens du fond, puisqu'elles ont pour objet d'en \u00e9viter la discussion.\nN\u00e9anmoins, comme les exceptions de droit peuvent \u00eatre oppos\u00e9es en tout \u00e9tat de cause \u00e0 moins qu'on ait renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 celles qui ne tiennent qu'\u00e0 l'int\u00e9r\u00eat priv\u00e9, on n'aurait point \u00e0 craindre qu'elles fussent rejet\u00e9es pour n'avoir pas \u00e9t\u00e9 oppos\u00e9es avant les d\u00e9fenses proprement dites.\nBioche Vo.

Cependant je crois devoir faire l'observation qu'il ne me parait pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 pris en consid\u00e9ration dans son ensemble. On a perdu de vue je crois, le fait que l'appelante pr\u00e9tend que la vente dont ii s'agit dolt \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 faite conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'usage du commerce.

The appellants purchased, not from the respondents, but from Messrs. Thompson & Murray, and they purchased from them, not as agents of the respondents, but as being the owners of the property, goods or chattels so purchased by the appellants. The real owner of the goods at the time was not disclosed to the purchaser. No doubt at one time, neither in France nor in Quebec could either of these parties bring an action, but the law of Quebec was changed to the extent that the party purchasing who deals with the agents of an undisclosed principal is entitled to bring an action against the principal. That is laid down in the code but it goes no further; it does not say that the mandator shall have, an action against the party who deals with his agents. But We are told that because there is an action allowed by the code against the mandator, therefore it works both ways. We may fairly assume that if it was intended by the code that that should be the case it would have been provided in the code as well that the mandator should have the right of action as that the party contracting with his agent should have the right of action against him. I therefore take the ground that this action will not lie under the present legislation in the Province of Quebec.\nThen there is another objection that is taken by the party here; it is this: He said, \"You purchased on this bill of lading, and you had the choice of purchasing the quantity mentioned in the bill of lading, or had the option of having it weighed at the expense of the sellers, Thompson, Murray & Co.\" Practically, they agreed to take it on the bill of lading, and, under ordinary circumstances, they might possibly be bound by it but for two reasons. In the first place it was proved on the trial and uncontradicted that there was a universal practice in Montreal of purchasing cargoes on bill of lading and it was only intended to cover a deficiency of four or five tons; it was never understood, and never intended by the parties that the shortage should go beyond that in such a contract. If that was the case and the parties said they would go by the bill of lading they would not be answerable for more than four or five tons, and not for such a deficiency as forty or fifty tons. Then, there is another question, which is an important one here. When these parties disclose themselves they must take the contract in all its relations, and imported into that contract is the fact that their captain signed the bill of lading, certifying that he had all this coal on board when he had not Then is it proved that he had not? It is for this reason that every single load of that coal is weighed, and there is not the slightest suspicion of the correctness of such weighing, and it is clearly shown that the quantity short is fifty tons. Then the owner of the coal says to the buyers, \" You must pay us for that amount of coal !\" The others say \" No we did not get that amount of coal.\" \" But,\" says the owner, \" If you did not get it, the sellers say you agreed to take it according to the bill of lading of Thompson, Murray & Co.\" They reply that they did not buy the bill of lading, but they bought a certain quantity of coal as guaranteed by the bill of lading. They did not become the endorsers of the bill of ladino but got their right to that property by purchase direct from Thompson, Murray & Co. who told them \" we have got a bill of lading saying that the captain has received so many tons of coal on board.\" But the owners come in afterwards after the amount is in dispute, and say \" you are bound to pay us because you agreed to take the quantity in the bill of lading.\" \" It is true, we did agree,\" the appellants say, \" but \u201c we agreed through the false representations made by y your servant, the captain, that he had that quantity on \" board, for which false representation you are answer\" able, and if there is liability upon us in one respect, there is also liability on your part to counteract that.\" I am not sufficiently acquainted with the administration and procedure of the law in Quebec, but I believe I am justified in saying that under the pleadings and practice and administration of the law there it is a good defence for those parties to come in and say, \"we \" did not get that coal, we bought it on the misrepresentation of your servant, you never gave it to us.\" That being the case and that being the law I feel that this appeal ought to be allowed and that these parties should be declared not liable to pay for coal which they never got. It is said \"you took the option at the time \"and could have had it weighed in the presence of the \" parities at the ship's side at the expense of the seller.\" I maintain that it is no matter where the coal is weighed if the evidence is sufficient to convince judge and jury that the quantity is as alleged, and that it is a correct weighing. The party was not obliged to get it weighed, and he was not obliged to give the other parties notice that he was going to weigh it All that is required is to prove satisfactorily that the quantity was not there, and if it was not there, the question arises: Have those parties who represented that it was, the right to be paid for what they did not supply? I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed.\"\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014It is in evidence that Thompson Murray & Co. are the general agents at Montreal of the Canada Shipping Co., and well known to be such. Now when the appellants bought coal from such a firm, publicly known as the agents of the respondents, can they be said to have dealt with an undisclosed principal?\nLe nom du mandant (says Troplong) ([33]) peut s'attacher \u00e0 lact\u00e9 par des circonstances de fait, par une certaine publicit\u00e9 de position, que les tribunaux doivent appr\u00e9cier avec \u00e9quit\u00e9.\nSee also B\u00e9darrides ([34]). Leaving this question aside however, I am of opinion with the Court of Queen's Bench that the Hudon Company, in tendering as they have done and depositing in Court with one of their pleas, the sum of $2,890722. as part payment for the coal in question, have acknowledged the Canada Shipping Co. as their vendors, and have admitted the said Canada Shipping Co.'s locus standi in this case. The contention that they cannot be bound by the admission contained in that plea because by another plea or in the same plea they denied the plaintiff's rights altogether, or any privity of contract with them seems to me untenable.\nThe conclusion of their said plea of tender and deposit is as follows i\nWherefore, the said defendants without acknowledging any in debtedness towards the plaintiffs, and praying acte of their said tender and offer of twenty-eight hundred and ninety dollars and seventy two cents, further pray that said tender and offer may be declared good and sufficient and that said plaintiff's action for any further and greater amount may be dismissed, the whole with costs including costs of protest and of exhibits distraits to the undersigned.\nIt is true that a party is allowed to fyle incompatible pleas, but it is not the less true that the offer of a confession of judgment, even only for a part of the amount demanded, or a plea of tender and payment in court must be held to be an admission by the defendant of the plaintiff s title as his creditor. In the case of a confession of judgment, the plaintiff may accept it, and in the case of atender and payment in court, he is entitled to receive the monies paid in without prejudicing his claim to the remainder. In Marc Aur\u00e8le v. Durocher ([35]) though the defendant had offered, in one of his pleas, to confess judgment he claimed that the action should be dismissed Mr. Justice Johnson said:\nStill less inmortalice attaches to the contention that this offer was made under reservation of all matters previously pleaded. It is intelligible that under the system of pleading that still exists in this country a defendant may plead everything he chooses, under reservation of everything else that he has already pleaded; that is to say, that he can go on contesting the action under as many new grounds as he pleases, reserving all that he has pleaded before tending to the same end, viz: the dismissal of the action 5 but I cannot understand how he can be allowed to reserve to himself the benefit of previous pretensions set up in order to get the action dismissed. while he admits that judgment ought to be rendered against him. A defendant may ask for the dismissal of an action against him for as many \u00bfrood reasons as he is able to give; but he surely cannot be allowed to ask in nineteen consecutive pleas that the plaintiff be sent out of court and reserve to himself the benefit of all these pretensions in a. twentieth plea admitting that the same plaintiff is entitled to judgment; or, in other words, asks to reserve means of defence which he expressly renounces.\nWhat was said in that case by Mr. Justice Johnson about a confession of judgment applies with still greater force, it seems to me, to a plea of tender and payment in court.\nIn Gorrie v. The Mayor of Montreal ([36]) the defendants had pleaded a tender of part of the sum claimed with also a defence au funds en fait. The Superior Court had dismissed the action altogether. The presiding judge, adopting the same ground as taken in the present case by the appellants, had said:\nThe defendants admit the balance of \u00a375, which is all the plain tiff is entitled to claim, but if the action does not exist, I can take no notice of such tender, it amounts to nothing,\nThe case, however, was carried to appeal, and the judgment was reversed, and defendants condemned. Judgment in appeal not reported; I have a note of it through the kindness of the prothonotaries of the Superior Court, Montreal.\nAlso in Boulangtt v. The Mayor of Mont Tell ([37]) though a tender had been pleaded and a payment in court of the sum so tendered had been made, the Superior Court had dismissed the plaintiff's action altogether, but on appeal this judgment was reversed and it was held, Sir L. H. Lafontaine delivering the judgment of the court, that a plea in a case by which the defendant admits that a part of the sum claimed is due to the plaintiff, praying act\u00e9 of the deposit of the sum so admitted, and also praying that the plaintiff's action for the surplus he dismissed, entitles the plaintiff to a judgment for the sum tendered and paid into court. In the present case, it is true, the defendant's plea denied entirely the indebtedness, but how could he do so or what effect can this have, when he offered the plaintiff a part of the sum claimed.\nThe law is that if one pays a debt voluntarily, knowing what objections he could oppose to the payment, he is presumed to renounce his right to avail himself of such objections. And this even if he pays under protest and reserve. Solon Nullit\u00e9s says ([38]):\nL'ex\u00e9cution volontaire est une veritable ratification 1 elle couvee toutes les nullit\u00e9s de la convention ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e, lors m\u00eame qu'en ex\u00e9cuaant la partie ferait des protestations et des reserves pour pouvoir l'attaquer dans la suite. On con\u00e7oit que ces reserves tombent devant une execution contraire \u00e0 laquelle on n'\u00e9tait pas oblige.\nAna B\u00e9darride de la fraude ([39]):\nEx\u00e9cuter volontairement un acte qu'on sait \u00eatre nul ou rescinda ble c'est indiquer aussi positivement que possible qu'on renonce \u00e0 l'attaquer d\u00e9sormais Cela est si \u00e9vident que les r\u00e9serves qui accompagnaient l'ex\u00e9cution n'en att\u00e9nueraient aucunement l'importance et n'apporteraient aucun obstacle \u00e0 la fin de non-recevoir qu'elle cr\u00e9e.\nLa r\u00e9serve contraire au fait n'op\u00e9re pas, lorsque l'ex\u00e9cution est livre is a maxim equally applicable to procedure ([40]) and to contracts and obligations, and the principles upon which it is based rule the pleas in a case, as well as the acts of the parties out of the case. If a party executes an act or performs an obligation under all the circumstances which would make such execution or performance a valid implied ratification of such act or obligation, the protest or reserve with which this execution or performance might be accompanied are of no avail and do not hinder the effect of the ratification.\nHere, the defendants tendered as voluntarily as possible a part of the sum claimed; they did so with the full knowledge of their possible objections to the plaintiffs claim in toto: the protestations and reserves in their plea consequently fall to the ground.\nBuchanan J. in Bertrand V. Hinerth ([41]) held that a d\u00e9fense an fonds en tait does not affect or impair the strength and force of admissions contained in another plea.\nIn Monty. Ruiter ([42]), Bert helot J. held: \"That in an action for false imprisonment, the admission of defendant in one of his pleas is sufficient proof of his having caused the arrest of the plaintiff, although another of the pleas is the general issue, and that such an admission relieves the plaintiff from the necessity of making other proof of the fact.\"\nIn Viger v. Beliveau ([43]), a plea of tender had been fyled with a plea of general issue, and the Superior Court had dismissed the action. The case was carried to appeal, and it was then held by Aylwin, Duval, Meredith and Monk JJ. that the defendant having ad mitted by one of his pleas the existence of a verbal lease the admission of this plea should be taken against him, although he had also pleaded the general issue and that when there is a plea of tender for part of the sum claimed the action cannot be dismissed in toto.\nIn Bussi\u00e9re v Blais ([44]), Mr. Justice Meredith for the court, referring to an admission in the defendant's plea, says: \"Here we have a very unequivocal recognition of the plaintiff's right of property; and according to a recent judgment of the Court of Appeals, the plaintiff has a right to the benefit of that admission notwithstanding the d\u00e9fense en fail filed by the d\u00e9fendant.\"\nUpon the question whether the defendants, present appellants, are entitled to claim a reduction for the alleged deficiency in the quantity of the coal I concur fully in what the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Queen's Bench said for the court as follows:\nUpon the second question, we are, I believe, all of opinion that the respondent having made his option to take the cargo of coal for the quantity mentioned in the bill of lading, instead of having it reweighed with the sellers, as he was entitled to cannot claim & reduction in the price on account of deficiency in the quantity, except on the ground of fraud, and there is no fraud proved in this case. It would be extremely dangerous to allow a purchaser who has chosen to receive delivery in bulk and without weighing, to assert, two or three weeks after such delivery, and after the coal has been mixed with other coal, so as to prevent any verification by the seller, that there was, according to his own calculation a deficiency for which he was entitled to a reduction in the price of his contract. The respondents are, we consider, by the option which they have made to receive the coal in bulk concluded against claiming a reduction of the price of the coal. Moreover their laches in not giving notice of their intention 'to weigh the coal and in mixing it with other coal, so as to prevent verification, before they informed the sellers of the pretended deficiency would in any ordinary case, be sufficient to reject their claim for a reduction and we are therefore of opinion that on both grounds the tender made by the respondents is insufficient.\nThis seems to me unanswerable. The defendants, appellants here having waived their right to have the quantity verified at the time of delivery, made the option to take the bill of lading as conclusive proof of the quantity They are estopped from now complaining of their own option. There certainly was no fraud on the part of the vendors;. there may have been an error in the shipment of the cargo, or a part of it may have been jettisoned. Moreover, if the defendants, notwithstanding their option, thought that they had a claim for deficiency, they should have given notice to the plaintiffs of their intention to reweigh and should certainly not have mixed the coal Their mixing the coal with other in their yard was another acceptance of it as sold per bill of lading The delay in ascertaining that deficiency and notifying the plaintiffs of it was also too long. .\" Il suffit de remarquer que la verification dolt \u00eatre provoqu\u00e9e et faite dans le plus bref d\u00e9lai,\" says Pardessus No. 285 All the authorities are clear in the same sense.\nI am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed. It is unnecessary for me to consider the question decided affirmatively by the court appealed from, whether under our law, a principal can bring an action upon a contract made by his agent, when such agent contracted in his own name and without disclosing his principal. I do not wish my silence on this point however, to he construed as throwing a doubt on my part on the \u00b0 correctness of the decision given by the court below on that part of the case.\nGWYNEE J.\u2014This is an appeal by the defendants in an action brought against them in the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec by the plaintiffs upon a contract alleged to have been entered into between the plaintiffs and defendants through the intervention of a broker by bought and sold notes. The plaintiffs in their declaration in short substance, allege that on tue 13th day of August. 1879. the plaintiffs acting by a firm of the name of Thompson, Murray & Co , doing business at Montreal and general agents of the plaintiffs for the Province of Quebec, through James S. Noad of Montreal, broker sold to the defendants at their request a certain cargo of best South Wales black vein steam coal, then on board the plaintiffs' ship, called the Lake Ontario at the rate of three dollars and seventy five cents per ton of two thousand two hundred and forty pounds, customs duty paid ex ship. That said cargo according to to the bill of lading of said ship contained eight hundred and ten of said tons and five hundred weight; that (among other things) it was stipulated as a condition of the said sale that the defendants should have the option of taking the said coal at the total weight appearing on the face of the bill of lading or of having said cargo reweighed at the expense of the seller and of paying for the exact number of tons so found to be contained in said cargo that thereupon the said Noad on the said 13th day of August delivered to the defendants a bought note signed by him, setting out the said sale and said terms and conditions thereto attached, and on the same day delivered to said Thompson, Murray & Co. an identical note signed by him called a sold note, which last note is in the words and figures following ([45]).\nThat the ship arrived at Montreal on 3rd September; that the defendants thereupon elected and agreed to accept the said cargo according to the weight given to it on the face of the bill of lading, being entitled to any surplus and accepting the risk of deficit that might exist over or below the said bill of lading weight and refused to have the same reweighed at the expense of the vendor; that the said cargo was duly delivered to the defendants, duty paid ex ship as per bill of lading, on the 3rd of September, 1879; that said bought and sold notes and the invoice which was rendered to the defendants according to the usage and custom of trade in that behalf and the previous dealings between said parties bear the name of Thompson, Murray & Co., but said coal was ever the property of the plaintiffs, and plaintiffs were the principals ir? said transaction, and the said sale was made in plaintiffs' interest and on their behalf alone as the defendants well knew; the declaration then alleges non-payment of the price agreed upon or any part thereof by the defendants. The declaration also contains a count for goods sold and delivered.\nTo this declaration the defendants plead 1st A general denial of all allegations in the declaration; that the defendants never had any dealings with the plaintiffs but that in all transactions of which mention is made in the declaration the defendants contracted only with the firm of Thompson, Murray &. Co.\n2nd plea. Admitting that the defendants, on the 13th August, 1879, bought from Thompson, Murray & Co., through Noad, a cargo of eight hundred and ten tons (of twenty-two hundred and forty pounds each ton) and five hundred weight of the best South Wales black vein steam coal mentioned in the bill of lading thereof as being on board the ship Lake Ontario then on her voyage and expected to arrive within a few days at Montreal, at the price of $3.75 per ton admitting also the arrival and the delivery to the defendants of a quantity of coal which the defendants caused to be weighed on an approved scale avers that instead of said coal weighing 810 tons, 5 cwt., as bought by defendants, and as men- tioned in the bill of lading, it weighed only 755 tons and 580 lbs.; that by the custom and usage of merchants the vendor of a cargo of coal as per bill of lading is always understood to sell the quantity mentioned in the bill of lading without any large or important variance therefrom, the purchaser being at all events understood to pay only for the quantity delivered; that vessels of the class of the Lake Ontario,\" in transporting coal are well known to the mercantile community not to vary to an extent exceeding five or six tons, the surplus or deficiency being always less than ten tons, but that the deficiency of the cargo in question was 55 tons; that in purchasing said cargo and in making option to receive the same as per bill of lading instead of having said coal weighed at the expense of the vendor, the defendants never agreed or intended, and could never have been understood according to the custom and usage of trade to have agreed or intended, to assume the risk of a deficiency in said coal of more than ten tons; that the plaintiffs, at the time of the shipment of the coal on board said vessel and at the time of said contract and of the delivery of the coal were and are now the owners of said vessel l that the captain of the said vessel as servants of the plaintiffs in signing the said bill of lading, represented that the quantity named therein was on board the said vessel l and that it was on the faith of that representation and of similar representations made by said firm of Thompson, Murray & Co., that the defendants agreed to take the said cargo as per bill of lading without asking the reweighing thereof; that the said plaintiffs were and are aware that the said master of said vessel has been in the habit of signing bills of lading for cargoes of coal without ascertaining the quantity thereof, and have allowed him to do so assuming themselves the responsibility incurred in consequence; that, to the knowledge of the plaintiffs, the said ship was not ' loaded in the ordinary and regular way, and said cargo was not weighed at the time when it was put on board the said vessell; that neither the plaintiffs nor Thompson, Murray & Co. paid for any more than the quantity of 755 tons and 580 pounds, the quantity delivered to defendants, and that said plaintiffs and Thompson, Murray & Co. well knew that the said cargo was not of the quantity of 810 tons, 5 cwt., but only of the quantity delivered to defendants as aforesaid, and that said Thompson, Murray & Co. in offering said carso to be accepted for a cargo of 810 tons,5 cwt., practiced a fraud upon the defendants.\nThe plea then alleges a tender to Thompson, Murray & Co. of $2,890.72, being at the rate of $3.75 per ton for 755 tons and 580 lbs. delivered to the defendants, and ten tons added as the extreme limit of variance allowed according to the custom of the trade together with interest thereon from the 3rd September, 1879, which sum Thompson, Murray & Co. refused, and thereupon the defendants bring it into court and plead it as a payment into court in this cause\nTo the first of these pleas the plaintiffs reply denying all the defendants' allegations therein to be true and reaffirming the truth of the allegations in the declaration.\nTo the second plea they reply that they were and are wholly ignorant of any weighing of said coal as alleged in the plea, and that they never had any notice thereof, and that the defendants chose to buy as per bill of lading instead of actual weighing, in the hope of making a profit thereby as they would have been entitled to do even had the surplus amounted to 50 or 60 tons.\nThe plaintiffs further specially deny that any such custom and usage of merchants as alleged in said plea exists. That cargoes vary considerably in their delivery weights, and that the defendants accepted all risk in connection with the actual output of the cargo in question. That the said bill of lading was signed by the captain of the L Lake Ontario \" in good faith, after the customary weighing at the point of shipment and in the belief that the said bill of lading represented the bou\u00e2 fide weight of said cargo.\nThat said cargo was bought on account of and for the plaintiffs who paid the price thereof and the Canadian customs duties thereon, upon the basis of the total weight set forth in said bill of lading, and the defendants specially deny that the captain of the Lake Ontario ever to the knowledge of the plaintiffs acted in the manner falsely set forth in said plea, and they deny that the said ship was not loaded in the ordinary and regular way, and that the said cargo was not weighed at the time the coal was laden on board the vessel, as falsely alleged in said plea, and they aver that the defendants accepted said cargo according to said contract and their said option to take the same as per bill of lading and for more than a month after said acceptance did not pretend or object that they were not liable because of any of the matters alleged in the said plea and they have never tendered back such cargo and the plaintiffs deny that, they recognize the tender alleged in defendants' plea as made previous to the institution of the action, but insist upon its insufficiency. And for second answer to said second plea the plaintiffs say that the allegations of said plea are false and that the allegations of plaintiffs' declaration are true.\nThe above pleadings contain all the material issues joined between the parties in this action.\nAs to the first \"part urged by and on behalf of the defendants, namely: that the contract was with Thompson, Murray & Co., who therefore should be the plain tiffs, it is not open to the defendants to urge that cont\u00e9ntion in the present action, for after a plea of payment into court the defendant cannot nonsuit the plaintiff nor take any objection however valid to the sufficiency of the cause of action to which he has so pleaded. Wright v. Goddard ([46]). The plea admits all material allegations in the declaration which the plaintiff might be compelled to prove in order to recover the amount paid in. Dyer v. Ashton ([47]); Cooper v. Blick ([48]); Wright v. Goddard.\nThen, as to the allegations in the defendants' second plea to the effect that the plaintiffs were aware that their servant, the captain of their vessel, was in the habit of signing bills of lading for cargoes of coal without ascertaining the quantity thereof; and that to the knowledge of the plaintiffs their vessel was not loaded with the cargo in question in the ordinary and regular way, for that the cargo was not weighed at the time it was put on board the vessel; and that the plaintiffs paid for no more than the 755 tons and 580 lbs, delivered to the defendants; and that they knew the cargo, as delivered to the defendants, contained no more; all these allegations impose upon the defendants the burden of proving them and they have failed to do so. The case therefore is made to rest upon the allegation of difference between the quantity as stated in the bill of lading and that delivered to the defendants, and the alleged usage of the trade in accepting delivery of a cargo as per bill of lading.\nUpon this point, the contention of the plaintiffs is that when a purchaser of a cargo accepts, as the defendants did here, delivery of the cargo as per bill of lading, both vendor and purchaser assume the risk of any variance, however great it may be, between the actual quantity delivered and that as stated in the bill of lading, so that in this case if in truth only 100 tons and been actually delivered, the defendants must nevertheless pay for 810 tons and if 1200 tons had been delivered, in fact, they should still only have to pay only for the 810 tons; on the contrary the contention of the d\u00e9tendant is that it is well understood in the trade that in a vessel of the class of the Lake Ontario the difference should not exceed ten tons, and for such a variance it is admitted by the defendants that the vendor and purchaser alike assume the risk. The contention of the plaintiffs, if it should prevail would establish a condition of things much more favorable to a vendor than to a purchaser, as it is more likely to occur that a cargo on board of a vessel should be less than the capacity of the vessel than that it should be, to any considerable extent, greater than the vessel's capacity; but the plaintiffs contention seems so to shock a sense of justice that no such usage as they contend for ever could in my judgment, be permitted to prevail in law and indeed it is not suggested in the evidence that such a usage is supposed to exist, or that, in fact, such a case ever occurred. The evidence seems to me to establish that a clearly proved variance of 55 tons out of a cargo of 810 tons, as alleged here, would be so utterly exceptional and unreasonable that the law could not justify the plaintiff s recovery for 810 tons, if in truth only 755 tons had been delivered; and if the plaintiffs here had had notice given them of the intended weighing by the defendants, on their own scales, of the cargo as delivered so as to enable the plaintiffs to check the weights, and if then it had been established beyond doubt that the alleged deficiency in the cargoes existed, and if the defendants had promptly asserted their claim and ascertained the deficiency so as to enable the plaintiffs to assert their claim against their vendors to correct an error which, however it occurred, we must upon the evidence, take to have been an innocent mistake I cannot doubt that the defendants would have been entitled to redress in this action. It is, however, suggested that although it is admitted that for such a deficiency as is alleged by the defendants if satisfactorily proved to have existed they are still entitled to redress, yet that they are not so entitled as a defence to the present action, and that to obtain redress they must bring an action upon the bill of lading.\nI can see no foundation whatever for this positon. In fact the defendants had nothing to say to the bill of lading, in the sense of its having ever belonged to them as their property. They did not acquire their title to the cargo through any transfer to them of the bill of lading. It is not indeed suggested that it was as\u00b0 signed to them. They acquired their title by the contract contained in the bought and sold notes by which they might accept delivery either according to the statement of the qantity in the bill of lading Or by weight over the ship's side, and they had no occasion even to look at the bill of lading, unless it might be to see whether the qantity stated in it was the same as was stated in their contract. The bill of lading as an evidence of property discharged its functions when the plaintiffs, who were the consignees and owners of the cargo, received the cargo. To admit that the defendants are entitled to redress and compensation for the alleged deficiency, if they bring their action upon a bill of lading which never was their property, seems to me to be a mockery of their complaint. However inasmuch as the defendants gave no notice to the plaintiffs of their intended weighing of the coal upon the defendants' own scales, and so the plaintiffs had no opportunity to check the weights, and as the defendants did not make prompt claim upon the plaintiffs for the alleged deficiency, I do not think it would be reasonable to hold the plaintiffs to be bound by the ex parte weighing of the defendants, upon the evidence given in the case, or to recognise a claim so tardily made by the defendants.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Beique, McGoun & Emard.\nSolicitors for respondents: Davidson & Cross.\n[1] 2 Dorion's Q.

On a recount before the County Court Judge, J., the appellant, who had a minority of votes according to the return of the returning officer, was declared elected, all the ballots cast at three polling districts, in which the appellant had polled only 331 votes and the respondent, B., 345, having been struck out on the ground that the deputy returning officer had neglected to place his initials upon the back of the ballot. On appeal to the Supreme Court of P. E. Island, it was proved that the deputy returning officer had placed his initials on the counterfoil before giving the ballot paper to the voter, and afterwards, previous to his putting the ballot in the ballot box, had detached and destroyed the coun\u00adterfoil, and that the ballots used were the same as those he had supplied to the voters, and Mr. Justice Peters held that the ballots of the said three polls ought to be counted and did count them. Thereupon J.appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, and it was\nHeld,\u2014Affirming the judgment of Mr. Justice Peters, that in the pre\u00adsent case the deputy returning officer having had the means of identifying the ballot papers as being those supplied by him to the voters, and the neglect of the deputy returning officers to put their initials on the back of these ballot papers, not having affected the result of the election, or caused substantial injustice, did not invalidate the election. (The decision in the Monck Election Case commented on and approved of ([1]).\nIn this case J., the appellant, claimed under sec. 66 of 37 Vic, ch. 10, that if he was not entitled to the seat the election should be declared void, on the ground of irregularities in the conduct of the election generally, and fyled no counter petition, and did not otherwise comply with the provisions of 37 Vic, ch. 10, The Dominion Controverted Elections Act.\nHeld,\u2014That sec. 66 of 37 Vic, ch. 10, only applies to cases of recrimi\u00adnatory charges and not to a case where neither of the parties or their agents are charged with doing any wrongful act.\nQuoere,\u2014Whether the County Judge can object to the validity of a ballot paper when no objection has been made to the same by the candidate or his agent, or an elector, in accordance with the provisions of sec. 56 37 Vic. ch. 10, at the time of the counting of the votes by the deputy returning officer.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Mr. Justice Peters, of the Supreme Court of Judicature for the province of Prince Edward Island, declaring that the petitioner, F. De St. Croix Brecken, in the election petition against the return of Theophilus Jenkins, as the member elect representing Queen's county, Prince Edward Island, in the House of Commons of the Dominion of Canada, was the duly elected member of the Dominion Parlia\u00adment for said Queen's county.\nThe election was held on the 20th of June, 1882. At the election the candidates were the petitioner and respondent, who ran together as the liberal-conservative candidates, and Louis Henry Davin and David Laird, who ran as the opposition candidates.\nOn the 27th day of June, the returning officer added up the votes and declared the result of the poll; as follows:\u2014\nPetitioner, (Brecken)................................. 3472\nDavies....................................................... 3516\nRespondent, (Jenkins)............................. 3462\nLaird............................................... 3062\nAnd Messrs. Davies and Brecken were by him re\u00adturned elected.\nA recount was then applied for by the said John T. Jenkins, and held before a county court judge, and on such recount the said judge certified the result of poll, as follows:\u2014\nDavies............................................. .......... 3164\nJenkins................................................... 3122\nBrecken................................................... 3120\nLaird............................................... 2759\nThe county court judge, in arriving at his conclusion, struck out all the ballots cast at three polling districts, namely, at districts Nos. 23, 27 and 33, at which dis\u00adtricts the total number of votes cast were as follows:\u2014\nBrecken........................................... .......... 345\nDavies...........................................\u2026........ 334\nJenkins................................................... 331\nLaird.......................................\u2026\u2026. 289\nThe ground of rejecting these votes, was that the deputy returning officer had neglected to place his initials upon the back of the ballots. To this ruling and certain other rulings on the recount, which are hereafter mentioned, the petitioner objected, and accord\u00adingly filed this petition.\nThe cause was tried before Mr. Justice Peters, who declared that the petitioner (present respondent) was duly elected for Queen\u2019s county at said election.\nOn a scrutiny of the votes, and on appeal to the Supreme Court, there were objections taken to several ballots.\nThe first ballot objected to by the appellant was one marked thus:\u2014\nElection for the Electoral District of Queen's County, June 20th, 1882.\nThis ballot was allowed by Mr. Justice Peters, and his ruling was affirmed on appeal. The next ballot was marked thus:\nElection for the Electoral District of Queen's County, June 20th, 1882.\nFirst cross allowed for Mr. Brecken, second cross disallowed. The next ballot was marked thus:\nElection for the Electoral District of Queen's County, June 29th, 1882.\nAllowed for Mr. Jenkins The next ballot was marked thus, with the slight pencil straight line in the first division:\nElection for the Electoral District of Queen's County, June 29th, 1882.\nDisallowed by Mr. Justice Peters and allowed on appeal for Mr. Jenkins. The next ballot was marked thus:\nElection for the Electoral District of Queen\u2019s County, June 29th, 1882.\nDisallowed by Mr. Justice Peters and ruling affirmed.\nThe next ballot, the x was found to be on the back of the ballot corresponding with the division contain\u00ading Mr. Jenkins' name and was disallowed\nThe other material facts of the case and objections raised sufficiently appear in the judgments here in after given.\nMr. Lash, Q.C., for appellant, and Mr. Hector Cameron, Q.C., for respondent.\nThe main arguments of counsel and cases cited are fully set out in the judgments. RITCHIE, C. J.:\u2014\nThis was au appeal from the decision of Mr. Justice Peters, on the petition of Frederick de St. Croix Brecken, deciding against the return of John Theophilus Jenkins, as a member of the House of Commons, for the electoral district of Queen's County, in the Province of Prince Edward Island.\nThe candidates at the election were the respondent, Louis Henry Davies, the appellant and David Laird.\nThe Returning Officer declared the respondent and Louis Henry Davies elected and declared the total number of votes polled for each candidate to be as follow B:\u2014The respondent, 3,472; Louis Henry Davies, 8,516; the appellant, 3,462; David Laird, 3,052.\nThe appellant demanded a recount of votes before the Judge of the County Court; a recount was held before the said judge, and the result of such recount is as follows:\u2014The respondent, 3,120; Louis Henry Davies, 3,264; the appellant, 3,122; David Laird, 2,759.\nThereupon the said appellant and Louis Henry Davies were declared duly elected to represent the said county in the House of Commons.\nThe County Court Judge, in arriving at his conclu\u00adsion, struck out all the ballots cast at three polling districts, namely, at districts Nos. 23, 27 and 33, at which districts the total number of votes cast were as follows:\u2014Brecken, 345; Davies, 334; Jenkins, 331; Laird, 289.\nThe ground of rejecting these votes was, that the deputy returning officer had neglected to place his initials upon the back of the ballots, he having by mistake placed them on the counterfoil. To this ruling and certain other rulings on the recount the petitioner objected, and accordingly filed this petition.\nThe appellant contended at the trial and still con\u00adtends that the rules and provisions contained in the act were not complied with and that mistakes were made which did or might affect the result of the elec\u00adtion.\nMr. Justice Peters ruled that the ballots at said three districts ought to be counted and did count them,\nThe appellant filed objections and recriminatory case under 66th section of \"The Dominion Controverted Elections Act, 1874,\" which are on fyle.\nBy 41 Vic., ch. 6, sec. 43 of 37 Vic., ch. 9 is repealed and the following substituted:\u2014\"\nEach elector, being introduced one at a time, for each compart\u00adment, into the room where the poll is held, shall declare1 his name, surname and addition, when shall be entered or recorded in the voters' list to be kept for that purpose by the poll clerk ; and if the same be found on the list of electors for the polling district of such polling station, he shall receive from the deputy returning officer a ballot paper, on the back of which such deputy returning officer shall have previously put his initials, so placed that when the ballot is folded they can be seen without opening it; and on the counter\u00adfoil to which he shall have placed a number corresponding to that opposite the voter's name on the voter's list.\nThe 45 section of the same act is also repealed and the following substituted:\u2014\nThe elector, on receiving the ballot paper, shall forthwith proceed into one of the compartments of the polling station, and there mark his ballot paper, making a cross with a pencil on any part of the ballot paper within the division (or if there be more than one to be elected, within the divisions) containing the name (or names) of the candidate (or candidates) for whom he intends to vote, and shall then fold up such ballot paper so that the initials on the back can be seen without opening it, and hand it to the deputy returning officer, who shall, without unfolding it, ascertain by examining his initials and the number on the counterfoil, that it is the same that he fur\u00adnished to the elector, and shall first detach and destroy the counter\u00adfoil, and shall then immediately, and in the presence of the elector, place the ballot paper in the ballot box.\nIt is clear from the substituted section 45 of the Election Act, 1874, that the sole object of the initialling of the ballot is to enable the deputy returning officer to ascertain, by examining his initials on the ballot and the No. on the counterfoil, that the ballot is the same that he furnished to the elector; this is to all intents and purposes as practically effected when the ballot paper with the counterfoil attached is handed to him and he examines the number and his initials upon the counter\u00adfoil as if the initials had been on the ballot paper, for the ballot paper and counterfoil are but, in fact, one paper, until after such examination he detaches and destroys the counterfoil. In this case, having by such examination established beyond the possibility of a doubt that the paper handed to him by the voter was the identical paper furnished by him to the elector, he then detached and destroyed the counterfoil, and imme\u00addiately, and in the presence of the elector, placed the ballot paper in the ballot box, whereby all that the legislature intended to accomplish was effected beyond all question or doubt, viz.:\u2014that the elector had handed back to the officer the very paper which the officer had furnished to the elector. The requirements of the statute having been substantially fulfilled, upon what principle can we, in the absence of any enactment declaring that misplacing his initials by the officer, though working no, injury whatever, shall destroy the vote, punish by disfranchisement the voter who, so far as he is concerned, has been guilty of no violation of the law, but has marked his ballot and returned it to the officer as the law directs, and the officer has the means of identifying the ballot as effectually to all intents and purposes as if the initials had been on the ballot itself ?\nBut we are not left to inference to discover the duty of the deputy returning officer in counting the ballots. The substituted section 55 as to the counting of the votes by the deputy returning officer, and on proceed\u00ading to count the number of votes given for each can- didate, declaring what ballot papers he is to reject, enacts that \"he shall reject all ballot papers which have not been supplied by the deputy returning officer, all those by which votes have been given for more candidates than are to be elected, and all those upon which there is any writing or mark by which the voter could be identified.\" Does not this enumeration con\u00adtain all the grounds which would justify a rejection of a ballot, and is not the maxim we find so often made applicable to the interpretation of statutes, viz: expressio unius est exclusio alterius very applicable; for the grounds of rejection named are not put by way of example; but we have in addition this express language showing that the enumerated ballots only are to be rejected. In sec. 10, following the sub-sec. 55, are these words, \"the other ballots being counted,\" &c. How is it possible the deputy returning officer could legally reject ballot papers which he had the means of identi\u00adfying beyond a peradventure as having been supplied by him to the. Voters; which he has identified, and which he swears were the very ballot papers he had actually sup\u00adplied to the electors respectively, and which they had marked, and from which he had, after such identification, detached the counterfoil, and which immediately, in the presence of the elector, he had placed in the ballot box?\nAnd by sub-section 4 of section 14 of the act 41 Vic., ch. 6, the judge is to proceed to recount the vote accor\u00adding to the rule set forth in sec. 55 of the Dominion Elections Act, 1874, as amended by 41 Vic., ch. 6.\nAgain, where do we find in the act the slightest in\u00addication that the mere fact of non-initialling shall abso\u00adlutely and arbitrarily destroy the vote? On the contrary have we not section 80 of 37 Vic., ch. 9 which, though held in Woodward v. Sarsons ([2]) to apply to the conducting of the election generally, may serve as a guide to the construction which ought to be placed on the act in reference to initialling. The section reads thus:\nNo election shall be declared invalid by reason of a non-com\u00adpliance with the rules contained in this act as to the taking of the poll or the counting of the votes, or by reason of any want of qualification in the person signing a nomination paper received by the returning officer, under the provisions of this act, or of any mistake in the use of the forms contained in the schedules to this act, if it appears to the tribunal having cognizance of the question that the election was conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in this act, and that such non-compliance or mistake did not affect the result of the election.\nIs not this misplacing of the initials merely a non-compliance with the rules contained in the act as to the taking of the poll, or a mistake in the use of the form contained in the schedules of the act? And does it not appear beyond all question or doubt that as regards those uninstalled ballots, notwithstanding this non-compliance or mistake, the election was conducted, so far as initialling is concerned, in accordance with the principle laid down in the act in reference thereto?\nWhat was that principle, but that the deputy return\u00ading officer should have the means'\" of identifying the ballot returned to him by the voter as the ballot fur\u00adnished by him to the voter, and that he should not count any ballot not supplied by him? And is it not' clear that not withstanding his non-compliance or mis\u00adtake he had the means of identification and did identify the ballot by means of his initials, and in fact did not count any ballots not supplied by him ? Has not the taking of the poll and the counting of the ballots been to all intents and purposes practically and substantial\u00adly on the principle laid down in the act? And is it not equally clear that the non-compliance of the deputy returning officer with the strict provisions of the act and the mistake of putting the initials on the counter\u00adfoil instead of the ballot did not in this election in the Host remote degree affect the result of the election? I do not wish, to be understood that under no cir\u00adcumstances will the non-initialling of the ballots destroy the vote; on the contrary, if there are more ballots found in the ballot box than persons on the deputy \"returning officer's list, as polled, or if the returning officer is not enabled to identify them as having been furnished by him, or there is any evidence of fraud or col\u00adlusion, or the irregularity complained of has in any way affected the result of the election, it is right enough that they should not be counted: but the evidence before us shows the very reverse to have been the case.\nKelly, deputy returning officer to district number twenty-three, says:\nThis is the poll book which I kept for this district; it was sent by ballot box by the sheriff. I took the oaths contained in it. I have put down the names, occupation and place of residence. I opened and examined the ballot box on opening poll in the morning. The candidates were all represented by agents. I emptied the box in the presence of agents, then locked the box and kept the key. I counted the ballot box in presence of agents at close of poll. I counted the votes in presence of agents. I put the ballot papers in envelopes (No. 1) Brecken & Davies. This is my writing on the back of envelope (No. 2) ; this is the envelope in which I put the ballots marked for Brecken and Jenkins (No. 3) marked 1 for Davies and Jenkins, 1 for Laird and Jenkins (No. 4.) Three disputed papers not counted, one voter made cross on back of ballot paper and two wrote their names instead of cross (No. 5.) Forty-four votes, forty-three marked for Laird and Davies, one for Davies alone. I counted the number of unused ballots and of rejected; none spoiled. I made up a return, and this is it. I and Poll Clerk swore to it. I gave each candidate a statement similar to this; kept one myself. I put this statement, the poll book and the ballots both used and unused into the box, locked and sealed the box and delivered it in Sheriff's office. I did not initial any of the backs of the ballots. When a voter asked for a ballot I put my initials and a number cor\u00adresponding with the voter's name in the book on the counterfoil. I delivered that ballot to the voter with the counterfoil on it and with my initials and No. on the counterfoil. The voter then took it into the room, and when he brought it out I would take the ballot from him, I would look at my initials and the counterfoil then annexed, to see it was the same ballot I had given to him, and then I tore off the counterfoil in the presence of the voter and then put ballot in box and destroyed the counterfoil. I did same with every ballot and every vote, and I looked when it was right back at every counterfoil to see that initials were there. I never separated the counterfoil until I had looked at my initials. No ballots were put in box except r what I put in. I think it impossible that a ballot could be put in without my knowledge. I totted up the votes and the number of votes in the poll book agreed with the number of ballots found in the box. There was no objection made to the ball pts on the ground that they were not initialed on the back. At the polling place there were three ballots disputed. These are they. I rejected them and they were not counted. I don't think it probable there was any ballot found in the box that I had not supplied.\nAlexander Home\u2014Deputy returning officer for district number 33, at the Engine House, in Charlottetown:\nThis is the poll book kept by me. I was sworn. It contains the name, occupation and residence of the voters. This is my signature to the book. The candidates were represented each by two agents. They were there all day, I examined the ballot box in the morning before poll opened in the present of the agents of all parties, nothing in them, then I locked it and kept the key. I remained in polling place all day. On poll closing I opened and examined box in presence of the agent. I counted the votes and made a return and swore to it. I gave a certificate to each party the same as this produced and I kept a copy. Donald McKinnon was poll clerk. I put all the unused ballots in envelopes and the writing on them is that of my poll clerk. I rejected four ballots, (these are they uninitialled by me). After adding up the ballots, I ascertained that the number found in the box cor\u00adresponded with the number in the book, I then put the poll in the box and sealed the box and gave it to the sheriff. My initials are not on any of the ballots. A voter came in, I wrote his name, occupation and residence. As soon as poll clerk had that down I numbered the ballots on the counterfoil, according to number in the book. I numbered and initialled it on tbe face of the counterfoil. I folded it so that I could see the number and initials without seeing the face of the ballot, and when he returned it I tore that off, but before doing so I satisfied myself that that was the ballot I had given to the voter. I then put the ballot in the box and threw the counterfoil on the floor. I did this in every case. There was no objection made by the agents that day, they could see the ballots put in. I don't think it could be possible that any ballots could get in except what I put in. None could be taken out. If any were put in, it could not agree with the poll book. Peter Burke:\nI was deputy returning officer, district number twenty-seven. My initials are not on the back of the ballots. I initials and numbered them on the counterfoil in every case before I delivered J, them to the voters. When they brought ballots back, I looked at my numbers and initials. I tore off the counterfoil and destroyed it, I satisfied myself in every case that the paper was the one I delivered to voter. I kept the ballot boxes under my own charge. I delivered them to the deputy sheriff. The number of ballots agreed with the number of voters.\nThere is no way in which I can identify the ballots. I swear that no ballots were put into the box but what passed through my hands. I initialled the ballots on the back of counterfoil. I won't be certain which side I initialled them, whether back or face. There was no official mark on the ballot after the counterfoil was taken off. I covered the box with paper and tied it round with tape and sealed it. I also enclosed the key in an envelope addressed to returning officer. No one could drop a ballot into the box, when I gave it up, without removing paper round the box and breaking seal. [Witness shews how he folded the ballot when he delivered it to the voter.] When I recovered it back from the voter, I tore off the counterfoil but did not open it or see inside of it.\nIt is probable that another ballot might not have been inside, I think it could not.\nThe evidence of these witnesses is uncontradicted Their credit stands not only unassailed, but all evi\u00addence of fraud or wilful misconduct, either on the part of the returning officers or the candidates or their agents, is negatived, and any mistake or irregularity is admit\u00adtedly attributable solely to mistake or inadvertence on the part of the election officers.\nNo doubt it is the duty of all officers engaged in the holding of an election to inform themselves fully of the previsions of the statutes under which they are acting and to be most careful strictly to comply with all require\u00adments of the law, but though they do not do so it by no means follows all and every error they may commit or mistakes they may make necessarily invalidate the election and disfranchise the electors, though under circumstances such errors or mistakes may have such effect, but for neglect of duty the statute, by section 108, prescribes a penalty in these words:\u2014\nAny returning officer, deputy returning officer, election cleric or poll clerk, who refuses or neglects to perform any of the obligations or formalities required of him by this act, shall for each such refusal or neglect forfeit the sum of $200 to any person suing for the same.\nUnder section 66 the respondent seeks to have the election invalidated by reason of the returning officers not having properly regulated the districts as to num\u00adbers of voters, not having supplied the deputy return\u00ading officer in certain districts with a sufficient number of ballot papers, and not having in one district provided sufficient accommodation in the polling booths.\nOne cannot help being struck with the peculiarly anomalous, inconsistent and unreasonable position which, through his counsel, the respondent has placed himself in by his contention in this matter.\nHe accepts the return which gives him a majority of votes, takes his seat in Parliament as a duly elected member, and when his right to hold the seat is attacked urges on this court to adjudge that at a legal election, regularly and properly held, he was elected by a majority of the electors, and that the majority being so in his favour he is lawfully entitled to hold the seat he now occupies, but with the same breath he says:\u2014if you cannot find the majority in my favour, then the whole election is irregular, illegal and void, and must be set aside; so that the validity or invalidity according to his contention is made to depend upon his having or not having a majority of votes; in other words he says through his counsel: \"If you find I have a majority of votes it's a right good election and should not be dis\u00adturbed, but if you find Mr. Brecken has the majority it's a dreadfully bad election by reason of divers illegalities and irregularities, and forsooth, in the public interests should not be allowed to stand.\" In the meantime, bad as this respondent contends the election is, great as is the public exigency, when he has not the majority, that it should be set aside, he finds it a good enough election to enable him to take his seat in Parliament and make laws for those unfortunate electors who have by these illegalities, mistakes, or irregularities of the returning officers, been prevented from legally electing their members.\nBut this contention cannot prevail. It shocks common sense. If he wished to attack this election he should have attacked it by petition, depositing his $1,000 as security, when all the candidates at the election would be respondents, as would the returning officer whose conduct is complained of, as provided by section 64, which is as follows:\u2014\nWhenever any election petition complains of the conduct of any returning officer, such returning officer shall, for all the purposes of this act, except the admission, of respondents in his place, be deemed to be a respondent.\nBut he claims the right to do this under sec. 66, but this section does not, in my opinion, give him any such right to attack the election on grounds which, if sustained, must \"make the election void in toto, and this, too, with\u00ad out the candidate whose election is not impeached, and\nwithout the returning officer whose conduct is com\u00adplained of, and whose misdoings it is now contended avoids the election, being made parties.\nAs I read, sec. 66, which is as follows:\u2014\nOn the trial of a petition under this act, complaining of an undue return and claiming the seat for some person, the respondent may give evidence to show that the election of such person was undue, in the same manner as if he had presented a petition complaining of such election\u2014\nit only enables the respondent to show that the election of the person claiming the seat is undue as for corrupt or improper practices by himself.\nEven if this view is incorrect and the respondent could attack the election on the ground of irregularities by the returning officer, the respondent has not, in my opinion, on the facts of the case shown that this was not substantially an election by ballot, or that the con\u00adstituency had not a fair and free opportunity of elect\u00ading the candidate which the majority might prefer, or that there is any reasonable ground for believing that a majority by reason of the alleged irregularities might have been prevented from electing the candidates they preferred, nor that such irregularities affected the result of the election.\nI express no opinion as to the necessity of objections to ballots being raised at the time of the count by the deputy returning officer under sec. 56, which is as follows:\u2014\nThe deputy returning officer shall take a note of any objection made by any candidate, his agent or any elector present, to any ballot paper found in the ballot box, and shall decide any question arising out of the objection; and the decision of such deputy returning officer shall be final, subject only to reversal on petition questioning the election or return.\nThe legislature seems to have been very particular to provide that the candidates or their agents should be present, or in their absence that the electors should be represented, and the provision seems to contem\u00adplate that matters in reference to the ballots should be then finally settled. Whether any such objection after\u00adwards made is not too late, is a question, in the view I take, there is no necessity for investigating or settling; should the point hereafter arise in a case 'to render its determination necessary, it will, in my opinion, be worthy of serious consideration.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs in this court, and in the court below, and a certificate will be issued in accordance with the provisions of the statute that Frederick de St. Croix Brecken has been duly elected a member of the House of Commons for the electoral dis- trict of Queen's county, in the province of Prince Ed\u00adward Island.\nSTRONG, J:\u2014\nBy the section which the amending act of 1878 substitutes for the 55th section of the original act of 1874, the ballots which the deputy returning officer is to reject are distinctly specified, and it is enacted that, \" he shall reject all ballots which have not been sup\u00adplied by himself.\"\nThe question arising on the scrutiny, as to the admissibility of the ballots which the deputy returning officers omitted to mark with their initials pursuant to the requirements of the substituted sections 43 and 45, must, it seems to me, depend entirely on the construc\u00adtion to be given to this provision of section 55.\nIt is to be observed that the words of the statute are, not that ballot papers not marked with the officer's initials are to be rejected, but only those which appear not to have been supplied by him.\nIn the present case it has been established to the satisfaction of the judge who tried the petition\u2014and the evidence was ample to justify his finding\u2014that the uninitialled ballot papers had all been supplied by the deputy returning officers. The very words of the statute have thus been complied with.\nIt seems plain, therefore, that we cannot now reject the uninitialled papers which have been counted by the officers who supplied them, merely because one of the directory provisions of the act has not been followed, and thus disfranchise a large body of electors in con\u00adsequence of omissions arising from the mistakes of the officers.\nPrinciple and authority both require that we should hold the requirements of initialling to be merely direct\u00adory and not mandatory, and that in cases like the present, where the officers are able to establish beyond a doubt that no ballots have been deposited which were not furnished, by them, the election court, on a scrutiny, must hold they would not have been justified in rejecting ballots not initialled.\nThe act must be regarded as only requiring that it should appear to the satisfaction of the deputy return\u00ading officer that no ballots other than those supplied by him had been used by voters, and the initialling must be taken to have been a device to secure that end, and not to exclude the officers from identifying the ballots in another way, as they have done in the present case. This was the determination of Vice-Chancellor Blake in the Monk case, where that learned judge determined this identical point ([3]); and I think that decision affords us a sound and safe precedent to be followed in the present appeal. Then the 80th section, although I am of opinion it has no direct application to the question of rejecting or admitting votes on a scrutiny, but applies only to the case of an election impeached as being altogether void for irregularity, yet indirectly con\u00adfirms the construction which I place on section 55, as showing that the provision requiring initialling is not absolute but directory only.\nAs regards the avoidance of the election for irregu\u00adlarities, either as respects the omissions to initial the ballots or on the other grounds urged, no case raising such a complaint is before us on which we can pro\u00adnounce a judgment.\nThe petition was filed by Mr. Brecken claiming the seat as having a majority of the legal votes. If the appellant desired to raise this question as to the validity of the election he should have presented a petition himself praying its avoidance, but this he has not done. The 66th section of the act of 1874 manifestly does not enable him to impugn the election as wholly void and irregular, without a petition; it merely enables a res\u00adpondent to a petition, by which the seat is claimed, to recriminate, by shewing that even if the petitioner should prove that he has a majority, he is, by reason of the illegal conduct of himself or his agents, disen\u00adtitled to have the seat awarded to him\nI think the appeal must be dismissed with costs, and a certificate granted that Mr, Brecken is entitled to the seat.\nFOURNIER, J.:\nLe r\u00e9sultat du scrutin devant cette cour, comme devant l'honorable juge Peters en premi\u00e8re instance, a donn\u00e9 une majorit\u00e9 en faveur de l'Intim\u00e9.\nL'Appelant, qui n'a pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de produire une r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la p\u00e9tition, a cependant donn\u00e9 avis, en vertu de la section 66 de l'Acte des \u00e9lections contest\u00e9es, qu'il demanderait la nullit\u00e9 de l'\u00e9lection pour deux raisons:\n1. Parce que dans trois bureaux de votation les voteurs n'ont pu voter en cons\u00e9quence de l'insuffisance du nombre de bulletins dont le d\u00e9put\u00e9 officier-rap\u00adporteur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pourvu ; et que dans un autre, le no. 36, il n'y avait pas l'espace suffisant pour permettre aux voteurs d'arriver au bureau de votation, et qu'il y avait plus de deux cents voteurs dans cette division.\n2. Parce que dans trois bureaux de votation les bulle\u00adtins ne portaient pas les initiales des d\u00e9put\u00e9s officiers-rapporteurs. Ces d\u00e9put\u00e9s officiers-rapporteurs ayant, par erreur, mis leurs initiales et le no. du votant sur le talon du bulletin, il s'est trouv\u00e9 environ 675 bulletins ne portant pas d'initiales. Dans le d\u00e9compte fait par le juge de comt\u00e9, tous les bulletins ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9s et l'Appelant s'est trouv\u00e9 avoir une majorit\u00e9 de quinze votes. Un rapport a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait en sa faveur et il a pris possession de son si\u00e8ge. L'Intim\u00e9 ayant produit une p\u00e9tition contre le retour de l'Appelant, l'honorable juge Peters appel\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 cette contestation a admis la validit\u00e9 des bulletins retranch\u00e9s. Cette d\u00e9cision a eu l'effet de rendre la majorit\u00e9 \u00e0 l'Intim\u00e9.\nQuant aux moyens de nullit\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9s dans la premi\u00e8re question, on doit se demander d'abord, si l'Appelant a bien le droit de demander la nullit\u00e9 de l'\u00e9lection en vertu de laquelle il si\u00e8ge actuellement. Peut-il en m\u00eame temps affirmer la validit\u00e9 et la nullit\u00e9 de l'\u00e9lection? Peut-il en loi prendre cette position contradictoire de consid\u00e9rer l'\u00e9lection comme l\u00e9gale pour lui et comme ill\u00e9gale s'il doit faire place \u00e0 son adversaire ? Il ne le peut certainement pas d'apr\u00e8s les nombreuses autorit\u00e9s cit\u00e9es dans le jugement de l'honorable juge Peters. En outre, un examen s\u00e9rieux de la preuve d\u00e9montre la futilit\u00e9 de ces moyens de nullit\u00e9. En r\u00e9alit\u00e9, il est bien prouv\u00e9 que personne n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9 du droit, de voter ni par manque de bulletins, ni par d\u00e9faut d'accommoda\u00adtion dans les bureaux de votation.\nMais, \u00e9tait-il bien n\u00e9cessaire pour l'honorable juge d'entrer dans l'examen de tous ces d\u00e9tails ? L'Appelant n'ayant pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de faire une contestation r\u00e9gu\u00adli\u00e8re de l'\u00e9lection, pouvait-il en se pr\u00e9valant seulement de la section 66 de l'Acte des \u00e9lections contest\u00e9es demander la nullit\u00e9 de l'\u00e9lection? Quel droit lui con\u00adf\u00e8re cette section?\nThe Respondent may give evidence to show that the election of such person (claiming the seat) was undue, in the same manner as if he had presented a petition complaining of such election.\nCette section s'applique aux accusations r\u00e9criminatoires que le membre si\u00e9geant peut faire pour d\u00e9montrer non pas la nullit\u00e9 de l'\u00e9lection d'une mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, mais faire voir que pour des motifs particuliers, corrup\u00adtion ou autres, le rapport (return) de son adversaire serait ill\u00e9gal et demander aussi sa d\u00e9qualification. Ici l'Appelant ne demande pas seulement \u00e0 faire d\u00e9clarer que le rapport de l'Intim\u00e9 serait ill\u00e9gal, mais il demande nullit\u00e9 de l'\u00e9lection ; il se trouve \u00e0 attaquer par son proc\u00e9d\u00e9 non-seulement le droit de l'Intim\u00e9 mais aussi la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 du rapport de M. Davies, membre si\u00e9geant pour la m\u00eame division, sans que ce dernier ait \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en cause. Pour arriver \u00e0 ce r\u00e9sultat il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire de se con\u00adformer \u00e0 toutes les dispositions de l'Acte concernant les \u00e9lections contest\u00e9es. Il fallait faire un d\u00e9p\u00f4t de mille dollars, mettre en cause les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es et donner les diff\u00e9rents avis requis par le statut ainsi qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans la cause de Sommerville et Laflamme ([4]) et Devlin vs. Ilyan ([5]). Rien de tout cela n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait. Toute cette partie de la preuve, qui n'avait pour but que de prouver la nullit\u00e9 de l'\u00e9lection et non \/ pas seulement la nullit\u00e9 du rapport de l'Intim\u00e9, a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7u ill\u00e9galement. En cons\u00e9quence il n'y a pas lieu de d\u00e9cider si les moyens invoqu\u00e9s auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 suffisants pour faire annuler l'\u00e9lection. Cependant comme la preuve en a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite, quoique ill\u00e9galement, je n'h\u00e9site pas \u00e0 dire que je partage enti\u00e8rement l'opinion de l'honorable juge Peters sur son insuffisance.\nQuant \u00e0 la question de l'omission des initiales, elle a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9e dans l'\u00e9lection de Monk par l'honorable ex-vice-chancelier d\u2019Ontario ([6]). Je concours dans les rai\u00adsonnements sur lesquels cette d\u00e9cision est fond\u00e9e Bien que la loi \u00e9lectorale ait \u00e9t\u00e9 amend\u00e9e depuis, elle n'a pas dispens\u00e9, cependant, de la formalit\u00e9 obligeant l'officier-rapporteur \u00e0 mettre ses initiales sur chaque bulletin. Les d\u00e9put\u00e9s officiers-rapporteurs qui ont pr\u00e9sid\u00e9 \"aux poils o\u00f9 cette formalit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 omise ont tous \u00e9t\u00e9 enten\u00addus comme t\u00e9moins. Chacun d'eux a \u00e9tabli de la mani\u00e8re la plus positive que les bulletins trouv\u00e9s dans la bo\u00eete du scrutin \u00e0 la cl\u00f4ture de la votation \u00e9tait identi- quement ceux qu'ils y avaient respectivement d\u00e9pos\u00e9s eux-m\u00eames. Ils ont aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que personne n'a puy introduire sans leur connaissance, d'autres bulletins que ceux qu'ils y ont mis eux-m\u00eames. Aucune circonstance ne tait supposer qu\u2019il y a eu fraude ou intention d'\u00e9luder la loi. Cette omission n'est due qu'\u00e0 une erreur accidentelle. Il est vrai que la loi dit dans la forme imp\u00e9rative :\nThe voter shall receive from the Deputy Returning Officer a ballot paper, on the back of which such Deputy Returning Officer shall have previously put his initials.\nLe devoir de l'officier-rapporteur est clair; mais l'omission de sa part de se conformer \u00e0 la disposition de la loi emporte-t-elle nullit\u00e9 du vote? Si telle \u00e9tait l'intention de la loi, ce serait laisser le sort de la plupart des \u00e9lecteurs \u00e0 la merci de l'imp\u00e9nitie, de la n\u00e9gligence, ou m\u00eame de la mauvaise foi des d\u00e9put\u00e9es officier-rapporteurs. La loi n'ayant pas prononc\u00e9 la nullit\u00e9 on ne doit pas conclure qu'elle r\u00e9sulte de la forme du langage adopt\u00e9. Les dispositions de cette nature adress\u00e9es aux officiers publics sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme directoires (directory) d'apr\u00e8s l'autorit\u00e9 de Maxwell:\nWhen the provisions of a statute relate to the performance of a public duty they seem to be generally understood to be merely instructions for the guidance and government of those on whom the duty is imposed or directory only. The neglect of them may be punishable indeed, but it does not affect the validity of the act done in disregard of them * * * It is no impediment to this con\u00adstruction that there is no remedy for non-compliance with the direction ([7]).\nD'ailleurs la loi \u00e9lectorale, section 80, contient au sujet des irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s qui ne peuvent manquer d'avoir lieu en mati\u00e8re d'\u00e9lections, une disposition formelle qui doit nous guider dans l'appr\u00e9ciation des effets de ces irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s.\nNo \u00e9lection shall be declared invalid by reason of a non-com pliance with the rules contained in this Act as to the taking of the poll or the counting of the votes\/or by reason of any want of qualification in the persons signing a nomination paper received by the Returning Officer, under the provisions of this Act, or of any mistake in the use of forms contained in the schedules to this Act, if it appears to the tribunal having cognizance of the question that the \u00e9lection was conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in this Act, and that such non-compliance or mistake did not affect the result of the \u00e9lection.\nIl est \u00e9vident d'apr\u00e8s la preuve en cette cause que l'\u00e9lection dont il s'agit a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite conform\u00e9ment aux principes contenus dans l'Acte des \u00e9lections et que les irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s constat\u00e9es n'ont pas affect\u00e9 le r\u00e9sultat. En faisant application de cette section on doit donc d\u00e9clarer que l'\u00e9lection a \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e9galement faite.\nEn lisant la section 10 de l'acte amend\u00e9 de 1878, la question ne fait plus difficult\u00e9. La section 55 de l'acte de 1874 qu'elle amende dit quels sont les votes que l'officier-rapporteur doit rejeter lors du d\u00e9pouillement du scrutin.\nIn doing so he shall reject ail ballot papers which have not been supplied by the Deputy Returning Officer, ail those by which votes have been given for more, candidates than are to be elected, and ail those upon which there is any writing or mark, by which the voter can be identified.\nNous avons la preuve ici que les bulletins sont ceux fournis par les d\u00e9put\u00e9s officiers-rapporteurs ; et tous ceux qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 admis par le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance ne comportent aucune des causes de nullit\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9es dans cette clause, si ce n'est ceux, dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 dispos\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la seconde partie de cette clause concernant les bulletins qui ne doivent pas \u00eatre compt\u00e9s.\nPour ces raisons et pour celles d\u00e9velopp\u00e9es dans le jugement si complet de l'honorable juge Peters, je suis d'avis que l'Intim\u00e9 doit \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9 l\u00e9galement \u00e9lu au lieu et place de l'Appelant. Le tout avec d\u00e9pens. Henry, J. :\u2014\nThe decision of the question of the validity of the ballots given at three of the polls, in the electoral district in question, having for its effect the seating of the respondent or of the appellant, it becomes very impor\u00adtant to see whether the statute authorizes the rejection of th\u00e8se ballots, and to do so we have to look to the different clauses of the statute The 43rd section of the act 37 Vic, ch. 9 provides that electors \"shall receive from the deputy returning officer a ballot paper on which such deputy returning officer shall have previously put his initiais\" In the first place I may say that that portion of the provision of the law has not been complied with. The returning officer, therefore, handed to each elector a paper not authorized by law. The question, therefore, is of very great importance to decide whether the returning officer can pay disrespect to the law and put in a paper which is not in strict compliance with its provisions. If we say he can in that respect, why not in another, and the resuit would be the virtually giving to the deputy returning officer the power to do what he pleased Was i\u00ee then the inten\u00adtion of the legislature to place such a power in the hands of the deputy returning officers? The legisla\u00adture, as I take it, must have had some object in making that provision, and must have had some good reason, some valid reason, for doing so. Now, in looking for the reason, we must first ascertain what the law is in regard to the Dominion elections. As I have already stated, the deputy returning officer must provide a ballot paper on which he shall have previously put his initiais. He is but a ministerial officer and has been given no discretion\u2014as to the placing of his initiais on the ballot paper\u2014to carry out or to violate the act at his pleasure, and by the judgment now appealed from it is shown he did not initial the ballot papers in question, there is therefore nothing but his testimony to show the identity and validity of the ballot papers. Was it the intention of the legislature that this should be?\nIf we turn to section 55 as amended it will be found that after the close of the polls it is the duty of the deputy returning officer when he counts the ballots to \"reject all ballot papers which have not been supplied by the deputy returning officer.\" But what has he got to guide him in his decision? He finds no mark on the ballot papers to identify them. Has not the legislature, in order to prevent ballot papers being tampered with, directed that those which have not been supplied by the return\u00ading officers shall be rejected? And here the deputy returning officer could not identify them after once passing from his sight. If a recount takes place, under 41 Vic, ch. 6, section 14, sub-section 4, the county judge is called up to make a recount, he has simply to do so, and when he finds ballot papers not initialled, how can he say they are those supplied by the deputy returning officer? He is bound to reject all ballots not supplied by the deputy returning officer, and I think, with the law before him, would be justified in rejecting all uninitialled ballots. He, too, is but a ministerial officer, and not entitled to take evidence. The only one who could testify at ail would be the deputy returning officer, but how could he, days or weeks after parting with the possession of th\u00ebm, identify the ballots without any private mark to distinguish them? Besides, did the legislature intend to leave the whole question of the regularity of the vot\u00e9s to d\u00e9pend upon the statements to be made by the deputy returning officer? I confess that I find it difficult to come to any such con\u00adclusion. I have also some difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that the non-compliance with mere formalities should avoid an election; but then, on the other hand, it is seen that the security provided in this respect by the legislature is not found. \"We have section 80, which declares that mistakes of form only are not fatal.\n[The learned judge then read the section.]\nI think, however, that in the present case there is more than a mistake as to form. Besides the reference to rules in this section only applies to the rules in the act of 1874. When I look at th\u00e8se rules there is not one of them that refers to this question. Then as to mistake of forms, there is no mistake in the forms complained of here.\nI am reasoning it out to show there is a difficulty in coming to a conclusion either one way or the other. The petitioner in this case has received a clear majorlty of votes, and unless the act has made it very clear that this majority is illegal, I would be reluctant to so de\u00adclare. It is not in. the province of the court to unseat a member for m\u00e8re irregularities in carrying out the provisions of the law, which do not affect the result, un\u00adless the Court can declare that the provisions are mandatory, and that the error on the part of the deputy returning officer shall, therefore, have the effect of avoiding an election.\nThe consequences of the decision of this court will be very serious, if it were not in the power of the legis\u00adlature to clear up the doubt by further legislation, as no returning officer will hereafter be required to initial any of the ballot papers. \"With section 80 still in force, I shall not interpose any decision of mine to affect the judgment of the majority of this court, but shall con\u00adtent myself by expressing my doubts as to the correctness of it.\nAs to the other point, I think it was the duty of the sitting member, if he did not wish to allow the respon- dent to take the seat, to resign his own seat, and file a petition setting forth grounds to avoid the whole election. Then parties interested would have been heard, which has not been the case h\u00e8re, They are not here, and this court cannot take upon itself to d\u00e9cide upon the rights of parties who have not been brought before it.\nI concur, therefore, with my brother judges, in giving the seat to the respondent, expressing doubts as I have before stated, as to the powers of the deputy returning officers.\nI hope the matter will be settled by the legislature, in order that these occurrences may not take place again, and that the legislature will determine whether or not the legality of the ballot papers should be left entirely to depend upon the option of the deputy returning officers.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\u2014\nI am of opinion that, upon the scrutiny, the ballots not initialled should not be counted, and that the judgment of the court below, on this point, should consequently be reversed. The l\u00e9gislative power, with the view of providing for fair and free elections, has ordered and decreed that they should be held according to certain rules laid down in the act on the subject.\nWhat right has the judicial power to say that these rules are not to be followed? Parliament has devised certain means by which its elections are to be regulated, and the votes of the electors are to be given and admitted. Have we the right to say that other means, in our judgment, are equally good for the same purpose, and can be legally substituted for those decreed and adopted by parliament? The court below says \"yes,\" and rules that in virtue of section 80 of the act of 1874 it has that power. But this is a grievous error, a pal- pable misapplication and a gross misinterpretation of this section of the statute. By its very terms this section has no application whatever to a scrutiny of the votes; but has reference purely and simply to the avoidance of the whole election. Then the section would virtually be a repeal of the most important provisions of the act, if the construction put upon it by the court below was to prevail.\nSection 27, as amended by 41 Vic, ch. 6, of the act, for instance, orders that the ballot shall be a printed paper. But this is not necessary, says the court below, a written paper is just as good. The names of the candidates, for another instance, are ordered to appear on the ballot paper alphabetically arranged But this is a m\u00e8re matter of form according to the court below, and, if it is not proved that any elector has been deceived by this formality not having been followed, how the names of the candidates appear on the ballots is of no importance whatever. The voter, says the act, shall make a cross within the division containing the name of the candidates for whom he intends to vote. But these are mere formalities\u2014simple directions, entirely optional, says the court below. And so on. If the judgment appealed from was to stand, not one of the rules laid down in the statute is to be held as imperatively ordered. Yet the language of this enactment itself leads to no ambiguity. \"It shall be done,\" says the law-giver. But, says the court below, \"It need not be done.\" The Interpretation act vainly decrees that the word \"shall\" is to be construed as imperative: the court below decrees that it is not imperative.\nAnd upon what ground does the respondent ask us to support this judgment? Virtually none, except that to reject all non-initialled ballots would, as he contends, be virtually to leave it in the power of a deputy returning officer to control the election. But it is Mr. Justice Peters' decision that leaves the result of the election entirely depending on the arbitrary and illegally arrived at conclusion the deputy returning officer has come to at the counting of the votes, or on his evidence before the courts when the return is questioned.\nThen are courts of justice now to presume that a sworn public officer will not do his duty? Is it not the contrary that must always be presumed? It is also obvious that the deputy returning officer, if unscrupulously disposed to do so, must necessarily have it in his power, without his being obliged to resort to these means of not putting his initials on the ballot papers, to more or less control the election. And, moreover, it is clear that under the Imperial statute, from which was taken 35-36 Vic, ch. 33, sec. 2, the omission by the returning officer to stamp the ballot with the official mark avoids the vote. The Imperial parliament, then, did not think that to leave such a power to the returning officer was objectionable. The initials of the deputy returning officer are substituted, with us, for the official mark of the Imperial Act; why their absence from the ballot should not, with us, avoid the vote, as the absence of the official mark in England avoids it, I cannot understand.\nTrue, it is; that the Imperial statute, in express words, says that, in such a case, the vote is void. But a special enactment of that kind in our act would, it seems to me, have been superfluous, since the act decrees that the ballot paper to be given to the voter must be one on the back of which the deputy returning officer shall have previously put his initials. But, says the respondent, section 55 of the act (as amended) enacts that the deputy returning officer shall reject only the ballots which have not been supplied by him, so that if he is otherwise satisfied that the ballot is one he supplied, he must count it, even if not initialled by him. But this is not so: the respondent reads this section 55 without reference to the other parts of the act. It is quite clear, as said Lord Ormidale, in the, Wigtown case ([8]), that the statute does not contemplate that there should be an investigation by the deputy returning officer, when counting the votes at the close of the poll. He has to count only the ballots that he has supplied. But how is he to ascertain whether such and such a ballot has been supplied by him? Only, and clearly so, it seems to me, by his initials on the back of such ballot, If his initials are not there, he is to treat the ballot as not supplied by him. Section 45 of the act, as amended makes this clear. The voter \"shall fill up such ballot paper so that the initials on the back can be seen without opening it, and hand it to the deputy returning officer, who shall, without unfolding it, ascertain by examining his initials and the number upon the counterfoil, that it is the same that he furn\u00adished to the elector.\" Here, it is plain, there is a special order, an imperative order, to this officer not to receive the ballot paper, except after having ascertained that it bears his initials. Yet, says the court below, it is not necessary that this ballot paper should be so initialled.\nAccording to the statute, the deputy returning officer is prohibited from receiving as a vote, any ballot not initialled, If one is offered to him, he is obliged to refuse it\u2014if he admits it, he disobeys the law, and there is no legal vote received. The ballot not initialled is not the ballot which, according to the principles of the act, can be counted as a vote. It is a nullity\u2014a blank paper.\nSection 55, it is argued, does not authorize the deputy returning officer to reject ballots not initialled by him. This contention is, it seems to me, opposed to the very language of that section. It enacts, in express words, that the deputy returning officer shall reject all ballot papers which have not been supplied by him.\nNow, section 43 orders him not to supply the voters with any but initialled ballots. And section 45 com\u00admands him, when the voter returns the ballot to him, to ascertain first that it is initialled, and then, and then only, to put the ballot in the box. Now, when in section 55 the legislature orders him to reject all ballots not sup\u00adplied by him, does this not mean that all not initialled ballots are to be rejected, and that the initialled ones only are to be counted? The statute can mean nothing else, since, in the box, under the statute itself, the initialled ballots only are those that the deputy returning officer can have supplied. All those that are not initialled he has not supplied under the terms of the act. There can be, under the act, no ballot in that box not supplied by him other than those not initialled by him. In other words, the statute contemplates that all the ballots in the box that have been supplied by the deputy returning officer shall bear his initials. And so, when it orders the deputy returning officer to reject\" all ballots not supplied by him, it orders him expressly to reject all ballots not initialled by him.\nThen, on a. re-count, the judge has also to reject all ballots which have not been supplied by the deputy returning officer (41 Vic, ch. 6, sec. 11, sub-sec. 4.) Now, how can he ascertain which have been and which have not been so supplied, otherwise than by the initials on the back? The deputy returning officer is not before him, and he does not receive any evidence. Is he not obliged, then, to reject all non-initialled ballots? Is he not bound to treat all non-initialled ballots as not hav\u00ading been supplied by the deputy returning officer?\nThe case of Woodward v. Sarsons ([9]), relied on by the respondent, is, as I read the report, entirely adverse to his contentions. The respondent cannot rely upon that part of the remarks of Lord Coleridge upon' the question of the avoidance of an election. We are here on the question of scrutiny simply. Then Lord Coleridge bases his judgment mainly on the ground that the Imperial Act, as to the rules under consideration in that case, was purely directory. I have already said that the rule as to the initialling of the ballots, in our act, is imperative. Many of the rules, which in the Imperial Act are contained in the schedules to the act and in a directory form, are with us inserted in the body of the statute, in the imperative form. For instance, how the ballot shall be marked, in the Imperial Act, is, as re\u00admarked by Lord Coleridge, in the directory part of the act. With us it is in the body of the act, in imperative terms. Now Lord Coleridge lays down the rule that \"an absolute enactment must be obeyed or fulfilled exactly, but it is sufficient if a directory enactment be obeyed or fulfilled substantially.\" To illustrate the principle he so lays down in relation to this act, Lord Coleridge adds that as the second section of the Imperial Act enacts that' the voter having secretly marked his vote on the paper,\" there is, in the act, an absolute enactment that the voter shall mark his paper secretly so that this enactment as to secrecy must be obeyed exactly. Now, how can the respondent invoke that case in his favor? Is it not clear that Lord Coleridge's decision is directly in the sense that what the statute has ordered must be followed exactly, whilst what the statute has merely directed is sufficiently obeyed, if obeyed substantially?\nIs it not imperatively ordered, in our statute, that the ballot shall be initialled by the deputy returning officer. And, I may add, sec. 80 of our act forms also part of the Imperial Act, and in fact has been taken from it. Yet, Lord Coleridge did not seem to think, as the court appealed from here seems to have done, that this enact\u00adment left to the courts the arbitrary power to declare the act not applicable to all elections. But says the respondent, it would be very hard to deprive a voter of his vote for the neglect of a public officer. To this, I will quote Lord Ormidale's answer to a similar objec\u00adtion in the Wigton case. \"No doubt,\" he says, \" this is a hardship upon the voter in one sense, but in the ' directions as to voting' which was put up in con\u00adspicuous places at the polling booths, reference is made to the official mark, and the voter has a particular duty to perform in reference to it; that is to say, he must fold up the ballot paper so as to show the official mark on the back. Therefore his attention is directed to that matter, and it is his own fault if he does not see that the mark is on his voting paper.\"\nThis language is entirely applicable here. With us the deputy returning officer, not the voter as in Eng\u00adland, puts the ballot in the box. See Pickering v.James ([10]); but here, as in England, the directions for the guidance of the electors are posted up in the poll, sec. 28, Act of 18*79. And these directions tell the voter that the initials of the deputy returning officer must\nbe on the back of the ballot, as they in England inform him that the official mark must be on it. The difference between the Imperial statute and ours being that, in the Imperial statute, this enactment, as to the voter being obliged to see that the ballot paper is duly marked or initialled is in what Lord Coleridge calls the directory part of the statute, whilst, with us, the similar enactment is, in imperative terms, in the body of the act itself.\nI may remark that besides the deputy returning officer, whose duty it is to initial the ballots, besides, the voter who has a right to ask a legal ballot, and consequently to insist that one duly initialled be given to him, there are in the polls the candidates or their agents, who also have a right to insist that the for\u00admalities required be fulfilled, and, if need be, to call the deputy returning officer's attention to the necessity of his initials being on the back of the ballot paper. This demonstrates that, after all, the deputy returning officer, who would be disposed to wilfully neglect to initial the ballot papers, would not find it so very easy to do so.\nI am of opinion to allow this appeal. Upon the scrutiny the non-initialled ballots being rejected, this would give Jenkins a majority of two votes. I would there for dismiss the petition complaining of his election and return.\nUpon the other part of the case, I would find it diffi\u00adcult to say that Jenkins who has been duly elected was obliged to fyle a petition. How could he when elected, complain of the return? How could he be expected to attack the very return which declares him elected, before that return was at all questioned? How could he be expected to take the anomalous position of a member of Parliament asking a Court of Justice to annul the election under which he is such member, before his said election was at all impugned? Courts of justice are to redress wrongs, but Jenkins had no wrong to complain of, to ask redress from, when the returning officer returned him as the member duly elected For my part, I have never heard yet of the case of a member depositing $1,000 and fyling a petition for the purpose of complaining of his own return. Jenkins\u2019 position here seems warranted by sections 7 and 66 of the statute ([11]). GWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nIt is not, in my opinion, open to the sitting member to raise under the 66 sec. of the Dominion Controverted Elections Act, the objection having relation to the ballot papers having run short at some of the polling places, in\u00adsufficiency of accommodation, &c. Objections of that kind, if they should prevail at all, should prevail wholly independently of a scrutiny. If the defect in the supply of ballot papers was so small as to leave no doubt that the vast majority of the electors had' exercised their franchise, the objection should not, I think, be open as between two of several candidates, the votes given for whom were so even that the want of two or three ballot papers might have turned the scale in favor of the one over the other, and that therefore as to them the election should be avoid\u00aded while it remained unaffected as to the other candidates elected. I think that the want of a sufficient supply of ballot papers in order to constitute a good ground for avoiding an election, should be such a defect in the supply as to justify the avoiding it altogether, and that therefore the objection is one which should be raised upon a petition expressly relying upon it, and to which all the candidates elected should be made respondents.\nUpon the point as to the allowance or rejection of the uninitialled ballots, I cannot so construe the act as to give to an act passed for the purpose of securing to the electors perfect freedom from all influence in the exer\u00adcise of their elective franchise, the effect of disfranchis\u00ading 675 electors, not for any default of theirs, but for a mistake of the deputy returning officers in the use of a form prescribed by the act, which mistake, as appears by the evidence, did not occur with any fraudulent intent, but arose from a mere misapprehension (bon\u00e2 fide entertained) as to the manner in which they should perform the act which the statute directed them to per\u00adform, and had not the effect of, in any manner, interfer- ing with that secrecy which constitutes the essential principle of vote by ballot, and which cast no doubt upon the authentic city of the ballots when put by the officer into the ballot box, and when there was no sug\u00adgestion or shadow of suspicion that it had been tam\u00adpered with.\nThe act does not, in express terms, require me to give it a construction which would have the effect of avoid\u00ading all those uninitialled ballot papers, and in the ab\u00adsence of all suspicion of any fraud having been com\u00admitted or attempted, and, indeed, in the particular case, of any suggestion of the possibility of any fraud having been committed, I do not think I am justified in putting on the statute such a construction by implication. The statute, no doubt, directs the deputy returning officer to put his initials upon the back of the ballot paper\u2014for what purpose this is directed to be done the statute does not say. It does not in terms declare that the effect of the deputy returning officer neglecting to put his initials as directed, shall cause the vote of the innocent elector to be rejected. If the statute had intended such to be the result, in the absence of all fraud or suspicion of fraud having been attempted or contemplated, it would have, as I think, and should have, said so in express terms, and not having said so, I cannot think that we should supply the omission by implica\u00adtion The 55th section of the dominion statute of 1874, as amended by 41st Vic, ch. 6, although apparently taken from the Imperial act 35th and 36th Vic, ch. 33, makes a provision as to the counting and rejection of ballots markedly different, as it appears to me, and as I must hold intentionally so, from the English act. By the 2nd sec. of the latter it is enacted that each ballot paper shall have a number printed on the back, and shall have attached a counterfoil with the same number printed on the face. At the time of vot- ing the ballot paper shall be marked on both sides with an official mark and delivered to the voter within the polling station, and the number of such voter on the reg\u00adister of voters shall be marked on the counterfoil and the voter having secretly marked his vote on the paper and folded it up so as to conceal his vote shall place it in a closed box in the presence of the officer presiding at the polling station, after having shewn to him the official mark at the back, and any ballot which has not on its back the official mark, or on which votes are given to more candidates than the voter is entitled to vote for, or on which anything except the said number on the back is written or marked by which the voter can be identified, shall be void and not counted.\nNow, although by the 43rd section of the Dominion statute the deputy returning officer is directed to give to each voter coming up to vote a ballot paper with his initials on the back of it, so placed that when the ballot is folded they can be seen without opening it, yet by the 45th section it is the deputy returning officer who, upon being satisfied that the ballot paper brought up by the voter after having inserted his vote in it is the one which he had supplied to the voter, puts it into the ballot box in the presence of the elector and not as in the English act the elector in the presence of the officer, and when we look to the 55th section which regulates the counting and rejection of ballots when the ballot box shall be opened by the deputy \"returning officer in the presence of the poll clerk, the candidates or their agents, and of at least three electors, we find the direction to the deputy returning officer in count\u00ading not to be, as in the English act, to reject all ballot papers not having on their back the initials of the deputy returning officer, but to reject all ballot papers which have not been supplied by the deputy returning officer, ail those by which votes have been given for more candidates than are to be elected, and all those upon which there is any writing or mark by which the voter can be identified. All others are to be counted, for the section proceeds to provide that: \"All others being counted, and a list kept of the number given to each shall be put into separate envelopes, &c, &c.\" Now, what the deputy returning officers in the case before us did was this: they placed their initials upon the counterfoil in the honest belief that in so doing they were complying with the statute, and they gave the ballot papers with the counterfoils attached so initialled to the voters. Upon receiving them back from the voters so folded that they could see their initials without opening the ballots, they themselves detached the counterfoils from the ballot paper, both of which up to that time were one paper, and thus, being satisfied beyond doubt that the ballot papers brought back to them were those they had respectively them\u00adselves supplied to the voter, they put the ballot papers containing the votes into the ballot boxes, and upon opening them at the close of the polls in the pre\u00adsence of the candidates, their agents, and at least three electors, finding the number of votes in the respective boxes to correspond precisely with the number of ballot papers by them respectively supplied to the voters, they without any objection whatever being made, counted the uninitialled ballots (unless avoided for some other reason), as good votes, being perfectly satisfied, as they swear they were then and still are, that the ballot papers which they had respectively so put into the boxes were the identical ballot papers which they had respectively supplied to the voters. The deputy returning officers were therefore under these circumstances justified by the literal terms of the statute in counting those ballots, notwithstanding that they had made a mistake as to the place where their initials should hare been placed. The power of the county judge upon recounting is prescribed by section 14 of 41st Vic, ch. 6, and he is ordered to recount according to the rule above given in section 55 of the Act of 1874, as amended by 41 Vic. ch. 6, as governing the deputy returning officers upon their counting. So that the county judge cannot reject any ballot papers which had been supplied by the deputy returning officers. The directions to him are not to reject all ballot papers not having the initials of the deputy returning officers on the back. Now without evidence, as to his taking which no provision is made, that the ballot papers not initialled were not supplied by the deputy returning officers, I cannot see how he could be justified in rejecting ballots which the deputy returning officers, being well satisfied they had supplied, had counted, unless there should be some appearance of fraud, as for example the number of bal\u00adlots in a box exceeding the number appearing by the poll book to have been supplied by the officer, or the like. Upon the evidence given before the learned Chief Justice upon the petition in this case, and in the absence of all suggestion or suspicion of fraud, or that any thing occurred which had interfered with the elec\u00adtion being conducted according to the principles of the act, that is, as I understand it, being conducted with that perfect secrecy which constitutes the principle of vote by ballot, I think the learned Chief Justice was right in counting those uninitialled ballots, and that therefore his judgment should be affirmed and the result reported to the House of Commons.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: McLean & Martin.\nSolicitor for respondent: F.

By petition of right the suppliant alleged that the railway was negligently and unskillfully conducted, managed and maintained by Her Majesty; that Her Majesty,, disregarding her duty in that behalf and her promise, did not carry safely and securely suppliant on said railway, and that he was greatly and permanently injured in body and health, and claimed $50,000. The Attorney General pleaded that Her Majesty was not bound to carry safely and securely, and was not answerable by petition of right for the negligence of her servants.\nThe learned judge at the trial found that the road was in a most unsafe state from the rottenness of the ties, and that the safety of life had been recklessly jeopardized by running trains over it with passengers, and that there had been a breach of a contract to carry the suppliant safely and secure]y, and awarded $36,000.\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada:\u2014Held\u2014(Fournier and Henry, JJ., dissenting.) That the establishment of government railways in Canada, of which the Minister of Railways and Canals has the management, direction and control, under statutory provisions, for the benefit and advantage of the public, is a branch of the public police created by statute for purposes of public convenience, and not entered upon or to be treated as a private and mercantile speculation, and that a petition of right does not lie against the Crown for injuries resulting from the non-feasance or misfeasance, wrongs, negligence, or omissions of duty of the subordinate officers or agents employed in the public service on said railways.\nThat the Grown is not liable as a common carrier for the safety and security of passengers using said railways.\nAppeal from the Exchequer Court of Canada.\nThe petition of right, the pleadings and the facts are set out at length in the judgment of Henry, J., in the Exchequer Court and in the judgments delivered in the Supreme Court.\nThe suppliant was represented in the Exchequer Court by Mr. Lewis Dames, Q.C., Mr. Malcolm McLeod, Q.C., and Mr. Frederick Peters; and the respondent by Mr. Edward J. Hodgson, Q.C., and Mr. Waller Morton,\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court the appellant was represented by Mr. Lash, Q C, and Mr. Edward J. Hodgson, Q.C.; and the respondent by Mr. Lewis Davies, Q.C, and Mr. A. F. McIntyre. The arguments of counsel and authorities relied on, are reviewed in the judgments.\nThe following is the judgment of Henry, J.:\n\"This is an action brought by the plaintiff by petition of right, to recover damages for injuries sustained by him, when a passenger in a railway car, on the railway in Prince Edward Island, owned by the Dominion of Canada and operated under the management of the Minister of Railways and Canals. The suppliant, in his petition, alleges that the railway in question was in the year 1880 run, worked and managed as a public Work of the Dominion of Canada, and carried, for hire and reward, such passengers as presented themselves and such freight as was offered to be carried from station to station, on said railway.\n\"He therein further alleges that during that year he presented himself as a passenger on said railway from Charlottetown to Souris, and became and was received as a passenger between the two said stations on said railway for reward, Her Majesty promising in consideration of his becoming such passenger, for such reward, to safely and securely carry him upon the said railway, upon the said journey between the stations aforesaid; that all conditions were performed by the suppliant and all things happened to entitle him to be carried safely and securely by Her Majesty upon the said railway on the said journey, but that Her Majesty, disregarding her duty in that behalf and her said promise, did not safely and securely carry the suppliant on the said railway upon the said journey, but so negligently and unskillfully conducted, managed and maintained the said railway, and the train upon which the suppliant was a passenger as aforesaid on said journey, that, in the course of the said journey, the suppliant was greatly and permanently injured in body and health, and has become seriously incapacitated in his ability to earn a livelihood and has incurred great loss of time and expense in and about the cure of his wounds and injuries, and has suffered great pain of body in consequence of his injuries.\n\"The suppliant claimed $35,000 as damages, but on an application made to me on affidavit at the trial I granted a rule to extend the same to $50,000.\n\"The Attorney General of the Dominion fyled and served an answer to the suppliant's petition in which he admits that the railway in question was and is the property of Her Majesty, but says that the same was during the whole of the year 1880 under the control and management of the Minister of Railways and Canals of Canada, under the provisions of the statutes in that behalf.\n\"In the third clause of his answer he says: 'He has no knowledge of the alleged contract or of the facts and circumstances set out in the third paragraph of the suppliant's petition, and, therefore, on the part of Her Majesty, denies the same.'\n\"In the fourth paragraph of his answer he submits that the suppliant cannot enforce his alleged claim against Her Majesty by petition of right, and that the petition of th\u00e8 suppliant should be dismissed, and alleges as reasons:\n\"1st. That the control and management of the railway being vested by statute in the Minister of Railways and Canals, Her Majesty cannot be made liable upon petition of right because the same was negligently and unskilfully conducted, managed and maintained, as alleged; and,\n\"2nd. That even assuming the railway to be under the management and control of Her Majesty, no negligence can be imputed to her, and Her Majesty is not answerable by petition of right for the negligence of her servants.\n\"The suppliant was represented by th\u00e8 Hon. Lewis Davies, Q.C., Malcolm McLeod, Q.C., and Frederick Peters, Esq.; the defendant by Edward J. Hodgson, Q C., and Vi alter Morson, Esq. The action was tried before me at Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, in July last, and occupied several days.\n\"The suppliant proves that he was a first-class passenger on the train which left Charlottetown for Souris on the 25th August, 1880, had paid his fare at the station at the former place, and had a first-class ticket; that he was in a first-class car, in which he travelled until the train reached a place called Robinson's curve, near York station, when it left the track. The railway carriages were upset over a bank, and the suppliant and several other passengers severely injured.\n\"The train, on the occasion in question, consisted of an engine and tender, two flat cars loaded with coal, attached to the tender, and having on the top of the coal a large iron smokestack extending the length of the two cars; next to them was a luggage car, followed by a second-class car, to which was attached the first-class car, in which were the suppliant and several other passengers.\n\"The gauge of the road was three feet and a half, and the rate of speed at the time of the accident was shown to be from 18 to 20 miles an hour. The curve was shown to be one of the sharpest on the line\u2014the commencement of it being on a down grade, then nearly level for a few yards, succeeded by the upgrade.\n\"It was shown that the front one of the two flat cars was, where connected with the tender, eight to ten inches lower than the tender; that it was not connected therewith by the usual S link, but by a straight short one of not ten inches in length. It was satisfactorily shown, by evidence on the trial, that such a connection, when steam having been shut off going over a down grade and again used to increase the speed, has a tendency to lift the end of the car, and that momentum, suddenly given on a curve where the grade becomes an up one, is calculated to throw the cars off the track. Such was the position of the train when the accident occurred.\n\"It was shown that the part of the road at the curve in question was made in 1873, and was built principally with spruce ties, the life of which was proved to be about seven years, at which age they become rotten and useless as such; very little, if any, substitution of new for old ties had been made on that curve after the road was built, and when the accident occurred it was shown that the ties for eighty yards were torn up and broken, the most of them into fragments of decayed wood. It was shown, by independent testimony of a large number of respectable and reliable witnesses, that for months before the accident several of the ties were so rotten that the ends of them outside the rails could be kicked off, and several proved that they had done so. Several persons also proved that, because of the rottenness of the ties, they could and did draw out with their fingers the spikes which connected the rails with them. On a curve where there is so much lateral pressure the result might legitimately be expected to be the spreading out of the rail on one side and the going off of the train. Such was shown to have been the case where the train left the track. It was in evidence that the whole damage to the road was repaired by new ties, and the whole number required for doing so was charged by the track-master as having been used by him for that purpose.\n\"To show the bad state of the ties on the two lines going east and west from Charlottetown, evidence was given that after the accident 90,000 ties were procured and were used subsequently to replace rotten ones on the two lines.\n\"The only witness on the part of the defence who alleged the soundness of the ties was Hoole, the track-master at the section where the train went off; but his testimony was contradicted as to their state by upwards of thirty witnesses, as well as by his charge for repairing the damage to the road by all new ties. I have, therefore, no difficulty in reaching the conclusion and finding the fact that the road was in a most unsafe state from the rottenness of the ties, and to that cause I trace the accident; and that the safety of life had been recklessly jeopardized by running trains over it with passengers for some time before the accident occurred. \"I also find that the connection of the coal cars, attached to the tender as they were, added to the danger when the train was running at express train speed.\n\"Alexander McNab, C.E., was in charge of the management of the road from the 1st May, 1879. He was examined as a witness on the part of the defence, and by him and others it was shown that before that date the road was worked and managed by an engineer and three other officers, all of whose duties he assumed, but which he said he found himself wholly unable to perform and had been obliged to resign. He stated that Mr. Carvell had made an inspection of the lines, and made a report as to their state shortly before he, Mr. McNab, took charge. That he had the report in his hands at Ottawa after or about the time of his appointment, but did not read it, and had never applied for or obtained it, or a copy of it, and that up to the time of the accident he had not inspected the lines or got any one else to do so, but depended, as he stated, upon irresponsible trackmen to keep the road in running order.\n\"He does not seem to have realized the importance of the duty he undertook, the first of which was to manage the road with a due and proper regard for the safety of passengers going over it.\n\"He had undertaken the management of a road that he knew had been several years built and worked, and his first duty was to prove its safety, but instead of that he neither inspected the lines nor availed himself of the information as to its state which Mr. Carvells report was intended to, and which I have no doubt did, supply. Under the circumstances I have shortly stated, and from the evidence on the trial, the wonder is naturally not that such a serious accident occurred, but that the road was travelled so long without one. Had the road been so operated by a company the circumstances would have justified a finding of vindictive damages arising from the culpable conduct of their r manager. When the car in which the suppliant was went over, he was thrown with great violence from one side of it to the other. His face struck on the side of the car; his upper and lower jaws were fractured on 'both sides so that his chin was moveable, and his nose also could be depressed by pressure, the upper and lower jaw bones on both sides having been fractured. Another portion of the upper jaw bone was also broken off. Eight of his lower teeth, with a part of the lower jaw bone, were knocked out and were left sticking in the side of the car, where his face struck against it. His back was also injured. He bled profusely from the nose and mouth and was insensible for some time. He was brought home (six miles) by a special train the same night, and attended immediately by Drs. Hopkirk and Beer, the latter sent by the railway department. They were examined and gave substantially the same description of the state of the suppliant. The former said he had been a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, England, since 1839, and a fellow of the same college since 1854, and had been in practice for about 40 years. He said that the suppliant was not recognizable. He said:\nHe was covered with blood, and bleeding from the mouth and nose profusely; that the hemorrhage was so great, and the face so much swollen, it was impossible to make any examination; that the blood went down his throat.\n\"And that they had difficulty in stopping it for three days. They had to place him sitting up in bed, and support him in that position, as if he were placed in a lying position, he would have been suffocated by the blood. They packed ice round his head and face to stop the hemorrhage, and continued it for three days, and they administered styptics before they could examine his face. They found the severe injuries I have stated, which this witness fully and minutely described.\nThe sufferings of the suppliant must have been intense for a long time. In the setting of the fractures of the jaw bones his mouth had to be nearly filled with supports to keep the bones in a position, and he had to be supported for several weeks by liquid food poured into his stomach through a tube. His sufferings of mind and body were so great that it was feared by his physicians, for several weeks, that his recovery was improbable. At the trial, eleven months after the injuries, he testified to his inability to attend to his usual business as manager of a bank, and that he was continued in the position only by sufferance, he assisting only a few hours some days, when able, by advice and direction to subordinates, but unable to pursue any continued mental exertion. Previous to the injury he was very active and aged 32 years, rode a good deal on horseback, and took part in athletic exercises. When giving evidence he alleged, and I believe, truly, that he was unable to do either; that he could walk on smooth surfaces, but that he could not get down a step of a few inches without the greatest care, as the slightest shock was felt severely in his back, which, he alleged, was getting more troublesome than at first. He exhibited on the trial a photographic likeness of himself, taken four years before he was injured, compared with which he appears now a physical wreck. He showed his income from the bank which he managed to have been at the rate of $3,000 a year, and that his income from the agency of an insurance company was about $1,000 a year, both of which he stated he would have to resign in consequence of the result of the injuries. It was shown, also, by independent and reliable evidence, that as a bank manager he stood in the first rank; that besides his high qualifications as a bank manager in the Dominion, he was well acquainted with the system of banking in the United States, and was eligible to an appointment of that kind in New York, where salaries are paid ranging from four to ten thousand dollars. He was married a few years ago to a daughter of a worthy judge in Charlottetown, and has one or two children. The evidence is abundant to show that his worldly prospects, pecuniary and otherwise, have been blasted, and that he is but a wreak of what he was before the injuries complained of Dr. Hopkirk said, when giving his evidence, that the suppliant was not even then out of danger from the injuries to his face. He described the result of a suppuration that supervened in his jaw after the fractures had united which necessitated the extraction of two of his remaining teeth, and says that for months he must have suffered agony. He said that the injuries to the upper jaw were of very uncommon occurrence; that Sir W. Ferguson, in his late work on surgery, only mentions one case, and that in that case the patient died. He stated, with great minuteness, the then state of the suppliant, which will be found fully in the evidence, from which he gave his opinion as to the permanency of the injuries. After recounting a number of unfavorable symptoms, he says:\nThat shows that his injuries are connected with the brain. He cannot apply himself. He has want of application. He cannot sit down and occupy his mind for any time. Night before last he could not stand on his heels, and nearly fell down. He could not stand steady on both feet. We tried the tenderness on his back; it was there then.\n\"When asked as to the probability of his complete recovery from it (the injury to his back), he replied:\nHe never will. He will never be able to resume his business again. In another year or so he will be quite incapable, if he lives so long, and there is some doubt about that. He was, he says, a very sound man before the accident, and that if he had not been a tough man, he never would have recovered from the accident. He had no affection. He played cricket and indulged in various exercises. The local pain in the back is the most dangerous symptom.\n\"In answer to a question: Is there any doubt as to the disease the symptoms indicate?' the witness replied:\nThere is no doubt inflammation of the spinal cord or membrane.\n\"The witness, in answer to a question, stated that the general period at which the disease described ends fatally is from two to four years, but that there was one case reported where the patient lived ten years but that was uncommon.\n\"Dr. Beer stated that he attended the suppliant, in consultation with Dr. Hopkirk, for a month, at the instance of the railway superintendent. He corroborates his statements in every particular as to the nature of the injuries, and also as to the symptoms two nights before he gave evidence. When asked as to the probable consequences, he replied:\nDeath within four or five years, in my opinion, it is probable. According to Bryant and Erickson, the best authorities, it is laid down as an invariable rule that railway concussion of the spine, followed by paralysis, proves almost inevitably fatal. Each one of the symptoms indicate it, and, taken altogether, it is undoubted.\n\"He said he had no bill for his services against the suppliant, as he was paid by the railway department.\n\"Dr. McLeod proved that he shortly before examined the suppliant, and found the symptoms as stated by the two preceding witnesses, and gives the same opinion as to the probable results.\n\"Dr. Blanchard proved that he also was present at the examination; noticed the same symptoms as the other doctors, and agreed with them as to the probable result. He says: 'I think he will grow gradually' worse. There may be some intervals when he may 'be better, but he will get steadily worse.'\n\"Mr. Creamer states he heard the symptoms of the suppliant's condition described by the other doctors, when giving their evidence, and said:\nHis injuries will result in paralysis.\" He has' some complaint of the spine. The symptoms indicate that he will get worse, and it will end in death, after a certain length of time.\n\"The foregoing is a brief statement of the evidence to the nature and extent of the injuries sustained by the suppliant,, of his sufferings, and the results up to the time of the trial, with the symptoms then lately ascertained, and the medical decision unanimously pronounced by the doctors examined as to the probable consequences and result of his injuries.\n\"It was shown that the medical expenses up to the time of the trial, medicines and other necessary expenses, amounted to over a thousand dollars, and that it would be necessary for the suppliant, in the opinion of his medical advisers, to go to England to obtain further medical aid and advice.\n\"After the evidence of the suppliant was concluded, Mr. Hodgson, on the part of the defence, moved for a non-suit on the grounds set out in the fourth paragraph of the answer, and was about to argue the objections therein stated. I, however, informed him that I had recently given judgment on demurrer in two cases where the same questions were raised, and having decided them in favor of the suppliants, suggested, that as the points would in those cases probably come before the whole court on appeal, he should be satisfied to have the motion noted, which would enable him subsequently to deal with them. To this he asserted. I have, therefore, to deal with them.\n\"The first objection is that the present action cannot be maintained, because the control and management of the railway being vested by statute in the Minister of Railways and Canals, Her Majesty cannot be made liable upon petition of right, because the same was negligently and unskilfully managed and maintained. The first answer I give to that objection is that the action is not brought to recover damages arising from the mere negligence of management or maintenance. It is alleged and proved that for a good consideration a valid contract was entered into by Her Majesty, and that she failed to perform it. Were it an action in similar circumstances against a company, what defence could be successfully maintained? In case the breach of contract were proved, how could they save themselves from the consequences? Only by proof of vis major of some kind. Something beyond their control, but certainly not the negligence of their own servants. If there was a contract in this case, and a breach shown, a legal excuse or justification must be shown.\n\"If, again, this action were against a company for the breach of a contract to carry and convey safely, the plaintiff's evidence that they did not do so would be sufficient, in the absence of proof of contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff, to put the defendants on their defence. It is only necessary in such cases to prove the contract and the breach, with evidence as to the resulting damage. If, therefore, the present action is at all maintainable, the question of negligence or unskilfulness does not arise as a defence, but may be given in evidence to show how the damage was caused as part of the res gest\u0153. On sound principles of pleading and evidence\/the question of negligence or unskilfulness is no part of the issue where an action is brought on contract to carry safely, and in such cases it has been held by many writers and judges that the going off the track of a railway by a train is in itself prim\u00e2 facie evidence of negligence that calls for evidence in rebuttal.\n\"Redfield, in his treatise on railways, says[1]:\nThe fact that injury was suffered by anyone while upon the company's train as a passenger is regarded as prim\u00e2 facie evidence of their liability.\nand cites in support of that view Carpin v. London & Bir. Railway Co.[2], and several American decisions, stated in a note at p. 177, and shews that the same rule was acted on in a case in the Supreme Court of the United States[3], and in Skinner v. L. Bri. 8f S. Coast Railway[4].\n\"In Galena & Chicago Railway v. Yarnrod[5], it was held \"that a passenger in a railway car need only show that he has received an injury to make a prim\u00e2 facie case against the carrier. The carrier must rebut the presumption in order to exonerate himself[6].\n\"In Hammack v. White[7] it was held that mere proof of an accident having happened to a train does not cast upon the company the burden of showing the real cause of the injury, but it was held in Dawson v. Manchester Sh. & L. Railway[8], that if a carriage break down or run off the rail this will be & prim\u00e2 facie evidence of negligence.\n\"In Pym v. Great Northern Railway[9], it occurred from a defective rail. In a note at page 189 the same learned author says:\nSo that, in regard to the undertakings of carriers of goods and passengers, the law has attached certain conditions to the general undertaking, implied from entering upon the transit, that the things or the person is to be carried safely through in a reasonable or the ordinary time unless prevented, in the case of carriers of goods by some invincible obstacle like the act of God or the public enemy, and in the case of carriers of passengers that it shall be so done, unless prevented by some agency not under the carriers control, by the exercise of the strictest care and diligence consistent with the successful conduct of the business \"If such be the law, and I do not think it will be doubted, then a contract to carry safely was by legal implication entered into in this case, and unless it can be found that Her Majesty in all cases of contract is above the law, I cannot arrive at the conclusion that because the injuries complained of were caused by the bad management, unskilfulness or negligence of those entrusted with the working of the railway, the suppliant must be denied redress. If the claim had been one founded on mere negligence, without a contract express or implied, the case would have stood upon a very different legal footing, and to such a case would the objection be alone, in my opinion, applicable.\n\"The objection that the action cannot be maintained, because the control and management of the railway in question was vested in the Minister of Railways and Canals, I disposed of in my judgment in McFarlane v. The Queen[10], and in MacLean v. The Queen. \"It is held in England that an action by petition of right will lie in all cases in the Exchequer Court for breaches of contract entered into by departmental officers of the government, and by the 58th sec. of the Act of the Dominion establishing this court, exclusive jurisdiction is given to it in all cases in which the demand shall 'be made, or relief sought, in respect of any matter 'which might in England be the subject of a suit or 'action in the Exchequer Court on its revenue side 'against the Crown.'\n\"I find no qualification of the term \u2018contract' in any decision or proceeding in England, nor can I discover any reason for any such qualification. If there be a contract, the law makes no difference whether it be written or verbal, express or implied. In any case it is equally binding. The law in this case makes the contract sued on, and who can say that is less potent for that purpose than if one had been made by the parties in writing, and even under seal.\n\"Suppose a case wherein a departmental officer in the government, in execution of the proper functions of his department, enters into an agreement in writing expressly undertaking, for a valuable consideration, that he will, on certain works being done, pay a certain sum of money, transfer property of some kind to the other contracting party, or to do some other act, but failed to do so, and an action by petition of right was brought, would it be any answer in law to allege that the failure to perform the contract arose from the improper conduct and negligence of the officer, and that Her Majesty was not answerable for the negligence of her servants?\n\"The other objection, 'that even, assuming the said 'railway to be under the management and control of 'Her Majesty, no negligence can be imputed to Her, and 'Her Majesty is not answerable by petition of right for 'the negligence of Her servants,\u2019 is, I think, fully answered, as far as this case is concerned, by what I have previously said. Were there no contract existing, and a duty and obligation accepted, it might possibly be considered the doctrine would be available. It might be urged, for instance, in a case where a person not a passenger was injured, or where property, not in the possession or under the control of the railway management, was destroyed or injured, through the improper conduct of the railway agents or servants, but I think it is wholly inapplicable where a contract for safe conduct exists. When the legislature has placed the title of certain railways in Her Majesty, and provided for the management and control of them in the minister specially assigned for that duty, it is clear that the title is in trust for the Dominion, and the minister was fully clothed with power to enter into all necessary contracts on the part of the Dominion for the object in view. The amount of a judgment against the' crown is to be paid out of the Dominion treasury, and the action, though nominally against Her Majesty, is virtually against the Dominion.\n\"When, therefore, a failure to perform a contact is found, the action I conceive to be properly brought by petition of right in this court.\n\"The question of the obligation to perform an implied contract is elementary in law, and I have therefore cited no authorities in support of the doctrine. It is fully treated on in every work on contract, and no doubt is expressed in regard to the binding effect of one.\n\"I am of opinion the action is properly within the jurisdiction of this court, and that the suppliant is entitled to a judgment.\n\"The only question left is as to the amount of damages. I have not stated in detail the length or acuteness of the sufferings endured by the suppliant for months after he was injured; or fully the evidence as to the probability of future sufferings. The evidence, however, is full upon those points. The suppliant was a young man (aged 32 years) and of robust health. In the language of Chief Justice Cockburn in Philips v. South Western Ry.[11]:\nHis health has been irreparably injured to such a degree as to render life a burden, and a source of the utmost misery. He has undergone a great amount of pain and suffering. The probability is that he will never recover. His condition is at once helpless and hopeless.\n\"The suppliant in this case was in the receipt of an annual income of t-1-,000 up to the time of the trial; he continued by the favour of the directors of the bank to receive his salary of $3,000 as manager of the bank, although unable for months to perform any service, and but little afterwards. Both he and all the medical practitioners examined stated his inability to attend to business, and that, consequently, he would be unable to earn any salary or attend to any regular business. He had increased expenses, by reason of the injury, to over $1,000 for medical aid. I feel bound by the evidence he gave of his condition and inability hereafter to earn a livelihood, and sustained, as it has been, so fully by the evidence of the medical practitioners.\n\"In the case just mentioned, Chief Justice Cockburn[12] says:\nIt is extremely difficult to lay down any precise rule as to the measure of damages in cases of personal injury like the present. No doubt, as a general rule, when injury is caused to one person by the wrongful or negligent act of another, the compensation should be commensurate to the injury sustained. But there are personal injuries for which no amount of pecuniary damages afford adequate compensation. While, on the other hand, the attempt to award full compensation in damages might be attended with ruinous consequences to defendants, who cannot always, even with the utmost care, protect themselves against carelessness of persons in their employ. Generally speaking, we agree with the rule as laid down by Brett, J., in Rowley v. London & N W. Ry. Co.[13], an action brought on the 9th and 10th Vic., c. 93, that a jury in such cases must not attempt to give damages to the full amount of a perfect compensation for the pecuniary injury, but must take a reasonable view of the case, and give what they consider, under all circumstances, a fair compensation.\nHis Lordship then stated what he considered all the heads of damages, in respect of which a plaintiff, complaining of a personal injury, is entitled to compensation.\nThese are the bodily injury sustained, the pain undergone, the effect on the health of the sufferer, according to its degree, and if it\u2019s probable duration is likely to be temporary or permanent; the expenses incidental to attempt to cure or lessen the amount of injury, the pecuniary loss at stained through inability to attend a profession or business\u2014as to which, again, the injury may be of a temporary character, or may be such as to incapacitate the party for the remainder of his life.\n\"In such a case it is necessary and proper to consider that, by accident or otherwise, a person's life may be suddenly shortened, even in cases of comparative youth 1 and in cases of apparent robust health. On the other hand, a party like the suppliant, in his condition of health before the injury, had a reasonable prospect of living 30 or 40 years. He had, also, the reasonable prospect of enjoying his salary as long as he was able to attend to his duties, with a fair prospect of advancement, All these matters I have carefully weighed, and have adopted the heads of damage stated in the judgment of Chief Justice Cockburn, and, after long and full deliberation, I have concluded to award damages in this case to the amount that may, at first sight, seem high in this country, but which, in other countries, would not be so considered. I have felt great unwillingness to tax the Dominion resources more than could be helped, but, at the same time, it is my duty to award, not ample compensation for the injuries sustained, for no amount would be sufficient for that purpose, but the fair and reasonable compensation, under all the circumstances, to which I think the suppliant is entitled. To obtain a life annuity of $4,000 payable annually at six per cent., would require a sum beyond $50,000, but that would not be a correct mode of ascertaining the damages. I have, however, considered the fact as one legitimately connected with the matter of damages. Having very carefully weighed all the unfortunate circumstances of the case, I trust I have arrived at a conclusion that will do justice to all the interests involved. I award to the suppliant, for damages for the injuries sustained by him, as complained of in his petition, the sum of thirty-six thousand dollars.\" RITCHIE, C. J.:\nI cannot distinguish, this case from that of McFarlane v. The Queen[14], nor can we sustain this judgment without overruling the decision of this court in that case, which I am not prepared to do.\nThis is, in my opinion, unquestionably a claim sounding in tort, a claim for a negligent breach of duty.\nThe suppliant's case is based on the allegation that being entitled \"to be carried safely and securely by Her Majesty upon said railway on the said journey, Her Majesty, disregarding Her duty in that behalf, and Her said promise, did not safely and securely carry the suppliant upon the said railway upon the said journey, but so negligently and unskilfully conducted, managed and maintained the said railway, and the train upon which the suppliant was a passenger, that in the course of said journey the suppliant was greatly and permanently injured in body and health.\"\nAs between private individuals, it is thus laid down in all the text authors and sustained by the cases, that a carrier of passengers, not being an insurer and liable at all events as a carrier of goods is, actual negligence must be proved; it is not sufficient merely to show an accident, unless it is of such a description as to afford a presumption of negligence. See Chilly and Temple on Carriers[15].\nIn actions against carriers for injuries to passengers by the negligence of the defendant it lies upon the plaintiff to prove the negligence, and not on the carrier to show that he used reasonable care.\nAnd in Chitty on Contracts[16] it is thus stated:\nA carrier of passengers, therefore, is liable for personal injuries which they may sustain, whilst being carried by him, only where such injuries have been occasioned by his negligence and unskilfulness.\nThe proposition is fully established by the case of Crofts v. Waterhouse[17]. This was an action against a coach proprietor for having by the negligence and improper conduct of his servants overturned and injured the plaintiff\u2014travelling in the defendant's coach.\nBest, C. J.:\nThe action cannot be sustained unless negligence is proved.\nParke, j.:\nThe distinction between carriers of goods and carriers of passengers was not sufficiently left to the jury. A carrier of goods is liable in all events, except the act of God or the King's enemies\u2014a carrier of passengers is only liable for negligence.\nAston v. Heaven[18] was a case against defendants as proprietors of the Salisbury stage coach for negligence in driving the said coach, in consequence of which the coach was overset and the plaintiff was bruised and her finger broken.\nEyre, C. J., said:\nThis action is founded entirely on negligence. * * * I am of opinion that the case of loss of goods by carriers and the present is totally unlike * * * this action stands on the ground of negligence alone.\nBut the learned judge in the Exchequer seems to base his judgment on the assumption that a carrier of passengers is liable at all events as a carrier of goods is, in other words an insurer, for as to the objection raised, \"that Her Majesty cannot be made liable upon petitions \"of right because the same was negligently and unskilfully managed and maintained,\" the learned judge says: \"The first answer I give to that objection is \"that the action is not brought to recover damages \"arising from the mere negligence of management \"or maintenance. It is alleged and proved that for a \"good consideration a valid contract was entered into \"by Her Majesty, and that she failed to perform it\" Again, \"If there was a contract in this case and a breach \"shown, a legal excuse or justification must be shown, \"If again, this action were against a company for the \"breach of a contract to carry and convey safely, the \"plaintiff's evidence that they did not do so, would be \"sufficient in the absence of proof of contributory \"negligence on the part of the plaintiff to put the \"defendants on their defence, it is only necessary in \"such cases to prove the contract and the breach with \"evidence as to the resulting damage.\" And again: \"On sound principles of pleading and evidence the \"question of negligence or unskilfulness is no part of \"the issue where an action is brought on a contract to \"carry safely.\"\nThe learned judge was addressing these observations in reference to and dealing with what was assumed to be the contract in this case; but no such contract was proved as that Her Majesty promised, in consideration of suppliant being a passenger for reward, safely and securely to carry him upon the said railway upon said journey between the said stations\u2014the only evidence of any contract is that the suppliant paid his fare and received a ticket, as follows:\n\"Ticket, P. E. I. Railway, first class, Charlottetown to Souris and return.\n\"August 25th, 1880.\"\nThis indicates neither more nor less than that the holder had paid his toll and was entitled to a passage between the points indicated. Tolls on all public works are established under section fifty-eight of the Public Works Act[19], which deals with all tolls in the same manner; it is as follows:\nThe Governor may, by Order in Council to be issued and published as hereinafter provided, impose and authorize the collection of tolls and dues upon any canal, railway, harbor, road, bridge, ferry, slide, or other public works, vested in Her Majesty, or under the control or management of the Minister, and from time to time in like manner may alter and change such dues or tolls, and may declare the exemptions therefrom 5 and all such dues and tolls shall be payable in advance and before the right to the use of the public work in respect of which they are incurred shall accrue, if so demanded by the collector thereof.\nThis doctrine of the learned judge might be all right enough, as between private individuals, if it could be established that carriers of passengers are, as carriers of goods were, insurers, or if there was an express contract to warrant and insure at all events the safe carriage of the passenger between the stations named in the ticket.\nBut the doctrine of the learned judge, as applicable to this case, cannot, in my opinion, be sustained.\nThe establishment of the government railways in the Dominion is, as has been said of the Post Office establishments, and as we thought of the slides in the case of McFarlane v. The Queen[20], a branch of the public police, created by statute for purposes of public convenience, and not entered upon or to be treated as private mercantile speculations.\nAs to the Intercolonial Railway; it was in no sense in the nature of a private undertaking, constructed for reasons influencing private promoters of similar works, or in the nature of a mercantile speculation\u2014it was constructed as a great public undertaking essential to the consolidation of the union of British North America, and in fulfilment of a duty imposed on the government and parliament of Canada by the British North America Act.\nAnd so with respect to the P. E. I. Railway now in question. We find from the Journals of the House of Assembly of P. E. L, 1871[21], the following history of the legislation and reason for its construction:\nWhereas, the trade and export of this island have much increased during the past few years; and whereas, it is found almost impossible, in the absence of stone or gravel, to keep the roads in an efficient state of repair, to render easy the transport of the production of the colony; and whereas the construction and maintenance of a line of railway through the island would greatly facilitate its trade, developed its resources, enlarge its revenue, and open more frequent and easy communication with the neighboring Provinces and the United States;\nResolved, That a Bill be introduced authorizing the Government to undertake the construction of a railroad, to extend from Cascumpec to Georgetown, touching at Summer side and Charlottetown, and also branches to Souris and Tignish, at a' cost not exceeding five thousand pounds currency, per mile, for construction, including all surveys and locating the line, and all suitable stations, station houses, sidings, turn-tables, rolling stock, fences, and all the necessary appliances suitable for a first class railroad, and the construction of suitable wharfs at Cascumpec, Summer side, Charlottetown and Georgetown, provided the contractors for building and furnishing the said railroad accept in payment the Government debentures of Prince Edward Island, at thirty years at par, without allowance for discount or otherwise.\nOn Prince Edward Island becoming a part of the Dominion this public undertaking became the property of the Dominion, the management, direction and control of which the legislature has entrusted to the Board of Works, under statutory provisions, for the benefit and advantage of the public; and being thus established for public purposes, it is subordinate to those principles of public policy which prevents the Grown being responsible for the misfeasance\u2019s, wrongs, negligences, or omissions of duty of the subordinate officers or agents employed in the public service on these public works and therefore the maxim respondent superior does not apply in the case of the Crown itself, and the Sovereign is not liable for personal negligence, and, therefore, the principle qui facit per alium facit per se, which is applied to render the master liable for the negligence of his ser rant, because this has arisen from his own negligence or imprudence in selecting or retaining a careless servant, is not applicable to the Sovereign, to whom negligence or misconduct cannot be imputed, and for which, if it occurs in fact, the law affords no remedy; for as Mr. Story says, \"the Government does not undertake to guarantee to any persons the fidelity of any of the officers or agents it employs, since it would involve it in all its operations in endless embarrassment and difficulties and losses which would be subversive of the public interests.\"\nIn this respect the law places the crown in reference to the post office, railways, canals and other public works, and undertakings, and those availing themselves of the convenience and benefit of such institutions, in no better or no worse position than if they were owned by private individuals, who made it an express stipulation that they should not be liable to parties dealing with them for the consequences of the negligence or misconduct, wilful or otherwise, of their agents and servants[22]. This, of course, does not touch or affect the question of the liability, or the personal responsibility to third persons of officers or subordinates for acts and omissions in their official conduct when injuries and losses have been sustained, still less, where they are guilty of direct misfeasances to third persons in the discharge of their official functions. There is therefore nothing unreasonable in limiting the liability of the crown and freeing it from liability for negligences and laches of its servants; none of the great public works having been undertaken with a view to mercantile gain, but for the general public good.\nThe public who use these government railways must understand what the law is, to what extent the law, on principles of public policy, prevents actions being brought against the Crown for injuries resulting from the nonfeasance or misfeasance of its servants\u2014in other words, parties dealing with the crown, in reference to these great public undertakings, deal subject to those prerogative rights of the Crown and those rules and principles, well known to the law, which, on considerations of public policy, are applicable to transactions between the Crown and a subject, but not between subject and subject.\nTo say that these great public works are to be treated as the property of private individuals or corporations, and the Queen, as the head of the government of the country, as a trader or common carrier, and as such chargeable with negligence, and liable therefor, and for all acts of negligence or improper conduct in the employees of the crown, from the stoker to the Minister of Railways, is simply to ignore all constitutional principles. These prerogatives of the Crown must not be treated as personal to the sovereign; they are great constitutional rights, conferred on the sovereign, upon principles of public policy, for the benefit of the people, and not, as it is said, \"for the private gratification of the sovereign\"\u2014they form part of and are generally speaking \"as ancient as the law itself.\"\nThe judiciary of the United States of America, ignoring prerogative rights, deal with matters, such as this on principles of public policy, on the ground of the principles of the common law.\nThus in Johnson v. United States[23], Nott, J., says, in the Court of Claims:\nThis court has again and again held to the principle of the common law that the government cannot be sued in an action sounding in tort, nor made liable for the tortious acts of its officers.\nThis constitutional principle this court cannot ignore; it must not attempt to make laws; it must administer the law, constitutional, local, public or private, as it is, and leave the Dominion Parliament, on general and constitutional questions affecting the whole Dominion, and the provincial assemblies, on local questions, each within the scope of their legislative functions, as declared by the B. N. A. Act, to alter or adapt the practices or principles in force, to make them, if found expedient so to do, more suitable and applicable to the circumstances of the country. As to the statutes which it is alleged recognize the right of a party to recover for damage or injuries sustained on any railroad, see 31 Vic., ch. 12; 33 Vic., ch. 23; 44 Vic., ch. 25.\nThe Crown not being liable, it is only necessary to say that in a case such as this at common law, if the legislature has given a remedy, the remedy prescribed must be pursued, because the statute gives no action at common law, there is only the statute to be relied on, it being clearly established that, where a new right is created by statute, the remedy is confined to that given by statute.\nThe statute 38 Vic., ch. 12, repealed by 39 Vic., ch. 27, giving power to this court to deal with petitions of right, expressly enacts that nothing in it shall prejudice or limit otherwise than therein provided the rights, privileges or prerogatives of Her Majesty or Her successors, or give to the subject any remedy against the Crown in any case when not entitled in England, under any circumstances, by laws in force prior to the passing of the Imperial Statute 23 and 24 Vic., ch. 34.\nI have not felt it necessary to go more minutely into the cases bearing on the questions involved in this case as they can be found in McFarlane v. The Queen[24]. Under these circumstances, I am constrained to the conclusion that the judgment must be reversed, and this court should declare that the suppliant is not entitled to the relief sought by his petition.\nI may be permitted to add that the suppliant in this case has my deepest sympathy, and, I trust, that an application on his part to the grace, favor and bounty \u201e of the Crown may yet enable him to get that relief which this court has been unable to grant him.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nIn the case of the Queen v. McFarlane[25], lately decided in this court, I stated my reasons for holding that a petition of right will not lie against the Crown in respect either of tortious injuries or breaches of contract, caused by the negligence of its servants or officers. In other words, that in the case of torts the maxim Respondent Superior does not apply to the Crown, and in the case of contracts, that they are to be construed as though they contained an exception of the Crown for liability in respect of any wrongful or negligent breach by its servants.\nI am unable to distinguish this case on principle from that of the Queen v. McFarlane, and as I adhere to what It hen said, I refer to my judgment in that case for the grounds of the conclusion at which I have arrived as to the disposition of the present appeal, which is, that it must be allowed, and the petition of right dismissed. [TRANSLATED]\nFOURNIER, J.:\nThis is an appeal from a judgment of the Exchequer Court in the matter of the petition of right of the respondent, claiming the sum of $35,000 damages for injuries suffered by him in consequence of an accident which took place on the Prince Edward Island Railway, the property of the Dominion of Canada.\nOn the 25th August, 1880, the respondent presented himself as a passenger, and obtained, in consideration of the payment of the ordinary fare fixed by the Government, a passenger ticket entitling him to be carried upon the said railway from Charlottetown to Souris, and by his petition alleges that he fulfilled on his part all the conditions which entitled him to be carried safely and securely on said railway on the said journey. He avers that the said railway was run, worked, and managed so negligently and unskilfully that the train upon which he (the suppliant) was a passenger was run off the rails, and that in the accident he was greatly and permanently injured in body and health, and has become seriously incapacitated in his ability to earn a livelihood for himself and his family.\nBy the defence put in on behalf of Her Majesty it is admitted that the Prince Edward Island Bail way is the property of Her Majesty, but was, at the time of the accident in question, under the control and management of the Minister of Bail ways and Canals of Canada. The defence also denies any contract on behalf of Her Majesty to carry safely and securely the suppliant.\nIn the fourth paragraph of the statement of defence, two other grounds are set up in answer to the suppliant's claim, the first\u2014\"That the control and management of the said railway being vested by statute in the Minister of Railways and Canals, Her Majesty cannot be made liable upon petition of right for the bad management of the Minister as alleged\u20142nd. That even assuming the said railway to be under the management and control of Her Majesty, no negligence can be imputed to Her, and Her Majesty is not answerable by petition of right for the negligence of her servants.\nThe evidence adduced in this case, and the finding of the learned judge who tried the case, removes all doubt on the questions of fact, the cause of the accident, the extent of the damages suffered, &c. There was no dispute on this point on the part of the counsel on the argument before us, except, perhaps, an opinion put forward, that the amount awarded was excessive, but no good reason was given. On this appeal, therefore, the only question which arises, is one of law, viz.: Whether Her Majesty is responsible towards a subject for damages resulting in consequence of acts of omission or negligence by those who represent Her Majesty, or act for Her in the execution of a contract, when such acts as between subject and subject would constitute a breach of contract? The learned counsel for the appellant contends that Her Majesty is not responsible, relying on the old common law maxim, \"The king can do no wrong.\" Is it not greatly extending the applicability of the true meaning of this maxim, to apply it to such a case as the present one, when in truth the political power of Her Majesty is not in question, but merely Her Majesty's civil responsibility in a matter of a contract?\nAlthough the signification of this maxim is somewhat well known, it is necessary for me, in consequence of the opinion of the majority of the court in this case, to cite the opinion of some authors. Amongst others Chitty in his work on Prerogatives of the Crown[26], says:\u2014\n\"The king can do no wrong.\"The constitutional signification of this maxim was in former times misrepresented. It was pretended by some that it meant that every measure of the king was lawful, a doctrine subversive of all principles of which the constitution is compounded. It is a fundamental general rule, that the King cannot sanction any act forbidden by law, it is in that point of view that His Majesty is under, and not above, the laws, that he is bound by them equally with his subjects.\nIn Broom's Legal Maxims[27] it is said:\n\"The king can do no wrong.\" Its true meaning is\u2014First, that the sovereign individually and personally, and in his natural capacity is independent of, and is not amenable to, any other earthly power or jurisdiction$ and that whatever may be amiss in the condition of public affairs is not to be imputed to the king, so as to render him answerable for it personally to his people. Secondly, the above maxim means, that the prerogative of the crown extends not to do any injury, because, being created for the benefit of the people, it cannot be exercised to their prejudice, and it is therefore a fundamental rule that the king cannot sanction any act forbidden by law 5 so that, in this point of view, he is under, and not above, the laws, and is bound by them equally with his subjects.\nAnd in Todd's Parliamentary Government in British Colonies[28]:\nProminent among these constitutional maxims, is the principle that \"the king can do no wrong,\" Rightly understood this precept means, that the personal actions of the sovereign, not being acts of the government, are not under the cognizance of the law, and that as an individual he is not amenable to any earthly power or jurisdiction. He is nevertheless in subjection to God and to the law. For the law controls the king, and it is, in fact, the only rule and measure of the power of-the Crown, and of the obedience of the people. And while the sovereign is personally irresponsible for all acts of the government, yet the functions of royalty which appertain to him, in his political capacity, are regulated by law, or by constitutional precept, and must be discharged by him solely for the public good, and not to gratify personal inclinations.\nKent's Commentaries[29]:\nAnother attribute of the royal character is irresponsibility, it being an ancient fundamental maxim that the king can do no wrong. This is not to be understood as if everything transacted by the government was, of course, just and legal. Its proper meaning is only this: that no crime or other misconduct must ever be imputed to the sovereign personally. However tyrannical or arbitrary, therefore, may be the measures pursued or sanctioned by him, he is himself saved from punishment of every description. On the same principle no action can be brought against the sovereign, even in civil matters. Indeed this immunity, both from civil suit and penal proceeding, rest on another subordinate reason also, viz: that no court can have jurisdiction over him. For all jurisdiction implies superiority of power, and proceeds from the Crown itself.\nWhile the sovereign himself however is, in a personal sense, incapable of doing wrong, yet his acts may, in themselves, be contrary to law, and are in some cases subject to reversal on that ground.\nAfter stating that patents granted by the sovereign may be declared null, not on account of any error or injustice on his part, but because the sovereign was misinformed by his agents, the author adds:\nSo, if a person has in point of property a just demand upon the sovereign, though he cannot bring an action against him, he may petition him in the High Court of Justice, and obtain a redress as a matter of grace, though not upon compulsion.\nThe passage I have above cited from Chitty shows that it is not the first time that the proper signification of this maxim has been misunderstood. The terse language used in order to prove how limited its signification is, clearly establishes the fact that this maxim cannot be invoked as laying down an absolute principle. Such a doctrine, in his opinion, would be subversive of all the principles of the constitution. It is a general and fundamental rule that the king cannot sanction any act forbidden by law. It is in this sense that the king is under and not above the laws, and is bound by them equally with his subjects. Therefore the laws relating to contracts, as well as other laws, are binding on the sovereign. Now, it is an elementary principle of law, that the conditions of a contract are as binding between the contracting parties, as if they were dispositions or provisions of; the law itself. If Her Majesty, as it is Her undoubted right, can enter into contracts, must she not be considered to be bound towards those with whom she contracts, in the same manner and to the same extent as they are bound to her? There must be reciprocity in such cases; as Lord Justice Blackburn says in Thomas v. The Queen[30]:\nContracts can be made on behalf of Her Majesty with subjects, and the Attorney-General, suing on her behalf, can enforce those contracts against the subject, and if the subject has no means of enforcing the contract on his part, there is certainly a want of reciprocity in such cases.\nThe right of Her Majesty to contract either in her name, or the name of her agents or public officers, cannot be doubted. The statutes creating the public departments, the Public Works Department and the Department of Railways and Canals, apart from the general power which Her Majesty possesses, as sale-corporation, contain also numerous provisions relating to the manner in which Her Majesty may become a contracting party either in her name or in the name of her agents.\nMoreover, the maxim that the king can do no wrong is not only limited in the manner stated in Chitty, but it is further limited by the allowance of the petition of right, \"an ancient common law remedy for the subject against the Crown,\" as Chitty describes ii, giving to the subject the right to claim from the sovereign, moveables, lands, debts, and unliquidated damages[31]. This gives the subject the same right he would have by action against another subject. \"The petition (he says) is, however, substantially as well as nominally, a petition of right, as the prayer, if it is grantable, is ex debito justiti\u0153\" This is not a new question it has been treated of in the case already referred to of Thomas v. The Queen. Arid in Broom's Constitutional Law[32], when speaking of the redress which the subject has against the sovereign, I find the language more precise. He recognizes but a single exception, that is when the redress sought is against the personal act of the sovereign. He adds:\nAs for the most petty and inconsiderable trespass committed by his fellow subjects, so for the invasion of property by his sovereign, does our law give to a suppliant, fully, freely, and efficiently redress. One exception, and one only, to this rule (as just intimated) occurs, and that is, where the sovereign has done himself personally an act which injures or prejudices another, for the king of England can theoretically do no wrong. Our law thus recognizes his supremacy, it has omitted to frame any mode of redress for that which it deems to be impossible.\nTrue, that out of respect for the dignity of the Crown, a petition cannot be tried without Her Majesty's consent, but when the petition is, tried, it carries the same effect as an action between subject and subject. The petition is, however, substantially as well as nominally, a petition of right, as the prayer, if it is granted, is ex debito justiti\u0153. The mode of exercising this right has been regulated by our statute.\nNow, in the present case, however, I find that Her Majesty, by her present statement of defence, as I have before stated, denies to the suppliant any right to claim a redress for the damages he has suffered, and, on the other hand, the suppliant contends that Her Majesty, having contracted to carry him safely and securely, is responsible to him for a breach of said contract, which took place by the accident happening under the circumstances disclosed by the evidence in the case. To decide whether this proposition is correct, I may say, is the principal question to be determined by this court on the present appeal. The question of the responsibility of the Crown in matters of breach of contract, is not a new one. In the case of Thomas v. The Queen, the Court of Queen's Bench in England decided the question affirmatively[33]. In that case, the suppliant, being the inventor of a new system of heavy artillery, had made an agreement with the Secretary of State for the War Department, by which he consented to refer to a special committee at Woolwich the merits of his invention and to furnish all descriptions, plans and models necessary to enable the committee to express an opinion on the matter, obliging himself personally to give such explanations as would be required. The consideration of this arrangement was that should his inventions be approved of by the committee, he should be remunerated by a sum of money to be determined by Her Majesty's General Board of Ordnance. He alleged also in his petition that he had been put to considerable expense and outlay in perfecting his invention, the Government having promised, should the experiment to he made be successful, to reimburse him for such outlay. That, although he had fulfilled all the conditions of the arrangement on his part, yet the amount which he was to receive had not yet been determined or paid.\nAfter filing a demurrer to the petition, the Attorney General abandoned all preliminary objections which might be remedied by amending, and the points argued before the court were the following: \"That a petition of right will not lie for any other object than specific chattels or lands, and that it will not lie for breach of contract, nor to recover money claimed either by way of debt or damages.\" I will only cite that part of Mr. Justice Blackburn's elaborate judgment which refers to the question whether a petition of right will lie for damages resulting from a breach of contract.\nBut it is quite settled that on account of her dignity no 'action. can be brought against the Queen; the redress, if any, must be by petition of right, which is now regulated by 23 and 24 Vic. c. 34, If the suppliant ultimately recovers, he obtains, under section 9, a judgment of the court that he is entitled to such relief as the court shall think just. And this form of judgment would be applicable to the case in which it appeared to the court that the plaintiff was entitled to be paid damages for non fulfilment of a contract.\nIt appears that at the time of the passing of the act there was a general impression that a petition of right was maintainable for a debt due on a breach of contract by the crown; the opinion to that effect expressed in Lord Somers' argument in the Bankers case[34] had been adopted by Chief Baron Comyns[35], and by Sergeant Manning in his treaties on the practice, of the Court of Exchequer, where he says[36]:\n\"That chattels, personal debts, or unliquidated damages may be recovered under it.\" * * * * Indeed, the framers of the act appeared to have considered its chief utility to consist in the applicability of its improved procedure to petitions on contracts between subjects and the various public departments of the government, so vastly on the increase in recent years, both in numbers and importance! whilst petitions of right in respect of specific lands or chattels for the future will be exceedingly rare.\nBut as sec. 7 of the act above quoted, declares expressly that, \"nothing in this statute shall be construed to give to the subject any remedy against the Crown in any case in which he would not have been entitled to such remedy before the passing of this act,\" it became necessary to determine whether the general impression above mentioned, was well founded, and whether, before the passing of the statute, a petition would lie for breach of a contract, made with an authorized agent of the crown.\nThe determination of this question is of the utmost importance, as our statute regulating the procedure in petitions of right, 35 Vic., c. 12, by sec. 19, gives to the subject only such rights as are given in England by 28 and 24 Vic., c. 34. And as this latter act only gave such remedies as were in existence before the passing of the Act, it necessarily follows that if the right did not exist in England prior to 23 and 21 Vice. 34, in cases of breach of contract, it would not exist in this country in a similar case, as the rights of the subject are declared to be the same in both countries. The learned judge after an able and exhaustive review of all the authorities and precedents relating to this question, concludes by answering it in the affirmative. I will only cite the concluding remarks of the learned judge at p. 43 of the report:\nIn Comyns' Digest, Prer. D, 78, it is said that petition lies if the king does not pay a debt, wages, &c., citing Lord Somers arg. 85, and Chief Baron Cornyns expresses no doubt as to the soundness of the doctrine thus cited by him. It appears in Macbeth v. Haldimand[37] that Lord Thurlow and Buller, J,, (both obiter diota it is true) expressed an opinion that a petition of right lay against the Crown on a contract; and a similar opinion seems to have been expressed by the barons in the Exchequer in Oldham v. Ford of the Treasury[38]; and in Baron de Bode's Case[39], in which the point was raised, but was not decided\u2014Lord Denman declares \"an unquestionable repugnance to the suggestion that the door ought to be closed against all redress and remedy.\" A doctrine much resembling what Lord Somers called Lord Holfs \"popular opinion,\" that if there be a right there must be a remedy. In discount Canterbury v. Attorney General[40] it was decided that the sovereign could not be sued in petition of right for a wrong. But in neither case was any opinion expressed that a petition of right will not lie for a contract. Erie, C J., expressly saying that \"claims founded on contracts and grants made on behalf of the Crown are within a class legally distinct from wrongs;\" and in Feathers v. Reg.[41], it is assumed in the judgment that it does lie \"where the claim arises out of a contract, as for goods supplied on the public service.\" We think, therefore, that we are bound by the bankers case to hold that the judgment on the demurrer should be for the suppliant.\nThis decision and the numerous authorities there cited are so decisive in my opinion, that there can be no doubt a petition of right will lie for a breach of a contract, and that the Crown is responsible to the other contracting party for any damages suffered in consequence of such breach.\nBut, although the right of the subject in such cases to claim redress by petition of right does not, in my opinion, suffer any doubt, it is contended also on behalf of the appellant, that as by 33 Vic. ch. 23, a special redress is given for damages in cases of accident on government railways, it was not open to the respondent to urge his claim otherwise; in other words, that he had only the redress ex grati\u00e2 provided by that statute, and that he could not exercise his legal right (ex debito justiti\u0153) by petition. This statute, 33 Vic. c. 23, passed to extend the jurisdiction of the official arbitrators, in addition to the different kind of claims over which they had jurisdiction, enacted that the Minister of Public Works may, under 31 Vic. c. 12 s. 34, refer to the decision of the official arbitrators, amongst others, any claims for damages arising from accidents on railways and canals, causing death and grievous injuries. This claim must be made in accordance with the provisions contained in 31 Vic. c, 12, which, amongst others, provides that the minister may in his discretion arbitrarily refuse or grant a reference to the arbitrators. By 42 Vic. c. 7, which creates the Department of Railways and Canals, the minister of the new department is given the same powers in reference to claims for damages that was given to the Minister of Public Works. There can be no doubt that in virtue of the 5th section of the said Act the Minister of Railways and Canals can in his discretion receive and refer to the official arbitrators a claim in the nature of the present one. This power of reference existed by statutes relating to the construction of public works prior to 31 Vic. c. 12. It was extended, as I have just stated, in 1870 by 33 Vic. c. 23 to personal injuries, But can we not infer that, in addition to this right to obtain redress ex grati\u00e2, which by experience was shown to be exercised not without inconvenience, the legislature has thought fit to add a redress by legal right ex debito justiti\u0153 by passing the 89 Vic. c. 27 regulating the procedure in matters of petition of right. This redress ex grati\u00e2 must have been considered to be insufficient, as it placed the claimant entirely in the hands of his adversary. There were, no doubt, good reasons which induced the legislature to give to the subject a legal right by passing the petition of right act. And, therefore, I do not think the following rule of law has any application to the present case: \"If the statute which imposes the obligation, whether private or public, provides in the same \"section a specific means or procedure for enforcing it, \"no other course than that thus provided can be resorted \"to.\" The statute in question, 33 Vic. ch. 23, did not give the right of action to the respondent, it merely enacts that official arbitrators shall hereafter have, at the minister's discretion, jurisdiction in matters over which they, prior to the passing of that statute, had no jurisdiction. The respondent in this case has not based his claim on that statute. His right of action is founded on the contract implied by his purchasing a passenger ticket, and on the statutes hereinafter mentioned relating to railways, and it is in virtue of the petition of right act that he proceeds to maintain his right of action. Moreover, the statute, 33 Vic., ch. 23, cannot be said to have taken away any legal right a party may have, because it provides an optional remedy, and its provisions cannot affect the petition of right act which was passed subsequently.\nParliament, having by the latter statute regulated the procedure in matters of petition of right, had no doubt the power to revoke or modify statute 33 Vic., ch. 23; but t may be permitted to express a doubt whether it has the power to deprive a subject of his constitutional right to submit by petition of right a claim he has against the Crown. And if this be so, it is evident that the subject cannot be deprived of such a right impliedly by a statute which merely provides for the mode of addressing oneself to the discretionary power of a minister. In my opinion the two remedies are not incompatible, and therefore both exist. Having the liberty of choice, it will not be denied that the majority of claimants would prefer to put forward their legal right.\nIt was contended also on behalf of Her Majesty that the decision of the majority of this court, in the case of the Queen v. McFarlane[42], laid down the principle of law which should govern this case. The facts are, however, in my opinion, totally different. In that case, the suppliant prayed that Her Majesty should be held responsible for the tort of a public' officer, as may be seen by the following opinion given by Sir William Ritchie, Chief Justice, on the nature of McFarlane's claim, in these words:\nI am of opinion there was no contract or breach of contract to give to the suppliant any claim against the Crown, nor do the suppliants put forward their claim to relief on any such grounds. The claim in the petition is a tort pure and simple.\nThen as to the cases cited on the argument of Lane v. Cotton[43], and Whitfield v. Le Despencer[44]; I am of opinion that they are not applicable to the present case. In these cases it was attempted to make the Postmaster General responsible for the acts of his employees. In the first case the majority of the court were of opinion that the establishment of the post office was a branch of the public services of police, created by statute, as well for the purpose of raising a state revenue as for the convenience of the public, and that it was under the control and administration*of the Government. That the Postmaster General did not enter into any contract with individuals, and received no reward as in the case of a common carrier, proportionate to the number and value of the letters confided to his care, but a general remuneration from the Government in the form of a salary. In the second case, the claim was for certain monies stolen from a letter, and in that case Lord Mansfield says:\nThe postmaster has no hire, enters into no contract, carries on no merchandise or commerce. But the post office is a branch of revenue, and a branch of police, created by act of parliament. As a branch of revenue there are great receipts, but there is likewise a great surplus of benefit and advantage to the public arising from the fund. As a branch of police, it puts the whole correspondence of the country (for the exceptions are very trifling) under Government, and entrusts the management and direction of it to the Crown. There is no analogy, therefore, between the case of a postmaster and a common carrier.\nMr. Story, commenting on these observations, adds:\nIn truth in England and in America, the postmasters are mere public officers, appointed by the Government; and the contracts made by them officially are public and not private contracts.\nThis doctrine is now generally admitted. The same author adds[45]:\nIn the ordinary course of things, an agent contracting on behalf of the government or the public, is not personally bound by such contract, even though he would be by the terms of the contract, if it were an agency of a private nature.\nThis principle I find also admitted in the case of Dibley v Lord Palmerstone[46] as follows:\nThis is an action brought against the defendant, as Postmaster General, for an alleged breach of an implied undertaking, said to attach upon him in that character. With reference to this ground, it will be sufficient to advert to a class of cases too well known and established to be more particularly mentioned, and which in substance and result have established, that an action will not lie against a public agent for anything done by him in his public character or employment, and constituting a personal and particular liability.\nAs it is seen, these decisions do no more than confirm what has since become a general principle, as remarked by Mr. Story, that is, that a public officer is hot personally responsible for acts done in his official capacity. This is very different from the question to know whether or not Her Majesty is responsible for acts committed by her agents and constituting a breach of contract.\nThe law of the United States is also relied on; although in that country the maxim that \"the king can do no wrong\/' is not applicable, yet the principle of law which declares the irresponsibility of the State is also recognized there. See Story on Agency[47];\nIn the next place, as to the liability of public agents for torts or wrongs done in \"the course of their agency, it is plain that the government itself is not responsible for the misfeasance or wrongs, or negligences, or omissions of duty of the subordinate officers pr agents employed in the public service; for it does not undertake to guarantee to any person the fidelity of any of the officers or agents whom it employs, since that would involve it in all its operations in endless embarrassments and difficulties and losses, which would be subversive of the public interest, and indeed laches are never imputable to the government. Our next inquiry therefore is, whether the heads of its departments or other superior functionaries are in a different predicament. And here the doctrine is now firmly established (subject to the qualification hereafter stated) that public officers and agents are not responsible for the misfeasances or positive wrongs, or for the misfeasances or negligences, or omissions of duty, of the sub agents, or servants, or other persons properly employed by and under them in the discharge of their official duties. Thus, for example, it is now well settled, although it was formerly a matter of learned controversy, that the Postmaster General is not liable\/e for any default, or negligence, or misfeasance, of any of the deputies or clerks employed under him in his office. This exemption is founded upon the general ground that he is a public officer, and that the whole establishment of the Post Office being for public purposes, and the officers therein being appointed under public authority, it would be against public policy to make the head of the department personally responsible for the acts of all his subordinate officers, seeing it would be impracticable for him to supervise all their acts, and discouragement would thus be held out against such official employment in the public service.\nIt is true that the doctrine is there enunciated in such terms as would at first sight make us believe that the law in the American republic is upon this point more absolute than it is in Great Britain. In England, at all events, this doctrine is limited, as stated by Chitty, and also by the existence of the petition of right. But on reading attentively this passage of Story, it will be seen that this doctrine is only applicable to agents in the public service for acts committed in their official capacity, as forming part of the political government of the country. That it is an attribute of the State, as a political power, to be irresponsible, is a political truth not only in Great Britain and in the United States, but is common to all countries. But is this principle also true in civil matters? On this point this passage of Story has no bearing, for I find, on the contrary, that in the United States the responsibility of the State is expressly admitted in matters of contracts. They have there what is known as a special tribunal, viz.: the Court of Claims, whose jurisdiction, which has often been exercised, embraces claims for damages resulting from breach of contracts[48]. The Court of Claims shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine the following matters:\nFirst\u2014All claims founded upon any law of Congress, or upon any regulation of any executive department, or upon any contract express or implied, with the Government of the United States, and all claims which may be referred to it by either House of Congress.\nBy the terms of this section jurisdiction is given in matters of contract express or implied. It is evident, as stated in 21 vol., Albany Law Journal[49], that the right exists only when the claim is founded upon a contract made with a person duly authorized, or on an implied contract when such a contract can be implied from the acts of a duly authorized person, And it is equally clear, that this section does not make the Government of the United States responsible for the wrongful acts nor even for contracts either expressed or implied made by parties, however exalted their position may be, if not duly authorized. But this section does not relieve the Government from being liable for damages resulting in consequence of a breach of contract. And the interpretation which has been put upon it by the Court of Claims, as may be ascertained by referring to the long list of cases reported in the reports of the Court of Claims, and which are given under the word \"damages,\" all prove that this liability has been admitted and acted upon.\nIt is manifest therefore that the responsibility of the State for a breach of contract is as well recognized and acted upon by the law and jurisprudence of the United States as it has been by the decisions in England. Now the respondent in this case relies on that responsibility, and does not put forward any pretension that could extend that doctrine. In order to see whether it is applicable to the present case, we must now examine whether the damages claimed arose in consequence of a breach of contract.\nThe respondent has alleged and proved that when he presented himself as a passenger on the railway in question he obtained from the duly authorized person to that effect, in consideration of a sum of money, equal to the tariff rate fixed by the Government, a passenger's ticket from Charlottetown to Sour is Show, was there not a contract, by this fact alone, entered into between Her Majesty and the suppliant? Has not Her Majesty obliged herself to carry this respondent on said railway on the ordinary conditions fixed by law on a contract for the carriage of passengers?\nWhat is a contract at common law?\nA contract is an agreement upon sufficient consideration to do or not to do a particular thing[50]. A contract in legal contemplation is an agreement between two parties for the doing or the not doing of some particular thing[51].\nIn the note at the foot of the page I find also the following definition:\n\"A contract is an agreement in which a party undertakes to do or not to do a particular thing\"[52].\nIn Campbell's law of negligence I find the following definition:\nThe English law makes no attempt to classify obligations arising out of contracts, but contemplates all contracts as moulded on a single type, namely, a promise grounded on a consideration. Where obligation is contracted by deed, consideration is presumed. But in other cases, the question whether or not a contract is enforceable by law generally resolves itself into the question whether or not the promise to be enforced is grounded upon a good legal consideration.\nIn the present case, these two essential elements for the existence of a contract of conveyance are to be found, on the part of McLeod, a good and valid consideration, given in exchange for the service demanded, by paying the railway fare according to the tariff,\u2014on the part of the Government, the handing over of a passenger ticket as evidence of the promise to convey the respondent from Charlottetown to Souris. I should not have deemed necessary to refer at length to these elementary principles, had not the learned counsel for Her Majesty, on his argument, strongly contended that the right of action for damages resulting from an accident is founded in such a case on a tort and not on a contract, Although, according to the definitions above cited, there can be no doubt as to the nature of the obligation which results from the purchasing of a passengers' ticket for a journey over a railway, it may not be amiss to refer to the decisions in cases in England, in order to ascertain what they decide as to the character of such a transaction.\nIn Mytton v. The Midland Ry. Co.[53], the plaintiff, who had purchased a passengers' ticket from the South Wales Ry. Co, from Newport to Birmingham and lost his portmanteau while travelling on the Midland Ry. Co., and with which latter company the South Wales Ry. Co. had connections, sued the Midland Ry. Co. for the value of the articles contained in his portmanteau. It was there decided that the purchase of the ticket created a contract, and that the contract was only with the company that had sold the ticket and received the pi ice, and not with the Midland Ry. Co., which was in accordance with certain arrangements, to receive only a proportionate part of the money. Baron Martin thus states his opinion on this point:\nUpon these facts the only question is, whether there was any contract between the plaintiff and the Midland Ry. Co., or whether the contract was not an entire contract with the South Wales Ry. Co. to convey the plaintiff the whole distance from Newport to Birmingham. We are of opinion that there was but one contract with the South Wales Ryo Co., and not with the Midland Ry. Co. There was one sum paid and one ticket given for the entire journey, and there was no evidence whatever of any privity of the Midland Ry. Co. to that contract, except that by arrangement with the South Wales Ry. Co., they conveyed on their line passengers booked from Newport to Birmingham.\nCockburn, C.J., in the case of Tatton v. Great Western Ry. Co.[54], says:\nThe question therefore is, whether the present is an action of contract, or on the case., Now whatever may be the distinction between an obligation arising out of a contract and a duty imposed by the common law on persons entering into a contract, it is impossible to refer to cases to which our attention has been called, without seeing that they establish that a duty was imposed upon the defendants in r the present case by the custom of the realm, so soon as they entered into the contract with the plaintiff, and independently of the terms of the contract itself. The plaintiff might, had he thought fit, have; brought his action on the contract, but he was also entitled to sue the defendants for the breach of the common law duty.\nCrompton, J., in the same case, appears to have expressed a different opinion, by stating that an action against a common carrier is in substance an action of tort, and he relies on the decision given in the case of Pozzi v. Shipton[55], and to which he refers as follows:\nBut ever since Pozzi v. Shipton it has been settled law that an action against a common carrier, as such, is substantially an action of tort on the case, founded on-his common law duty to carry safely, independently of the particular contract which he makes.\nNow, this opinion is not, as a matter of fact, opposed to that of Cockburn, C J., who says that when there is a contract, the action can either be brought on the contract, or in tort on the case. In the case of Pozzi v. Shipton, the court did not hold, that whether there was a contract or not, the action was necessarily one of tort. What was there decided was, that even had there been no contract, the common carrier, according to the custom of the realm, i.e., the common law, was responsible for his negligence. I find in this latter case nothing opposed to the opinion expressed by Cockburn, C. J., as may be seen by the following extract from Patteson, J's. judgment[56], when speaking of the declaration:\nIt does not state that the goods were delivered to the defendants at their special instance and request, nor contain any other delegation necessarily applicable to an express contract only, or even pointing to an express contract only; and it is sufficient for the present purpose, if the language in which it is couched is consistent with its being founded on the general custom as to carriers. In the case of Alton et al v. The Midland Ry. Co.[57] it was also decided that the purchasing of a ticket created a contract between the company and the passenger. Erie, C. J., says:\nOn the face of the declaration it appears that the relation between the defendants and Baxter arose out of a contract, for it alleges that Baxter was received by the defendants as a passenger to be carried by them upon their railway for hire and reward.\nShearman and Redfield, in their work on the law of negligence, after remarking that the obligations on the part of the carrier of passengers do not solely depend on a contract, but are in great measure founded on the provisions to be found in the common law as well as in the statutes passed for the protection of human life, conclude that these obligations are in the nature of a contract. At No. 261[58] they say:\nNevertheless the legal obligations of a carrier being called into activity by the action of e ach person separately who offers himself as a passenger, are in the nature of a contract, and no one can complain of their breach except the person with whom, or for whose benefit the contract was made, or can rarely be other than the passenger himself.\nThere can be no doubt, that according to these English authorities it is well settled in England that the purchase of a passenger ticket constitutes a contract between the buyer and seller. On this contract, although the parties are silent thereon, the law engrafts an obligation to convey the passenger with sufficient care, skill and foresight to ensure his safety. Mr. Campbell, in his work on the law of negligence (1), after having treated of the responsibility of a carrier in the case of a latent defect in a tyre, which could not be attributed to any fault of the manufacturer, and which could hot have been discovered before the accident, and after having cited the opinion of the judges in the case of Redhead v. The Midland Ry. Co., exonerating in such a case the company of all responsibility, continues as follows:\nAnd the judges were unanimously of opinion that there is no contract either of general warranty or insurance (such as that in the contract of a common carrier of goods), or of limited warranty (as to the vehicle being sufficient) entered into by the carrier of passengers, and the contract of such a carrier and the obligations undertaken by him are to take due care (including in him the use of skill and foresight) to carry a passenger safely.\nIn No. 41, after comparing the responsibility of a company to that of an individual who undertakes to erect a building for a public exhibition, as in the case of Francis v. Cockerell[59], the author adds the following observations:\nThis last case and the case of Redhead between them very clearly define the degree and kind of negligence which is sufficient to infer liability in the contract to carry passengers by fast conveyance. And it comes to this, that the carrier is bound to use the most exact diligence, and is answerable for any negligence however slight, and not only for his own personal default, but for the default of all employed by him, or from whom he has purchased work done or skill employed upon the thing. He is also bound to use such precautions for the preventions of accidents as a reasonable person having the management of the line would adopt for such purpose. Daniel v. Metropolitan Ry. Co.[60].\nWe find also the same doctrine propounded in the case of Pym v. The Great Northern Ry. Co.[61], where the accident was caused by a defective rail.\nNow, does not the obligation contained in the contract, although implied, to carry passengers safely, form part of the contract as well as if it was expressly stated? And when an accident happens proving want of care or diligence, is there not a breach of the obligation to carry safely? True, it is negligence which causes the accident and which gives rise to the action for damages, but the origin of the action is nevertheless founded upon the contract, for a breach of one of its essential conditions, as in ordinary actions brought for breach of contract.\nI admit that there exists an action independently of any contract, but it would be illogical to say that it is not founded on the contract when such a contract is proved.\nIf in the public interest the common law imposes on the carrying of passengers without any contract the obligation to carry safely, does it not follow as a necessary consequence that a breach of this duty through negligence entitles the party injured to claim damages? And in such a case if it is not a breach of contract, there is a breach of duty, for which the same remedy exists, as is shown by the following authorities. In Bretherton v. Wood[62], Dallas, C. J., in delivering the judgment of the Court of Error says:\nThis action is on the case against a common carrier upon whom a duty is imposed by the custom of the realm, in other words by the common Jaw, to carry and convey their goods, or passengers safely and securely, so that by their negligence or default must no injury or damage happen. A breach of this duty is a breach of the law, and for this breach an action lies founded on the common law, which action wants not the aid of a contract to support it.\nThe same doctrine is laid down in the following cases: Marshall v. The York & Newcastle Ry. Co.[63]; Pozzi v Shipton[64]; Veppin v. Shepherd[65]; and other cases cited at p. 296 of the volume of the Law Journal above cited.\nBrown, on the Law of Railways[66], says:\nAs carriers of passengers the company are bound, in the absence of any special contract, to exercise a due care and diligence, but they are not liable for accidents in the absence of negligence.\nThey are liable for an accident arising from a defect in the carriages which can be detected by an ordinary reasonably proper and careful examination, but not for a latent defect which a careful and thorough examination would not disclose.\nThe liability for injury to a passenger from negligence does not depend upon express contract.\nAddison on Torts[67]:\nThe action for negligence proceeds upon the idea of an obligation on the part of the defendant towards the plaintiff to use care, and a breach of that obligation to the plaintiff's injury.\nThese authorities and numerous others in the same sense clearly demonstrate that in order to create the liability there need be no express contract. In the interest of the public the liability exists in favor of persons, who, although they have not purchased any ticket, are lawfully on the train of a railway company. But we must not conclude that in all cases negligence is the sole foundation for the right of action. No; it is negligence as violation of contract or duty.\nBrown (idem)[68], after referring again to the well settled rule that a company engaged in carrying or conveying goods or passengers is bound to exercise due care and diligence, adds: \"But they are not liable of the absence of negligence.\" What is meant by this restriction? Is it anything else than declaring that a company shall not be liable when an accident happens through no fault of the company? In other words, is it not just admitting the exception in favor of accidents caused by vis major and latent defects, as would be the case in ordinary contracts between individuals? This exception from liability is just as expressly recognized by the English law as it is by all civil codes.\nNeither must we conclude that because this doctrine has been well established, an action for damages cannot originally be founded upon a contract, but can only be supported on the fact that the company has been negligent. The first part of the passage I have read from the above text-writer is equally applicable to the latter part, and the only true conclusion to come to is the one which was arrived at in the case of Tattan v. The Great Western Railway[69], to wit, that an action for damages may, according to the circumstances of the case, either be brought on the contract or based entirely on the negligence of the company. In order to avoid all liability in this case, the learned counsel for Her Majesty contend that the breach of contract or breach of duty is nothing more than a simple tort or wrongful act, and thus claim the right of invoking the maxim \"The king can do no wrong.\" But I cannot adopt that view. The authorities have expressly made a clear distinction between the two cases. For example, Addhon on Torts[70], \"Distinction between contracts and torts;\"\nWhen the foundation of the action is a contract, and no right to sue exists independently of the contract, the action, though in form ex delicto, is in substance an action ex contractu, and the plaintiff must recover more than \u00a320, or obtain a certificate rule or order in order to entitle himself to costs in the Superior Courts. On the other hand, when the foundation of the action is a wrongful act, as, for instance, a tort to the right of property and not a breach of contract, the action is in fact founded on tort. Where goods are delivered to a common carrier to be carried, and are lost on the road, the action against the common carrier is founded on contract; for, where an action is brought against a common carrier for breach of the common law duty to carry safely, the action is founded on a contract, and is not an action ex delicto for negligence, and therefore if the plaintiff does not recover more than \u00a310 he is not entitled to costs,\nIn the present case the duty being imposed on Her Majesty by a contract, it is a breach of that contract that has taken place by the negligence which was the cause of the accident for which the respondent claims damages. The action must therefore be considered as being one ex contractu and not ex delicto. If Her Majesty is not to be held liable in such a case, when will any responsibility be east upon Her Majesty? If we adopt the contention of the learned counsel for the appellant, the Crown can never be held liable. For, after all, a breach of contract must always be the result of negligence, or omission to do something voluntarily or maliciously. If malice is relied on, I admit that in such a case Her Majesty cannot be made liable, but if she is not responsible for negligence or omission to do something under a contract then the right to petition is a mere delusion. In the case of Thomas v. Queen, the contrary doctrine is certainly laid down. For on what was founded the suppliant's claim? Although he alleged that he had fulfilled all the conditions which he had undertaken to fulfil, the amount to which he claimed he was entitled to had neither been determined upon or paid. Evidently what he complained of was the negligence to do that which the Crown had contracted to do, and in that case it was not found to be derogatory to the dignity of the crown, nor was any principle of law supposed to be violated by granting the suppliant's prayer. This decision, which has not been in any way impugned by any other decision, settles, in my opinion, this question as to the responsibility of the Crown for negligence in matters of contract. And it also decides that it is by petition of right that the subject can obtain compensation in such cases, and therefore disposes, in my opinion, of all the questions raised on the present appeal in favor of respondent, for it, at the same time negatives the extraordinary proposition advanced by the learned counsel for the appellant, that Her Majesty is not answerable in the present case by petition of right, because the control and management of the government railways are by statute under the direction of the Minister of Railways and Canals. In virtue of 42 Vice.? this minister is the head of a Department of State as much as the Secretary of War is in England; and within the scope of his authority he acts not for himself but for the government of Her Majesty. It was not personally with Her Majesty that Thomas had contracted in respect of his invention, but with the 'Secretary of the War Department, This is the manner in which this ground of demurrer was disposed of in that case:\nIndeed the framers of the Act (Petition of Right Act, 23 and 24 Vic. c. 34) appeared to have considered its chief title to consist in the applicability of its improved procedure to petitions on contracts between subjects and the various public departments of the government so vastly on the increase in recent years, both in numbers and I importance, whilst petitions of right in respect of specific lands or chattels for the public will be exceedingly rare.\nHaving considered the question of the responsibility of Her Majesty in matters of contract, and also in connection with the duty imposed by law on the carrier of passengers, it now remains for me to examine whether Her Majesty is not also liable in virtue of the statute laws passed in reference to the Government railways of Canada. I will at once state that I readily admit that the Government of the Dominion of Canada, when exercising its legislative authority over railways belonging either to private companies or to the Dominion, is free from all responsibility. But this irresponsibility ceases the moment the Government undertakes to work a railway as an ordinary company would. In such a case the Government ceases to exercise its political authority and undertakes an ordinary civil transaction, and in such transaction is not above, but under and subject to the ordinary rules of the common law. This would have been the legal and logical position to hold the Government to be in, when it undertook to do the business of a common carrier of passengers, without any statutory declaration to that effect, as was held by the Supreme Court of Belgium, when the government of that country began to work their railways. But our Government, in order to remove all doubt on this subject, has thought proper to define and limit its responsibility in the working of its railways.\nThat the Government should be considered as a common carrier of passengers does not seem to me to admit of a doubt according to the following definitions. Shearman and Redfield[71]:\nAny person or corporation making it a regular business to carry persons for hire or advantage of any kind is a common carrier between the places to and from which he is accustomed to transport persons, The owner of a stage, a railroad car, a ship or ferry boat, is, if he carries on such a business by means of such vehicles, a common carrier of persons.\nThis is certainly what the Government does when working its railways.\nNow, then, what responsibility attaches under our statutes and the regulations passed by order in council for the working of said railways. It has been admitted that the Prince Edward Island Railway upon which the accident happened, causing damage to the respondent, is one of the railways which is under the control and management of the Minister of Railways and Canals. By 41 Vic., ch. 3, sanctioned on the 16th April, 1878, the railway acts are made applicable to this railway. Since then there has been a consolidation of the railway acts, and the Consolidated Railway Act 42 Vic. c. 9 was passed and sanctioned on the 15th May, 1879.\nThe provisions of the first portion of this act, from the 5th section to the 34 section inclusive, are declared to be applicable to the Intercolonial Railway, also the property of the Government, in so far as they are not contrary to the provisions contained in the special acts relating to this railway.\nThe Act 41 Vic. c. 3, being repealed by the new consolidated act, it was declared by sec. 102 that the provisions of the consolidated act were substituted for those of the act repealed.\nSection 101 is even more precise, for it says that the whole act, with the exception of sections 29 and 34, are applicable to the Prince Edward Island railway. Sec. 29 having reference to certain statistics, and section St relating to certain reports to be made to the minister. Among the provisions of this Act which are applicable to the Intercolonial as well as to the Prime Edward Island railway are to be found those in sec. 25 regulating the working of railways.\nI will only cite those sections which declare that the working of these railways by the government, shall be a business of common carrier, and also those which have any bearing upon the responsibility of government in such case.\nSec. 25, sub. s. 2, is as follows:\nThe trains shall be started and run at regular hours to be fixed by public notice, and shall furnish sufficient accommodation for the transportation of all such passengers and goods as are within a reasonable time previous thereto offered for transportation.\n3. Such passengers and goods shall be taken, transported and discharged at, from and to such places on due payment of the toll, freight or fare legally authorized therefor.\n4. The party aggrieved by any neglect or refusal on the premises, shall have an action against the company, from which action the company shall not be relieved, by any notice, conditions or declarations, of the damages from any negligence or omissions of the company or of its servants.\n13. any person injured whilst on the platform of car, or on any baggage, wood, or freight car, in violation of the printed regulations posted up at the time in a conspicuous place inside of the passenger cars then in the train, shall have no claim for the injury, pro' vided room inside of such passenger cars sufficient for the proper accommodation of the passengers was furnished at the time.\nThese sub-sections 4 and 13 clearly demonstrate that it was not the intention of the Government to work these railways on a different basis than that of railways of private companies. Evidently they have subjected themselves to all the obligations and to the responsibility attached to private companies, by declaring i these sections applicable to both government and private railways, and in order to make this plainer, if we replace the word \"company\" that is to be found in these sections by the word \"Government,\" and which should be done in virtue of sections 2, 4, 101 and 102, there can be no question as to the result. Thus, for example, sub-sec. 4 should read as follows:\n\"Any person aggrieved by any neglect or refusal in the premises, shall have an action against the Government from which action the Government shall not be relieved, &c., &c.\"\nIt is evident also that by sec. 13 the Government is made responsible for injury to the person, for by claiming exemption from all responsibility for damage or injury caused to a person standing on the platform, it was in fact admitting the general principle of responsibility. This provision is also to be found in the orders in council regulating the working of the Government railways.\nTo my mind, it is sufficient to read these sections to convince one on this question of responsibility. If necessary to add to this, 1 will refer to sec. 27, also applicable to the Prince Edward Island Railway, which regulates and limits the right of action; it reads as follows:\nAll suits for indemnity for any damage or injury sustained by reason of the railway shall be instituted within six months after the time of such supposed damage sustained.\nThis section, as well as the preceding sections cited, whenever they are applicable either to the Intercolonial Railway or the Prince Edward Island Railway, in virtue of secs. 2, 4, 101 and 102 should be read as if the words \"Government of Canada\" were there specially inserted. As is seen, not only is the responsibility of the Government duly recognized, but the right of action, which is the natural sequence of such responsibility, is also provided for Then, again, notwithstanding that I consider it sufficiently established by the above sections, I might refer to the statute passed in 1881 by the parliament of Canada entitled \"an Act to consolidate and amend the law relating to Government railways.\" This act contains in a great measure a re-enactment of the clauses of the General Railway Act of 1879. The provisions relating to passengers journeying on said railways are identical in both acts, as can be readily ascertained by comparing sees. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 13 of the act of 1879 with sees. 71, 72, 73, 74 and 81 of the latter act. Although the act of 1881 came into force only after the accident in question in this case, it may be looked at to discover what was the legislative interpretation of the act of 1879, as to government responsibility. In the act of 1879, as the sections which dealt with the question of responsibility only mentioned companies, it was necessary to refer to secs. 2, 4, 101 and 102 to find out whether they also could be applicable to the Government. In sec. 4 and other sections having reference to the Government, the language used is made clearer by stating that the \"department\" shall be liable in all cases mentioned, and, as I have already said, they are the same as those mentioned in the act of 1879. In sec. 123, which repeals the act of 1879, it is enacted that such portions of the new act as do not essentially differ from the provisions contained in the old act, can be referred to. This section has so much bearing upon this view of the case that I will cite it at length.\nAnd provided also that anything heretofore done in pursuance of or contravention of any provision in any act heretofore in force and applying to government railway, which is repealed without maternal additions in this act, may be alleged or referred to as having been done in pursuance of or in contravention of the act in which such provision was made or of this act; and every such provision shall be construed, not as a new enactment, but as having and as having had the same effect, and from the same time as under such act, and every reference in any former act or document, to any such act, or to any provisions in any such act, shall hereafter be construed as a reference to this act or to the corresponding provisions in this act.\nIn virtue of this section, the provisions contained in sections 74 and 81, which are in substance the same as those of sections 4 and 13 of the act of 1879, can be referred to as applicable to the present case, and in any case can be relied on to establish the applicability of the principle of responsibility when working railways.\nFor these reasons I have come to the conclusion that the maxim \"the king can do no wrong\" is literally true in a limited sense, i.e., when the political authority of the sovereign is in question; that whenever the sovereign enters into a contract, either personally or by his duly authorized agent, he is subject to the laws relating to contracts; for all authors who have commented on this maxim agree that the sovereign is under and not above the laws, and is bound by them equally with the subjects; that it is true that in consequence of the immunity attached to his person, the sovereign cannot be summoned before the ordinary civil tribunals of the land to fulfil the obligations of his contracts, or to restore lands or chattels, or to pay a just debt, but, nevertheless, in all such cases the maxim must be accepted in a restricted sense, viz., subject to the constitutional right of every subject to claim from his sovereign, by petition, the payment of a just debt, the fulfilment of the obligations of a contract, or the delivery of lands or chattels, or unliquidated damages. True, this petition can only be adjudicated upon after leave has been granted and the fiat \"let right be done\" signed, but the right to the petition, which is founded on ex debito Justiti\u0153, is in reality the same as the right of action of a subject against another subject; that a petition of right will lie for unliquidated damages for breach of a contract made in the name of or in the interest of the sovereign or the Government by persons duly authorized to that effect; that public departments are but agents of the crown, and when acting for the crown in matters of contract render the Crown liable, as has been decided in the case of Thomas v. The Secretary of the War Department; that in the present case a contract was entered into, by the purchase of a ticket, between the Government of Canada and the respondent, and to that contract the law implies the obligation to convey the passenger with ordinary care, diligence and skill for his personal safety; that under the circumstances disclosed by the evidence in this case there has been a breach of that contract which entitles the respondent to claim damages; that, moreover, as the common law, independent of any contract, imposes upon the common carrier of passengers the, duty to convey safely and securely, and renders him liable for any damage caused by his negligence, there has been in the present case a breach of that duty, giving to the respondent the further and equal right to petition for the damages he has suffered; that the Government when working railways for gain and hire is subject to the same responsibility as a common carrier of goods and passengers; that the consolidated railway act of 1879 and the act of 1881, consolidating the laws relating to government railways, have expressly recognized this responsibility; that 33 Vic., ch. 23 by giving to the injured person the option of addressing himself to the discretionary power of the Minister of Railways and Canals in order to obtain in the particular mode provided, redress for any damage suffered by him, has not thereby taken away his constitutional right to make his claim by way of petition of right, and that the respondent having the option of choosing his remedy, he, in this case, is justified' in relying upon his petition of right, and this appeal ought to be dismissed.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nIn giving the judgment of the Exchequer Court in this case I laid down certain propositions as I thought affecting the positions of the different parties to this suit. I may possibly have laid down some of them a little too strongly\u2014stronger than I intended. The legal obligation with regard t\u00a9 the carrying of passengers is well understood by those who have turned their attention to the subject. The obligation and the contract entered into by a railway company when issuing a ticket, is to convey the party from one point to another safely. That is part of the contract, but it goes further and includes a guarantee against negligence. It is part of the contract itself. Rut we are told when negligence comes in, that the contract is not to be performed, inasmuch as the Queen cannot be assumed to be guilty of negligence, and with regard to the negligence of her servants, the same doctrine applies. But I take it, there are two kinds of breach of contract, there may be a tortious breach as well as one that is not tortious, but the mere fact that a breaches of contract is tortious does not relieve the Crown from the breach of a contract by its servants. I take it that the principle applicable to those questions arising between companies and those they engage to carry, should be held applicable to the Crown when a contract has been entered into. How then are companies relieved from liability if an accident occurs and parties are injured? Only by showing why they were not only guilty of negligence; by showing that it was some thing over which they had no control; and that only. The absence of proof of negligence does not necessarily relieve a railway company. Sometimes it is assumed from the peculiarity of the accident which produced the injury. For instance, if two railway trains owned by the same company running on its own line come into collision, and thereby injure passengers, it is not necessary for a party to show where the negligence was, and which train caused the damage.\nIt is assumed the company being answerable for the conduct of both trains, the collision was the result of negligence. Then, it is not necessary in an action against a company to prove negligence at all: all that is necessary, is to prove circumstances under which negligence can be fairly presumed by a jury. Now, I consider that is the question which is involved when a company issues a railway ticket to a party to carry him safely. But we are told that this would negative our decision, in The Queen v. Macfarlane[72]. Possibly it might, but possibly a decision the other way would negative one or two other judgments of this court. In The Queen v. McLean 8f Roger, which was an action brought to recover damages for violation of contract, this court, by a majority, decided that through the negligence or improper conduct of the Queen's officers, the work was not given to the contractors to perform according to their contract; and that, therefore, they were entitled to recover damages. How then can it be said that if the Queen is answerable under the circumstances in that case for the improper conduct of her officers and subordinates, she is not to be answerable in every like case? There was another case tried before my learned brother Taschereau in Quebec[73]. It was an action brought to recover damages under similar circumstances. A party undertook to take all the rails imported for the Government at Montreal, from ship there, and deliver them on the wharf at Lachine. By the negligence and improper conduct of the parties, who were acting there for the Government, a portion (about one-half) of these rails were transported by other means. The contractor brought his action in the Exchequer Court, and my learned brother decided, I think correctly, that the contract was broken; and that the contractor was entitled to damages, and judgment was given in his favor for such damages for, I think, $1,500. I cannot distinguish that case from this. If the Queen is answerable for the fulfilment of a contract, is it necessary to inquire whether it is through negligence or the wilful misconduct of the officers that a party sustained damage through a breach of it?\nIf the contract is broken or violated, does it make it any the less broken or violated because it was negligence that caused it? My learned brother Fournier has referred to the statute which provides certain exemptions from liability, which, however, do not touch this case. I take it there is in the statute making such exemptions a legislative acknowledgment of liability; but even without that we know that in England a foreign sovereign cannot be sued, nor a foreign minister, but there are many cases which show that if the foreign sovereign sends his ship into England and undertakes to take freight for payment, he becomes liable to be sued in England. Why? Because he puts himself in the place of a common carrier, and, therefore, although his prerogative right in one case shields him, the very moment he steps away from his prerogative position and becomes a common carrier, the law follows him and makes him answerable for all his contracts the same as all other common carriers. Apply that principle to this case and what have we? The Government, in the Queen's name, undertakes for hire to carry passengers, and convey them safely, for everyone must admit that failure to do so is neglect, and we are told because the servants of the Queen negligently managed her business, the party who was injured thereby cannot recover. It is not a recovery for mere negligence that is sought for in this case. If there were no contract, of course the Queen is not answerable, and the cases referred to are those where actions were brought for mere negligence without any contract. Therefore, they do not apply to this case. If this suit were against a company, it is admitted the company would have to respond for the negligence of its servants, but we are told the Queen is not answerable for the misconduct of her servants in such a case. But I take it the contract here is not unilateral, and that there is a liability to others under it on the part of the Queen. It is her duty to fulfil her contracts, is it any answer for the Queen any more than for a company to say, \"My servants were guilty of negligence and other improper conduct, and therefore I am not bound to fulfil my contract?\" It appears to me the reasoning is all on the side of liability. I have considered this case very fully, to some extent before I gave my judgment in the Exchequer Court, and since very fully, with a view to changing my opinion, if I could do so conscientiously, and coming to the same conclusion as my learned brothers. I have not been able to do so, but, on the contrary, consider that the verdict I gave in the first place is the right one. I think it should be held to be the law of the land, that where the Government of the country enters into contracts it should be obliged to keep them, and if it fails to do so, it should be as amenable to the law as private parties. I consider for the foregoing reasons and those appearing in my previous judgment that the appeal should be dismissed with costs. TASCHEREAU, J., who was not present at the argument took no part in the judgment.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nThe suppliant's claim in this case is stated in his petition of right to be founded upon a contract for the carriage of the suppliant for hire and reward, upon the Prince Edward Island Railway, alleged to have been entered into with the suppliant by Her Majesty, whereby, as is alleged, Her Majesty contracted with the suppliant and promised him, in consideration of certain hire and reward paid by him, to carry him safely and securely upon the said railway from a station called Charlottetown to another station called Sow is upon the said railway, and the breach alleged is that Her Majesty, disregarding the duty which is alleged to have arisen from such her alleged contract and promise, did not carry the suppliant safely and securely upon the said railway upon his said journey, but so negligently and unskilfully conducted, managed, and maintained the said railway and the train upon which the suppliant was a passenger, in the course of his said journey, that he was greatly and permanently injured in body and health, &c., &c.\nUpon behalf of the suppliant it was contended that; as the petition thus presented the suppliant's claim as founded upon a contract, no objection could be entertained founded upon the principle, which was admitted to be established by authority, that Her Majesty could not be made liable for an injury occasioned either by the negligence of the persons having in charge the maintenance of the road bed, or of the persons in charge of the engine and train running upon it.\nIn actions of this nature between an injured person and a railway company the gist and gravamen of the action, whether it is framed in contract or in tort, is the negligence and misconduct of the defendants, or of their servants, for whom they are responsible. The action, although in form it be founded upon a contract, is in substance and reality for a negligent breach of a duty arising out of the alleged contract, so that Her Majesty could not be made liable by the mere fact that the pleader has framed his complaint as upon a contract, if she would not be liable under the like circumstances, if it had been framed in tort. Her Majesty's liability can not depend upon the pleader's choice as to the form of the complaint; no authority was cited in support of such a contention, and in principle it cannot be sustained.\nIn the Metropolitan Railway Co. v. Jackson[74], Lord Blackburn, in the House of Lords, says:\nIn all cases to recover damages for a personal injury against Railway Companies, the plaintiff has to prove first that there was, on the part of the defendants, a neglect of the duty cast upon them under the circumstances, and second that the damage he has sustained was the consequence of that neglect of duty.\nIf Her Majesty could not be made liable in tort for the negligence of the persons who caused the injury to the suppliant of which he complains, it is impossible that she should become liable from the fact that the negligence which is said to have caused the injury is alleged to be in breach of a duty arising out of a contract.\nBut in truth there never was any such contract between the suppliant and Her Majesty as is alleged in the petition of right. It is not pretended that there was any express contract, but it is contended that the force and effect of certain sections of the Consolidated Railway Act of 1879 is to make the Dominion Government, and Her Majesty, as the executive head of that Government, common carriers, and that upon receipt by the agents and servants of the Government of the suppliant's railway fare, and upon his becoming a passenger upon the railway, a contract is to be implied to the effect that the Government shall and will carry the suppliant safely, and that he shall not suffer any damage or injury upon his journey upon the railway for which he had so become a passenger: and Thomas v. The Queen[75] is relied upon in support of this contention; but that case relates to contracts of a wholly different nature from that which is relied upon as existing here, namely, express contracts made with officers of the Government upon behalf of Her Majesty for the payment of reward for services rendered to the Government. I have already, in McFarlane v. The Queen[76], expressed my opinion to be that the argument upon which the existence of such a contract as is relied upon is rested is fallacious.\nThe facts disclose no contract whatever between the suppliant and Her Majesty.\nThe sections of the act of 1879, which are relied upon are section 101 and section 25, sub-sections 2, 3 and 4. The 101st section declared that all the provisions of the act of 1879, except those contained in the 29th to the 34th both inclusive, shall be held to have applied to Prince Edward Island from the time of the passing of 41st Vict. ch. 3, unless declared to be applicable only to one or more of the provinces composing the Dominion. By sec. 25, sub-sections 2, 3 and 4, it was enacted that\u2014\n2nd. Trains should be started and run at regular hours to be fixed by public notice and should furnish sufficient accommodation for the transportation of all such passengers and goods as are within a reasonable time previous thereto offered for transportation at the place of starting, and at the junctions of other railways and at usual stopping places established for receiving and discharging way passengers and goods from the train. 3rd. Such passengers and goods shall be taken, transported and discharged, at, from and to such places on the due payment of the toll, freight or fare legally authorized therefor,\n4th. The party aggrieved by any neglect or refusal in the premises shall have an action therefor against the company, from which action the company shall not be relieved by any notice, condition or declaration, if the damage arises from any negligence or omission of the company or of its servants.\nNow, as it appears to me, it is obvious that, apart from the act, no obligation to carry passengers or goods, even upon receipt of tolls, freight, or fare in consideration of such carriage, could ever be imposed upon the Government by the common law, as it could upon a trading corporation assuming the duties and responsibilities of common carriers for reward; assuming, therefore, the 25th section and its sub-sections to be by the 101st section made to apply to the working of the Prince Edward Island Railway by the Government and not by a company, although it seems to me to be difficult so to read the 4th subsection, still the obligation imposed in that case upon the Government by the 3rd sub-section would be a duty imposed by the act of Parliament and not one arising from any contract, the neglect or refusal to discharge which would be what is made by the 4th subsection actionable; so that whatever may have been intended by applying the 25th section and the subsections, assuming them to apply to the working of this railway under the control and management of the Government, no proceeding by petition of right against Her Majesty can be authorized by the 3rd sub-section of section 25, for what is there made actionable is the tort or wrong consisting in the neglect or refusal to discharge a statutory duty imposed upon the Government and not the breach of any contract; moreover, with this act of 1879 must be read the provisions of 33 Vic. c. 23, which enacted among other things, that if any person should have any claim against the Government of Canada for alleged direct or consequent: damages arising out of any death or any injury to person or property on any railway, canal, or public work under the control and management of the Government of Canada, such person might give notice in writing of such claim to the Secretary of State for Canada, stating the particulars thereof and how the same has arisen, which notice the Secretary of State should refer to the head of the department with respect to which the claim has so arisen, who should then have power to tender satisfaction, and, if it be not accepted, to refer the claim to one or more of the official, arbitrators appointed under the act respecting the public works of Canada, and the said official arbitrators should then have power to hear and award upon such claim, and that all the provisions of the act respecting the public work 3 of Canada with respect to cases referred to arbitration and to the powers of the arbitrators, and proceedings by or before them, should apply to such claim, to the head of the department concerned and to the said official arbitrators respectively: Provided always, that nothing in the said act 33 Vic. c. 23 should be construed as making it imperative on the Government to entertain any claim under said act, but that the head of the department concerned should refer to arbitration such claims only as he might be instructed so to refer by the Governor in Council.\nThe Act 44 Vict. ch. 25, entitled \"An Act to amend and consolidate the laws relating to Government Railways,\" was also relied upon by the learned counsel for the suppliant. This act was passed after the happening of the accident at which the suppliant sustained the injuries complained of; assuming it, however, to have application to the present case, its provisions do not in my judgment support the suppliant's contention. The 3rd sub-sec. of the 27th section of this act makes provision for the case of any person having any supposed claim arising out of any death or any injury to person or property on any such railway, similar to the provision, above extracted, which had in like case been made by 33rd Vict. ch, 23. Sections 65 to 84 inclusive make provision for the working of the Government Railways. Section 72 makes provision for the Government Railways identical with the provision by the 2nd sub-section of section 25 of the Consolidated Railway Act of 1879, and section 73 is identical with sub-sec. 3 of section 25 of the act of 1879. Section 74 enacts that:\nThe department shall not be relieved from liability by any notice, condition or declaration in case of any damage arising from any negligence, omission or default of any officer, employee or servant of the department; nor shall any officer, employee or servant be relieved from liability by any notice, condition or declaration if the damage arise from his negligence or omission.\nBy sec. 78 it is enacted that: every locomotive engine shall be furnished with a bell of at least 30 lbs. weight and with a steam whistle; and by section 79, that: the bell shall be rung and the whistle sounded at the distance of at least 80 rods from every place where the railway crosses any highway, and be kept ringing or be sounded at short intervals until the engine has crossed such highway; and the department shall be liable for all damages sustained by any person by reason of any neglect thereof, and one half of such damages shall be chargeable to and deducted from any salary due to the engineer having charge of such engine and neglecting to sound the whistle or ring the bell as aforesaid, or shall be collected from such engineer. By sec. 81 it is enacted that any person injured while on the platform of a car, or on any baggage, wood or freight car, in violation of the printed regulations posted up at the time in a conspicuous place inside of the passenger cars then in the train, shall have no claim for the injury, provided room inside of such passenger cars sufficient for the proper accommodation of the passengers was furnished T at the time. Section 64 was relied upon as enacting that,\nNeither the department nor any officer, employee or servant thereof (except where the killing or injuring is negligent or wilful) shall be liable for any damage which may be done by any train or engine to cattle, horses or other animals on the railway.\n1. Where they, being at large contrary to the provisions of section 60, are killed or injured by any engine, &c., &c.\n2. Where they gain access to the railway from property other than that of the owner, or in which the owner has a right of pasturage.\n3. When they gain access to the railway through a gate of a farm or private crossing, the fastenings of which are in good order, unless such gate is left open by an employee of the department.\n4. When they, gain access to the railway through or over a fence constructed in accordance with sec. 55.\n6. Where they being at large contrary to the provisions of sec. 60, gain access to the railway from the highway at the point of intersection.\nSecs. 108 and 109 enact, the former that all claims for indemnity or injury sustained by reason o\u00ed the railway shall be made within six months next after the time of such supposed damage sustained, or, if there be continuance of damage, then within six months next after the doing or committing of such damage ceases, and not afterwards; and sec. 109, that no action shall be brought against any officer, employee or servant of the department for anything done by virtue of his office, service or employment unless within three months after the act committed, and upon one month's previous notice thereof in writing; and the action shall be tried in the county or judicial district where the cause of action arose.\nSec. 101 enacts, that the Minister, or any person acting for him in investigating and making enquiry into any accident upon the railway, or relating to the management of the railway, may examine witnesses under oath, and for that purpose shall have full power to administer such oath. By sec. 85 it is enacted, that the Governor may by Order in Council to be issued and published (in the Canada Gazette), impose and authorize the collection of tolls and dues upon any railway under the control or management of the Minister, and from time to time in like manner may alter and change such dues or tolls, and may declare the exemptions therefrom, and that all such dues should be payable in advance, if so demanded by the collector thereof; and by sec. 86, that all such tolls and dues might be recovered with costs in any court having civil jurisdiction to the amount, by the collector or person appointed to receive the same, in his own name or in the name of Her Majesty, and by any form of proceeding by which debts to the Crown may be recovered; and by sec. 83 it was enacted, that for the due use and proper maintenance of Government railways, and to advance the public good,. the Governor might, by Order in Council, enact from time to time such regulations as he might deem necessary for, among other things, the management of all or any such railways, or for the ascertaining and collection of the tolls, dues and revenues thereon, or to be observed by the conductors, engine drivers and other officers and servants of the department; and by sec. 89, that he might by such orders and regulations impose such fines, not exceeding in any case four hundred dollars, for any contravention or infraction of any such orders or regulations, as he should deem necessary for insuring the observance of the same, and the payment of the tolls and dues to be imposed as aforesaid, &c.; and that such orders and regulations should be read as part of the act. Now, from this act it is, I think, sufficiently clear that all superintendents, engineers, conductors, engine drivers and all other officers and servants of the department, are severally and respectively servants of the public, having certain statutory duties imposed upon each of them; for any injury caused to any person by their negligent and improper conduct in the discharge of which duties they are, each of them severally, responsible to the injured person, and this not in virtue of any contract, but as tortfeasors by reason of their negligent and improper conduct in the discharge of the duties imposed upon them by the statute having been the direct cause of injury to another. It is also, I think, obvious that all tolls, dues or fares, payable by all persons travelling upon or using the railway, are payable and recoverable solely under the authority of the statute which makes them to be recoverable, when not paid in advance to the person authorized to collect them, either by the collector in his own name, or in the name of Her Majesty as a statutory debt due to the Crown. The payment and collection of them rests upon the provisions and authority of the statute alone, and not upon any contract made with Her Majesty or with any person. There is no foundation whatever for the contention that Her Majesty is by the statute constituted a common carrier of goods and passengers by railway, and so exposed to all the liabilities by the common law attached to such carriers, or that the use of the railway for the carriage of passengers and freight is in virtue of a contract entered into by Her Majesty as such carrier; that is a position in which Her Majesty could never be placed, unless at least by the express terms of an Act of Parliament to which she herself should be an assenting party. But it is said that several of the above sections recognize and refer to a liability \"of the department,\" and that, there being no mode indicated by the statute for suing the department eo nomine, it must be liable in this mode of proceeding by petition of right against Her Majesty. To this contention there are, as it appears to me, two answers.\nBy the interpretation clause of the statute it is declared that the word \"department\" shall mean the Department of Railways and Canals, and the word \"minister\" the Minister of Railways and Canals. Now, there is no pretence that the department is made a corporation and capable of being sued as such. Indeed, its not being so is made the basis of the contention that Her Majesty may be proceeded against by petition of right. All officers and servants of the department of every degree are individually responsible for any injury directly caused to any person by their own negligent or improper conduct in the discharge of the duties imposed upon them respectively by the statute, but the remedy to give effect to the liability of the department referred to in certain clauses of the act must, I am of opinion, be that given by the 27th section of the act, and if that remedy be insufficient it is for the Parliament to interfere. The statute which imposes a liability upon the department without making it liable to be sued eo nomine by any process, and which at the same time provides a particular mode of ascertaining the extent of the liability in each particular case, must, I think, be construed as confining all persons having, or supposing themselves to>have, any claim upon the Government of Canada arising out of any injury to person or property on any Government railway, to the particular mode given in the act, while as against all officers of the department for their individual misconduct aggrieved parties are left unrestricted in their right to pursue whatever remedy the law may give them.\n2nd. It is sufficient to say that by virtue of the provisions of 39 Vic., ch. 27, sec. 19, Her Majesty cannot be proceeded against by petition of right in respect of any liability of the department, unless it be such a case as would have entitled the suppliant to the remedy by; petition of right under similar circumstances in England by the laws in force there prior to the passing of the Imperial Statute, 23 and 24 Vic., ch. 34.\nNow, the case of the carriage of letters by the Post Office Department under the provisions of the statutes regulating that Department, is a case precisely similar in circumstances, as it appears to me, to the carriage of passengers and freight on a Dominion Government railway under the statutes in that behalf, and, although at an early period an attempt was made to make the head of the Post Office Department responsible for losses occasioned by the negligence of subordinate officers of the Department, no attempt has ever been made to institute proceedings by p\u00e9tition of right against Her Majesty in such a case, nor has it ever been supposed that such a proceeding could be taken, although there is as much reason for implying a contract in that case as in the present. So neither can such proceeding be instituted in the present case in the absence of special legislation authorizing it. However much the suppliant's grievous sufferings and the great injury sustained by him call for and receive our deepest sympathy with him, I can come to no other conclusion upon the question of law involved than that the appeal must be allowed and the petition of right dismissed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: O'Connor & Hogg.\nSolicitors for respondent: Cockburn & McIntyre.\n[1] Vol. 2, p. 176, 3rd Ed.\n[2] 5 Q.

APPEAL from a judgment of Cameron, J.,[2] allowing a certain preliminary objection presented by and on behalf of the respondent, to the election petition of the appellant, and for ever staying proceedings under the said petition.\nThe petition was presented on the 12th day of August, A.D. 1882, and prayed that it might be determined that the respondent was not duly elected or duly returned for the Electoral District of the West Riding of the County of Huron, and that the election proceedings were void in consequence of the alleged fact that the respondent, during the election in that behalf, by himself and his agents, was guilty of corrupt practices within the meaning of the various Controverted Elections Acts.\nThe petition was entitled in the High Court of Justice (Queen\u2019s Bench Division), and was presented to and filed with Mr. Alexander Macdonell, acting for Mr. R.P. Stephens, Registrar of the said Queen\u2019s Bench Division of the High Court of Justice, at his office, at Osgoode Hall, in the city of Toronto.\nAt the time of the presentation of the said petition, the appellant\u2019s agent deposited with Mr. Macdonell, at the said office, and acting as aforesaid for Mr. R.P. Stephens, a Dominion note for $1, 000 as security for the costs of the said petition.\nOn the 6th day of September, A.D. 1882, the respondent presented to the court certain preliminary objections to the appellant\u2019s petition and to any further proceedings being had thereon, and such preliminary objections having come on for disposition in a summary way, the preliminary objection to the jurisdiction of this court, being the respondent\u2019s first preliminary objection, was, on the 20th day of October, A.D. 1882, allowed by the Honorable Mr. Justice Cameron, and was adjudged to be a good and sufficient objection and ground of insufficiency against the said petition and against any further proceedings thereon.\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, the respondent moved to quash the appeal. 1. On the ground that the appeal should have been taken in accordance with the provisions and rules regulating ordinary appeals to the Supreme Court, and not under the provisions regulating election appeals, which it was contended did not apply to an appeal from a judgment on preliminary objections. 2. Because the deposit of $1,000 had not been made with the proper officer.\nThe court decided to hear the appeal on the merits.\nMr. McCarthy, Q.C., for appellant:\u2014\nThe question which arises on this appeal, is whether the election petition of the present appellant, not having been presented to any of the courts mentioned in the Dominion Controverted Elections Act, 1874, eo nomine, the same is before any court having jurisdiction in respect thereof.\nWhen this case was argued, each party claimed the benefit of the judgment of the Privy Council in Valin v. Langlois[3].\nMy contention is that the Dominion Parliament, having taken by name certain (then existing Provincial Courts), has conferred upon them and the judges wielding authority in them a jurisdiction to try election petitions over and above the ordinary jurisdiction vested in such courts and judges by virtue of the British North America Act. If this contention is correct in law, then the Dominion Parliament, having so made use of existing courts must be taken to have done so with the knowledge that the power of altering the name of any such courts was lodged in another legislative body, namely, the Legislature of Ontario; and must be taken to have conferred such jurisdiction subject to any change in name to be made by such other legislative body.\nThe effect of the Ontario Judicature Act is, so far as regards the trial of election petitions, merely a change in the name of the courts.\nThe Queen\u2019s Bench Division is in fact the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench named in the Controverted Elections Act of 1874, and not a new and different court. This is manifest from a consideration of the provisions contained in sec. 3, sub-sec. 3, of the Ontario Judicature Act, 1881, which provides that after that act takes effect the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench shall be called the Queen\u2019s Bench Division of the High Court, &c.; and sec. 9 of the same act which declares that the High Court of Justice shall be a continuation of the said courts. The mere change of name could not take away from the court the power to try election petitions as conferred upon it by the Dominion Parliament.\nSec. 87 of the Ontario Judicature Act upon which the learned judge relied so strongly, on the question of jurisdiction, relates only to practice and procedure in matters connected with Dominion Controverted Elections, and can not be construed as an expression of the intention of the Legislature that the Divisional Courts of the High Court of Justice should not retain jurisdiction in Dominion Controverted Election petitions.\nMr. R.P. Stephens was, at the time the petition was presented, Clerk of the Crown and Pleas of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, and the office where the said petition was presented was then the same as had been formerly occupied by the Clerk of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, and there was not then, nor has there since been, any office of the Clerk of the Queen\u2019s Bench, or of the Clerk of Crown and Pleas of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, other than that where the said petition was presented.\nMr. Robinson, Q.C., and Mr. C. Moss, Q.C., for respondent:\u2014\nI think the judgment of the Privy Council in Valin v. Langlois[4] has made it plain that the Dominion Controverted Elections Act, 1874, is intra vires of the Parliament of Canada, and that it established and constituted certain pre-existing Courts in the Province of Ontario, (the Court of Appeal, the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, the Court of Common Pleas and the Court of Chancery) tribunals for the trial of election petitions; and by the same Act[5] established a system of procedure to be observed by such courts in the matter of controverted elections.\nThe tribunals so established by the Parliament of Canada could not and cannot be abolished, nor could their functions be interfered with, except by the Parliament of Canada; and they have never in fact been abolished, nor have their functions been abrogated or taken away by any Act of the Parliament of Canada. They are, therefore, still existent, and they still possess full and complete jurisdiction to receive and try Dominion election petitions.\nThis special jurisdiction of the Provincial Courts named did not and does not in any way result from their establishment or constitution as Provincial Courts by the Provincial Legislature, but is a separate and distinct jurisdiction for which they are solely dependent upon, and of which they can only be deprived by, the the Parliament of Canada.\nThe High Court of Justice, in which the appellant presented his petition, is a creation of the Legislature of the Province of Ontario, under the Provincial Act, 44 Vic., ch. 5. (Ontario Judicature Act.) The Parliament of Canada has not vested in this Provincial Court (the High Court of Justice) the jurisdiction which had been conferred as above mentioned, upon the pre-existing Provincial Courts, with regard to Dominion controverted elections. The High Court of Justice has, therefore, eo nomine, no jurisdiction in the matter of Dominion controverted elections. Although the Ontario Judicature Act may be said to vest in the High Court of Justice such jurisdiction, powers and functions as were vested in the pre-existing courts by virtue of their establishment, by Provincial legislation, as Provincial Courts, yet that Act could not and did not vest in the High Court such jurisdiction, powers and functions as were vested in the pre\u2011existing courts by virtue of their establishment by Dominion legislation (Controverted Elections Act, 1874), as Dominion Courts for the trial of Dominion controverted elections.\nThe framers of the Ontario Judicature Act did not profess to vest in the High Court of Justice any such powers. (44 Vic. ch. 5, sec. 87.)\nFrom these considerations, it follows that petitions in respect of Dominion controverted elections should still be presented in the courts designated by the Controverted Elections Act of 1874, and that their presentation in the High Court of Justice is unauthorized and improper, inasmuch as the latter court has no jurisdiction to entertain such petitions.\nThe respondent refers to and relies upon the reasoning of Mr. Justice Cameron, in the judgment appealed from[6] and in his judgments in the North York case, upon the motion to strike out the preliminary objections, and upon the trial of the same objections respectively[7].\nThe following authorities, among others, were relied upon: Re Niagara Election Case[8]; Re W Hastings Election Case; Re S. Ontario Election Case[9]; Re Kingston Election Case[10].\nRITCHE, C.J.:\u2014\nIf the petition in this case had been entitled in and addressed \u201cTo the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, of Ontario, for the trial of Election Petitions, now known as the Queen\u2019s Bench Division of the High Court of Justice of Ontario\u201d this would most certainly have been strictly and literally correct. If this would be sufficiently accurate, can it be said that presenting a petition in the Queen\u2019s Bench Division is not substantially a presentation in the Queen\u2019s Bench. The effect of the Judicature Act has, so far as Dominion legislation in relation to the Controverted Elections is concerned, done no more than give in Ontario another name to the court, leaving the jurisdiction in such cases untouched. The objection raised is so purely technical, that the most that can be said of it is, that if professing to present the petition in the Queen\u2019s Bench Division is not strictly and verbally correct, it is unquestionably substantially so, and is no more than a mere irregularity, and an objection which should not be permitted to prevail. But in my opinion it is not even worthy of the name of an irregularity. The local legislature could not take away from the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench the jurisdiction conferred on that court by the Dominion Parliament for the trial of controverted elections, nor have they attempted to do so; but, on the contrary, it is abundantly apparent that so far as the local legislature had any legislative power in the matter, their intention and desire was to continue the courts as they originally existed for the trial of Dominion Election Petitions. The local legislature had obviously no wish or intention to destroy or put an end to the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, they merely united and consolidated the courts, and enacted that the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench should \u201cthereafter be called the Queen\u2019s Bench Division of the High Court,\u201d clearly showing that the existence of the court was continued, merely its name changed.\nA reference to secs. 6, 9 and 89 of the Act 44 Vic. ch. 5 (Ont.) makes all this abundantly clear:\nSec. 6.\u2014Every existing judge is, as to all matters within the legislative authority of this province, to remain in the same condition as if this Act had not passed, and subject to the provisions of this Act, each of the said existing judges shall be capable of performing and liable to perform all duties which he would have been capable of performing or liable to perform if this Act had not passed.\nJURISDICTION.\nSec. 9.\u2014The High Court of Justice shall be a Superior Court of Record, and subject, as in this Act mentioned, shall have the jurisdiction which, at the commencement of this Act, was vested in or capable of being exercised by the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, the Court of Chancery, the Court of Common Pleas, the Court of Assize, Oyer and Terminer and Goal Delivery (whether created by commission or otherwise) and shall be deemed to be and shall be a continuation of the said courts respectively (subject to the provisions of this Act) under the name of the High Court of Justice aforesaid.\n(2) The jurisdiction aforesaid shall include (subject to the exceptions hereinafter contained) the jurisdiction which, at the commencement of this Act, was vested in or capable of being exercised by all or any one or more of the judges of the said courts, respectively sitting in court or chambers, or elsewhere, when acting as judges or a judge in pursuance of any statute or law; and all powers given to any such court, or to any such judges or judge, by any statute; and also all ministerial powers, duties and authorities, incident to any and every part of the jurisdiction.\nSec. 89.\u2014Nothing in this Act, or in the schedule thereto, affects or is intended to affect the practice or procedure in criminal matters, or matters connected with Dominion Controverted Elections, or proceedings on the Crown or Revenue side of the Queen\u2019s Bench or Common Pleas division.\nIt may be all true enough, that so far as the Jurisdiction Act applies, the Queen\u2019s Bench Division of the High Court discharges its functions as a branch or a division of the High Court, but as regards the Dominion Controverted Elections Act, the Queen\u2019s Bench is not abolished; it is continued, exists and discharges its functions as the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench for the trial of Dominion Controverted Elections, a Dominion Court capable of discharging all and every function that pertain to it as a Dominion Court, and over and with which the legislature of Ontario has no jurisdiction or right to interfere; and therefore, notwithstanding the legislature of Ontario has for local purposes changed its name, it is denuded of none of its jurisdiction as a Dominion Court, of which it could alone be deprived by the Dominion Parliament.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs and the preliminary objections to the election petition in this case be dismissed with costs.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nSub-section 3 of section 3 of the Ontario Judicature Act of 1881 enacts that\nThe Court of Queen\u2019s Bench shall thereafter be called the Queen\u2019s Bench Division of the High Court.\nMr. Maclennan, in his annotated edition of that Act, appends this note to the sub-section in question[11]:\nThe English Act does not identify the existing courts with the divisions of the High Court bearing the same names; the Ontario Act expressly makes the High Court and its several divisions a continuation of the existing courts, under a new name.\nIt appears to me that this construction is correct, and that there can be no doubt of the identity of the present Queen\u2019s Bench Division with the former Court of Queen\u2019s Bench. It is true, it may be occasionally composed of different judges, since the other judges of the High Court are made ex officio members of the Queen\u2019s Bench division, but this can make no difference, for it never could have been sensibly argued that the jurisdiction conferred by Parliament on the former Court of Queen\u2019s Bench could have been affected by the addition to it, under the authority of provincial legislation, of additional permanent or occasional ex officio judges. Then the question is reduced to the mere change of name. There can be no doubt now, since it has been decided by this court in Valin v. Langlois[12], and that decision has been approved by the Privy Council, that Parliament had power to confer jurisdiction in election petitions on provincial courts. Can it then be said that the continuance of this jurisdiction was dependent, not on the continued existence of the court, but also on the conservation of the name by which it was designated in the Act of Parliament originally conferring the jurisdiction? Surely we must hold that the mere name and style of the court is immaterial, and that the intention of Parliament was not to confer the jurisdiction upon the courts because they were known by particular names, but rather because they possessed certain jurisdiction and were composed of judges possessing certain qualifications, and that consequently it was a matter of no moment what change of name might be imposed by the provincial legislature, so long as the new court or division was continued as a judicial body identical in organization and jurisdiction with the old court; and this has been carefully provided for by the section referred to, which expressly conserves the identity of the new division with the former court. I am of opinion that the 87th section has no bearing on the present question. It refers not to judicial organization but to procedure and practice, and does not, in my judgment, keep the old court in existence under its former title for the purpose of the trial of Dominion elections. Had it so provided, I should still have been of opinion that the erroneous entitling of the petition was not a fatal preliminary objection, but as the petition had in fact been filed with the proper officer of the proper court, and the deposit paid in accordance with the requirements of the statute, I should have considered that the irregularity might have been remedied by amendment, I need not, however, enter upon any discussion of this point, as I am clear that there was no irregularity. I am of opinion that the appeal must be allowed with costs.\nFOURNIER, J.:\nI am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed, I believe that the words of the statute are very clear\u2014that the old courts have been continued under a new name.\nHENRY, J:\nThis question is one of some magnitude, not only in regard to the parties in this suit, but in other respects; and it becomes a matter of importance to consider whether the tribunal that has been selected by the petitioners in this instance was the proper one under the Dominion statutes which provide for the trial of controverted elections. It is one of very great nicety, and, I may say, I have had a great deal of difficulty in arriving at any conclusion in regard to it. I was at first of the opinion that the judgment of Justice Cameron, who gave his judgment in this case in the court below, was perhaps untenable, inasmuch as there was but little, if any, change in substance in the constitution of the courts beyond the name. I agree that if an amendment had been sought for, within the time allowed for presenting the petition, it should have been allowed, but if the party at fault does not apply to amend, so as to bring it within the time that is allowed for presenting a petition, I think it would be then too late. The petitioner, however, proceeded to trial on the petition as it is. When the trial was had on the preliminary objections it was competent for him to have moved to make the correct filing within the time allowed by law. That was not done. I think he was bound to do it, or he could not afterwards ask for the amendment. The 87th section which has been referred to, is as follows:\nNothing in this act, or in the schedule thereto, affects or is intended to affect, the practice or procedure in criminal matters, or matters connected with Dominion controverted elections, or proceedings on the crown or revenue side of the Queen\u2019s Bench or Common Pleas divisions.\nNow, the question arises, does not that except from its operation altogether the Dominion laws providing for the trial of controverted elections? It was clearly the intention of the legislature, that the Judicature Act of Ontario was not to interfere in any way with the trial of controverted elections for the Dominion. But it is said, it is only a change of name. I should say, if the controverted election cases could be tried by the same judges it then would be, to all intents and purposes, but a change of name. I do not know that I am right in the decision I have arrived at, but as the majority have reached a different conclusion it will not affect the decision of the case, if I am wrong; but I am of opinion that the trial would be changed by the operation of this act Sec. 29, sub-sec. 4 provides, and sec. 31 says:\n(4.) Every judge of the said High Court shall be qualified and empowered to sit in any of such divisional courts.\n31. Subject to any rules of court, it shall be the duty of every judge of the High Court who shall not for the time being be occupied in the transaction of any business specially assigned to him, or in the business of any other divisional court, to take part, if required, in the sittings of such divisional courts as may from time to time be deemed necessary for the transaction of the business of any of the divisions of the High Court.\nNow, under these circumstances, if a petition were presented, before this act was passed, in the Common Pleas, a judge of the Queen\u2019s Bench could not sit on the trial, If, again, a petition were presented in the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, a judge of the Common Pleas could not sit, but, by the change that is made by this statute, if a petition is now presented under this act in the Common Pleas division of the High Court, the merits of that petition could be tried by a judge of the Supreme Court or the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, and vice vers\u00e2. Thus, it appears to me, there is an important change made in the trial of an election petition. When a party selected his court to try his petition, he selected either the Queen\u2019s Bench, or the Common Pleas, or the Court of Chancery, and he knew that his case would be tried by the proper judges of the court he selected. Now, a party may present his petition in any one of the divisions of these courts, and one of the judges of another division is not only authorized, but is required to sit and try it, if necessary, Now, there, it appears to me, is not only a change of name, but a change in substance, and if that is really the case, nobody will contend that the legislature of Ontario had the power to make a change to that extent in the law of the Dominion, which provides for the trial of election petitions. In fact, the Dominion act says, that a petition presented in the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench shall be tried by the judges of that court; if it is presented in the Common Pleas, it must be tried by the judges of that court, and if this act has effect, the very opposite is the result. It appears to me, under these circumstances, that there is an important and fundamental change as to the trial of these petitions, The legis- lature of Ontario had not the power to make that change, and, therefore, if this petition has not been presented in the proper court, I think the petition itself must fail for want of jurisdiction. Now, it must be understood that, in making these remarks, I do not forget that the Court of Common Pleas for the trial of election petitions remains and has jurisdiction. If they can be tried under the old procedure, as established by the Controverted Elections Act, we would then have several tribunals, the Queen\u2019s Bench, Common Pleas, and the Court of Chancery, and the several divisions of the High Court of Judicature, equally competent to try the same case. Now, it appears to me, that when the original courts are still maintained, they are the proper courts to try these petitions, and they should be presented in these courts, as originally constituted. I do not express a very decided opinion on this point, and differing, as I do, from the majority of the court, I express it with no great confidence; but as I view the question, I think it is right that this appeal should be dismissed.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\u2014\nI am of opinion that the preliminary objections to the election petition should be maintained for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Cameron in the court below, and that consequently this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: McCarthy, Osler, Hoskin and Creelman.\nSolicitors for respondent: Bain, McDougall, Gordon and Shepley.\n[1] 1 Ont.

On the 25th August, 1882, the respondent obtained from Rigby, J., a rule nisi to set aside the order of the 16th August.\nOn the 27th September, 1882, this rule nisi was made absolute with costs on the ground that the order of the 16th August was improvidently granted and without sufficient cause shown.\nOn the 30th September, 1882, on the application of the petitioner, supported by affidavits, Rigby, J., made another order extending to the 15th of October then next the time for service of notice of presentation of petition and of security with a copy of petition.\nOn the 16th of October, Rigby, J., granted a rule nisi (returnable before the Supreme Court of Halifax,) to set aside the petition, the presentation thereof, the order made on the 30th September preceding the service of petition, &c., and all further proceedings.\nOn the 15th January, 1883, this rule nisi was made absolute, without costs, by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, on the principal ground that the affidavits on which the exparte order of the 30th September was granted disclosed no facts unknown to the petitioner when the order of the 16th August was obtained. The petitioner thereupon appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nHeld\u2014(Fournier and Henry, JJ., dissenting), that the rule appealed from was not \"a judgment, rule, order, or decision on a preliminary objection\" from which an appeal would lie under section 10, 42 Vic., ch. 39\u2014(The Supreme Court Amendment Act of 1879.)\nAppeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia making absolute without costs a rule nisi to set aside a previous order of Rigby, J., made in the matter of the election for King's county, on the 30th September, 1882, and the service of the copy of the petition, together with the presentation thereof, and the other papers served under the authority of the said order.\nOn the 5th day of August, 1882, the petition herein was presented at the office of the clerk of the court at Halifax.\nThe respondent was not within five days served with a copy of the petition.\nOn the 16th day of August, 1882, an order extending the time for service of the petition, &c., was granted by Rigby, J., upon the affidavits of the sheriff of King's county and of the petitioner. On the 31st day of August, 1882, the respondent herein was under the last-mentioned order duly served with a copy of the said petition.\nOn the 25th day of August, 1882, an order nisi was granted by Rigby, J., to set aside the last-mentioned order and the service of the said copy of the said petition. On the 27th September, 1882, the last-mentioned order was made absolute, on the ground, as appears by the judgment of the learned judge, that his exparte order of the 16th August extending the time for service was improvidently granted\nOn the 30th of September, 1882, Rigby, J., granted a new order extending the time for service to the 15th October, on affidavits of the said petitioner, the said sheriff, and of the agent of the said petitioner, and on other papers on file in the said petition.\nOn the 12th of October, 1882, the said respondent was, under the last-mentioned order, duly served with a copy of the said petition.\nOn the 16th of October, 1882, Rigby, J., granted an order nisi, returnable before the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco, to set aside the second service of the said petition, on the grounds, amongst others, that the said last-mentioned order was obtained on a second application and on a state of facts known to the petitioner and his counsel at the time when the first order for extension of the time for service was applied for.\nOn the 15th day of January, 1883, the said last-mentioned order nisi was made absolute by the court in banco on the last-mentioned ground solely, and the present appeal is from the rule making that order absolute.\nOn motion to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction, it was contended that the judgment appealed from was not a \"judgment, decision, rule or order\" which comes within the meaning of the 10 th section of the Supreme Court and Exchequer Court Amendment Act of 1879.\nH. McD. Henry, Q.C. for appellant.\nMr. Hector Cameron, Q.C. for respondent. RITCHIE, C. J.\nThe petitioner in this case allowed the time prescribed by the statute to pass; he then applied exparte to the judge for an extension of time within which to serve the petitioner, which the judge granted, but subsequently, on the exparte application of the respondent on cause shown, rescinded the order granting the extension, on the ground that the order was made improvidently. The petitioner made a new application to the judge seeking to have this last order rescinded and further time granted; the judge granted a rule nisi returnable before the full court; on cause shewn the court refused to interfere, on the ground that, inasmuch as all the facts set forth, and materials on which this second application was based, were in the knowledge or possession of the petitioner at the time he made his first application, a second application was not open to him.\nThe judge having in the first instance made an exparte order, it was quite competent for him to rescind that order, on its being shown to him that it ought not to have been granted, and when rescinded it was as if it had never been granted, and the petitioner, though served in fact before its rescission, on its rescission ceased to be served in law, such service being of no force or effect, the rescission simply amounting to a refusal to extend the time. I do not think it can be for a moment contended that from such a refusal there was any appeal to this court.\nAgain, when the petitioner made his second application for the extension and the Court refused to make the order nisi, this too was nothing more than a refusal to extend the time. It appears to me, as at present advised, that the ground on which the Court refused to entertain the application, if called on to decide the question, was amply sufficient to justify such refusal, and I am quite at a loss to understand how this refusal can be appealed from any more than if the judge had refused to entertain the application in the first instance. In Brassard v. Langevin[1], it was decided that there could only be an appeal on the merits not on preliminary objections, and subsequently the statute was passed allowing an appeal from a judgment upon preliminary objections. I cannot look upon this as an objection in the nature of a preliminary objection such as the statute contemplates, and therefore the motion to quash should be granted with costs.\nSTRONG, J.:\nI concur with the Chief Justice. I think this question ought to be looked upon as res judicata. Before the statute of 1878 there was no appeal from any decision on an election petition, except on the merits, and it was so held by this court in the second Charlevoix case. By the Act of 1879 an appeal is given from any decision on a preliminary objection which, if allowed, is final and conclusive and puts an end to the petition. By the context of the statute it is clear that what is meant is a judgment upon a substantial objection raised by the sitting member against the petition and not a decision on a mere point of practice or procedure. This is clearly not such a preliminary objection as comes within the statutory provision, and if we were to entertain this appeal we should be opening the door to appeals from every incidental order made during the pendency of a petition. I am; therefore, of opinion that this appeal is without any statutory authority to warrant it.\nFOURNIER, J.:\u2014\nIn this case there was a service of the petition, and whether good or bad there was a service. Now the usual way to take objection to an irregular service is by preliminary objection, and in this case the respondent instead of doing this, took out a rule nisi to set aside this service as irregular, and have the petition dismissed. In my opinion there is no difference whatever as to the result; the difference, if any, is in words. The statute has not defined what shall be considered a preliminary objection. In this case, as in the case of Brassard v. Langevin, the objection taken is to the irregularity of the service, and such objection could be taken as a preliminary objection. I think, therefore, that the Supreme Court, after the judge had granted an extension of time for making service, could not set aside that service or revise his order. There is no power given by the statute to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia to set aside a service and put an end to a petition on appeal.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nI have fully considered this case in regard to the whole question of election trials provided for by the Legislature, and the question in the case of Brassard v. Langevin. This court decided that the objections taken in that case were preliminary objections, and that under the statute which gave an appeal to this court in election petitions there was no appeal, except from a decision after the trial of the merits. Then the Legislature steps in and provides in the Act of 1879 for an appeal from an order, rule, or decision on preliminary objections. The statute says:\nAn appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from the judgment, rule, order, or decision of any court or judge on any preliminary objection to an election petition, the allowance of which shall have been final and conclusive, and which shall have put an end to the petition, or which would, if allowed, have been final and conclusive and have put an end to the petition; Provided always that an appeal in the last mentioned case shall not operate as a stay of proceedings, or to delay the trial of the petition, unless the court, or a judge of the court appealed from, shall so order; and provided also that no appeals shall be allowed under this section in cases in litigation and now pending, except cases where the appeal has been allowed and duly filed.\nNow, what are the preliminary objections here, and for what object was this rule nisi taken out?\nI will first refer to the position of the case as it stood when the learned judge granted the second order to allow the service to be made, and extended the time for making it. He had before him the affidavits and he decided that the first order he granted should be rescinded. Whether he was right or wrong in coming to that conclusion, it is not necessary for us now to say, nor whether he had the right to pass the second order or not. However he made the order granting an extension of time for serving the petition, and having done so, he was functus officio. If the respondent was dissatisfied with that order the statute provided an appeal to this court; he did not appeal, but applied to the judge to set aside his own order. I have looked at the rule and it reads as follows:\nUpon hearing read the affidavit of Douglas B. Woodworth, sworn herein the 23rd day of August last past, the affidavit of Simon H. Holmes, sworn herein the 23rd day of August last past, the affidavit of the said Douglas B. Woodworth, sworn herein the 16th day of October instant, and the exhibits thereto annexed, the second affidavit of Douglas B. Woodworth, sworn herein the 16th day of October instant, without exhibits, the affidavit of Watson Bishop, sworn herein on the 14th day of October, instant, and the exhibits thereto annexed, the affidavit of John Redden, sworn herein the 14th day of October instant, the affidavit of Stephen Belcher, sworn herein the 13th day of October instant, the affidavit of Stephen Belcher, sworn herein the 28th day of September last past, the affidavit of Stephen Belcher, sworn herein the 15th day of August last past, the affidavit of David M.

Henry, sworn herein the 29th day of September, last past, the affidavit of James P. Cunningham, sworn herein the 13th day of October instant, the order of his Lordship Mr. Justice Rigby, made herein on the 16th day of August, last past, and the affidavits and papers on which the same was granted, the order nisi to set aside the said order granted by his Lordship Mr. Justice Rigby, the 25th day of August last past, the judgment or decision of his Lordship Mr. Justice Rigby, filed herein on the 26th day of September, A.D. 1872, the order absolute thereon, dated the 27th day of September last past, and order of his Lordship Mr. Justice Rigby granted herein the 30th day of September last past, and the affidavits and papers on which the same was granted, the affidavits and papers on file herein, and on motion.\nI do order that the petition on file herein, the presentation thereof, and all proceedings now outstanding had on the said petition, or in virtue thereof, the order of his Lordship Mr. Justice Rigby, made herein the 30th day of September last past, the service of the said order and all proceedings had thereon, the service of the said petition, notice of presentation and of the security made, had and effected under and in virtue of the said order on the said 30th of September, the deposit receipt, and the service of the same served on the respondent herein, be set aside and all further proceedings on the said petition stayed on the following grounds [giving the grounds].\nUnless cause to the contrary be shewn before the Supreme Court at Halifax, on the first day of the ensuing term thereof, in December.\nThis rule the learned judge made returnable before the full court, which court I find make this rule absolute upon the ground that the judge had no power to pass the second order.\nIn the first place, I do not recognize the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia to deal with such a case, nor that the judge has the power to create such a jurisdiction by making his order returnable to the court. In my opinion what the learned judge should have said is, \"I have exercised my discretion, and if I have erred, you have a right of appeal.\"\nI am perfectly aware that there are some cases where a judge can rescind his own order, but this is not such a case. As it is said in Chitty's Practice of the Law[2]: Unless a judge's order has been made under the authority of a statute and thereby deemed to be final, or it has been previously agreed by the parties that it shall be final) either party dissatisfied with his decision may, if he apply in a reasonable time, move the full court \"to set aside\" or \"rescind such order,\" and all proceedings taken thereupon. 'When an order has been made under an express power given by statute, it is sometimes conclusive, and is not subject to review, unless an appeal to the court be expressly or impliedly given.\nIn the case before us the learned judge has given his decision based on the authority of a statute, and the present appellant was by his decision given a statutory right to serve his petition. Can it be said that a week after the judge can take away that right? If the judge had even no right to make that second order, he had not the right to, or power to, set it aside. The proceeding here is not an appeal from a mere matter of procedure, but from an order putting an end to the petition, and if the court below had no right to rescind the judge's order this court has the right to reverse their decision. Now I maintain, taking the whole election law together, that this court alone could rescind the judge's order. By holding the contrary, we decide that a judge can give judgment in favor of one of the parties and subsequently reverse his own judgment\u2014a power which no judge possesses. I think that the judge in this case having once granted the order, neither he nor the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia could set it aside; certainly not because it was considered he had come to a wrong conclusion.\nNow, let us look at the preliminary objections.\nDouglas B Woodworth, the respondent or person against whose election and return a petition of David M. Dickie has been filed, objects to any further proceedings herein on or in virtue of the said petition on the following grounds which he presents as preliminary objections or grounds of insufficiency against the said petition or any further proceedings thereon.\n1. Because the said petition was never presented.\n2. Because the said petition was never presented by a duly qualified person as required by the provisions of the Dominion Controverted Elections Act, 1874.\n3. Because the said petition was not left at the office of the prothonotary of the Supreme Court at Halifax.\n4. Because the said petition was not presented within thirty days after the publication, in the Canada Gazatte, of the receipt of the return to the writ of election of a member for the County of King's County aforesaid, by the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery, and it does not specifically allege any act of bribery to have been committed since the time of such return.\n5. Because the said petition was not delivered at the office of the clerk of this court during office hours as prescribed by the said Act.\n6. Because the said petition was not delivered at the office of the clerk of this court, or left at the office of the prothonotary, at Halifax, by a person duly qualified, within thirty days after the publication in the Canada Gazette of the receipt of and return to the writ of election of a member for the County of King's County, by the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery, and it does not specially allege any Act of bribery to have been committed since the time of said return.\n7. Because the said petition was not presented by a person duly qualified to do so under the provisions of the Dominion Controverted Elections Act, 1874.\n8. Because the said petition was not presented by a person who had a right to vote at the election to which the petition relates, or by a candidate at such election.\n9. Because the said petition was not presented by a person who had a right to vote at the election to which the petition relates, or a candidate at such election, within thirty days after the publication in the Canada Gazette of the receipt of the return to the writ of election of a member for the said County of King's County by the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery, and it does not specifically allege any act of bribery to have been committed since the time of such return.\n10. Because notice of the presentation of the petition and of the security, accompanied with a copy of the petition, was not served on the respondent within five days after the day on which the petition was presented, or within any prescribed time, or within any longer time allowed by the court or any judge thereof.\n11. Because notice of the presentation of the petition and of the security, accompanied with a copy of the petition, was not served by petitioner on the respondent, as required by the provisions of the Dominion Controverted Elections Act, 1874.\n12. Because the said petition and notice of the date of the presentation thereof and a copy of the deposit receipt were not served on the respondent, as required by the provisions of the Dominion Controverted Elections Act, 1874.\n13. Because the notice of the presentation of the petition and of the security accompanied with a copy of the petition was not served on the respondent within five days after the day on which the petition was presented, or within the prescribed time, and, if a longer time for service was allowed by the court or a judge thereof, the said allowance was not made until after the time prescribed for said service had expired, and the said allowance on that account was irregular and void, and the said court or judge had then no power or authority to allow any longer time for such service.\n14. Because the order of Mr. Justice Rigby, dated at Halifax the thirtieth day of September, A.D. 1882, extending the time for the service of the said petition, notice of presentation thereof, and of the security, and by virtue of which the same were served, is ultra vires and was not granted until the prescribed time for the service thereof had expired, and after the power and authority of the court or a judge thereof to make any such order had ceased to exist.\n15. Because notice of the presentation of the said petition and of the security, accompanied with a copy of the said petition, was not served on the respondent within five days after the day on which the petition was presented, or within the prescribed time, and no longer time for such service was allowed by the court or a judge thereof.\n16. Because the deposit receipt, a copy of which was served on the respondent, was not signed by the clerk of the court as required by the provisions of the Dominion Controverted Elections Act, 1874.\n17. Because an order extending the time for the service of the said petition and notice had been previously granted by a judge of this court and afterwards discharged on the merits before the said order, dated at Halifax the thirtieth day of September, A.D. 1882, was obtained, and the said last-mentioned order was obtained on a second application and on a state of facts fully known to the petitioner and his counsel at the time the first order was applied for.\n18. Because the said order of the thirtieth of September, aforesaid, extends the time for the service of the said petition and notice, until the fifteenth day of October, 1882, and allows the said petitioner to serve respondent therewith on the said fifteenth day of October, which day was Sunday, and the said order is therefore illegal and void.\n19. Because an order had been granted under the said act, extending the time for the service of the petition, and notices herein previously to the said order of the thirtieth of September, and the statute could not be a second time invoked to secure an extension of time for the service of the said petition and notice.\n20. Because an order extending the time for the service of the said petition and notice had been previously granted by a judge of this court, and afterwards discharged, because the same had been granted without sufficient cause shown, previously to the said order of the thirtieth of September being granted, and no new facts have arisen or transpired since the granting of the first of said orders on account of which the said order of the thirtieth of September should be granted.\n21. And because the said order of the thirtieth of September was improvidently granted, and without any sufficient cause or reason.\n22. And the respondent prays that this honorable court, or a judge thereof, may hear the petitioner and respondent on and as to the foregoing preliminary objections and grounds of insufficiency, and decide the same in a summary manner.\nDated at Halifax, in the county of Halifax, this seventeenth day of October, A.D. 1882.\nDOUGLAS B. WOODWORTH.\nSurely these are all legal questions. There is here no question of fraud or misrepresentation in obtaining the order upon which the respondent would be entitled to move to have the order rescinded in the first instance by the judge of the Election Court, and afterwards if unsuccessful by appeal to this court.\nLooking at the case, of Brassard v. Langevin[3] which we decided here, [the learned Judge then read the head note in that case,] are not these the same objections that are taken in this rule nisi. A majority of the court in that case held that they were preliminary objections, and therefore not appealable under the law as it then stood. I can see no difference in the objection taken here. For these reasons I think this motion to quash should not be allowed to prevail.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\u2014\nI am of opinion that the appeal should be quashed for the reasons given by the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Strong.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nI am also of opinion that the judgment of the Supreme Court, making a rule nisi to set aside a previous order granted by Mr. Justice Rigby ex parte absolute, is not appealable under the Supreme and Exchequer Court Amendment Act of 1879.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Henry & Weston.\nSolicitor for respondent: J.

J. Ritchie, C. J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Gwynne, JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK.\nAppeal on Election Petition\u201442 Vic., ch 39 (The Supreme and Exchequer Court Amendment Act of 1879), sec. 10, construction of\u2014Rule absolute by Court in banc to rescind order of a Judge in Chambers\u2014Preliminary objection.\nA petition was duly filed and presented by appellant on the 5th of August, 1883, under the \"Dominion Controverted Elections Act, 1874,\" against the return of respondent. Preliminary objections were filed by respondent, and before the same came on for hearing the attorney and agent of respondent obtained on the 3th October from Mr. Justice Weldon an order authorizing the withdrawal of the deposit money and removal of the petition off the files The money was withdrawn, but shortly afterwards, in January, 1883, the appellant, alleging he had had no knowledge of the proceedings taken by his agent and attorney, obtained upon summons a second order from Mr. Justice Weldon rescinding his prior order of 13th October, 1882, and directing that upon the appellant re-paying to the clerk of the Court, the amount of the security the petition be restored, and that the appellant be at liberty to proceed. Against this order of January, 1883, the respondent appealed to the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, and the Court gave judgment, rescinding it. Thereupon petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nHeld,\u2014That the judgment appealed from is not a judgment on a preliminary objection within the meaning of 42 Vic., ch, 39, sec. 10, (The Supreme Court Amendment Act, 1879), and therefore not appealable.\nDickie v. Woodworth[1] followed.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick making absolute a rule nisi calling upon the petitioner to show cause why an order of Mr. Justice Weldon, made on the seventeenth January, 1883, in the matter of the Dominion Controverted Election for the County of Gloucester, Province of New Brunswick, whereby he rescinded a previous order which he had made on the 13th October, 1882, should not be rescinded.\nThis was an application to rescind an order of Mr. Justice Weldon, made on the seventeenth January last, whereby he rescinded a previous order which he had made in this matter on the 13th October, 1882. It appeared that a petition had been filed by the appellant under the \"Dominion Controverted Elections Act, 1874,\" against the return of the respondent as a member for the County of Gloucester in the Dominion Parliament, that certain preliminary objections to the petition had been filed and a time appointed for hearing these objections, and after several adjournments the following order was made by Mr. Justice Weldon on the 13th October last.\n\"Upon application made to me by Mr. Rand, of \"counsel for the respondent, and with and by consent \"of the petitioner, and upon hearing read the affidavits \"of Barton S. Reed, the attorney and agent of the petitioner, \"of Stephen Rand, and of the above named respondent, \"I do order that the said petition may be \"taken off the files of the court, and that the sum of \"one thousand dollars deposited as security in the \"matter be paid to the petitioner or his agent, or to \"such other person as may be duly authorized to \"receive the same.\"\nIn consequence of this order, the deposit of $1,000 was paid by the Clerk of the Election Court to Mr. Reed, the petitioner's attorney, but the petition was not in fact withdrawn from the office. No further proceedings were taken in the matter until January, 1883, when, on the application of the petitioner, and on his affidavit that the withdrawal of the petition and discontinuance of the proceedings therein, and the withdrawal of the deposit were done by his attorney without his (petitioner's) consent, and that he was desirous that proceedings in the petition should be continued, a summons was granted calling on the respondent to show cause why the order of the 13th October should not be rescinded, and the petition proceeded with. At the hearing of this summons on the 17th January last, the following order was made:\n\"Upon reading the summons granted by me, etc., I \"do order that upon the petitioner's repaying or causing \"to be repaid to the clerk of this court the amount \"of the deposit money paid into court upon the filing \"and presentation of the petition, drawn out by his the \"petitioner's agent or attorney under my said order of \"the thirteenth day of October aforesaid, that my said \"order be rescinded, and that the said parties be restored \"to their original status and rights the same as if \"such order of the said thirteenth day of October last \"had not been made.\"\nAgainst this order the respondent appealed to the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, which court gave, judgment rescinding Mr. Justice Weldon's order, made in January, 1883.\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, a motion to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction was made.\nMr. Blair, Attorney General of New Brunswick, for appellant.\nMr. Harrison for respondent.\nRITCHIE, C. J.:\u2014\nI cannot entertain any doubt that this is not an appealable case. It is not an appeal from a judgment on a preliminary objection, and I fail to be able to bring myself to the conclusion, upon any ground whatever, that this is a preliminary objection such as is contemplated by the terms of the Controverted Elections Act of 1874, or which can come under the express terms of the statute giving us the right to hear appeals from judgments on preliminary objections. And it is very clear we must have express authority by statute in order to hear election appeals\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nI am of the same opinion. I think it is quite clear that under the Controverted Elections Act of 1874, and under the statute of 1879 (Supreme Court Amendment Act) enlarging our jurisdiction to hear appeals from judgments, deciding preliminary objctions to an election petition, we have only jurisdiction provided the preliminary objection is one of the kind which originally and before this jurisdiction in appeal was conferred was authorized by the statute to be filed. It must be an objection emanating from the respondent himself and of a particular class, such as for instance an objection taken by the respondent to the status of the petitioner. But here there is no objection of this kind. This is a much stronger case than the case of Dickie v. Woodworth, by which I consider the point now raised to have been finally settled. In my judgment, the appeal should be quashed.\nFOURNIER, J.:\u2014\nI am also of opinion that an appeal will only lie from a decision on a preliminary objection\u2014which must be fyled within the time prescribed by the statute, and if not fyled within the specified time, it cannot be treated as a preliminary objection. I do not think the decision in this case is appealable.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nWe have to place ourselves in the place of the Legislature in order to ascertain what was meant by the words \"preliminary objections.\" I think the preliminary objections referred to are those which are to be fyled by the respondent. The question is whether we have jurisdiction in an appeal when these objections have not been adjudicated. Now, I take it, it must be limited to such preliminary objections But in this case the petitioner says: \"I have not got to that stage of the proceedings when the preliminary objections can be adjudicated upon. I only want to show I am entitled to have my petition tried, but somebody went to the judge and represented to him that he had authority to withdraw the money, and he was not so authorized.\"\nThis clearly shows that this is not such a preliminary objection as was contemplated by the Legislature. I feel, though reluctantly, that I must agree with the decision arrived at by this court. It is not an appeal from a decision on the merits of a preliminary objection.\nI may add that it might be said that the money has been improperly withdrawn. If Judge Weldon was right in his conclusion, the parties may be said to be still in court, and contend that Judge Weldon had a perfect right to order the money illegally withdrawn to be returned, and having given his decision on a question of fact, not of law, the full court had no power to rescind his order. I only regret this court has no power to revise that order.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nIt appears to me the case is very plain. The appeal is not against any decision upon a preliminary objection to the petition at all, but against a judgment of the court rescinding an order of Mr. Justice Weldon which rescinded a prior order of his own, upon the ground that the court found that the first order was made and acted upon by the withdrawal of petition and of the deposit filed by the petitioner as security for costs, by and with the consent of the petitioner himself, who had thereby put himself out of court, and that therefore, the second order made by Mr. Justice Weldon, which order the judgment of the court now appealed from rescinded, was improperly made. Against such a judgment of the court rescinding an order of a single Judge in Chambers the statute gives no appeal.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Gregory & Blair\nSolicitor for respondent: L.

Co., to recover money claimed to be due for fencing along the line of C.C. railway, the C.C.R. Co. pleaded never indebted, and payment.\nThe agreement under which the fencing was made is as follows: \u201cMemo. of fencing between Muskrat river, east, to Renfrew. T. and W.M. to construct same next spring for C.C.R.

T. and W.M. built the fence and the C.C.R. Co. have had the benefit thereof ever since. The case was tried before Patterson, J., and a jury, and on the evidence, in answer to certain questions submitted by the judge, the jury found that T. and W.M., when they contracted, considered they were contracting with the company through F., and that there was no evidence that the company repudiated the contract till the action was brought, and that the payments made were as money which the company owed, not money which they were paying to be charged to F. and a general verdict was found for T. and W.M. for $12,218.51. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada\u2014\nHeld (affirming the judgment of the Court below) that it was properly left to the jury to decide whether the work performed, of which the C.C. R. Co. received the benefit, was contracted for by the company through the instrumentality of F., or whether- they adopted and ratified the contract, and that the verdict could not be set aside on the ground of being against the weight of evidence; [Ritchie, C.J., and Taschereau, J., dissenting, on the ground that there was no evidence that F. had any authority to bind the company, T. and W.M. being only sub-contractors, nor evidence of ratification]\n2.

Foster, was not one made or purporting to be made with the defendants, and that there was no evidence or sufficient evidence of its being or being intended to be a contract with the defendants, and that if it purported to be or was intended to be a contract with the defendants there was no authority or sufficient authority shown in the said A.B. Foster to bind the defendants or to contract for them, and that there was no evidence of any ratification or adoption of said contract by the defendants; that the work of fencing was done for, and on the credit of, the said A.B. Foster, and under contract with him individually, and that there was no evidence or sufficient evidence to render the defendants liable for said work, or fencing, or any part thereof, and that on the facts and evidence or weight of evidence there should have been either a non-suit or a verdict for defendants; or why the verdict should not be set aside and a new trial be had between the parties for misdirection and improper ruling on the part of the learned judge, in not holding the written contract to be one between the plaintiffs and the said A.B. Foster personally, and also in submitting it to the jury whether the plaintiffs supposed they were dealing with the defendants; or on the ground of the verdict being against law and evidence and the weight of evidence, for the reasons above set forth as grounds for entering verdict for defendants or a non-suit, and that on the evidence and weight of evidence the plaintiffs were not \u201centitled to recover, and said verdict should have been for defendants.\u201d\nAfter argument the rule was discharged, the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench being unanimously of opinion that the verdict was right, and it appears from the judgment of the learned Chief Justice of the Queen\u2019s Bench, that the judge who tried the cause concurred in this opinion.\nThe appellants then appealed to the Court of Appeal for the Province of Ontario.\nThe judges sitting in appeal were equally divided, the Chief Justice of Ontario and Mr. Justice Burton being of opinion that the verdict was wrong, and should be set aside; Mr. Justice Morrison and Mr. Justice Osler being of opinion that the verdict was right, and should not be disturbed.\nThe court being equally divided, the judgment stood affirmed, and the present appeal is from that judgment.\nThe work was actually performed by the respondents, and the appellants have had the benefit of it. The evidence relating to Mr. Foster\u2019s position and to the adoption by the company of the contract is reviewed in the judgments.\nMr. J.K. Kerr, Q.C., and Mr. Walker, for appellants, and Mr. Bethune, Q.C., and Mr. Deacon, Q.C., for respondents.\nThe points argued and cases relied on by counsel are reviewed in the judgments.\nRITCHIE, C.J.:\u2014\nI think the appeal should be allowed and non-suit entered for reasons to be found in the judgments of Spragge, C.J., and Burton, J., in the Court of Appeal. I may, however, add that the ownership of property alone will not render the owner liable for work performed upon it without his request, though he receives it knowing that the work has been performed. In this case, in my opinion, no contract was shewn between the plaintiffs and the defendants, nor can I discover any evidence of any authority on the part of Foster to enter into any such contract on behalf of the defendants, or that he intended to do so; nor is there anything, in my opinion, to shew that defendants in any way held out or permitted the plaintiffs to believe in any existing state of things in reference to this contract, or any act of ratification (assuming the company would be bound by a ratification), precluding them from denying their liability. No payments were, in my opinion, authorized or made, by or in the name of the defendants to the plaintiffs. Those relied on as a ratification, think, were made by the company on account of Foster, and not by and on behalf of the defendants. It is said there was no repudiation on the part of the defendants\u2014there was not, that I can see, any necessity for a repudiation. On the part of the company, there is not the slightest evidence that the company ever knew that any contract was entered into, or professed to be entered into on behalf of the company, or that the plaintiffs were acting on any supposition that there was a contract binding on the company. There was no evidence to show that they permitted Foster to deal with plaintiffs as their authorized agent, or held him out as authorized by them in any way to make such a contract. On the contrary, the evidence is clear that though the fencing may not have been included in the written contract, it was, between Foster and the company, well understood that it formed part of the work he was to do under his contract. The plaintiffs, so far from communicating with the defendants that they were under any such impression, on the contrary, appear to have rendered their account for this work against Foster personally, they never appear to have rendered any account or made any claim against the company until after the death of Foster, which took place on the 1st November, 1877, long after the work had been performed. Had the defendants been notified that plaintiffs were doing the work under a contract made by Foster on their behalf as their agent, and he had continued to act as such agent and the plaintiffs continued to fulfil their contract without any repudiation on the part of defendants, it may well be that defendants could become bound to plaintiffs on the contract. But in the absence of any authority on the part of Foster, or of any knowledge brought home to defendants, or of any ratification or adoption by the company of the contract, how can a liability be fixed on them? I cannot discover that Foster had any express or implied authority or ostensible authority to bind the company. Now, the law as to ratification is clear, and applies equally to cases of contract and of tort. In the case of the Phosphate Lime Co. v. Green[1] Willes, J., laid down the law as to ratification thus:\nThe principle by which a person, on whose behalf an act is done without his authority, may ratify and adopt it, is as old as any proposition known to the law. But it is subject to one condition: in order to make it binding, it must be cither with full knowledge of the character of the act to be adopted or with intention to adopt it at all events and under whatever circumstances.\nBramwell, B., in Riche v. Ash Car. Ry. Co.[2], referring to the case of Phosphate of Lime v. Green, says:\nMy late brother Willes laid down a rule (using the language before quoted) by which I am content to be governed.\nI may ask, as Bramwell, B., did in the case referred to, \u201cWhere is the evidence of adoption?\u201d with intention to adopt it at all events and under whatever circumstances.\nFOURNIER, J.:\u2014\nI am in favour of upholding the verdict. I have no doubt that the contract was made by the parties with Foster, believing they were contracting with the company. It is said in so many words in the writing that the work is to be done for the company. It is true that Foster signed his name individually, and that he did not sign it in the quality of an agent, but it was a well known fact that Foster had been the general manager of the company. If he was not occupying that position at the time, he had for his own purposes changed his position so often from contractor to general manager, that it was very difficult for the general public to understand what his real position was in a legal point of view. In fact, it was really no change at all, and the jury, in my opinion, were well founded in declaring that he was acting for the company; he was using the cars of the company, the work was being done for the company, and, under the circumstances, this verdict ought not to have been disturbed.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nThis is an action under the common counts in assumpsit for goods sold and delivered, work done and materials provided, and for work done in building fences for the appellants along their line of railway, and for sawed lumber, fence posts, nails and fencing materials furnished by the respondents for the appellants at their request, and the particulars furnished by the respondents of their claim are as follows:\nSeptember 1st, 1876.\nTo 15,678 rods of fencing done by plaintiffs for defendants at their request on line of Canada Central Railway between the village of Renfrew and Graham\u2019s Bridge, over the Muskrat river, in the township of Westmeath, at $1.25 per rod, as per agreement, $19,597.50.\nThe appellants pleaded\u2014\n1st. Never indebted as alleged.\n2nd. That before action they discharged the plaintiffs claim by payment.\nThe agreement under which the fences in question were made is as follows:\nRenfrew, 6th January, 1876.\nMemo. of fencing between Muskrat river, east, to Renfrew. T. and W. Murray to construct same next spring for C.C.B. Co., to be equal to 5 boards 6 inches wide, and posts 7 to 8 feet apart, for $1.25 per rod, company to furnish cars for lumber.\n(Signed)T. & W. Murray,\nA.B. Foster.\nThe agreement was performed by the respondents by the building of the fences, which is fully admitted, and the appellants have had the benefit thereof ever since. It was, however, contended on their behalf, that Foster had no authority to bind the company\u2014that the respondents made the agreement with Foster personally\u2014that he was under a contract to build the railway, and that the fences were included in the work to be done by him under his contract, and that therefore the appellants were not responsible to the respondents. The agreement of the respondents is certainly not with Foster, but with the appellants. It is signed by him on their behalf. Had he authority to bind them? If he had, our judgment must be for the respondents. No express authority to enter into that particular agreement was shewn; but such express authority is not necessary to be shewn. The evidence is irresistible that he (Foster) was to a large extent the company. Such is proved by Mr. Moffat, who was a director of the company. He says:\nI knew Foster. In 1875 and 1876 he was managing director of the company. I may be mistaken that he was managing director in \u201875. * * * I think he was manager only 1876. He was building the road in 1875 between Renfrew and Pembroke. * * * He was managing director after he took the contract. * * * As a matter of fact he was manager of the whole thing.\nMr. Baker, who was general manager of the railway, and had been for two years, who was also secretary of the company and had the custody of all the books and papers of the company, and was in the employment of the company since 1869, says:\nFoster had the bulk of the stock\u2014about nine-tenths of the stock of the company. * * * Foster elected all the directors. He held proxies for nine-tenths of the stock. * * * He had an overwhelming control of the board of the Canada Central. He elected the directors and the directors elected him managing director, &c.\nThe whole evidence goes to establish these positions. It is shewn that Foster had a contract with the company for the building of the railway on the sides of which the fences in question were erected, in which the work to be done by him thereunder is specially described and stated, but not in any way referring to or including the fencing. Foster, whilst engaged in performing that contract, and, in fact, while directing and controling the whole operations of the company, knowing that no provision had been made for the erection of the fences, entered into the contract therefor with the respondents. Were the case to rest solely on the question of general authority, I should say there was quite sufficient in the evidence I have cited, taken in connection with the rest of the evidence, to justify the submission of it to a jury. But it is plain that Foster and the directors well knew the fencing was not included in his contract. They knew they should be erected before the line would be operated, and it is not unreasonable to assume that Foster informed them of the contract, or that he was understood to have the whole control and direction as to all that was necessary to be done for the completion of the line outside of his own contract. The directors, if taking at all any active part apart from Foster in the completion of the line, must be taken to have known of the respondents\u2019 contract. The agreement is found amongst the records and papers of the company and must be considered as known to the directors. If known to them, they must also be assumed to have known that the respondents were performing it. That assumption would not be an unnatural one without any specific proof, but when we see that the materials for the fences were carried for the respondents by the appellants\u2019 cars and distributed, and without exacting payment as their freight regulations in all other cases provided, when payments were being made on account from the funds of the company, are we not bound to conclude that the directors knew all about the contract with the respondents. If they did not, they were remiss in their duty, and in the absence of proof we should not clear the company of a liability to pay for what they got good value for by assuming such a dereliction of duty. If the directors, therefore, were unwilling to ratify the contract they should have so notified the respondents, but instead thereof by their dealings they gave them unmistakable proof of the ratification of it. If the directors knew not of the contract, or were opposed to it, if they thought that Foster\u2019s contract included the fencing, or that he personally was the contractor with the respondents, it is a little strange that the record shows no attempt to prove either position, although one or more of the directors gave evidence on the trial. There is no evidence that Foster on his own account ever made a claim against the company for the fencing or was paid anything for it. Had it been shewn that he had been paid for it through any mistake, and that those managing the company\u2019s finances had by a mistake paid him what was due to respondents, although not a defence, it would at all events have shown that the company had been willing to pay some one; but such evidence is wholly wanting, and the impression is, therefore, not a favorable one. The evidence was fairly submitted to the jury by the learned judge who presided at the trial, and they found a verdict for the respondents. I think the learned judge would have been wrong if he had done otherwise, and I think that, under the circumstances, the verdict should not be interfered with, even were we of opinion that it might have been for the appellants. I am, however, of the opinion that the conclusion of the jury was what both in law and equity the evidence warranted.\nI think, therefore, the appeal should be dismissed, and a judgment entered for the respondents with costs in all the courts.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\u2014\nI cannot concur in the conclusion reached by the majority of the court. I cannot see that Murray ever contracted with the company. He simply took a subcontract from the contractor Foster, and I cannot see that the company is to be made liable towards him.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nThe question before us in this case, for the same reason as was that in the case of The Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford Ry. Co. v. Slattery in the House of Lords[3], is limited to the enquiry whether there was any evidence whatever to go to the jury. Now, that the learned judge could not have withheld the case from the jury, cannot, I think, admit of doubt, and that it was submitted to them with a charge of which the defendants have no just reason to complain, appears to me to be also free from doubt.\nThe jury accompanied their verdict for the plaintiffs with a declaration in answer to certain questions put to them by the judge for their guidance\u2014that they found as matter of fact that the plaintiffs, when they entered into the contract sued upon, considered that they were contracting with the company through Foster, and that there was no evidence that the company ever repudiated the contract until this action was brought; and further, that certain payments made to the plaintiffs on account were made as money which the company owed, and not money they were paying to charge to Foster. When we read the evidence, I confess that I am not at all surprised that the jury should have rendered their verdict for the plaintiffs.\nThe contract is as follows:\nRenfrew, 6th January. 1876.\nMemorandum of fencing between Muskrat river east, to Renfrew. T.W. Murray & Co., to construct some next spring for C.C.R.R. Co., to be equal to five boards 6 inches wide, and posts 7 to 8 feet apart, for $1.25 per rod. Company to furnish cars to distribute lumber.\n(Signed)T. & W. Murray.\nA.B. Foster. The evidence describes this Mr. Foster, whose name is set to this paper, as a gentleman who controlled nine-tenths of the stock of the company\u2014whose control of the board of directors was overwhelming\u2014who was, in fact, himself the company; who elected the directors, who in turn elected him managing director; who resigned his office of director and put another in his stead\u2014for the sole purpose of receiving\u2014or rather (in view of his control over the board) of giving to himself, a contract to enable him to obtain a subsidy from the Ontario Government and to build the road. Who, by his like power of control over the board, had persons in his own private service and employment appointed to be officers and servants of the company, while continuing to be in his own private service and under his control. Who assigned the contract to build the road, which he had given to himself, to one Haskell, who does not appear to have ever done anything in performance of it, and procured the board of directors to go through the form of passing a resolution accepting Haskell as contractor in his place. Who, thereupon resumed his position at the board as a director, and was appointed formally by the board, but substantially by himself, vice-president and managing director, which offices he held for about two years, when he suffered them to merge into the more modest title of manager. Who upon the 2nd December, 1875, in his character of manager of the company received certain debentures to the amount of $50,000, issued by the town of Pembroke in favour of the company from certain trustees in whose hands they had been placed to the amount of $75,000 in the whole, upon trust to be handed over to the company upon the fulfilment by the company of certain conditions, and gave a receipt and guarantee therefor to the trustees, as follows: Pembroke, December 2, 1875.\nTo Messrs. Andrew Irving, Michael O\u2019Meara and Duncan McIntrye,\nTrustees of C.C.R. Debentures:\u2014\nGentlemen, in consideration of your handing over to me this day $50,000 worth of debentures of the town of Pembroke issued under by-law No. 138, of which you are trustees, I hereby on behalf of the Canada Central Railway Company, guarantee that if the extension of the railway from the village of Renfrew to the town of Pembroke be not fully completed within the time mentioned in said by-law, then that the said Canada Central Railway Company will either return the said municipality the said debentures and coupons attached, or the value thereof in cash.\nYours, &c.,\n(Signed,)A.B. FOSTER,\nManager C.C. Railway Co.\nWho having taken back to himself from Haskell an assignment of the contract to build the road, which about two and half years previously he had assigned to him, procured his agents and nominees, the directors of the company, upon the 14th December, 1875, to pass the following resolution:\nA certified copy being produced, signed by Benjamin A. Haskell and Hon. A.B. Foster, of the retransfer made by Benjamin A. Has, kell, dated the 21st of October last, to the Hon. A.B. Foster, of the two contracts made on the 16th November, 1871, between the Canada Central Railway Co. and Hon. A.B. Foster\u2014the said transfer is hereby approved and accepted.\nWho, notwithstanding such approval of such re-transfer upon the 12th April, 1876, in his character still of manager of the company, received from the trustees of the Pembroke debentures the balance of the $75,000 authorized to be issued by the by-law, and gave a receipt therefor as follows:\nReceived, Pembroke, April 12th, 1876, from the trustees for holding of the debentures for the assistance of building the Canada Central road to Pembroke, twenty-five thousand dollars worth of debentures, being the balance of the seventy-five thousand dollars granted by By-law No. 138 of the village of Pembroke.\n(Signed),A.B. Foster,\nManager C.C. Railway. His name also appears to be subscribed as \u201cmanaging director\u201d to all the bills of lading in use by the company, and by one of his co-directors he is spoken of as a person who as matter of fact was manager of the whole thing, and that they looked upon him as the owner of the road, and by other witnesses, not upon the board, with him, but who had dealings with the company through him, and had the opportunity of observing the manner in which he openly acted before the public, he is spoken of as a person who throughout the country publicly appeared to be, and was understood to be, and acted as, managing director or manager of the company, and that if there was a higher officer than manager he was such officer, that he was upon all occasions the mouth-piece of the company\u2014its soul and body\u2014and, in fact, the company itself.\nUpon this evidence, it is to my mind by no means surprising, that a jury consisting of men of common honesty and common sense, should come to the conclusion, not only that the plaintiffs in entering into the above contract might well believe that they were entering into it with the company, acting through an agent having full power and authority to act for the company, but that in fact it was as manager of the company and upon behalf of the company that he procured the plaintiffs to build the fence, for the balance of the cost of which this action is brought, and that the company, with full knowledge of the manner in which he was dealing on their behalf, suffered him to be considered to be a person having full power to bind the company.\nBut upon behalf of the company it is contended that, as by the resolution of the 14th December, 1875, Foster was accepted by the company in the place of Haskell as the contractor to build the extension of the railway from Renfrew to Pembroke, and that, as is alleged by the company, to build the fence was part of the contract, and that, as they also allege, Foster\u2019s appointment as manager was confined to the road already open to Renfrew, the jury should have come to the conclusion that it was with Foster in his character of contractor, and not with him in his character of manager, that the plaintiffs dealt when entering into the contract.\nAll that need be said to this, is, that it was for the jury to weigh the evidence; but I must say that, in my opinion and to my mind, it seems by no means surprising that intelligent men, judging the acts and intentions of men as they naturally strike ordinary minds should attach but little weight to this contention, for it does not appear that any means were adopted to inform the public of the internal transactions of the board of directors, or of the change effected by the transfer of the contract from Haskell to Foster, or of the terms of that con tract, or of the change effected by Mr. Foster being made manager instead of managing director. There does not appear to be any reasons for supposing that the public or the plaintiffs in particular had upon the 6th January, 1876, any knowledge of the change so recently effected in the status and condition of Mr. Foster. The gentleman who succeeded him, and who, at the time of the trial, filled the office of general manager and secretary of the company, and who, as he said, has been in the employment of the company since 1869 as secretary-treasurer, or in some other capacity, tells us that he does not know that anything was done to apprise the public of the change, and he adds that:\nIt is not customary to apprise the public of changes of that kind\u2014that the public would know nothing of it without examining the books.\nHe has not said, but I think it not unlikely that if pressed he might have also said, that if any individual of the public had been so inquisitive as to ask to be permitted to inspect the books of the company for the purpose of seeing how its internal management was conducted, he would have been politely\u2014or otherwise\u2014shewn his way down stairs. Moreover, all force in the objection is further removed by looking at the contract itself, by which we find that the fencing in question formed no part of the work which any person acting under that contract was required to do; but it is said that although it forms no part of the written contract, it was intended it should form part of the work to be done, and Mr. Abbott was called by the company to establish this position\u2014whether his evidence, if closely examined, would establish this it is not necessary to enquire, for if it would, then the evidence was wholly inadmissible, as altering the terms of a contract gravely reduced to writing and deliberately executed under seal. Then again, we see, although the company now contends that the powers of Mr. Foster as manager were confined to the road already opened to Renfrew, a thing not communicated to the public in any way, he nevertheless acted in the character of manager as regards the extension from Renfrew, and for and on behalf of the company, when he received for them the debentures of the town of Pembroke, on the 2nd December, 1875, and 12th April, 1876; it is therefore not surprising if, upon this evidence, the jury should have regarded him as acting in his character of manager of the company in his dealing with the plaintiffs on the 6th January, 1876.Then it appears that, as matter of fact, the company did supply the cars to distribute the lumber as stipulated in the memorandum of agreement that they should. Mr. McKinnon, who was superintendent of the company, and who says that he knew nothing of Foster, except that he was manager, furnished the cars. He says that he himself directed that the cars should be furnished\u2014that he arranged that the cars of the company should carry the lumber and distribute it as they required it. He does not know who gave notice when the cars were required. He furnished the cars for everything required on the extension Now, during the period that the plaintiffs were building the fence, it appears that Mr. Foster was in England He went to England in May, 1876, and being still absent in September, this witness, in his capacity of superintendent, the manager being still absent, acting upon behalf of the company, made a contract with the plaintiffs for making four miles more of fencing of the same character as that described in the memo. of the 6th January, 1876, and which was paid for by the company at the same price as that stated in the above memo. The force of this evidence in support of the plaintiffs\u2019 contention was attempted to be shaken by the suggestion that the cars were supplied by the company to Foster as contractor and charged to him, but this suggestion was so little supported by evidence that it is not surprising that the jury should attach little weight to it. No agreement was attempted to be shewn to have existed between the company and Foster to the effect that the company should supply the cars to him and charge them to him, and the evidence falls far short of satisfactory proof that any such charge was ever in fact made. Nor, indeed, was there even anything in the evidence to establish that before going to England Foster ordered McKinnon to supply the cars, or, if there had been, that he gave the order in any other character than that of manager, in which character alone McKinnon says that he knew him. Upon this evidence it was, I think, very natural and very reasonable that the jury should regard the furnishing the cars by the company to distribute the lumber in the terms of the memorandum of agreement of the 6th January, 1876, as an act of the company in adoption of the terms of that agreement. Then there was abundance of evidence to prove that the secretary-treasurer of the company gave credit to the plaintiffs for money due by them to the company for freight by applying such money as payments made by the company to the plaintiffs on account of the work performed by them under this contract. The force of this fact in support of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim was attempted to be shaken by the secretary-treasurer of the company, who said that these allowances were debited to Mr. Foster and settled by him.\nThis gentleman filled the equivocal position of being Mr. Foster\u2019s general agent in his private business, and at the same time secretary-treasurer of the company. There was no evidence offered to shew that the secretary-treasurer had any authority from the company to charge to Mr. Foster the allowances so made to the plaintiffs, nor if there had been, would that fact have in any respect diminished the weight of the evidence, that the fact of the making the allowance to the plaintiffs was an act of the company in adoption of the agreement of the 6th January, 1876. The evidence, however, failed to shew that in fact any such charge against Foster was ever made in the books of the company. Mr. Baker, who was the general manager and secretary-treasurer of the company at the time of the trial, swore most distinctly that there is no entry in the books of the company of these allowances made to the plaintiffs being charged against Foster, and although the next day, after he had an opportunity of conversing with the secretary-treasurer who had applied those monies due from the plaintiffs for freight as a payment to them upon account of this contract, he attempted to explain away this evidence, it is not, I think, surprising that the jury should have thought the attempted explanation unsatisfactory, and that they should decline to accept it, and that they should arrive at the con- clusion that when the secretary-treasurer of the company applied moneys due by the plaintiffs to the company, which moneys therefore constituted assets of the company, as a setoff or payment on account of a claim made by the plaintiffs against the company for work done for the company, and of which they received the full benefit, they should hold the company to the position which such act of their officer indicated, namely, that he was acting as their servant and within the authority conferred upon him by the company.\nUpon the whole of this evidence, which displays such a singular relation existing between the company and their manager, who also appears to have held a contract under them, and who had such overwhelming control over the company that he appointed all the directors, and was suffered to appear to the public to have full authority to act in every matter on behalf of and for the company\u2014to appear in fact to be the company itself\u2014it is not at all surprising that a jury, consisting of men endowed only with ordinary capacity, should arrive at the conclusion\u2014indeed, I should think it very strange if they had not\u2014that the work performed by the plaintiff under the agreement of January 6th, 1876, and of which the company have received the benefit, was contracted for by the company through the instrumentality of their manager duly authorized in that behalf; or that at least the company, by their conduct, subsequently ratified and adopted his act as their own, and dealt with the plaintiffs upon that footing, and, I must say, that, in my judgment, it would be a great reproach upon the administration of justice if any technical rule of law should stand in the way of the plaintiffs, who have received from the defendants a portion only of their demand, recovering the balance still due to them for work of which ever since its completion, upwards of six years ago, the defendants have enjoyed, and do still enjoy the benefit. The law, however, as it is administered in modern times, is, in my opinion, open to no such reproach. In Crampton v. Varna Railvay Co.[4], where the claim, being merely for a money demand, was not enforceable in the English Court of Chancery, the Lord Chancellor, Lord Hatherley, refers to the power of the court over a company which should receive the benefit of a contract not entered into under their seal and should refuse to pay for the work. He says[5]:\nThere might be a contract without seal under which the whole railway was made, and of which the company would reap the benefit, and yet it might be said that they were not liable to pay for the making of the whole line. When such a case comes to be considered, it may be that the court, acting on well recognized principles, will say that the company shall not in such a case be allowed to raise any difficulty as to payment.\nNow, by statute law in Ontario, the courts of common law, in a common law suit, have the same powers conferred upon them, and the same duty cast upon them, to administer justice upon the same principles of equity as always governed the Court of Chancery in England in cases within its exclusive jurisdiction.\nFor the determination of the case before us, the modern case of The South Ireland Ry. Co. v. Waddle[6] in the Common Pleas, and in the Exchequer Chamber[7] is ample authority. Cockburn, C.J., in delivering the judgment of the Exchequer Chamber in that case, says:\nWe are asked to overrule a long series of decisions in all the courts, which, in accordance with sound sense, have held, that the old rule as to corporations contracting only under seal, does not apply to corporations or companies constituted for the purposes of trading; and we are invited to reintroduce a relic of barbarous antiquity. We are all of opinion that the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas ought to be affirmed. It is unnecessary to say more than that we entirely concur in the reasoning and authority of the cases referred to in the judgment of Bovill, C.J., which seems to us to exhaust the subject. In early times, no doubt, corporations could only, subject to the well known exceptions, bind themselves by contracts under seal. And for some time that rule was applied to corporations which were formed for the purpose of carrying on trade. But the contrary has since been laid down by a long series of cases and may now be considered to be settled law.\nNow, the work performed by the plaintiffs was clearly beneficial to the defendants in securing to them the full enjoyment of the railway for the purposes of constructing and working which they were given their corporate powers, and in fact was necessary for the purposes of the defendants in the successful carrying on of the trade for which they were incorporated, and the verdict of the jury has conclusively established as matter of fact that it was with the defendants through the agency of Mr. Foster, and not with Mr. Foster in his private character, that the plaintiffs contracted, and that the defendants have ratified and adopted the contract by acting under it and making payments to the plaintiffs on account of it. The defendants, therefore, ought to pay the plaintiffs the balance still due to them for the work of which the defendants enjoy the benefit\nThe appeal, therefore, should be dismissed with costs, and judgment entered for the plaintiffs upon the verdict.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Walker & McLean.\nSolicitor for respondents: Thomas Deacon.\n[1] L.R. 7 C.P. 53.\n[2] L.R. 9 Eq. 239.\n[3] 3 App. Cases Pp. 1162 and 1200.\n[4] L.R. 7 Ch.

Ritchie, C. J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne, J.J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA.\nConstitutional law\u2014Tax upon fylings in Court\u2014Indirect tax\u2014Jurisdiction of Provincial Legislature\u201443 and 44 Vic. ch. 9, s. 9 (Que.)\nBy the Quebec Act 43 and 44 Tic. ch. 9 sec. 9 it is enacted that \" A duty often cents shall be imposed, levied, and collected on each promissory note, receipt, bill of particulars, and exhibit whatsoever, produced and fyled before the Superior Court, the Circuit Court, or the Magistrates' court, such duties payable in stamps.\" The Act is declared to be an amendment and extension of the Act 27 and 28 Tic. ch. 5 \"An Act for the collection by means of stamps, of fees of office, due and duties, payable to the Crown upon law proceedings and registrations.\"By section 3, as. 2, the duties levied are to be d deemed to be payable to the Crown.\" The appellant obtained a rule nisi against the prothonotaries of the Superior Court of Montreal for contempt in refusing to receive and fyle an exhibit unaccompanied by a stamp as required by the Act. Upon the return of the rule the Attorney General for the province obtained leave to intervene and show cause.\nHeld, Reversing the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side), (Strong and Taschereau, JJ. dissenting); that the Act imposing the tax in question was ultra vires, the tax being an indirect tax and the proceeds to form part of the consolidated revenue fund of the province for general purposes.\nPer Strong and Taschereau, JJ. (dissenting),\u2014Although the duty is an indirect tax yet under secs. 65 126 and 129 of the B. N. A. Act, the Provincial Legislature had power to impose it ([1]).\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) reversing a judgment of the Superior Court for the Province of Quebec.\nThe appellant wishing to test the legality of the taxes imposed by the 43 and 44 vic, ch. 9 (Quebec), obtained a rule nisi for contempt against the prothonotaries of the Superior Court of the district of Montreal for refusing to receive and fyle an exhibit unaccompanied by stamps to the amount of ten cents.\nAfter the return of this rule the Attorney-General for the Province of Quebec obtained leave to intervene, to sustain the legality of the tax.\nThe Superior Court held that the tax was unconstitutional, and declared the rule absolute against the prothonotaries who were condemned to be imprisoned in the common gaol of the district for a period of six months, unless they sooner accepted and fyled the exhibit offered by the appellant. The prothonotaries were further condemned to pay the costs From this judgment the Attorney-General appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench which court reversed the judgment of the Superior Court.\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court of canada, the sole question submitted was the constitutionality of section 9 of the said Act 43 and 44 Vic ch. 9, (Quebec).\nThe Act is entitled: \" An Act to amend and consolidate the different acts therein mentioned in reference to stamps.\"\nSection 9 reads thus u There shall be imposed levied and collected a duty of ten cents on every writ of summons, issued out of any county circuit court, magistrate's court, or commissioner's court in the province; and a duty of ten cents shall be imposed, levied and collected on each promissory note, receipt, bill of particulars and exhibit whatsoever, produced and fyled before the superior court, the circuit court, or the magistrate's court\u2014such duties payable in stamps.\u201d\nMr. Maclaren for appellant:\nAs to whether the tax in question should be considered an indirect lax cited: Mills on Political Economy ([2]); McCullough on Taxation ([3]); Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica ([4]); Atty.-Gen. of Lower Canada v. Queen insurance Co. ([5]); Say, Trait\u00e9 d'Economie Politique ([6]); Favard le Langlade ([7]); Loughborough v. Blake ([8]); Veazie Bank v. Fenno ([9]); Glascow v. Rouse ([10]); Turner v. Smith ([11]); Severn, v. The Queen ([12]).\nBut the Hon. Mr. Justice Cross sustained the tax on entirely different grounds, viz., under the provisions of Sec. 32 of ch. 109 of the Consolidated Statutes of Lower Canada by which the Governor in Council was authorized to impose a tax upon legal proceedings to form part of the building and jury fund in each district\nThis ground had been previously well disposed of by Judge Mackay in the Superior Court, as follows: \" It has also been said that this stamp tax might have been imposed by an Order in Council under C.S. L. C., ch. 109, sec. 32, entitled ' An Act respecting Houses of Correction Court Houses and Gaols.' But it has been imposed, not by the Lieutenant Governor in Council, but by another body, the Legislature, and its proceeds are to go, not to the building and jury fund, but to the consolidated revenue fund ! The question before me is as to the power of the Legislature, not of the Governor in Council.\"\nJudge Mackay has also pointed out that the Stamp Act, 27 and 28 Vic, ch. 5, relied upon by the Attorney General, was to apply to the taxes imposed under C S. L. C ch. 109 sec. 32 only so long as such fees continue to form part of the \" Officers of Justice Fee Fund \" or \" The Building and Jury Fund \" or either of them (sec. 4, ss 2).\nSection 126 of the B. N. A. Act does not apply to the building and jury fund. The Legislature of Canada before Confederation had not, properly speaking, the power of appropriation aver it, as the monies levied under it formed a special local fund in each district, which was administered and appropriated by the sheriff for the objects indicated for the benefit of the inhabitants of the particular district and no others. Again, it is not by the B. N. A. Act reserved to the Government or Legislature of the Province of Quebec, and if it is not a direct tax it is not raised in accordance with the special powers conferred upon the Provincial Legislature by the B.N.A Act.\nIn addition to the Quebec statute referred to by Chief Justice Dorian as recognizing the fact that the building and jury fund was not merged by the B. N. A. Act in the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the \"province, (41 Vic, ch. 16) appellant would also refer to the Quebec statute 45 Vic., ch 25, \"'An Act respecting the building and Jury Fund'.\" Section 3 of this Act provides that the local municipalities shall not be called upon by the sheriff for their annual contribution of $12 to this fund when the other sources of revenue in the district are sufficient to meet the charges upon the building and jury fund of such district. If the present tax on exhibits is levied under colour of a law authorizing the imposition of a tax for the building and jury fund of the district and does not go into that fund at all but into the Consolidated Revenue Fund as appears from the Act itself and the testimony of Mr. Honey; it is such a misappropriation as should render the tax entirely null.\nBesides each of the supply bills since Confederation has recognized the separate existence of this building and jury fund.\nIts separate existence has also been recognized by the Parliament of Canada in the Insolvent Act of 1869 (32 and 33 Vic. ch. 16 sec. 152) and in the Insolvent Act of 1875 (38 Vic., ch. 16, sec. 145). These sections provided that one per cent. of the proceeds of all sales of real estate under these Acts by assignees, should be paid over to the sheriff of the district to form part of the building and jury fund of such district A number of suits for the recovery of this tax were brought by sheriffs against assignees, one of which is reported, Chauveau v. Evans ([13]) Mr. Lacoste, Q C., for the Attorney General:\nTo justify the Provincial Legislature's action, I rely on sections 92, 65 and 129 of the British North America Act and believe that under these sections the legislature had the right of imposing the 10 cents tax.\nThe paragraphs 2, 14 and 16 are the only ones to which we need refer in section 92.\nThe first of these paragraphs confers upon the Provincial Legislatures the right of imposing direct taxes, in view of raising revenue for provincial purposes; the second one gives them the administration of justice including the constitution and maintenance of tribunals, and the third one includes in their jurisdiction all matters of a local and private nature.\nAs to paragraph 14, could we not allege that the maintenance of tribunals being left to the local governments, the latter can impose taxes by way of indemnification upon the citizens who claim their intervention?\nTaking for granted, for argument sake, that these taxes constitute an indirect tax section 92 paragraph 2, gives the legislature the right to impose a direct tax for merely local purposes, when there is clearly no interference with the powers of the Federal Government\nUnder paragraph 16, all matters of a purely local nature fall within provincial jurisdiction. Then, a law concerning the maintenance of tribunals is a purely local matter.\nHow can there be a conflict with the federal power?\nCertainly, nobody will contend that the Federal Parliament would have the right of imposing a tax of such a nature.\nSeveral authors do not classify such duties among regular taxes, and among others M. de Jacob, in his treatise on the science of finances \" ([14]), does not at least so long as the collection does not exceed the costs of Judiciary establishment and maintenance. See also Esquirou de Parieu, in his \"Trait\u00e9 des impots \" ([15]).\nTaxes imposed on legal procedures are not taxes, properly speaking; but are, as says Jules Mallein, in his Consid\u00e9rations sur l'enseiornement du droit administratif ([16]) accidental dues paid as compensation for the direct service rendered by the State to the pleader.\" See also McDonell in his manual, A Survey of Political Economy ([17]); M. J. Gamier, Elements de finance ([18]); Ch. Le Hardy de Beaulieu, in his Elementary Treaty on Political Economy ([19]); M. Villiaum\u00e9, New Political Treaty ([20]); Cooley on Taxation (7).\nSupposing that this tribunal does not find a sufficient authority in section 92 of the Act of British North America to justify the imposition of the 10 cents stamp tax, we pretend that such a power is given by sections 65 and 129 of said Act.\nWhen Confederation was established, chapters 93 and 109 of the consolidated statutes of Lower Canada as modified by 27 and 28 Vic, ch. 5, were in force, and there existed under these Acts a tariff compelling parties to pay stamps on judiciary procedures.\nUnder sections 18 and 19 of chapter 93 and section 82 of chapter 109 of the consolidated statutes of Lower Canada the Grovernor in Council was authorized to change and modify this tariff and to impose new taxes, and under section 65 of the British North America Act, these powers of the Grovernor in Council have passed to the Lieutenant-Grovernor in Council.\nMoreover, it is said in section 129 that the Acts in force can be revoked, abolished, or modified by the Canadian Parliament or by the Provincial legislature in conformity to the authority of such Parliament or legislature. Could chapters 93 and 109 of the consolidated statutes of Lower Canada, and. chapter 5 of 27 and 28 Vic. be abolished or modified by the Federal Parliament? Nobody can say so. They have remained in force for the benefit of the Province of Quebec, and they apply to an object exclusively assigned to the Province of Quebec\u2014the administration of justice.\nIt is also objected that the destination of the tax imposed by the 43 and 44 Vict., chapter 9, is not the same as that of the taxes imposed under the authority of the laws in force when Confederation began Since Confederation all special funds have been merged into one fund only\u2014the consolidated fund.\nRITCHIE, C. J.:\nIn 1875, the Legislature of the Province of Quebec by the Act 39 Vic., ch. 8, for the first time imposed a tax of ten cents on the fyling of every exhibit in a cause. This tax, payable by means of stamps, was to form part of the Consolidated Revenue of the Province of Quebec (secs. 1 and 2).\nThis Act was repealed by the 43rd and 44th Vic., ch. 9, and the same tax of ten cents on fyling of exhibits was re-imposed (sec. 9). Although this Act does not expressly declare that this tax shall form part of the consolidated revenue of the province, as the repealed statute (39th Vic. ch. 8) did yet it enacts that all the duties therein mentioned shall be deemed payable to the Crown (sec. 3, sub-sec. 2), and they necessarily fall under the provision of 31st Vic. ch 9 sec. 3 which declares that all revenue whatever over which the legislature of the province has power of appropriation, shall form one consolidated fund to be appropriated for the public service of the province.\nThis special tax has therefore been imposed since the B, N. A. Act by the Legislature of the Province of Quebec, to form part of the consolidated revenue of the province. By the B. N. A. Act, 1867, sec. 92, sub-sec. 2, the legislature of each province is authorized to raise a revenue for provincial purposes by means of direct taxation, and from the other sources, such as those mentioned in sub-secs. 5, 10 and 15 which have no application to the present case.\nTo the Dominion Parliament is given the right to raise money by any mode or system of taxation sec. 91, sub-sec. 3). This right is exclusive when not coming within the classes of subjects assigned to the provincial legislatures, and as the legislatures of the Provinces are only authorized to raise a revenue by direct taxation and the other sources of revenue already mentioned, it follows that the Parliament of Canada has the exclusive right to raise a revenue by means of indirect taxes, and the legislatures of the provinces have no such right.\nThe terms of the Act seem clear on this point and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council have so interpreted them by deciding in the case of the Attorney General of Quebec v. The Queen Insurance Company ([21]) that the tax imposed on insurance companies by the Act 39th Vic?, ch. 7, of the Legislature of the Province of Quebec, was ultra vires, as not being a direct tax.\nThe 43rd and 44th Vic. ch. 9 is clearly a tax act to raise a revenue for provincial purposes, and therefore the only question is\u2014is this a direct or indirect tax?\nStamp duties were introduced into England in 1671 by a statute entitled \"An act for laying impositions on proceedings at law \" for nine years\u2014continued for three years, then expired\u2014revived in 1693, and have always been considered indirect taxes.\nThis in my opinion, is clearly an indirect tax levied for no specific purpose, but forms part of the consolidated revenue of the province for general purposes. The judgments of Mackay, J., and Dorion, C.J., are to my mind, conclusive.\nHad this been merely an easy means adopted for the purpose of collecting a fee of office for work actually performed, I might, as at present advised, be disposed to look on the matter in a very different light from what it now strikes me but this is not a fee or reward for labor, but it is a tax for raising a revenue, pure and simple, and has no more to do with the officer who fyles the paper or with the maintenance of the administration of justice than any other tax or source of revenue of which the consolidated revenue of the province is composed for the support of the government, and to promote the general interests of the people.\nI am of opinion the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the Superior Court affirmed.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nThe question presented for our decision by this appeal requires us to determine whether the 9th section of the Act 43 and 44 Vic., ch. 9, was within the powers of the Legislature of the Province of Quebec. That section is in these words:\nThere shall be imposed, levied and collected a duty of ten cents on every writ of summons, issed out of any County, Circuit Court. Magistrate's Court or Commissioner's Court in the province and a duty of ten cents shall be imposed, levied and collected on each promissory note, receipt, bill of particulars, and exhibit whatsoever produced and filed before the Superior Court, the Circuit Court, or the Magistrate's Court, such duties payable in stamps.\nA former statute, the 39th Vic., ch. 8, had imposed a similar tax of ten cents for every exhibit filed in a cause. This Act was repealed and its provisions re-enacted and consolidated with other like provisions by the statute now in question, 43 and 44 Vic, oh. 9.\nIt has been argued that this was a direct tax which the legislature had power to impose under sub-sec. 2 of sec. 92 of the B. N. A. Act. I am, however, clearly of opinion. that this contention must fail. Taxes on legal proceedings are invariably classed by scientific writers on taxation and political economy as indirect, and even though such a tax may not be indirect in the sense that the burthen of it is ultimately to be borne by a person other than he who originally pays it, it is clearly so according to the well founded definition of Mr. McCulloch ([22]), who thus distinguishes direct and indirect taxes:\nA tax (he says) may be either direct or indirect, it is said to be direct when it is taken directly from property or income, and indirect when it is taken from them by making individuals pay for liberty to use certain articles or exercise certain privileges.\nSubjected to this test, which has the sanction of a great number of similar authorities, it is apparent that the tax in question must be classed amongst indirect taxes\nThe decision of the Privy Council in the case of the Attorney General of Quebec v. The Queen Ins. Co. ([23]) is also conclusively in favor of this view.\nIt is there said that there is nothing in the B N. A Act prohibiting provincial legislatures from imposing indirect taxes; that all that sub sec. 2 of sec. 92 does, is to confer on the provincial legislatures exclusive powers to impose direct taxes, and that it does not follow that the legislatures may not have implied powers of indirect taxation.\nTo say that the provincial legislatures have powers of indirect taxation, either generally, as an inherent power without reference to any authority derived from the B. N A. Act, or as implied from the powers expressly conferred upon them, is to assume that they have, to some extent, concurrent powers with parliament, and that their powers of legislation are not limited by the subjects particularly enumerated in sec. 92. In other words, that whilst sec. 92 gives certain exclusive powers, it does not restrict provincial legislatures to those subjects. This important question was referred to, but not decided, in the case of The Union St, Jacques v. Belisle ([24]), in the Privy Council. I do not think, however, we are called upon to consider it for the purposes of this appeal, for assuming that no such power exists, and that the legislation now impugned cannot be referred either to any concurrent authority to impose indirect taxes, or to a power of taxing incidental to the express authority to legislate on the subjects comprised in sub-secs. 14 and 16 of sec. 92 it appears to me that under other provisions of the B. N. A. Act, and apart altogether from those contained in sec. 92, the imposition of this stamp duty on exhibits was not ultra vires.\nBy ch. 109 of the Consolidated Statutes of Lower Canada, which was in force at the time the B. N. A Act, 1867, was passed and came into operation, the Governor in Council of the late Province of Canada was authorized to impose taxes or duties upon legal proceedings had in any of the courts of Lower Canada and these taxes were to form part of the building and jury fund of the district in which they were collected. Subsequently by an Act passed in 1864 (27th and 28th Vic, ch. 5 sec. 4) it was enacted that these taxes or duties should be paid by means of stamps.\nBy the 65th sec. of the B. N. A. Act, 1867, it was enacted that\u2014\nAll powers, authorities and functions which under any Act of the Parliament of Great Britain or of the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland or of the Legislature of Upper Canada, Lower Canada, or Canada, were or are before or at the union vested in or exercisable by the respective Governors or with the advice and consent of the respective executive councils thereof, or in conjunction with those governors, or with any number of members thereof; or by those governors; or lieutenant-governors individually; shall; so far as the same are capable of being exercised after the Union in relation to the Government of Ontario and Quebec respectively, be vested in and shall and may be exercised by the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario and Quebec respectively; with the advice or with the advice and. consent of or in conjunction with the respective executive councils or any members thereof, or by the lieutenant governor individually as the case requires, subject nevertheless (except with respect to such as exist under the Acts of the Parliament of Great Britain or Of the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland) to be abolished or altered by the respective Legislatures of Ontario and Quebec.\nBy the 126th section of the B. N. A. Act, it was also provided that:\nSuch portions of the duties and revenues over which the respective Legislatures of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, had before the union power of appropriation, as are by this Act reserved to the respective governments or legislatures of the provinces; and all duties and revenues raise I by them in accordance with the special powers conferred upon them by this Act, shall in each province form one consolidated revenue fund to be appropriated for the public service of the province.\nIt is clear, therefore, that by force of the 65th section, the power which, by Cons. Stats. of Lower Canada, ch. 109 was vested in the Governor in Council of the former Province of Canada, of imposing taxes and duties on legal proceedings, passed to and vested in the Lieutenant-Governor in Council of the Province of Quebec. There cannot be a question as to this; it was originally a power exclusively concerning and relating to that portion of Canada which constituted the new Province of Quebec and one the exercise of which did not involve any interference With any other portion of the Dominion, or any extension of authority beyond the territorial limits of Quebec and therefore it was according to the most strict and narrow construction which could be given to the language of the 65th section, a power capable of being exercised after the union in relation to the government of Quebec. It follows, that prior to and at the time of the passing of the Provincial Act 39 Vic. oh. 8 the Lieutenant-Governor in Council of the Province of Quebec had the power of imposing a tax or duty upon each exhibit filed in the courts pursuant to the authority conferred by Cons. Stats of Lower Canada, oh. 109.\nThen, as the produce of such a tax would be in the words of section 125, a duty or revenue reserved by the B. N. A. Act to the Government of the Province of Quebec, it would, under the express provision of the last-mentioned section form part of the consolidated revenue fund of that province. it was therefore up to 1875, when the 39 Vic, ch. 8, was passed, quite within the competence of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, not merely to impose this tax or duty on the filing of exhibits, but further to provide that the proceeds of the tax, instead of being paid as before confederation, into the jury and building fund of each district, should be paid into the consolidated revenue fund of the province; indeed, it was not merely within the power of the Governor in Council to order the monies so collected to be thus disposed of, but they were by law bound to make such a disposition of them, since the tax would come under the denomination of a tax or duty reserved to the government of the province, and was also a revenue over which the Legislature of the Province of Canada, before the union, had a power of appropriation; for there can be no doubt or question that although the building and jury fund was kept apart from the consolidated revenue fund of the Province of Canada, and was to some extent a local fund, it was nevertheless a fund produced by taxes payable to the Crown, over which the Legislature of the old Province of canada had absolute powers of control and disposition. It can, therefore, be demonstrated that the Lieutenant-Governor in Council could under the Consolidated Statutes of Lower Canada, ch. 109, have done precisely what the legislature did by the Act of 1875 (39 Vic, ch. 8), have imposed a tax of ten cents on every exhibit filed in a cause such tax to be payable by stamps, and the proceeds of the sale of the stamps to be paid into the consolidated revenue of the province.\nThen, can it be said that it was any usurpation on the part of the provincial legislature when they assumed to themselves this same power which the provincial executive could under the express provisions of the Confederation Act have exercised without further legislative authority? The answer to this is also to be found in the very words of the 65th section of the B. N. A. Act, which expressly provides that the powers of that section transferred to the provincial governments shall be \" subject to be abolished or altered by the respective Legislatures of Ontario and Quebec.\" That the transfer from the executive to the legislative department of the government of the authority which had been in the manner already indicated, reserved to the Lieutenant-Governor in Council was an alteration within the meaning of the authority given to the legislature to alter powers thus vested, is surely too plain to require or even to be susceptible of argument; having the right to abolish the power altogether, it must have been competent to the legislature, under the lesser authority given to alter, to assume the exercise of it themselves, and thus to provide that these functions of legislation and taxation which in the old Province of Canada had been delegated to the Governor in Council, should in the future be attributed to and exercised by the appropriate constitutional depository of such power, the legislature itself. Under the express authority to alter contained in the 65th sec., and also under sub-sec. 1 of sec. 92, authorizing constitutional changes, the legislature could therefore have passed an Act expressly and formally revoking the authority given to the Governor in Council by Consolidated Statutes of Lower Canada, ch. 109, and providing that thereafter, the taxes, authorized by that statute to be imposed by Order in Council, should only be levied under the authority of the legislature itself. And if it could have thus expressly revoked or transferred the power in question, it could also do so by implication as well; and this it did when by 39 Vic., ch. 8 and the subsequent statutes 43 and 44 Vic., ch. 9, by which the provisions of the first mentioned Act are renewed and consolidated, it imposed the tax now called in question.\nThe foregoing is in accordance with the view taken in the Court of Queen's Bench by Mr. Justice Cross, in whose judgment I agree in every respect.\nI am therefore of opinion that the 9th section of the statute 43 and 41 Vic ch 9 was not ultra vires of the Legislature of the Province of Quebec, and that this appeal must consequently be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER, J.:\u2014\nThis question has been so fully treated by Sir A. A. Dorion that I do not see what I could add. In my opinion this is an indirect tax and therefore the local legislature had no right to impose it. I also agree with the reasons given by the Chief Justice of this Court.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nUnder the B. N. A. Act, the local legislatures were not authorized to impose any indirect tax, and it is for us to consider now whether this Act (43 & 44 Tic. ch. 9) and this Act only for that is the only one before us) was within the powers of the Quebec Legislature since 1867. The first question is\u2014is it a direct or an indirect tax ? I have no hesitation in saying that it is an indirect tax. That tax was not for the payment of juries or other purposes connected with the court but it was to be paid into the consolidated revenue fund of the province. Now, carrying out the principle that is involved, if that is within the powers of the local legislature, where is the limit to be? We might go on to any extent. The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council have decided in Attorney General of Quebec v. Queen Ins. Co. ([25]), that they could not impose a duty by stamps, because it was an indirect tax This court decided that the Legislature of Ontario had no right to levy an indirect tax on brewers because it is taken indirectly from the pockets of the consumers. Now this tax is to be taken out of the pockets of suitors and placed in the general revenue of the province. That is to all intents and purposes an indirect tax and therefore I think the legislature exceeded its powers. As to whether the legislature had that power or not, and many of the matters argued, we have already had under the consideration of this court and the decisions we have given on this very question, render it unnecessary that I should say much. I think the appeal ought to be allowed, and the judgment below reversed.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\u2014\nI am of opinion with the Superior Court of Montreal, and the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Queen's Bench, that the tax in question here is not a direct tax, and that it is by direct taxation only that the provincial legislatures can raise a revenue for provincial purposes. I am also of opinion that the said tax is what the statute itself calls it really a tax or duty and not a fee of office under ch. 93 of the Consolidated statutes L.C. The fees of the officers of the court have not been increased and were not intended to be increased by the Act impugned; they do not collect it neither does it inure to their benefit in any way. On these three points, we are, I believe, unanimous. I am however, of opinion that the section of the Act 83 and 34 Vic. ch. 9, imposing this duty of ten cents on each exhibit is not ultra vires, and this upon the following ground.\nBefore confederation the Governor in Council could clearly, under sec. 32, ch. 109, of the C. S. L. C., have imposed such a tax or duty, payable in stamps by the Act of 1864. Under secs. 65 and 129 of the B. N. A. Act, this power was continued to the Lieutenant Governor in Council and under these two sections the exclusive power to repeal or alter the said provisions of the said chapter of the consolidated statutes or of the said Act of 1864, was vested in the provincial legislature. The provincial legislature, consequently, must have, and alone have, complete control over the building and jury fund created under the said chapter of the consolidated statutes, including the power to abolish it, and to enact that it shall form part of the consolidated revenue. Before confederation under the union of the two Canadas, the consolidated fund was, of course, a fund common to both of these provinces, so that, in order to prevent local revenues raised for special local expenses, expenses personal to one province, from inuring to the benefit of the other province, it was necessary to create special funds of the kind in question. Each province levied such taxes for itself alone and not at all for the benefit of the other, nor, in other words for the consolidated general revenue fund, which belonged to the two provinces jointly. But, since confederation this reason does not exist. The consolidated fund of each province belongs, in its integrity, to that province and is under exclusive provincial control\nAnd if the Province of Quebec has either expressly or impliedly, by the provisions of the 31 Vic, ch. 9, sec. 3 or by those of the particular enactment now impugned, abolished the building and jury fund, and thrown the proceeds of it into its consolidated revenue fund it has it seems to me, dealt with nothing but what is under its legislative control, or done nothing but what it had full power to do under the B. N. A. Act. It has imposed an additional tax, it is true, but has it not the power-and the exclusive power\u2014to do so (not for general provincial purposes, but for the same purposes as those for which the said provisions of the consolidated statutes were enacted) and this, as a consequence of the power to alter or amend them. It might be that, if in a proper case, it was alleged and proved that, for the whole province, the expenses of the administration of justice are more than covered by the duties imposed on the law proceedings, and, if it was demonstrated that the legislature, under pretence of providing for these expenses, has attempted, in evasion of the provisions of the B. N. A. Act to raise a revenue for general provincial purposes by indirect taxation on these law proceedings, the courts would then interfere and declare that these legislatures cannot in violation of the law so enlarge the powers conferred upon them. But there is no issue of that kind raised here. What Mr. Honey, the prothonotary of Montreal, examined as a witness in this case says on this subject, does not relate to all the expenses connected with the Montreal Court House, and, moreover, has no application to the province at large, in which it is notorious that the deficit in the revenues connected with the administration of justice is very large. Then, it seems to me the difference between the building and jury fund and the consolidated revenue is merely one of book-keeping. What has been paid to the building and jury fund before confederation, under the Act of of 1864, was deemed payable to the Crown, though for a special purpose only, and what was due to it was recoverable by the Crown. And that this tax of ten cents is ultra vires, because it is also, by the Act imposing it, declared to be deemed payable to the Crown, is what I cannot see. On the contrary, it seems to me clear that the provincial legislature alone had the power to pass an enactment like the one impugned, and to enact, as a matter of procedure, as it did by the same statute that no exhibit shall be received in the courts of justice if not bearing this ten cent stamp. The Dominion Government has certainly not that power. So if the Provincial Government did not have it it would follow that since confederation there would be no power anywhere to provide for the expenses of the administration of justice in the Province of Quebec, on the system and basis existing before confederation. It would follow that if a new procedure was introduced as for instance, has been done by the introduction of the writ of injunction in 1878. the province would have no power to impose any duty on that particular proceeding or act of procedure, or that if a new court was created, as was, for instance, the District Magistrates Court, all the proceedings in that court would be entirely free from all such tax.\nThese Acts of the consolidated statutes and of 1864 formed part of what was, at confederation, known as the Acts concerning the administration of justice in the province and the procedure in civil matters in the courts of the province, and as such they have been by the B. N. A. Act left under the exclusive control of the provincial legislature.\nThe Act 31 Vic, ch. 2, imposed for the building and jury fund before confederation, repealed by the Act now impugned reenacted that all such duties and taxes were to be deemed payable to the Crown. Then before confederation, the Act of 1864, as to these very duties, is entitled: \u201dAn Act for the collection, by means of stamps of fees of office, dues and duties payable to the Crown \"\u2014and its preamble says: \" Whereas it is expedient that all fees and charges payable to the Crown.\" By sec. 9 thereof, \u201c it specially enacted that all the fees, dues, duties, taxes and charges payable under the said Acts and parts of Acts (including those for the building and jury fund) shall be considered to be fees, dues, duties, taxes and charges payable to the Crown for the purposes of this Act.\" Is it not clear that all these duties, since they have been first enacted, have always been considered to be deemed payable to the Crown? They are received and paid to certain officers, but these officers receive it for the Crown; what is so paid them is paid to the Crown.\nAnd the argument that because 31 Vic ch. 9 sec. 3 enacts that all revenues subject to provincial control are to form part of the consolidated fund this new tax must also fall in that fund seems to me untenable. Ever since the 9 Vic, ch. 114, confirmed by 10-11 Vic, ch. 71, of the Imperial statutes (ch. 14, of the Consolidated Statutes of Canada) it had been likewise for the old provinces enacted that all revenues, subject to provincial control should form a consolidated revenue fund, Yet this did not and could not prevent the Legislature of Canada (before confederation) from creating for the Province of Quebec the building and jury fund and its revenues. If the appellant's contention that this new tax is illegal simply because it is declared to be deemed payable to the Crown was to prevail, it would follow that all such taxes of the same king levied since confederation are also illegal, and have been illegally levied since they also were all deemed payable to the Crown, and I do not believe that the appellant would be prepared to go so far. As a matter of fact, I may remark here, both the Quebec Provincial Legislature and the Dominion Parliament have, since confederation, recognized the existence of this building and jury fund, the former by, amongst others, 41 Vic. ch. 16, and 45 Vic., ch. 25, and the latter by the Insolvency Act of 1869, sec. 152, and the Insolvency Act of 1875, see. 145.\nIt must also be observed that this Act 43 and 41 Vic. ch. 9, is under one of its special provisions (sec. 20) to be read as forming part of the said Stamp Act of 1864, which, in its turn, must be read in connection with the said ch. 109 of the Consolidated Statutes. But whether or not this building and jury fund has been abolished seems to me immaterial I say that if it still exists, the proceeds of this new tax must go to it, though they are, by the Act, deemed payable to the Crown the same as all similar taxes imposed before confederation, which, though also deemed payable to the Crown, go to that fund; and if there is now no such special fund, it is no objection to the legality of this tax that it goes to the consolidated revenue wherein that special fund has merged the same as similar taxes imposed before confederation, which, must now all go to that consolidated fund.\nAs to the ground that this is a new or an additional tax, I have already said:\n1st. That, although an indirect tax, it is not a tax for the general revenue of the province.\n2nd. That the provincial legislature has the power, under secs. 65 and 129 of the B. N. A. Act to alter amend the Acts under which similar taxes existed on law proceedings at confederation.\n3rd. That, consequently, the provincial legislature could impliedly, as it has done by the enactment objected to, (as it can expressly) take away from the Lieutenant Governor in Council the powers he had in virtue of the said Acts and itself exercise these powers; that therefore, the provincial legislature has the power not only to abolish or diminish the said taxes or to transfer a particular tax from one proceeding to another, but that it can also legally impose a tax or duty of a similar nature on proceedings or acts of procedure on which none were imposed at the time of confederation, and I presume, though unnecessary to decide for the purposes of the present case, on any new act of procedure created since confederation, provided that the province, in the exercise of this power confines itself to the raisins of a revenue to meet the expenses of the administration of justice on the system and basis in existence before confederation\nGWYNNE, J.: \u2014\nThe real question involved in this case appears to me to be, whether any limit, and if any to what extent, is set by the B. N. A. Act to the power of the provincial legislatures to raise revenue by taxation. The scheme of the framers of our Federal Constitution, to provide means for the support of the provincial governments and legislatures, consisted primarily in a subsidy to be paid to each province in proportion to its population, as ascertained by the census of 1861. Accordingly by the 118th sec. of the B. N. A. Act, such subsidy is provided to be paid by the Dominion of Canada to the respective provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. By this subsidy, supplemented by such revenue raised by taxation as is authorized by the 92nd sec. of the Act, together with the public property and assets assigned to each province, all the expense attending the carrying on the several provincial governments must be defrayed. Now, by the second item of sec. 92, the legislatures of each province are authorized to make laws in relation to direct taxation within the province, in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial purposes; by the 9th item of the same section they are authorized to make laws in relation to shop, tavern, auctioneer and other licenses, in order to the raising a revenue tor provincial, local or municipal purposes; and by the 15th item they are authorized to make laws in relation to the imposition of punishment by fine, penalty or imprisonment for enforcing any law of the province made in relation to any matter coming within any of the classes of subjects enumerated in see. 92. These are the only sections which expressly authorize the raising, by any act of the provincial legislatures, any revenue whatever by any system of taxation. The public property and assets transferred to each province constitute an additional source of revenue, but at present we have to deal only with the power of the respective legislatures to raise by taxation a revenue for provincial purposes.\nThe express provision made by item 2, which while it authorizes the legislatures to make laws, in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial purposes by taxation limits the exercise of the authority thus conferred to direct taxation, very clearly excludes, in my judgment, the power of raising a revenue by any species of taxation other than direct; but it is contended that this is not so, and that as there is no express clause in the Act prohibiting indirect taxation, the provincial legislatures have implied power to raise revenue by indirect taxation to defray the expenses attending the exercise of their jurisdiction over each and every subject placed by the 92nd section under their exclusive control, and that the particular tax in question here being a stamp tax on legal proceedings, even though it be not a direct tax, is authorised by the 14th item of section 92 which places the administration of justice, and among other things, the maintenance of provincial courts, under the control of the provincial legislatures; the contention being that for the maintenance of the courts and the administration of justice, the provincial legislatures have by force of this item, No. 14, implied authority to raise a revenue by indirect taxation. But that the maintenance of provincial courts and the administration of justice are provincial purposes there can be no doubt, they are therefore comprehended within the purview of item 2 of section 92, which in express terms prescribes direct taxation as the mode of taxation to be adopted for raising revenue for provincial purposes, so that upon the principal of expressum facil cessare tacitum, there can be no such implied power involved in this item 14 as is insisted upon; moreover, if the contention were sound, then upon the same principle they could equally pass an Act imposing a special tax of an indirect character for the payment of provincial officers under a power implied under item 4 of this 92nd section, and another Act imposing another special tax, also of an indirect character, to defray the expense attending the establishment, maintenance and management of public and reformatory prisons, under the powers conferred by item 6, and another to defray the expense attending the establishment, maintenance and management of hospitals, asylums, &c., under the powers conferred by item 7; and, as in fact is boldly contended, other Acts imposing indirect taxation to defray the expenses attending the maintenance and management of all matters of a merely local and private nature, and so the effect would be, that this implied power of raising revenue by indirect taxation, which it is contended the legislatures have, being exercised as it might be if they have the power, to raise sufficient revenue to defray all the expenses of the government and legislatures in respect of all the several matters under their control and jurisdiction, it would be quite unnecessary for them to exercise the power conferred by item 2, raising by direct taxation a revenue for provincial purposes, or to draw upon the revenue created by the subsidy paid by the Dominion or by sale of the public property, or other income arising therefrom, or from the assets assigned to each province, such a contention appears to me to involve so palpable a reductio ad absurdum as to carry with it its own refutation; and indeed the judgment of the Privy Council in the Attorney General of Quebec v. The Queen Insurance Co. ([26]) in effect decides that the provincial legislatures cannot by any act of theirs authorize the raising a revenue by any mode of taxation other than direct.\nIt was further argued that inasmuch as (as was contended) the Lieutenant Grovernor of Quebec could under the 129th sec. of the B. N. A. Act impose the very tax which the Quebec Statutes 89 Vic. ch. 8 and 43 and 44 Vic., ch. 9, profess to impose, therefore it must be competent for the legislature by an act of legislation to impose a tax which the Lieutenant Grovernor by an Act in Council could impose. Independently of the objection, which I have already urged, that there beings given by the B. N. A. Act express power to the provincial legislatures with reference to taxation, and that being of a particular and limited character, no power of a different and an unlimited character can he implied the contention under consideration, which however is not in my opinion, raised before us in this case, proceeds upon the assumption that the Lieutenant Grovernor could impose the tax in question\u2014a position which as it appears to me requires for its establishment something more than its assumption\u2014for if the legislature of the province has only power to impose direct taxation, and if the tax in question be not a direct tax it would seem to be inconsistent that the Lieutenant Governor, could since confederation, impose indirect taxation as a source of revenue for a provincial purpose which by the Constitutional Charter, under which both Lieutenant Governor and Legislature exist, the Legislature has no power to impose. The question which in such case appears to me to arise is whether the Acts in virtue of which the Governor General of the late province of Canada had before confederation, power to impose taxes of the nature of the tax in question, can be Acts whose provisions are continued by the 129th sec. of the B. N. A. Act which enacts that except as otherwise provided by the B. N.A. Act, all laws in force, &c., shall continue, &c., &c., whether in fact, if the legislature is prevented by the provisions of the B. N. A. Act, from raising a revenue by indirect taxation, the imposition of such a mode of taxation by the Lieutenant Governor in Council is not prevented also; and whether the provision limiting the power of the legislature to the imposition of direct taxation is not such a provision otherwise as would exclude the Act under which such taxes had been imposed by the Governor in Council before confederation, from the operation of the 129th section of the B.N. A, Act? The 65th section appears to me to relate to acts of the Lieutenant Governor necessary for carrying on the government merely, and that unless the Lieutenant Governor has authority to impose this tax under section 129 he cannot have it under section 65. Unless the law or Act authorizing the imposition is continued by section 129 it is plain the Lieutenant Governor could not impose it under section 65. Here the question, however, is, whether the Acts or Act of the Legislature of Quebec, professing to impose the tax in question are or is ultra vires? and the answer to that question depends upon the single point, namely: whether the tax is or not a direct tax? for the legislatures have not, as it appears to me, any power to raise a revenue for any provincial purpose by any mode of taxation otherwise than direct. The whole expense of government and legislation for provincial purposes, which terms comprehend the whole expense attending all provincial purposes placed under the control of the Provincial Government and Legislature must be defrayed out of the produce of the public property, and assets assigned to each province, and the subsidy paid to the province by the Dominion\u2014supplemented, if these sources of revenue should be insufficient by taxation of a direct character only in addition to the money raised under the special authority given by clauses 9 and 15 of section 92 And as I am of opinion that the tax in question is not a direct tax, a point in my opinion, concluded by the judgment of the Privy Council in the Attorney-General v. The Queen Insurance Co., the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: MacLaren & Leet.\nSolicitor for respondent: A.

It appeared that the draft when made, and when received by T. et al, had no stamps; that they knew then that bills and promissory notes required to be stamped, but never gave it a thought and their first knowledge that the bill was not stamped was when they gave it to their attorney for collection on the 26th February, 1880, and they immediately put on double stamps.\nThe bill was received in evidence, leave being reserved to the defendant to move for a non-suit; the learned judge stating his opinion that though as a fact the plaintiffs knew the bill was not stamped when they received it, and knew that stamps were necessary, they accidentally and not intentionally omitted to affix them till their attention was called to the omission in February, 1880.\nHeld, 1. That the question as to whether the holder of a bill or draft has affixed double stamps upon an unstamped bill or draft so soon as the state of the bill was brought to his knowledge within the terms of 42 Vic., ch. 12, sec. 13, is a question for the judge at the trial and not for the jury. (Gwynne, J., dissentting.)\n2. That the \"knowledge\" referred to in the Act is actual knowledge and not imputed or presumed knowledge, and that the evidence in this case showed that T. acquired this knowledge for the first time on the day he affixed stamps for the amount of the double duty, 26th February, 1880.\n3. That the want of proper stamps or proper stamping in due time is not a defence which need be pleaded (Gwynne, J., dissenting).\nAppeal from the decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, refusing a motion that the verdict in this cause be set aside, and a non-suit entered[1].\nThis was an action brought by the respondents as payees against the appellant as acceptor of a bill of exchange.\nThe first count of the declaration is on the acceptance, by the defendant, of the draft of one David S. Howard, dated 26th December, 1880, for $500, in favor of the plaintiffs. The declaration also contained the usual common counts. The only plea material to the case is the first, which traverses the acceptance of the draft. The cause was tried on the 10th August, 1881, at the St. John Circuit Court, before his honor Mr. Justice Duff. The only question involved in the case was as to the sufficiency of the stamping.\nThe evidence on the point was, that the plaintiffs received the draft about a fortnight or a month after it was drawn; that the plaintiff, James A. Tufts, who was the witness, knew then that notes and bills required stamps, but never gave it a thought; that he did not put stamps on it until it was being sued; that his first knowledge that it was not stamped was when his attorney called attention to it on 26th February, 1880; that he then immediately put on double stamps and cancelled them; that he had the management of this, his brother and co-plaintiff having been away, and having had nothing to do with it.\nThe counsel for the defendant claimed on the trial that it was not competent for the person who had the bill in his possession, with the knowledge that bills of that kind required stamps, to make the bill good by acts such as those of Mr. James Tufts, as above detailed. He did not claim that there was any evidence of the plaintiffs having had any knowledge, in fact, that the draft was not stamped, any sooner than the time stated by the only witness who was called in the case, viz.: on the 26th February, 1880, at which time the double stamps were put on and duly cancelled.\nThe counsel for the plaintiffs claimed that double stamps having been put on by the holder, and duly cancelled as soon as he acquired knowledge of the defect, (\"plaintiff put double stamps as soon as he becomes aware of the defect;\") the acceptance was rendered legal and valid under 42 Vic. ch. 17.\nMr. Justice Duff received the draft in evidence, reserving leave to enter a non-suit if the draft was improperly received in evidence.\nThe motion of counsel for the defendant was, \"That the verdict in the above cause be set aside, and a non-suit entered;\" and the court, having taken time to consider, ordered\u2014\" That the said motion be refused.\"\nMr. Davies, Q.C., appeared for appellants, and Mr. Travis for respondents. RITCHIE, C.J.:\nThis was an action on a bill of exchange by the drawees against the acceptor, tried at the St. John Circuit Court before Mr. Justice Duff.\nThe only question involved is as to the sufficiency of the stamping. It was, in my opinion, the duty of the learned judge, under the statute 42 Vic., ch. 17, to determine whether the bill, on its face, was properly stamped or not properly stamped, and as I think the evidence shows that the respondent paid the double duty so soon as he acquired the actual knowledge that the bill was not properly stamped, the bill was properly received in evidence, and the judgment in the plaintiff's favor should be affirmed.\nSTRONG, J.:\nThe question, whether the plaintiffs affixed double stamps so soon as the unstamped state of the bill was brought to their knowledge, within the terms of sec. 13 and 20, ch. 17, was, as it appears to me, by the express provisions of that section, a question for the determination of the judge at the trial, and not one to be tried by the jury. It was a question of fact, upon the decision of which the admissibility or rejection of a document tendered in evidence was made to depend, and like all such issues, was one to be tried not by the jury but by the judge. And this being so, I am of opinion that the want of proper stamps or proper stamping in due time is not a defence which ought to be pleaded, inasmuch as the rules of pleading only require such defences founded upon facts as the jury might be called upon to try to be placed upon the record. In my view, therefore, Mr. Justice Duff took the proper course at the trial in dealing with the question himself, instead of treating it as one for the jury.\nThis view is warranted by the express words of the section, \"to the satisfaction of the court or a judge,\" which I construe according to their primary meaning as excluding a jury. These words \"to the satisfaction\" have relation as well to the payment of double duty by the holder as soon as he acquired knowledge as to the other condition that the omission should be through error and mistake, and without any intention to violate the law; both questions are clearly made triable by the judge alone. Then, this being so, it was quite competent for the court in banc to reverse the finding of the learned judge at the trial on this preliminary issue.\nThe learned judge finds substantially that it was through error and mistake and unintentionally that stamps were not affixed as soon as the bill came to the plaintiffs' hands, but he also finds that the plaintiffs knew when they received the bill that it was unstamped. The latter part of the finding the majority of the court below have thought unwarranted by the evidence\u2014a conclusion in which I entirely agree. I can find nothing in the evidence to warrant us in holding that the plaintiff, James A. Tufts, had any knowledge of the unstamped state of the instrument at any earlier date than that at which he swears he first became aware of it. He says his first knowledge that the bill was unstamped was when Mr. Travis, his solicitor, called his attention to it on 26th February, 1880, when he immediately put on double stamps and cancelled them. There is no evidence in any way to vary or neutralize this in the slightest degree. And unless we are bound to say that because the bill had been for some time preceding the date of the stamping in the plaintiffs' possession, they must be presumed to know it was not stamped, it will be impossible for us to come to any conclusion different from that arrived at by the Supreme Court of New Brunswick. The object of the enactment of which the plaintiff claims the benefit was clearly to relieve persons from loss through innocent inadvertence to pay the duty, and if we were to hold that imputed or constructive, and not actual knowledge was meant, we should be going far to do away with the efficacy of the section, as affording a means of relief against innocent error and mistake, and that without anything in the language of the statute requiring such a construction. I am, therefore, of opinion that \"knowledge\" means actual and not imputed or presumed knowledge; and this the evidence shows the plaintiff acquired for the first time on the day he affixed stamps for the amount of the double duty.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER, J., concurred.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nThe question was raised here whether a plea of the absence of proper stamps was necessary to be filed before the defendant could obtain the benefit of the evidence of the want of them. In the statute which provides that a bill or note not properly stamped shall not be sufficient, we have mentioned what kind of a bill would be sufficient to enable a party to recover. The statute settles that, and provides that, where the maker did not put on the stamp corresponding with the date and obliterate it when it is made, the party to whom the note is given, as soon as he discovers it is not stamped or is not sufficiently stamped, by putting on double the number deficient, with the date of his doing so, is enabled to make that which was useless before a good and available document. When a note or bill is produced and bears the stamping by the party who makes it, it is on view before the judge a sufficient document, and it would be for the other party to show that there was some reason, either that it was not stamped at the time, or give some other reason, why the stamp as affixed should not be considered sufficient. When a party denies the acceptance of a bill or the making of a note, he virtually denies the making of a legal and available document, and I think it is not necessary for the party to plead the want of stamps. It refers to a bill that the other party could recover on at law. The denial of the acceptance throws upon the other party the onus of proving a valuable document upon which he is entitled to bring the action. In this case the party in whose favor the bill was drawn received it without any stamps, and the evidence goes to show that, as soon as he became aware of the fact, he put on the legal number of stamps. It was a question then that might or might not be tried by the judge. The judge, in the first place, would be bound to receive the document on the trial, and it might be a question for him afterwards to decide whether there was any evidence on the other side which would do away with the testimony of the plaintiff. If there were contradictory evidence, it would, I take it, be left to the jury, but the judge was bound to decide whether on the face of it it was a good and available document. Under these circumstances, then, I think the judge did right so far as he gave effect to the bill, but I must say that I think his judgment was a little contradictory, and I think that, the only evidence being the evidence of one of the plaintiffs in regard to the fact of his own knowledge of the stamping of the bill, and that not being in any way attacked by counter evidence, I can only say that I for one, sitting as a judge, would have no hesitation in saying that the evidence was sufficient under the law. So that, although the judge decided in that way, it is more a legal decision than it is a decision on the evidence. Under these circumstances, I think the plaintiff is entitled to recover. He proved, I think, that he was not aware that the bill was not stamped, and I agree with my learned brother Strong in stating that, under the statute, it is actual knowledge that is required. If a party knows the bill is not stamped, and does not act upon that knowledge and put on the stamps, then, of course, he is liable to the consequences, but, if a man without knowing it puts a bill into his drawer or his safe, keeps it two or three months, takes it out again, and discovers it is not stamped or not sufficiently stamped, I think the statute provides for that. I therefore think the appeal should be dismissed, and the judgment below confirmed.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nIn my judgment the learned judge who presided at the trial of this case would have erred if he had ruled upon the case as presented at the trial, that there was no case to go to the jury and that the plaintiffs should be non-suited. As the plaintiffs could not be non-suited against their will, what was contended for is, in effect, that unless they should be willing to accept a non-suit the learned judge should have told the jury that there was no case to go to them, and that therefore their duty was to render their verdict for the defendant. The question depends upon the proper construction to be put upon the 2nd section of 37 Vic. ch. 47.\nThe action was brought by the plaintiffs as payees against the defendant as acceptor of a bill of exchange. To this action the defendant pleaded non accepit, upon which plea issue was joined, and the issue was brought down for trial by a jury. On the bill being produced, it appeared to bear date the 26th December, 1879, to be for the sum of $500, and to have on it bill stamps to the amount of 30c. marked \"cancelled F. T. & Co., Feb. 16, '80.\" There was no plea upon the record that the bill was not properly stamped. The stamps appearing upon it were consistent with the fact of the bill having been stamped at a time and in a manner authorized by law; but whether there existed any fact or circumstance which would render the stamps so put on insufficient in point of law was a point which, it must be admitted, was not raised by the plea of non accepit. Our act is quite different in this respect from the English act, which prohibits a bill not stamped being received in evidence, and therefore in England under a plea of non accepit an objection of want of a stamp does necessarily arise, because a bill not stamped being inadmissible in evidence, a defendant upon issue joined to a plea of non accepit must prevail, no bill being produced. He succeeds simply by reason of the plaintiff being unable to produce a bill, the existence of which the plea denies. It was assumed, however, by all parties at the trial, that the plea did put in issue all such questions as might be raised by the evidence, by reason of the stamps not having been, if they should appear not to have been, put upon the bill and cancelled at a time and in a manner authorized by law; the most favorable light therefore for the defendant in which we can entertain the point argued on this appeal is to treat the question, as it should be treated, upon an issue joined on pleadings in express terms raising the question. The plea in such a case would be to the effect that the bill had no stamps put upon it when it was drawn or accepted, and that the plaintiffs when they became holders of the bill acquired the knowledge that the bill was defective for want of stamps, and did not as soon as they acquired the knowledge that the bill was so defective by reason of the stamp duty not having been paid thereon, pay double duty thereon by affixing stamps to the amount of such double duty, and cancelling them as required by law in that behalf, but wilfully neglected so to do, and afterwards, to wit, a long time after they had acquired such knowledge that the bill was so defective as aforesaid, to wit, on the 26th February, 1880, put on and cancelled the stamps appearing on the said bill; by reason whereof and by force of the statute in that behalf, the said bill hath become and is invalid in law and equity. To this plea the plaintiffs, as appears by the evidence given at the trial, might have replied in substance to the effect that they first became holders of the bill some time after, to wit, a fortnight after it was drawn and accepted, and that they did not, when they first became such holders, nor until the 26th day of February, 1880, acquire knowledge that the said bill was defective for the reasons in the said plea alleged, and immediately upon their acquiring such knowledge they did upon the same 26th day of February affix stamps to the said bill to the amount of double the duty payable at the time of the drawing of the bill, and did cancel such stamps in the manner required by law; issue being joined on this replication would have effectually raised the point of fact to be tried, and the jury sworn to try that issue would have been the sole constitutional tribunal to render a verdict upon it. Now, the only evidence given at the trial upon the point was that given by James A. Tufts, one of the plaintiffs, whose evidence, as I read it, upon the case submitted to us, is, in substance, that although he knew that bills and notes require stamps, yet that the first knowledge he had that the bill in question was not stamped, was when Mr. Travis, his attorney, called his attention to it, Feb. 26th, 1830, and that he then immediately put on double stamps and cancelled them. He added, that he had the management of the matter; that his brother, the other plaintiff, had nothing to do with it. It was not objected or suggested at the trial that the other plaintiff should have been called; the naked contention of the defendant's counsel was that upon the evidence of James A. Tufts, as above, there was no case to go to the jury, and that of plaintiff's counsel was, that by the provisions of 37th Vic., ch. 47, sec. 2, the double stamping on the 26th Feb., 1880, was sufficient in law.\nThis section enacts that any holder of a bill of exchange or promissory note may pay double duty by affixing to such instrument a stamp or stamps to the amount thereof, or to the amount of double the sum by which the stamps affixed fall short of the proper duty, and by writing his initials on such stamp or stamps, and the date on which they were affixed; and wherein any suit or proceeding in law or equity the validity of any such instrument is questioned by reason of the proper duty thereon not having been paid at all, or not paid by the proper party, or at the proper time, or of any formality as to the date or erasure of the stamps affixed having been omitted, or a wrong date placed thereon, and it appears that the holder thereof when he became such holder had no knowledge of such defects, such instrument shall be held to be legal and valid, if it shall appear that the holder thereof paid double duty as in this section mentioned so soon as he acquired such knowledge, even although such knowledge shall have been acquired only during such suit or proceeding.\nNow, it is obvious that, whether the double stamps were affixed so soon as the plaintiffs acquired knowledge that the bill had not had affixed to it stamps to cover the single duty, was a question of fact which, assuming the point to have been properly in issue, it was the duty and province of the jury alone to solve. It was exclusively the province of the jury to determine what weight should be attached to the evidence of James A. Tufts, and what was the proper conclusion to arrive at in respect of the matter testified to by him. In arriving at this conclusion, it would have been quite proper for the jury to consider the fact admitted by him, that he knew that bills and notes required stamps, and also to take into consideration the means he had of acquiring knowledge, that a bill received by him in the course of his business had no stamps affixed to it when he received it; but as means of knowledge is not actual knowledge, all these considerations were but aids in enabling the jury to determine whether in point of fact they should find by their verdict that the plaintiff first acquired the knowledge, as testifie by him, on the 26th February, 1880. It was the exclusive province of the jury to weigh evidence, to draw inferences of fact\u2014to find the fact, and accordingly as they should find that single material fact, to render their verdict for or against the plaintiffs.\nThere is nothing in the Act of Parliament to justify a contention that the Legislature contemplated so to neutralize\u2014and in fact to revolutionize\u2014trial by jury, as to authorize a judge presiding at a trial of an action the issues of fact in which the parties have put themselves upon a jury to try, to take from the jury the sole material question of fact it had been sworn to try and to substitute himself for the jury. When a judge tries questions of fact without a jury, he is by law substituted for a jury, and his duty is to find facts as a jury should, and his verdict is open to review if it should be arrived at by improper inferences drawn by him, or if it should be plainly at variance with the evidence; but where the parties have put themselves upon a jury, called and sworn to try issues of fact joined, and a true verdict to render according to the evidence, there is no law which authorizes a judge to withhold from the jury the evidence bearing upon those issues of fact and to substitute himself for the jury, and this was what in effect the judge in this case was asked by the defendant's counsel to do, and what he would have done if he had ruled that there was no evidence to go to the jury, and that the plaintiffs should be non-suited. Even in a case where a question of reasonable and probable cause arises (which is held to be a legal question for a judge to determine) if the existence or non-existence of the reasonable and probable cause depends upon the existence or non-existence of certain facts, the jury must pass upon the facts before the judge can apply the law. The proper charge in the case before us would be that it was for the jury to say whether, all things considered, they believed the witness, James A. Tufts, when he swore that his first knowledge of the bill not having been stamped was acquired on the 26th February, 1880, and to render their verdict for the plaintiffs or defendant accordingly, as they should find upon that fact; but, as no question is raised here as to whether the point for the jury to determine was or not left to them with a proper direction, but simply whether there was any evidence to go to the jury, all that we have to do is to express our opinion upon that point, and, in my judgment, there can be no doubt that there was, and to have ruled otherwise would have been erroneous. It is, however, contended that a paragraph in the second section of 37 Vic., ch. 47, not quoted above, but which comes immediately after that which I have quoted, has the effect of substituting the opinion of the judge for the finding of the jury upon the material question of fact in dispute, and that as he intimated his opinion to be that Mr. Tufts (although, as a fact, he knew the bill had no stamps on it when he received it, and that stamps were necessary) accidentally, and not intentionally, omitted to affix them until his attention was called to the omission by Mr. Travis in February, 1880, the effect of such intimation of opinion was to require the case to be withdrawn from the jury, and to entitle the defendant to have a judgment of non-suit entered. This contention appears to me to be based upon a misconception of the paragraph referred to. If the defendant's contention be correct, then it is apparent that the effect of the section referred to would be, not by express language, but by implication, to neutralize, and, in fact, to revolutionize trial by jury, a construction which would require the most express and unequivocal language to justify. The paragraph is:\nAnd if it shall appear in any such suit or proceeding to the satisfaction of the court or judge, as the case may be, that it was through mere error or mistake and without any intention to violate the law on the part of the holder, that any such defect as aforesaid existed in relation to such instrument,\u2014then such instrument or any endorsement or transfer thereof shall be held legal and valid, if the holder shall pay the double duty thereon, so soon as he is aware of such error or mistake, but no party who ought to have paid duty thereon shall be released from the penalty by him incurred as aforesaid.\nNow, what is meant by the words \"if it shall appear, &c., to the satisfaction of the court or judge, as the case may be,\" especially of the words \"as the case may be.\" The section, it is to be observed, is providing in respect of a question arising in a suit or proceeding in law or equity. Such questions in the ordinary course of the practice of courts of equity arise there sometimes before a single judge, sometimes before the full court, and in such cases the court or judge is judge of facts as well as of law. In law the question might arise before a single judge trying the case without a jury, in which case the judge discharges the functions of a jury, but more usually it arisen before a Court of Assize and nisi prius, of which court a jury is a constituent part, having exclusive jurisdiction over all questions of fact. The words then \"as the case may be,\" plainly, as it appears to me, apply to the case of the question arising either in a court of which a jury is a constituent part, or before a single judge or a court consisting of more judges than one acting as a jury; before whatever tribunal, as the case may be, that the question arises in the suit or proceeding in law or equity, it is still the tribunal for determining facts in such case, to whose satisfaction the point of fact referred to must be made to appear. The tribunals referred to in the second paragraph are precisely the same as those referred to in the prior one, under the words:\nWhenever in any suit or proceeding in law or equity the validity of any instrument is questioned by reason of the proper duty not having been paid, &c., it appears that the holder thereof, &c.\nTo hold that a judge presiding at a jury trial may, under this language, withhold from the jury sworn to try the issues joined all consideration of the material matter of fact involved in such issues and assume to find the fact himself, would be, in my judgment, to put a forced and most unnatural construction upon the language used. The object of the first part of the section is to enable every holder (subject always to the liability to pay the pecuniary penalty imposed by the Act) to affix stamps for double duty to, and so to rehabilitate, a bill or note which had not a sufficient number of, or any, stamps to cover single duty when he received it, provided he can satisfy the constitutional tribunal in the given case, before which a question as to the validity of the instrument is raised in any suit or proceeding in law or equity, that he affixed such double stamps so soon as he acquired knowledge of the existence of the defect complained of; and this, whether his previous ignorance was ignorance of law or of fact; and the object of the second paragraph is to provide, that if he can satisfy such tribunal that the defect complained of was attributable to mere error or mistake, and not to any intention upon the part of the holder to violate the law, that shall be sufficient to enable him to put on double stamps and to recover in the suit or proceeding upon the instrument provided he shall put on such double stamps when he becomes aware of such error or mistake, even though that should be during the trial; but as questions of ignorance\u2014whether of law or fact, and of error or mistake, and of intention\u2014are all questions to be tried by the proper tribunal for trying facts in each case, whenever the question arises in a suit upon an issue found which a jury is sworn to try, the jury is that tribunal.\nIn the case before us, I am clearly of opinion that the question, assuming it to have been properly raised, was one for the jury and not for the judge to determine, and that the evidence could not have been withheld from them, and that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: James Straton.\nSolicitor for respondents: J.

Ritchie, C.J., and Strong, Fournier and Henry and Gwynne, JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nThe Banking Act 34 Vic., ch. 5, secs. 19 and 58\u2014Rights of shareholders\u2014Resolutions by directors and shareholders, not binding on absent shareholders\u2014Equitable plea.\nBank of L. brought an action against S., the appellant, (defendant) as shareholder, to recover a call of 10 per cent. on twenty-five shares held by him in that bank.\nBy the 7th plea, and for defence on equitable grounds the being able to enforce payment of a debt due to it by a transferor before allowing him to part with his shares, and possibly with a view to control in cases where a transfer would work a wrong to the bank. The enactments, in which are specified the times when and the reasons for which the completion of a transfer may be refused, show that sec. 19 does not authorize an arbitrary refusal. Thus: sec. 28 authorizes a bylaw for the closing of the transfer book during a certain time, not exceeding fifteen days before the payment of each semi-annual dividend; sec. 19 authorizes the bank to demand payment of any debt due by the transferor before the transfer; and sec. 59 saves the recourse of creditors against transferors on transfers made within one month of suspension.\nThe resolution of 26th June, 1873, cannot be alleged as a reason to justify the refusal to complete the transfer, for the following reasons:\n(a.) It was a mere agreement between the assenting parties, of whom defendant was not one.\n(b.) It was a resolution passed at a meeting at which defendant was not present, nor was there evidence of his being notified to attend. The record of the proceedings should not have been admitted in evidence, and being in evidence cannot prejudice defendant.\nThe equitable plea was proved, and the defendant was entitled to judgment in his favor, although he prayed for other relief as well. Rev. Stat, of N. S., 4th series, ch. 94, sec. 162; also cases cited by James, J. in the court below.\nMr. Gormully for respondents:\nThe shares in question have never, in fact, been transferred by the appellant to the firm of Almon & Mackintosh, and the appellant is still the registered holder thereof and liable to the calls thereon. It does not appear that any formal demand was ever made upon the board of directors by the appellant, or by his attorney, requiring the board to permit a transfer to be made. Even if there is evidence of such a demand, the appellant should have taken steps to compel the directors to comply therewith, and by his laches and delay he has precluded himself from equitable relief. The Supreme Court of Nova Scotia on its common law side has no power to give the relief demanded by the equitable plea pleaded herein. Under all the circumstances of the case\u2014having regard to the understanding come to by the shareholders in 1873 and the position of the bank\u2014the directors were justified in declining to permit the appellant to transfer his shares to Almon & Mackintosh.\nRITCHIE, C. J.:\u2014\nThe Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia says:\nIt may be that the statute intended that the directors of the bank should possess and exercise a discretion and control in the acceptance and registration of transfers of shares. But surely circumstances must exist calling for the exercise of such a discretion and justifying a refusal to accept and register transfers, in other words must there not be a reasonable cause for refusal? They surely cannot refuse to accept and register a transfer when no such reasonable cause exists.\nDid not the directors, without reasonable or legitimate excuse, refuse to sign the transfer in this case?\nThe transfer was made in good faith to parties then in perfectly good credit and standing, whose financial standing is testified to as being first class by defendant Smith, against whom the manager of the bank says: \"there was no claim or demand of the bank against defendant when the application for transfer was made,\" who states further, that by transfer books, \"it appears that twenty shares were transferred on 28th June, 1873. There were eighteen transfers accepted and registered between that date and the suspension of the bank These transfers represent about 2091 shares.\"\nSmith was never notified of the refusals of the directors to register the transfer, nor was any claim made on him by the bank, nor was he required by the bank to discharge any debts or liabilities due by him to the bank, nor did any such exist, nor did the bank, nor do the now plaintiffs, claim that any such existed. But the bank, with full knowledge that the stock certificate and power of attorney had been transmitted to the manager to be acted on, retained possession of the same, and, as the manager says, \"they remained in my possession as manager of the bank, until I handed them to the assignee after insolvency of the bank.\"\nThe defendant has nothing to do with any controversy that may arise between Mackintosh and Almon, and the plaintiffs; all he asks for is to be protected from this inequitable claim the plaintiffs are making against him, and against which the facts set forth, and proved, shew he is entitled to an absolute and perpetual injunction, this is all the relief the defendant asks for and can ever obtain, and, when obtained, does complete and final justice between the parties. With respect to the indebtedness of the bank to the bank of Nova Scotia, except so far as Smith's liability to Black was concerned, and from which liability he was released by Black, there clearly was no obligation on the part of Smith, as an individual shareholder, nor of any other shareholder, either to the bank of Liverpool or to the bank of Nova Scotia, beyond the indirect general liability of the shareholders to pay any legal call which might be made on the shareholders to meet the liabilities or to carry on the general business of the bank. I am of opinion to allow this appeal with costs. STRONG, J.:\nI am of opinion that this appeal must be allowed. It is clear that the shares were, by the express provisions of the 19th sec. of the Banking Act, transferable at the will of the holder, and the directors were bound to register the transfer unless there were debts or liabilities due by the shareholder to the bank. This was the prim\u00e2 facie right of the appellant, and it therefore appears to me that the seventh plea was a good defence to the action, and I am at a loss to see upon what principle the evidence of the resolution and loan by the bank of Nova Scotia was admitted in the absence of any replication to that plea. Upon this ground alone the judgment of the court below should have been for the appellant.\nThe case has, however, been argued upon the facts as they appear in evidence, and I will therefore consider them. The resolution adopted at the shareholders' meeting (held on the 26th June, 1873) is, in its terms, an expression of opinion only, and must consequently be considered as a mere recommendation to such shareholders who were not present at the meeting, and is not to be construed as an assumption by those present to bind those who were absent without their assent.\nBut had it been otherwise, and had it in terms expressed the determination of the shareholders present to bind those who were absent not to transfer these shares until the proposed loan should be paid, it would in law be entirely ineffectual and ultra vires of those constituting the meeting, for the meeting might as well have endeavored to restrain the absent shareholders from parting with any of their other property as to have attempted to restrain them from exercising their statutory right of selling and transferring their shares in the bank. Then it is not shewn that the appellant ever assented to these terms or that the loan was raised with his assent upon the agreement or understanding that he would not transfer his shares. It is true, that at a subsequent meeting held on the 28th January, 1874, at which appellant was present, the directors made a report that a loan had been obtained from the Bank of Nova Scotia in accordance with the resolution passed at the preceding meeting in June, but there is nothing in this report to shew that the loan was made by the bank upon the terms that shares should not be transferred, on the contrary it is expressly said \"this credit was obtained only with the assistance of C. H. Black, Esq., who with others of the shareholders became sureties for $60,000 of the loan.\" So far from shewing that the appellant assented to his shares being bound, the latter part of this report, that portion which I have just quoted, seems to indicate that the loan had been made upon other security altogether, as in fact the evidence shows that it had. It is sufficient, however, to say that there is nothing to show that the appellant ever agreed not to deal with his shares. There being then no evidence that the appellant ever agreed to his shares being held in security for the loan, or that his right to transfer them should be fettered by any restriction, it is impossible to say that this transaction of the loan interfered with his right to make any transfer he might think proper. Then it has not been, and, on the evidence could not have been, disputed that the transfer to Almon & Mackintosh was in every respect bon\u00e2 fide, that it was intended to be a real and not a colorable transaction, and that the transferees were at the time persons in good credit and unobjectionable on the score of solvency and in every other respect. I mention this, not because I think that it would have made any difference, had the appellant proposed to transfer to persons wholly insolvent, but only to show how groundless was the objection of the directors to register the transfer. The legal result of this must be that the respondent, as now representing the Bank of Liverpool, must in equity, at least, if not at law also, be considered as estopped from insisting on treating the appellant as still a shareholder and sueing him for calls. This defence is properly pleaded by the 7th plea and is a good equitable defence. I share with Mr. Justice James the doubt, which he expresses, whether the very strict and narrow rules applied in England to equitable defences pleaded under the C. L. Procedure Act should be adopted with reference to such pleas in Nova Scotia, where both legal and equitable remedies are administered, not by two separate jurisdictions as in England, but by the same court and in the same forms of procedure. This is, however, a matter concerning the practice of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia upon which I do not desire to express any decisive opinion. It seems, however, that even tested by the English cases there can be no objection to this plea as a good equitable defence, as it shews that the appellant would, if he had instituted a suit in equity for the purpose, have been entitled to an unconditional and perpetual injunction. The prayer which is unnecessarily added to the plea cannot have the effect of making the plea bad, if it appears from the averments that the appellant would have been entitled to have had the action restrained without the imposition of any condition, and this, I am clearly of opinion, would have been his strict right, although if a suit in equity had been instituted the plaintiff, as representing the bank, might have had some cross relief. The prayer may therefore be regarded as surplusage.\nI have not thought myself called upon to write more fully in this case for the reason that all the questions arising have been treated with great ability in the judgment of Mr. Justice James in the court below, with whom I, in all respects, agree.\nThe appeal must be allowed and the rule nisi for a new trial discharged with costs to the appellant in both courts.\nFOURNIER, J., concurred.\nHENRY, J.:\nI concur in the views expressed by my learned colleagues. I think that in equity the transfer of the stock to Almon and Mackintosh would have been held as made and completed. The statute gave the stockholders in the bank of Liverpool the right, independently of any control over the directors, to transfer stock. The only reason they could have to refuse would be that the party was in debt to the bank. That is provided for, but I think that is the only reason, because the transfer of stock is provided for by power of attorney by the parties selling and purchasing, and requires no consent or other sanction of the directors. In this case the seller and purchaser did everything it was necessary to do to entitle them to a transfer in the books. This was a transaction not between creditor and debtor, but by the bank itself. It is the bank saying to these parties: You had the right to transfer this stock; you did all that the by-laws and the law required you to do on both sides; we did not allow you to do it, and we therefore hold you as against the other party. Now, the Act provides that the transferee shall be considered the owner of the stock. After that has been done\u2014and it has virtually been done by the officer of the company, or would have been done formally but for the illegal interference of the directors\u2014Mr. Smith had no reason to suppose he was any longer a shareholder in the company, and the first thing he knowsi s, that, after the failure of Almon and Mackintosh, he is called upon to pay up 10 per cent. on his capital. I think it would be neither legal nor equitable, and therefore I think the appeal should be allowed, and the original judgment and verdict given by Mr. Justice James of Nova Scotia should be maintained.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nThis is an action commenced upon the thirty-first day of May, A.D. 1879, by the Bank of Liverpool, a bank incorporated in the Province of Nova Scotia by the Dominion Statute 34 Vict., ch. 42, subject to the provisions of the Act relating to banks and banking, 34 Vict., ch. 5, against the defendant, Edward Smith, who in the writ and declaration filed in the cause is alleged to be a holder of twenty-five shares in the capital stock of the bank, and the action is for the recovery of two hundred and fifty dollars alleged to have become due on the 10th March, 1879, from him to the bank in respect of a call of ten dollars upon each of his said shares alleged to have been made by the bank upon him in respect of such shares.\nTo this action the defendant pleaded:\n1st. That he never was indebted as alleged.\n2nd. That he is not the holder of twenty-five or of any shares in the bank.\nAnd among other pleas,\n7th. (Which is the plea upon which the defence mainly rests): For defence on equitable grounds the defendant says that before the said call the defendant made in good faith and for valid consideration a transfer and assignment of all the shares and stock which he had held in the capital stock of the said bank to a person authorized and qualified to receive the same, and the defendant and the transferee of the said shares or stock did all things which were necessary for the valid and final transferring of the said shares, but the plaintiffs without reasonable or legal excuse and without reason refused to record such transfer or to register the name in the books of the said bank or to recognize the said transfer; and the plea concludes with a prayer that the said bank shall be compelled and decreed to make and complete the said transfer and to do all things required on its part to be done to make the said transfer valid and effectual, and that the said Bank of Liverpool be enjoined from further prosecution of this suit.\nThe appeal case brought before us does not shew that any special replication or any demurrer was fyled to any of the pleas, nor indeed is there entered upon it even a joinder in issue, but as the case has been tried we must assume that there was a joinder in issue upon the record.\nSubsequently, and as it appears by the evidence, in the month of October, 1879, the bank became insolvent, and by an order of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, in which the action was pending, it was upon the 16th of February, 1880, ordered that the bank of Nova Scotia, assignee in insolvency of the plaintiffs, should have leave to intervene and to carry on and prosecute the suit against the defendant.\nThe case came down for trial before Mr. Justice James without a jury, and he, being of opinion that the equitable defence set up in the above seventh plea was established, rendered a verdict for the defendant. Upon a rule nisi to set aside the verdict, a majority of the learned judges of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, Mr Justice James, who tried the cause, dissenting, made the rule absolute for setting aside the verdict and granting a new trial. It is against this rule that this appeal is taken.\nNow, the action having been commenced by the bank when a going concern and solvent must be considered by us wholly regardless of the fact that subsequently it became insolvent, and must be adjudicated upon according to the rights and interests of the bank and the defendant inter se, wholly irrespective of all consideration, whether or not under the circumstances appearing in evidence the defendant lies under any obligation or liability for any, and, if any, for what amount to any creditor of the bank under the provisions of the 58th sec. of the Act relating to banks and banking.\nThere seems to me, I confess, to be much force in the observations made by Mr. Justice James in his dissentient judgment to the effect that the difference between the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia and that of the English courts of common law, as they were constituted before the establishment of the High Court of Justice, divests the judgments of these common law courts as to the limits of their jurisdiction to entertain equitable defences to actions at law, of their applicability to cases of equitable defences pleaded to actions instituted in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, which is a Court of Equity as well as of Common Law, and has, therefore, the machinery necessary to give full effect to all decrees or orders it may make in respect of the equitable rights and interests of parties litigant which the English common law courts had not; but I do not think it necessary in this case to for many judgment upon this point, or to pursue the consideration of it further, because I entertain a clear conviction that, even within the rule, as laid down by the old English common law courts relating to equitable defences, the matter pleaded by the defendant to this action in his seventh plea, if established in evidence, is a good answer to the present action as a defence upon equitable grounds, if, indeed, it be not a good legal defence as well. The rule to be collected from the cases is that a plea upon equitable grounds is a good defence when the equitable grounds relied upon are such as to entitle the defendant to relief in equity by an absolute unconditional injunction restraining the action, or, as it is sometimes expressed, when the common law judgment that the plaintiff take nothing by his writ, and that the defendant go thereof without day, would do complete and final justice between the parties in respect of the equitable grounds relied upon.

Harrop & Co., agents,\" (treating the latter as principals,) the court held that under the circumstances pleaded, the defendants, Harrop & Co., were entitled to an unconditional injunction restraining the action, and therefore the common law judgment ut nil capiat would do complete justice between the parties, and it being urged for the plaintiff that, as the plaintiff under the charter party as signed had no action against Davidson & Co., all that the defendants could ask was a reformation of the contract, the court held that it was enough that under the equitable grounds pleaded it was inequitable for the plaintiff to sue the defendants, and that the court was not concerned with the objection that no person could be found liable to the plaintiff. In that case, Bramwell, B., and Willes, J., were of opinion that the plea was a good legal plea. But the principle upon which the House of Lords proceeded in Bargate v. Shortridge[11] is in my judgment conclusive that this 7th plea is a good defence to this action either as an equitable or a legal plea. Such principle may be thus expressed: if an act required to be done is within the power of directors of a company to do, or to permit to be done, and if it be their duty to do it, or to permit it to be done, and they neglect to do it, or refuse to permit it to be done, and by such neglect or refusal damage is done to a third person, neither a court of law or equity will allow the company to take advantage of such neglect or refusal of the directors, and if the directors neglect a form or obligation which they ought to perform, the company cannot insist upon the non-compliance with such form or the non-fulfilment of such obligation as against the person entitled to have had the form complied with and the obligation fulfilled, and in such case no question arises whether a creditor of the company could or could not take advantage of such non-performance in support of any legal demand the creditor might have against such party as a shareholder in the company.\nI have gone thus at length into this point because it was entertained in the court below, and has been made a ground in the respondents' factum in support of the judgment of the court below and was relied upon in the argument before us; but in truth the appeal case laid before us shews that neither the sufficiency nor materiality of the seventh plea, but its truth only, has been put in issue upon the record.\nNow, the charter which affects the rights of shareholders in this banking company is the Dominion statute 34 Vict., ch. 5, the 19th sec. of which enacts that; The shares and capital stock of the bank shall be held and adjudged to be personal estate, and shall be assignable and transferable at the chief place of business of the bank, or at any of its branches which the directors shall appoint for that purpose, and according to such form as the directors shall prescribe; but no assignment or transfer shall be valid, unless it be made and registered and accepted by the party to whom the transfer is made, in a book or books to be kept by the directors for that purpose, nor until the person or persons making the same shall, if required by the bank, previously discharge all debts or liabilities due by him, her, or them to the bank, which may exceed in amount the remaining stock, if any, belonging to such person or persons, and no fractional part or parts of a share or less than a whole share shall be assignable or transferable.\nThis is the only clause in the charter qualifying the rights of a shareholder in the plaintiff's company to dispose of his shares. In Chouteau Spring Co. v. Harris[12], the Supreme Court of Missouri in 1855 held that:\nStock in incorporated joint stock companies is always treated as property without any declaration in the charter to that effect, and when such a provision is inserted, it is considered as merely cumulative, except so far as it designates the peculiar character of the property, whether real or personal. One of the incidents of property is its transferability, and, of course, the power of disposing of this stock like the power of disposition of any other property is incident of common right to the ownership of it.\nThen, citing Sargent et al. v. Franklin Ins. Co.[13], and Bates v. New York Ins. Co.[14], the court says:\nThe doctrine laid down in these cases is, that although the company have the power of regulating the transfer of stock, by prescribing the mode in which it shall be made, the transfer is valid as against the company, if they have notice of it and refuse to allow it the necessary formalities.\nIn Isham v. Buckingham[15], decided by the Court of Appeals of the State of New York in 1872, the provision of the charter of the company referred to in that case was similar to the clause above extracted from the act relating to banks, namely: The stock of every such corporation shall be deemed personal property and be transferred only on the books of such corporation in such form as the directors shall prescribe, and such corporation shall at all times have a lien upon all the stock or property of its members invested therein for all debts due from them to such corporation.\nThe court then says:\nIn this State it is well settled that the delivery of the certificate with a power of attorney to transfer passes the entire title, legal and equitable, as between the parties (the vendor and purchaser), and that the provisions referred to (as to mode and form of transfer in the company's books) are for the security of the corporation in securing its interests in its relations and dealings with stockholders, and that if a company did not provide a transfer book, or did not transfer the stock when required so to do according to the prescribed forms, the fault was its own, of which it could not take advantage.\nAnd in Angel and Ames, on Corporations[16],-several cases are referred to in support of this doctrine, that as between vendor and purchaser the delivery of the stock certificate, together with a power of attorney to transfer it in the books of the company, is a completed transaction which the vendor cannot after call in question In Weston's case[17], the Lord Justices in appeal held, that shares in joint stock companies are transferable by virtue of the statute, and that the province of the articles of association is to point out the mode in which they shall be transferred, and the limitations, if any, to which a shareholder shall be subjected before he can transfer; and that neither the shareholders at large nor the directors can prevent a particular shareholder from transferring his shares unless by the force and effect of some clause in the articles of association authorizing them to do so. Sir W. P.Wood, L. J., says:\nIt would be a very serious thing for the shareholders in one of these companies to be told that their shares, the whole value of which consists in their being marketable and passing freely from hand to hand, are to be subject to a clause of restriction which they do not find in the articles of association. And Sir C. J. Selwyn, L. J., says:\nWe have the general Act of Parliament which constitutes these companies, one important effect of which is, that the shares which in an ordinary partnership would not be transferable are made transferable, and the 22nd section, which has been relied on in argument, merely refers the company to their own articles for determining the manner in which that transfer shall be effected, but leaves the general right to transfer to stand upon the provisions of the Act. Then when we look at the articles of association in the present case and find that the 14th clause imposes a particular limit upon the authority of the directors, and mentions two cases only in which they may refuse to register a transfer, I think that the rule of expressio unius exclusio alterius applies most strongly to this case. No doubt if the directors had reason to believe that the transaction was fraudulent or fictitious, they might refuse to be partakers in any such fraudulent or fictitious transaction, but in the absence of that\u2014unless they could bring the case within the provisions of the 14th clause\u2014in my opinion they would be bound to register.\nSo (to apply the decision in that case to the case before us) unless the directors of the plaintiffs' bank could bring their objection to permitting the transfer to be entered in due form in their books within the provisions of the 19th sec. of the Act relating to banks and banking, they were bound to permit the transfer to be entered in the transfer book of the company.\nIn re National and Provincial Marine Insurance Co. ex parte Parker[18], Lord Justice. Rolt was of opinion that a transfer of shares made expressly to escape liability did not necessarily vitiate the transfer, but no question of that kind arises here, for there is no doubt that the sale by the defendant to Almon and Mackintosh was a bon\u00e2 fide sale made for value and to persons who were perfectly solvent and responsible. In re Scranton Iron and Steel Co.[19], V. C. Sir James Bacon, in 1873, speaks of the right to transfer shares in a joint stock company, as an incident to the ownership of the shares; and he says that it is the duty of directors of the company to receive and register, or to furnish some reason for refusing to do so; and Weston's case shews that it must be a valid and sufficient reason; and Lowe's case[20] is to the like effect. It appears that the general practice of the bank in perfecting the entry of transfers, when the the parties did not attend in person to sign the form of transfer approved by the directors in a transfer book kept for the purpose, and the acceptance of such transfer by the purchaser, was for the vendor and vendee respectively to give a power of attorney to an officer of the bank authorizing such officer to sign the transfer and perfect the same in the bank book kept for that purpose. Such officer, upon receiving such powers of attorney and the stock certificate held by the vendor, laid the matter before the board, who, unless there was sufficient reason for withholding their assent to the transfer, authorized it to be made, and the necessary entries for that purpose were accordingly made in the bank book by the officer having the powers of attorney, and a new stock certificate was issued in favor of the purchaser. Now, when the defendant sold his shares to Almon & Mackintosh and received from them the consideration money therefor, and delivered to them his stock certificate, and placed in their hands a power of attorney duly executed, constituting and appointing John A. Leslie, manager of the bank, to be his attorney for him, and in his name to transfer the shares, the sale and transfer of the shares, as between the defendant and Almon & Mackintosh, was complete, and the defendant never could have revoked that power of attorney to the prejudice of Almon & Mackintosh, neither could they repudiate the sale; but the defendant could compel them to have themselves entered in the books of the bank as holders of the shares, and to indemnify the defendant against all calls made subsequent to the sale; and when Almon & Mackintosh wrote to Leslie, as manager of the bank, as they did, enclosing to him the defendant's stock certificate and the power of attorney executed by him in favor of Leslie, together with the power of attorney from themselves to Leslie authorizing him as their attorney to accept the transfer, and to do all lawful and necessary acts to complete the same, and directed the bank to consider them as the holders of the stock formerly owned by the defendant, Almon & Mackintosh could not afterwards be permitted to repudiate their liability to the bank upon the shares. Now, what appears to have been done by Leslie, upon receipt of the above documents, was to communicate them at a board meeting to the directors, who, although the bank had no demand whatever against the defendant, and although the credit and responsibility of Almon & Mackintosh, if that had been material, was never questioned, and if it had been, was above suspicion and good beyond controversy, refused to permit the transfer to be entered in the bank book without assigning any reason for such refusal.\nIn this action they have attempted to justify their refusal upon the allegation that upon the 26th June, A.D., 1873, at a special general meeting of the shareholders of the bank at which, as appears by the evidence, the defendant was not present, it was resolved as follows:\nThat in the opinion of this meeting the bank of Liverpool should not be allowed to go into liquidation, but that steps should be taken to obtain a loan of such sum as may be necessary to enable the bank to resume specie payments, and that the shareholders agree to hold their shares without assigning them until the principal and interest due on such loan shall be fully paid, and to execute, when required, a bond to that effect.\nSuch a resolution, if binding upon the shareholders and directors, might have the effect of prejudicing the bank, if, for example, more solvent and wealthy persons than the then holders of stock should be willing to take the place of these holders by purchase of their stock, but whether such a resolution could have the effect of subjecting a non-assenting shareholder to the burthen of a condition restricting the rights acquired by him under the authority and sanction of an Act of Parliament, upon the faith of which he became a shareholder, and which the Act did not subject him to, it is not necessary now to enquire, because it is clear from the evidence that in truth the resolution was never acted upon, and the bank cannot now rely upon it as affecting the defendant's right of transfer in October, 1877. So far from its having been acted upon, it appears that twenty shares were transferred in the bank books two days after the passing of the resolution, and that between that day and the refusal to enter the transfer of the defendants stock in the bank books one thousand eight hundred and thirty-three shares were in like manner transferred, and that prior to the month of February, 1874, the bank effected a loan of $80,000 upon the security of a Mr. Black, who, to secure himself, took bonds to lesser amounts from other shareholders, and among those, from the defendant, which bond Mr. Black released upon the occasion of the sale by the defendant of his stock to Almon & Mackintosh. It appears therefore that the resolution relied upon, of the date of 26th June, 1873, was not a valid reason for the directors refusal to allow the transfer to be perfected in their books from the defendant to Almon & Mackintosh, and if such had been given at the time as the reason for such refusal it would not have afforded to the bank any justification, and they could have been compelled by bill in equity to permit the transfer to be entered; and as no other reason is suggested and the only justification for refusal mentioned in the Act of Parliament affecting the case, is proved not to have had any existence, I am of opinion that it was the duty of the directors to have permitted, and therefore they ought to have permitted, the transfer to have been entered in their books in October, 1877, and that having refused to do so without any good, valid and sufficient reason justifying such refusal they cannot now be permitted to avail themselves of their own wrong to the prejudice of the defendant.\nThe appeal must therefore be allowed with costs, and the rule for a new trial in the court below must be discharged with costs, and judgment be entered for the defendant upon the verdict rendered in his favor.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Thompson, Graham & Tupper.\nSolicitors for respondents: J.

Ritchie, C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne, JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nJudgment on demurrer appealable\u20143rd section Supreme Court Amendment Act, 1879\u201438 Vic. ch. 16, sec. 136\u2014Construction of\u2014Purchase of goods by insolvent outside of Dominion of Canada\u2014Pleadings\u2014Insolvent Act 1875, ss. 136, 137, intra vires.\nP. et al., merchants carrying on business in England, brought an action for $4,000 on the common counts against J.S. et al., and in order to bring S. et al. within the purview of sec. 136 of the Insolvent Act of 1875, by a special count alleged in their declaration that a purchase of goods was made by S. et al., from them on the 13th March, 1879, and another purchase on the 29th March of the same year; that when S. et al. made the said purchases they had probable cause for believing themselves to be unable to meet their engagements and concealed the fact from P. et al., thereby becoming their creditors with intent to defraud P. et al.\nJ.S. (appellant) amongst other pleas, pleaded that the contract out of which the alleged cause of action arose, was made in England and not in Canada.\nTo this plea P. et al. demurred. It was agreed that the pleadings were to be treated as amended by alleging that the defendants were traders and British Subjects resident and domiciled in Canada at the time of the purchase of the goods in question and had subsequently become insolvents under the Insolvent Act of 1875, and amendments thereto.\nHeld,\u2014(Taschereau and Gwynne, JJ., dissenting) That although the judgment appealed from was a decision on a demurrer to part of the action only, it is a final judgment in a judicial proceeding within the meaning of the 3rd section of the Supreme Court Amendment Act of 1879. (Chevallier v. Cuvillier[1] followed).\nPer Ritchie, C.J., and Fournier, J.: 1st. That section 136 of the Insolvent Act of 1875 is intra vires of the Parliament of Canada.\n2nd. That the charge of fraud in the present suit is merely a proceeding to enforce payment of a debt under a law relating to bankruptcy and insolvency over which subject\u2011matter the Parliament of Canada has power to legislate.\n3rd. Although the fraudulent act charged was committed in another country beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the courts in Canada, the defendant was not exempt for that reason from liability under the provisions of the 136th section of the Insolvent Act, 1875, and therefore the plea demurred to was bad and the appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Gwynne, J.: The demurrer does not raise the question whether the sec. 136 of the Insolvent Act of 1875, is or is not ultra vires of the Dominion Parliament, for whether it be or not the plea demurred to is bad, inasmuch as it confesses the debt for which the action is brought, and that such debt was incurred under circumstances of fraud, and offers no matter whatever of avoidance or in bar of the action; therefore if the appeal be entertained it must be dismissed.\nPer Strong, Henry and Taschereau, JJ.: There being nothing eiher in the language or object of the 186th section of the Insolvent Act to warrant the implication that it was to have any effect out of Canada, it must be held not to extend to the purchase of good in England by defendant, stated in the second count of the declaration. In this view, it is unnecessary to decide as to the constitutional validity of the enactment in question, and the appeal should be allowed.\nThe court being equally divided the appeal was dismissed without costs.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for the Province of Ontario, dismissing the appeal of the defendants, James Shields and John Shields, from the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, ordering judgment to be entered for the plaintiffs on demurrer to the defendants\u2019 third plea.\nThe action was commenced by Francis Peak, William Winch, W. Ray, and Herman Seidel, against the said John Shields and James Shields to recover $4,000.\nThe first count of the declaration was for goods sold and delivered; and the plaintiffs in addition thereto charged \u201cthat the defendants have been guilty of fraud within the meaning of the Insolvent Act of 1875 and the amending acts, in this that the said defendants, on the thirteenth day of March, A.D. 1879, purchased from the plaintiffs on credit goods to the extent in value of seven hundred and twenty-four dollars and sixty-one cents, said goods being parcel of the goods the price of which is sued for herein.\n\u201cAnd on the twenty-ninth day of March, A.D. 1879, the defendant purchased for themselves from the plaintiffs, on credit, goods to the extent in value of two thousand nine hundred and thirty-four dollars and three cents, said goods being parcel of the goods the price of which is sued for herein, the said defendants, on each and every of the said several days on which said purchases were made, knowing or having probable cause for believing themselves to be unable to meet their engagements and concealing the fact from plaintiffs, thereby becoming their creditors with intent to defraud the plaintiffs. \u201cAnd that although the several terms of credit so obtained on the purchase of each of the said several parcels of goods have elapsed, the said defendants have not paid or caused to be paid the debt or debts so incurred or any of them, and the plaintiffs claim four thousand dollars.\u201d\nTo this declaration and for a 3rd plea to the said 2nd count, the defendant John Shields said that the contract out of which the alleged cause of action arose was made in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, to wit in England, and not within the Dominion of Canada.\nTo this plea the plaintiff demurred; and it was agreed that the pleadings were to be treated as amended by alleging that the defendants were traders and British subjects, resident and domiciled in the Dominion of Canada at the time of the purchase of the goods in question, and had subsequently become insolvents under the Insolvent Act of 1875, and amendments thereto.\nMr. J. Bethune, Q.C., for appellant.\nWe contend that sec. 136 of the Insolvent Act of 1875 was ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada if the clause is to be regarded as giving a civil remedy and not creating a criminal offence.\nThe exclusive jurisdiction to enact laws respecting bankruptcy and insolvency, it is admitted, belongs to the Parliament of Canada; however, this must carry with it only such power as may be necessary to wind up the estate divide it amongst the creditors, and grant or withhold the bankrupt\u2019s or insolvent\u2019s discharge; it cannot carry with it the power to enact what remedy any particular creditor or creditors may have by actions in the ordinary courts of the province. This latter remedy must be within the competence of the provincial legislature. The remedy assumed to be given by sec. 136 is really imprisonment for debt.\nImprisonment for debt, as such, was long ago abolished by the Parliament of the Province of Canada, and the Legislature of the Province has never re-enacted it, but, on the contrary, on the revision of the statutes of the Provinces, has declared that it is abolished.\nThis statute assumes to give a right, in cases within it, to the creditor to take the body of the debtor and keep it in custody for a named period unless the debt and costs due to the creditor be sooner paid.\nManifestly this is not done in the interest of the general body of creditors, but only in favor of the creditor defrauded.\nA judgment is to be got by the creditor by an ordinary action. The question whether the defendant was guilty of fraud is to be tried, and if the defendant be found guilty the defendant is to be imprisoned for a term not exceeding two years, unless the debt and costs be sooner paid.\nThe imprisonment is designed as a means of compelling payment to the creditor. Except that the imprisonment is limited to two years, it is the same kind of imprisonment as that formerly awarded on a Ca. Sa.\nIt is not said in this section that the discharge of the debtor is to be void. It only enacted that the creditor shall have a new remedy for enforcing payment of his debt.\nAssuming that the parliament of Canada had not the power to repeal the similar sub\u2011sections of the Insolvent Act of 1864 when it assumed to repeal the whole act, but that this power belonged to the legislature of the Province of Ontario, they have been repealed by that legislature by Revised Statutes ch. 67, sec. 4.\nThis seems to have been overlooked by the learned judges in the court below. It is submitted that even, if section 136 be intra vires of the parliament of Canada, it ought not to be construed to extend to the conduct of persons in England, although domiciled in Canada.\nThe intent of parliament was to provide for the conduct of traders while in Canada, and parliament did not intend to interfere with the conduct of Canadian citizens while in another country.\nBut if the statute be wide enough in its language to cover the case of a person domiciled in Canada and obtaining the credit referred to while abroad, then it is ultra vires on that ground and to that extent. The powers of parliament are to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada. This, it is submitted, does not extend to make laws respecting the conduct of its citizens while in England. Persons domiciled in Canada are under the control of English laws while within the kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.\nIf section 136 be a criminal law it cannot apply to the obtaining of the credit in question in England; first, because the language of the section ought to be confined to conduct occurring in Canada, and secondly, because the parliament of Canada cannot enact a criminal law which shall be operative in England.\nIn answer to the objection taken in the respondent\u2019s factum that the case is not appealable, I submit that the decision in this court in Chevalier v. Cuvillier[2] is decisive.\nMr. Rose, Q.C., for respondents:\nIf the fradulent act complained of is a crime, it is congizable in the courts of this province, even though committed in another country. The said courts had conferred upon them common law jurisdiction, by the Imperial Parliament in 1792. The Imperial Parliament has power to enact that any offence against its laws, whether committed within or without its jurisdiction, is a crime, and punishable according to its laws whenever the offender is tried within the territorial limits of the British possessions, and the Imperial Parliament conferred upon the Dominion Parliament equal powers as to governing those resident in the dominion. See Maxwell on Statutes[3]; Valin v. Langlois[4]; May\u2019s Privileges of Parliament[5].\nBy the Insolvent Act of 1875, the word \u201ccreditor\u201d is defined in sub-section \u201dh\u201d of section 2 to mean,\u2014\u201cEvery person to whom the insolvent is indebted,\u201d\u2014and by section 101 foreign creditors are required to be notified of meetings of creditors; and section 136 contains the words, \u201cConcealing the fact from the persons thereby becoming his creditors.\u201d Again, \u201cWith intent to defraud the persons thereby becoming his creditors.\u201d It is submitted, therefore, that the word \u201ccreditor\u201d includes \u201cforeign creditors;\u201d and that section 136 expressly declares, that the fraud thereby legislated against is a fraud upon foreign as well as domestic creditors.\nIn view of the opinions expressed by the learned judges in the Niagara Election case[6], in Valin v. Langlois[7], and in Cushing v. Dupuy[8], it seems no longer open to question, that if the sections mentioned are enactments respecting \u201cBankruptcy and Insolvency,\u201d or \u201cCriminal Law,\u201d then the Dominion Parliament has full power \u201cto interfere if necessary, and modify some of the ordinary rights of property and other civil rights;\u201d and that it is not ultra vires of the Dominion Parliament to provide procedure for the administration of its own laws. In dealing with dom- inion laws, the Dominion Parliament does not recognize provincial limits. It enacts for the Dominion as a whole without territorial distinction, else the anomaly would exist of its being compelled to ask the several local legislatures to assist it in the administration of its own laws.\nAs to appellant\u2019s contention that as the law of England, where the contract was made, does not provide a penalty for the wrong in question, the defendants are not liable to a penalty by reason of any legislation in Canada: it is laid down in Story \u201cOn the Conflict of Laws,\u201d[9] that the better opinion now established both in England and America is, that it is of no consequence whether the contract authorizes the arrest or imprisonment of the party in the country where it was made, if there is no exemption of the party from personal liability on the contract; he is still liable to arrest or imprisonment in a suit on it in a foreign country whose laws authorize such a mode of proceeding as a part of the local remedy; and states that in a then recent case in England, where the plaintiff and defendant were both foreigners, and the debt was contracted in a country by whose laws the defendant would not have been liable to arrest, application was made to discharge the defendant from arrest on that account, but the court refused the application. Lord Tenterden, on that occasion, in delivering the opinion of the court said: \u201cA person suing in this country must take the law as he finds it; he cannot by virtue of any regulation in his own country enjoy greater advantages than other suitors here, and he ought not therefore to be deprived of any superior advantage which the law of this country may confer; he is entitled to the same rights which all the subjects of this kingdom are entitled to. Dela Vega v. Vianna[10]. And this doctrine has been confirmed in the case of Dunn v. Lippmann[11]. In the case in question the plaintiffs have instituted their action in a court in the Dominion of Canada, and they are, by the laws of that Dominion, debarred from recovering their debt, for under the provisions of the Insolvent Act, the debt is discharged, unless it is one for which the imprisonment of the debtor is permitted. The Act which contains the provisions for discharging such debt, and which Act is invoked against the plaintiffs, also confers a benefit upon them. Invoking the principle of the above reported decision, the respondents are entitled to the advantages which the law intends to confer.\nThe respondents further submit that there is no final judgment in this case from which the appellant may appeal within the meaning of section 17, of the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act; and refer to the case of Reid v. Ramsay[12].\nMr. Bethune, Q.C., in reply.\nRITCHIE, C.J.:\nThis is a peculiar statutory liability placed on the debtor, to be put forward in an action brought for the recovery of a simple money demand, but which, if sustained, involves serious consequences, to which the insolvent debtor would be in no way liable on the simple money demand. It is therefore quite clear that as against the allegation of such a liability the insolvent must have the right to raise an issue to show that, though he may not be able to answer the money demand, he can answer the charge of fraud, and so relieve himself from the consequences which the statute attaches thereto. I think the declaration clearly shows on its face that the plaintiff in this action seeks to bring the defendant within the purview of sec. 136 of the Insolvent Act of 1875, and the plea was intended to meet this claim by shewing that the purchase was made in England, and so the debtor did not come within the provisions of the act; and the amendment agreed on, and the dealing of the court, clearly show the issues the parties raised and intended the court should decide were, whether the act was intra vires, and, if so, whether to a transaction between the insolvent resident in Canada and the creditor resident in England the provisions of the act applied?\nBankruptcy alters the ordinary relations of debtors and creditors; its object is to secure a speedy and equitable distribution of the bankrupt\u2019s assets, but its object is not confined to this, it has likewise in view the prevention of fraud and bad faith. The honest and unfortunate debtor and honest creditor is dealt with in one way, fraudulent debtors and collusive creditors in a very different manner; and acts as a preventative to fraud and collusion on the one hand, and as an encouragement to honest and cautious trading on the other.\nThe very first introduction of the Bankrupt Law was by 34 and 35 Henry VIII. ch. 4, which was directed against fraudulent debtors only, who, as expressed in the act:\nCraftily obtaining into their hands great substance of other men\u2019s goods, so suddenly flee to parts unknown or keep their houses, not minding to pay, or return to pay any of their creditors, their debts and duties, but at their own wills and pleasures consume the substance obtained by credit from other men for their own pleasure and delicate living, against all reason, equity and good conscience.\nBy the Imperial Debtors Act of 1869, obtaining credit on false representation, or on false pretence of carrying on business, or fraudulently obtaining credit, &c., were made misdemeanors, and quitting England with property which ought to be divided among creditors, a felony. So soon as a debtor becomes insolvent and subject to any bankrupt or insolvent law passed by the Dominion Parliament, and proceedings are taken against him and his estate, under the provisions of such enactments, the provincial legislature ceases to have jurisdiction over his civil rights, either in relation to the disposition of his insolvent estate, or in relation to his dealings with his creditors, or their rights or remedies against his person or estate. Legislation on the subject of bankruptcy and insolvency, belonging exclusively to the Dominion Parliament, necessarily involves the exclusive right to deal alike with the rights of the debtor as of his creditor in relation to their dealings.\nIf the Imperial Debtors Act, 1869, for the punishment of fraudulent debtors, makes certain offences misdemeanors, punishable by imprisonment not exceeding two years, with or without hard labor, and certain other offences are made misdemeanors punishable by imprisonment with hard labor for one year, and the offence of absconding or attempting to abscond from England with property divisible among creditors, &c., is made a felony, punishable by imprisonment for two years, with or without hard labor, it would seem strange that the Dominion Parliament, having exclusive jurisdiction over bankruptcy and insolvency and over criminal law, should not have the power to (by way of dealing with a fraudulent debtor and securing the enforcement of the debt) confine a fraudulent insolvent, against whom the debt and the fraud are proved, for two years, unless he discharges the indebtedness.\nThe insolvency act intended to deal with all the liabilities and estate of the insolvent, recognizing the foreign as well as the domestic creditor, and could never have intended, in legislating against the fraudulent acts of the insolvent in his dealings with his creditors, to distinguish between such acts when com- mitted against the home creditor and similar acts committed against creditors abroad, and therefore the term creditors in the clause 136 and 137 refers, in my opinion, to all the insolvent\u2019s creditors without distinction. I cannot doubt that secs. 136 and 137 of the Insolvent Act of 1875 are intra vires of the Dominion Parliament.\nThe 136th section enacts that:\nAny person who * * purchases goods on credit * * knowing or believing himself * * to be unable to meet his * * engagements, and concealing, the fact from the person thereby becoming his creditor, with the intent to defraud such person * * and also shall not afterwards have paid or caused to be paid the debt or debts so incurred, shall be held to be guilty of a fraud, and shall be liable to imprisonment for such time as the court may order, not exceeding two years, unless the debt and costs be sooner paid: Provided always, that in the suit or proceeding taken for the recovery of such debt or debts, the defendant be charged with such fraud, and be declared to be guilty of it by the judgment rendered in such suit or proceeding.\nBut it is argued that this is a criminal offence, and as such was committed in England, and therefore ultra vires.\nThese sections, though of a quasi penal character, by no means constituted the acts referred to in them \u201ccrimes,\u201d in the legal technical sense of that term. In this suit could not the parties be witnesses? The proceeding contemplated by the act is in a civil suit, not in the nature of a prosecution for a crime, but as Attorney General Cockburn in Attorney General v. Radloff[13] expressed it:\nWhere the proceeding is conducted with the view and for the purpose of obtaining redress for the violation of a private right only, the proceeding is a civil one.\nThat the legislature was not dealing with this as a crime is clearly deducible from sections 138 and 143 where \u201coffences and penalties\u201d are dealt with, and the prohibited acts are made misdemeanors by express enactments, and I think Harrison, C.J., in dealing with sections 92 and 93 of the Insolvent Act, 1869, substantially the same as 136 and 137 of the Act of 1875, correctly characterized the proceeding in these words:\nThe coercive proceeding is in aid of or incident to the civil remedy for the collection of a debt and not at all for the punishment of a criminal.\nI have no doubt the parties in this suit, both plaintiff and defendant, could be examined as witnesses, and if at any time after the suit brought, before trial or immediately after, the defendant should pay the debt and costs, the proceedings would end and no imprisonment could be adjudged.\nThis is, in my opinion, no more a criminal matter than a bill in chancery charging fraud and seeking redress against such fraud.\nAs to this being matter of civil procedure and ultra vires as interfering with property and civil rights, what I have stated in Valin v. Langlois[14] is an answer to this objection. The right to direct the procedure in civil matters in the provincial courts has reference to the procedure in matters over which the Provincial Legislature has power to give them jurisdiction, and does not in any way interfere with or restrict the right or power of the Dominion Parliament to direct the mode of procedure to be adopted in cases in which the Dominion Parliament has jurisdiction, and where it has exclusive authority to deal with the subject-matter as it has with the subject of bankruptcy and insolvency. This is also the view taken by the Privy Council in the case of Dupuy v. Cushing[15]. I will only add that I am quite prepared to adopt the conclusion arrived at by the Court of Appeal, and to say that such a provision as the one in question comes fairly within the general scope of any law relating to bankruptcy or insolvency.\nSTRONG, J.:\nAn objection was taken to the jurisdiction of the court to entertain this appeal, as not being an appeal from a final judgment within the meaning of section 3 of the Supreme Court Amendment Act of 1879. The words of that section are:\nAn appeal shall lie from final judgments only in actions, suits, causes, matters, and other judicial proceedings originally instituted in the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec, or originally instituted in a Superior Court of Common Law in any of the Provinces of Canada other than the Province of Quebec.\nIn the case of Chevalier v. Cuvillier[16] it was determined that an appeal was well brought where the judgment in the court of original jurisdiction was not final, but was, as in the present case, a judgment on a demurrer to part of the action only; and this decision proceeded upon the ground that the judgment of the Provincial Court of Appeal, from which the appeal to this court was immediately brought, was a final judgment in a judicial proceeding within the meaning of this 3rd section of the Act of 1879. That case is not to be distinguished from the present and is an authority for this appeal.\nThe pleadings seem to be sufficient to raise the substantial question which was discussed on the argument of the appeal, both in this court and in the court of Appeal. The second count of the declaration is framed, not for the debt, but exclusively upon the statute, for the purpose of alleging the fraud, which section 136 of the Insolvent Act requires the defendant to be charged with before the provision of that section can be applied. It may not have been necessary to have pleaded to this charge of fraud, as by the express words of section 137 the court could not act without proof of it, even if no plea had been pleaded. Section 137 seems, however, to imply that the defendant may plead, and, that being so, I see no objection whatever to a plea such as that which has been pleaded to the second count, a plea not containing any answer to the debt, but addressed exclusively to the second count of the declaration, which is confined to the case of fraud.\nWe are to read the second count of the declaration as amended by the allegation that the defendants were British subjects, domiciled in Canada at the time of the purchase of the goods mentioned in the declaration. With this amendment, and taking as I do the second count of the declaration to be confined to the case of fraud and not to be a count for the debt, and reading the plea demurred to as limited to the second count, I think we have before us a perfect record raising the substantial question, which was argued and decided in both the courts below, namely the question: whether section 136 of the Insolvent Act applies to a purchase of goods made by a British subject domiciled in Canada, under the circumstances of concealment made punishable as fraudulent by that section, when the purchase is made without the Dominion of Canada.\nThe view which I take of the case does not make it necessary to decide the constitutional question as to the power of Parliament to pass such an enactment as that in question, limited to the territory of the Dominion, the opinion at which I have arrived being formed exclusively on the construction of the clause in question. I may say, however, that I have heard nothing to raise a doubt in my mind as to the constitutional validity of such an enactment, (provided it is construed, as hereafter to be stated as limited to the territory of the Dominion,) under one or other of the powers conferred on Parliament by the British North America Act of legislation as to criminal law, bankruptcy and insolvency, or trade and commerce, and even if this view is incorrect, and the provision in question cannot be considered a proper exercise of any of these powers of legislating, the opinion of Mr. Justice Burton must then be correct, and the similar clause in the Insolvent Act of 1865 be held to be still in force.\nThe opinion which I have formed, and which accords entirely with that of the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, proceeds altogether upon the construction of this 136th section, which, interpreted according to well established principles applicable to all statutes, must, in the absence of express words giving it an extra-territorial operation, be read as confined to offences committed within the territory subject to the legislature which enacted it. The statute is clearly penal in its terms, but it does not seem to me to be very material to enquire whether it creates what may strictly be called a criminal offence or not. Had it simply declared that a trader purchasing goods on credit, when he knew himself to be unable to meet his engagements, and concealing that fact from the vendor, should be guilty of a misdemeanor, and liable to the punishment prescribed of imprisonment for not more than two years, there could be no doubt that a new criminal offence would have been created. But supposing the degree and character of the offence by calling it a misdemeanor to have been left out, it would still have been an offence for which the party could only have been tried and convicted on an indictment for a misdemeanor. Then what difference can it make that a special statutory mode of trial is provided for instead of the usual proceeding at common law by indictment? None, that I can see; and the added condition that the party convicted shall in a certain event be entitled to a remis- sion of the punishment\u2014a sort of statutory pardon\u2014shews that the imprisonment is not intended to be merely by way of execution to enforce payment in the interest of the creditor. What proves this is, that a debtor, after having suffered the full term of imprisonment under a sentence pronounced in pursuance of this enactment, would be liable upon his release to be again imprisoned under a writ of capias ad satisfaciendum upon the unsatisfied judgment. I do not, however, think anything depends on this question whether a criminal or even a penal offence was or was not created. The rule of construction which applies, not being restricted to statutes creating offences or inflicting penalties, but being of much wider application, and appropriate to the interpretation of all statutes whereby any legal consequences are attached to the performance of a particular act, the rule to which I allude, and which I think must govern the decision of the present case, is that which establishes that the authority of a statute is not to be extended beyond the territory over which the legislature which enacts it has jurisdiction, unless by express words extra-territorial force is given to it.\nIn Jeffreys v. Boosy[17], Pollock, C.B., says:\nThe Statutes of this realm have no power, are of no force, beyond the dominions of Her Majesty, not even to bind the subjects of the realm, unless they are expressly mentioned or can be necessarily implied.\nSir Peter Maxwell, in his work on statutes[18], states this principle of interpretation as follows:\nAnother general presumption is that the legislature does not intend to exceed its jurisdiction.\nPrimarily, the legislation of a country is territorial. The general maxim is that extra territorium jus dicenti impune non paretur; or, that leges extra territorium non obligant. It is true, this does not compose the whole of the legitimate jurisdiction of a state; for it has a right to impose its legislation on its subjects in every part of the world; but in the absence of an intention clearly expressed, or necessarily to be inferred from the language, or from the object or subject-matter of the enactment, the presumption would be that Parliament did not design its statutes to operate on them beyond the territorial limits of the United Kingdom, and they are to be read as if words to that effect had been insented in them.\nAnd numerous decisions bear out this statement of the law, and show its accuracy beyond dispute.\nRosseter v. Cahlmann[19]; The Amalia[20]; Ross v. Himely[21]; The Zollverein[22]; Atty. General v. Kwok-A-Sing[23].\nIn the case of bigamy, under the statute of James I, it was held that no indictment lay when the second marriage was solemnized out of the kingdom. And statutes regulating the ceremony of marriage, as Lord Hardwicke\u2019s Act, were also held to be restricted to the territorial limits of the kingdom. It is said, it is true, that the Parliament of the United Kingdom may make laws binding British subjects without the limits of the British Dominion, provided the intention of the legislation so to give an extra-territorial operation to the statute is apparent, either from express words, or from necessary implication. But this is for the reason that the Parliament of the United Kingdom is a sovereign legislature having unrestricted power over subjects owing allegiance to the Queen in all parts of the world. Can this, however, be said of a colonial legislature which is not in this sense sovereign, but derives its authority to legislate from the delegation of powers by act of the Imperial Parliament? By the 91st section of the B.N.A. Act the Parliament of Canada is empowered to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada. Does this warrant the enact- ment of statutes binding British subjects in respect of acts done without the territory of the Dominion, merely because they happened at the time to have a domicile in the Dominion? Or are not such persons, like all other subjects of the Queen, liable to be affected by no legislation regulating their personal conduct without the limits of the Dominion, save such as may be enacted by the Imperial Legislature, the Parliament of the United Kingdom? I think these weighty and important questions would arise and have to be determined in the present case, if we found in the enactment under consideration, either from express words or necessary implication, that it was the intention of the legislature to apply it to traders, domiciled inhabitants of Canada making purchases without the Dominion, but as there is not the slightest indication of such a design as respects this 136th section, we are relieved from the obligation of determining such a grave question of constitutional law. I have been unable to find anything distinctly bearing on this question of constitutional power, but in Mr. Forsyth\u2019s work on Constitutional Law[24] he states that this identical point arose with reference to the power of the Indian Legislature to pass laws binding on native subjects out of India, and came before the law officers of the Crown and himself in 1867, (when Sir Fitzroy Kelly and Sir Hugh Cairns, were respectively attorney and solicitor general,) and they all, with the exception of the Advocate General Sir R. Phillimore, thought that \u201cas the extent of the powers of the Legislature of India depended upon the authority conferred upon it by acts of Parliament,\u201d it was unsafe to hold the Indian Legislature had power to pass such laws. Although, as I have said, we are not now called on to decide this question, it is still not without relevance to the question of construction, since it strengthens the presumption that all laws passed by the Parliament of Canada are, in the absence of any express language or unavoidable implication to the contrary, intended to be restricted in their operations to the limits of the Dominion.\nThere being nothing either in the language or object of this 136th section of the Insolvent Act to warrant the implication that it was to have any effect out of Canada, the ordinary rule of construction must apply to it, and it must be held not to extend to the purchase of goods in England stated in the second count of the declaration. In my opinion, therefore, the judgments of both courts below must be reversed.\nFOURNIER, J.:\u2014\nI am in favour of dismissing the appeal. I agree entirely with the learned Chief Justice, as also with the reasons given by the judge before whom the case came in the first place, and Mr. Justice Galt and C.J. Sprague. I believe the enactment of 136th clause is clearly within the powers of the Federal Government, which has unlimited power to legislate upon the matter of insolvency.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nI entirely concur in the judgment just rendered by my brother Strong. Although the provision contained in the 136th sec. is found in the Insolvent Act, it is not necessarily connected with the insolvency of any individual. A party need not be insolvent to come within the provisions of the enactment\u2014need not be brought into the Insolvent Court\u2014nor does it appear that it is at all necessary that he should be. Here is a provision separate and distinct altogether from the question of insolvency; although this section is to be found in the Insolvent Act it does not necessarily come under the Insolvent Act at all. Looking at that clause, what are the provisions which are applicable to this case? A party who, with intent to defraud, concealed the fact of his being insolvent from his creditors, or who by any false pretences obtains a credit for any loan of money or any part of the price of goods, wares or merchandize, &c., comes within the provision.\nIn the view I take of this question, I will not question the power of the Legislature to pass that Act, although there may be and have been raised serious doubts as to this provision being within the competency of Parliament. It has been most forcibly shown, whether correctly or not I am not going to say, that is a matter which rests with the Local Legislature. That question, however, I do not undertake to decide, nor do I consider it necessary in the view I take of the position, to do so. This Act was passed by the Parliament of Canada, which, for the purpose of this argument, I admit to be competent to pass it. Now, if a person is guilty of fraud, where is that fraud intended to be committed? It is not to be attributed to this legislature that it intended to punish fraud or felony committed outside of the Dominion. This is a fraud alleged to have been committed in England. If the legislature here had the power, which I doubt, to legislate for the punishment of fraud out of the country, it has not said so. I construe this, then, simply to mean that if a party within the jurisdiction of the Legislature of the Dominion is guilty of obtaining goods from another within that territory with intent to defraud him, and does not pay for them, he is liable. Here then a charge of fraud is made as committed in another country; the non-payment only is charged here. But if a party is not answerable here by the peculiar mode of procedure that is provided for in this section, then, of course, the offence is not com- pleted. There is only a portion of it\u2014the failure to pay. Looking at the whole case from the best consideration I have been able to give to it, I cannot come to the conclusion that the Legislature intended a party guilty of fraud in any other country\u2014foreign country (it might have been in the U.S. or Egypt)\u2014is to be imprisoned here for fraud committed in some other country, and not against any subjects of the Dominion. I think we must construe this section as intended to protect the people over whom the Dominion Parliament had power to legislate and not to include within its terms a provision for the protection of foreigners outside of the Dominion. Further than that, I doubt that the constitutional rights of the Parliament would not go as far as to pass an act, under the peculiar circumstances of this country, to punish a party for fraud committed outside of the Dominion. On these two points, therefore, I am with the appellants and I think the appeal should be allowed.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\u2014\nI would have been of opinion with my brother Gwynne that no appeal lies in this case, but as the majority of the court hold otherwise, I am of opinion with Mr. Justice Strong that section 136 of the act does not apply to acts done out of Canada, whether in England or in a foreign country, and I doubt very much if the Parliament of Canada would have the power to legislate at all on dealings or actions which have taken place outside of Canada.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nAt the argument of this case it was contended by the learned counsel for the respondents, that the case was not appealable to this court, upon the ground that the judgment, which is one in favor of the plaintiffs upon a demurrer to a plea, which is one only of several pleas, upon all of which, including that demurred to, issues in fact have been joined which are not yet tried, is not a final judgment within the meaning of the Act constituting this court, and it was agreed that the argument should proceed subject to this objection. Chevalier v. Cuvillier[25] was referred to by the learned counsel for the appellant as an authority in support of the appeal, but the demurrer in Chevalier v. Cuvillier was to a particular specified portion of the claim asserted in the action, and the allowance of the demurrer in such case was undoubtedly a final judgment as to the claim demurred to. Upon that ground I concurred in allowing the appeal in that case, and to that extent, but no further, I consider myself bound by it. The case here is quite different; it is a judgment allowing a demurrer to one of several pleas, upon all of of which \u201cissues\u201d in fact are joined and yet to be tried. Such a judgment decides nothing as to the action or suit in which the plea is pleaded; the action remains still wholly undetermined, and the 9th sec. of 42 Vict., ch. 39, declares that the words \u201cfinal judgment\u201d to be the subject of appeal means:\nAny judgment, rule, order, or decision, whereby the action, suit, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding is finally determined and concluded.\nBy this language I understand that a judgment, in order to its being appealable to this court, must be one which finally disposes of the whole, or of some specific part, of the subject of the claim in the action, suit or cause, when the point under adjudication arises in an action, suit or cause, or one which finally disposes of the whole, or of some part, of the subject of claim in any matter or judicial proceeding other than an action, suit or cause; a judgment finally determining and conclud- ing some matter or judicial proceeding can not be the proceeding itself concluded and determined. The judgment of the court upon the demurrer in this case leaves the action wholly undecided, and, in my judgment, still is, as it has always been considered to be, interlocutory only.\nWhile I am of this opinion, and that this case is not appealable to this court, it may, however, not be amiss to say also that in my opinion the demurrer does not raise the main question which was argued before us, namely, whether sec. 136 of the Insolvent Act of 1875 is or is not ultra vires of the Dominion Parliament, for whether it be or be not, the plea is clearly bad for the reasons pointed out by Mr. Justice Patterson. The plea confesses the debt for which the action is brought, and that such debt was incurred under circumstances of fraud and offers no matter whatever in avoidance, or in bar of the action, and the point attempted to be raised is whether the provisions of the 136th section of the Insolvent Act, as to imprisonment of the defendant, can be applied if the issue in fact raised upon the plea shall be found in favor of the plaintiffs. It will be time enough to raise that question when the issues in fact joined upon the pleas in bar of the action shall be found in favor of the plaintiffs. The question is probably raised by a replication to some of the other pleas, although it be not, as I think it is not, by a demurrer to a plea which, while it professes to be pleaded in bar of an action for goods sold and delivered, alleges as the sole ground of such bar that the cause of action arose in England. It is obvious that such a plea is no bar to an action for goods sold and delivered, even though it be alleged in the declaration, as it, must be in order to obtain the benefit of the provision of the 136th section of the Insolvent Act, that the defendants con- tracted the debt under circumstances alleged to be fraudulent within the meaning of the Insolvent Act, that is to say, that the debt was contracted by the defendants when they knew or believed themselves to be in insolvent circumstances, which fact they concealed from the plaintiffs with intent to defraud them. Whether the 136th section of the Insolvent Act be or be not ultra vires, such a plea is no plea in bar of the cause of action on the indebitatus assumpsit stated in the declaration; and as the question as to the validity of the above section of the Insolvent Act does not, in my opinion, arise upon the demurrer, I express no opinion upon it; but in withholding my opinion upon this point, I must not be understood as intending to convey any expression of a doubt as to its validity; I merely express no opinion upon it, because, I think, the demurrer does not raise the question; and, as I am of opinion that the plea is bad, I concur that, if the appeal be entertained, it must be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed without costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Bethune, Moss, Falconbridge & Hoyles.\nSolicitors for respondents: Rose, Macdonald, Merritt & Coatsworth.\n[1] 4 Can.

Campbell to Walter Bonn ell on the 19th January, 1876, and on the same day transferred by Bonnell to appellants, to have declared fraudulent, illegal, null and void certain agreements and covenants in the declaration mentioned to wit an obligation executed by the said Samuel S, Campbell on the 14th June, 1875, in favor of dame Lucy Jane Stevens, whereby he hypothecated in her favor, for considerations set forth in the said obligation, his certain real property therein described an obligation by the said Campbell to Brackly Shaw aforesaid executed on the 1st June, 1876, whereby for security of a loan of money made to him by said Shaw, he hypothecated to Shaw, among other the real property hypothecated as above in favor of the said Lucy Jane Stevens; and lastly, a covenant in the obligation to Shaw whereby the said Lucy Jane Stevens gave Lo Shaw priority of his mortgage over that previously granted to her upon the said real property.\nPerkins, as assignee of the insolvent estate of S. S. Campbell, one of the respondents did, not plead to the action \", and Lucy Jane Stevens, Campbell's wife, and Brackly Shaw severed in their defence. Lucy Jane Stevens pleaded that the obligation of the 14th June, 1875, was passed in good faith and for valuable consideration.\nShaw pleaded: 1st. That the said plaintiffs are not now and were not at the date of the institution of the present action, hypothecary creditors on the said lot of land mentioned and described in plaintiff's declaration. That the said obligation and hypothec from the said Samuel S. Campbell to the said Walter Bonnell, and which is alleged to have been transferred to plaintiffs was transferred as security for the payment of a promissory note of the said Walter Bonn ell, which has long since been paid by the proceeds of other collaterals, transferred to plaintiffs by the said Walter Bonnell as security for the payment of the said promissory note.\n2nd. That no legal consideration was ever given by the said Walter Bonn ell to the said Samuel S. Campbell for the said obligation and hypothec, and the said Samuel S. Campbell was not then and never has been since indebted in any sum to the said Walter Bonn ell, the said obligation and hypothec having been consented to by the said S. S. Campbell, simply to enable the said Walter Bonn ell to borrow money on the security of the land thereby hypothecated. That the said mortgage and hypothec was transferred to the said plaintiffs by the said Walter Bonn ell for money loaned and advanced by plaintiffs to the said Walter Bonn ell on the said mortgage and hypothec, and as and for advances then and there directly and indirectly made by the said plaintiffs to the said Walter Bonn ell on the security of land, the whole against the statutes in such case made and provided, and beyond the power and authority of the said the bank. That the allegations in the said transfer contrary and in opposition to the foregoing allegations are false and made with a fraudulent intent of avoiding the provisions of the statutes and the law of the Dominion respecting banks and banking.\n3rd. That the obligations and hypothec by Campbell to his wife was for good and valid consideration and that she could grant priority over her hypothec without binding herself for the debts of her husband\n4th. Shaw put in a general issue.\nThe answers of the appellants to these several \"pleas were general.\nIssue being joined, the parties proceeded to evidence, and it was proved that Campbell gave the mortgage for $25000 to Lucy Jane Stevens, his wife, for the price of the stock in trade belonging to her in a partnership which had existed between her and one Charles Hagar including $10,000 to $11,000 interest on said price. That the mortgage given by Campbell to Bonnell on the 19th January, 1876, was transferred by deed executed before T, Doucet, N. P. by Bonnell to the appellants on the same day as collateral security for a note of $26,000, dated 26th December 1875 and discounted on the said 19th January, 1876, the bank receiving at the same time other collaterals to secure the payment of the note viz :an obligation due to him by one Routh for the sum of $6,145.00, and one due by Girard for $24,000. That Bonnell failed in 1876 and the bank fyled its claim against Bonnell's estate on the 20th April 1877, for $78,682, valuing the three mortgages by them held as security for $25000. That the bank collected $6145 with interest under the Routh mortgage.\nThe Superior Court dismissed the appellant's action as to the three defendants by three separate judgments.\nOn appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench the judgment of the Superior Court was confirmed.\nThe appeal in this case was determined on the question whether the transfer by Bonnell to the bank of an hypothec to secure a note discounted, on the same day is null and void; as being contrary to the Banking Act 84 Vic, ch. 5, sec. 40, and therefore arguments of counsel on the other questions raised by the pleas need not be referred to.\nMR. LAFLAMME, Q.C., for appellants :\nThe taking of security in this case cannot be construed as being against public policy. If ultra vires, it is not necessarily illegal, and then it might be voidable but not void. It was not a direct transaction in violation of the statute. The bank never advanced the money on the security of the real estate, the original party to the mortgage had completed the transaction and advanced the money, and the bank, long afterwards, received this claim as security for advances made on a promissory note in the regular course of business.\nAll the circumstances connected with the granting of these securities, prove conclusively that the bank obtained them to guarantee the advances then made to Bonnell on bills and notes discounted \" a debt contracted to the bank \" in the course of its business. The transfer states it in positive terms.\n\"Whereas the said Walter Bonnell stands indebted to the said bank of Toronto in the sum of twenty six thousand dollars as represented by a certain promissory note signed by the said Walter Bonnell, and payable to his own order and endorsed by him.\"\n\"And whereas the said Walter Bonnell desires to furnish the said bank with collateral security for the due and faithful repayment of his said indebtedness assigns, &c.\"\nWhen he gives the promissory note as representing his indebtedness fixed at $26,000 he authorizes the bank in the letter addressed to the manager to retain the note for collateral security for bills there or there-after to be discounted. Banks as well as all joint stock companies with limited liability, first attained the most practical and complete organization and their fullest development and efficiency, in the United States, and there the courts were called to lay down the rules defining their powers and restricting them within the limits of their proper legal action.\nEvery bank charter in that country contains the provisions of our Banking Act, confining their operation to legitimate banking business, and prohibiting them from dealing in goods, wares and merchandise, and from loaning money on the security of land.\nNevertheless, the highest judicial authorities thought themselves bound to give a fair interpretation to these provisions, establishing restrictions and prohibitions in the interest of the commercial community and society generally, and universally held that the prohibition only applied when the receiving of goods was a direct purchase, or when the taking of security had, for direct object, the advance of money on security of real estate, and not when the security was given to secure regular banking facilities for genuine ordinary commercial transactions. See Angell and Ames on Corporations ([2]); Bryce\u2014Ultra vires ([3]); Ayers v. South Australasian Banking Company ([4]).\nMR. BENJAMIN, for respondent.\nThe Banking Act of this Dominion ([5]) declares :\u2014 \" That a bank shall not either directly or indirectly lend money or make advances upon the security, mortgage, or hypothecation of any lands or tenements, &c.\u201d\nArticle 13 of the Civil Code of Lower Canada declares : \" No one can by private agreement validly contravene the laws of public order and good morals.\" Article 14th of same Code declares:\u2014\"Prohibitive laws import nullity, although such nullity be not therein expressed.\"\nArticle 15th of same code declares: That the word \" shall \" is to be construed as imperative,\" &c.\nThe transfer by Bonnell to the appellants, of the Campbell hypothec is an evasion of the law as above cited, therefore the hypothec claimed by the appellants under such transfer is null and does not exist in their favor, and consequently their right of action, as an hypothecary creditor, never existed.\nRITCHIE, C.J.:\nThis was an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench (appeal side), Province of Quebec, affirming a judgment of the Superior Court, dismissing the appellant's action. [The learned Chief Justice then read a statement of the case 1\nThe plaintiffs based their claim on the validity of this mortgage, and the question of its validity is distinctly raised on the pleadings.\nI agree with Chief Justice Dorian that the transfer made to the appellants of a mortgage to secure an advance made on a promissory note discounted at the same time that the transfer was made was on the part of the bank in violation of the Banking Act, a clumsy attempt at evasion of the 84th Vic., ch. 5 sec 40 which enacts that :\nThe bank shall not, either directly or indirectly lend money or make advances upon the security, mortgage or hypothecation of any lands and tenements.\nAnd the same prohibition in the very same words is contained in the charter of the Bank of Toronto 20 Vic ch. 160 sec. 28 which enacts that:\nThe said bank shall neither directly or indirectly lend money or make advances upon the security, mortgages, hypothecation of any lands or tenements, &c. This prohibition as Chief Justice Dorion justly remarks, is a law of public policy in the public interest and any transaction in violation thereof is necessarily null and void; no court can be called upon to give effect to any such transaction or to enforce any contract or security on which money is lent or advances as thus prohibited are made.\nIt would be a curious state of the law if after the Legislature had prohibited a transaction, parties could enter into it, and, in defiance of the law, compel courts to enforce and give effect to their illegal transactions\nSTRONG, J.:\nThe evidence of Joseph R. Hutchins, a witness for the defendants, shews beyond question, in the entire absence of any contradictory proof, that the several notarial deeds of the 19th January, 1876, whereby S. S. Campbell transferred certain hypothecary claims or vendor's privileges to Bonnell and Bonnell transferred the same claims to the bank as security for the payment of the promissory note of the 30th December, 1875, were both made in pursuance of an arrangement with the bank, whereby the bank agreed to discount the note on the faith of the security afforded by the transfer that the deeds were parts of one and the same transaction, and that Bonnell was a party interposed to give the loan by the bank a colour of legality. Further, the evidence shews that the loan was, in fact, made directly to Campbell, and was not made until after the deeds of transfer were completed.\nMr, Smith the manager of the bank, states distinctly that \"the note was passed through the bank on the 19th January 1876;\" in other words that it was discounted on that day. From this it is apparent that the bank on the last-mentioned day lent to Campbell $26,000, less discount deducted on what was substantially the security of a mortgage of landed property.\nBy the 40th section of the General Banking Act of 1871 it is enacted that__\nThe bank shall not, either directly or indirectly, lend money or make advances upon the security, mortgage or hypothecation of any lands or tenements.\nBy the 41st section of the same Act the bank is empowered to take mortgages upon real property as additional security for debts contracted to the bank in the course of its business\nThe question therefore arises whether this advance of the proceeds of the note for $26000 discounted as before mentioned, having been made upon the security of the hypothec mentioned, that security, which is the foundation of the present action, is now valid in the hands of the bank so as to entitle them to maintain this action for the reduction of a prior mortgage upon the same subject.\nAlthough it appears that Campbell was primarily indebted to the bank, there is no pretence for saying that the mortgage in question was given as a security for the old debt and that the transaction was a mere giving of time and forbearance during the currency of the note, for it distinctly appears from the evidence of both the manager Mr. Smith as well as from that of Mr. Hutchins, who acted in the matter for Campbell that there was a new advance to the amount of the proceeds of the note, which, though bearing an earlier date was not discounted until after the security was completed and in the hands of the bank\nThe question we have to determine is therefore reduced to one of law arising on the construction and effect of the 40th section of the Banking Act and all we have to decide is whether a bank, making an advance or loan of money on a mortgage of real property in violation of the prohibition contained in the section referred to, is notwithstanding entitled to the benefit of the security. The only ground for an argument that the security is not invalidated, is that the Act does not in express words enact that it shall be void. This distinction, however, though it must be admitted to nave the support of considerable American authority cannot avail the appellants in the face, not only of the principles which the English courts have applied to the construction of statutes in analogous cases but also of the decision of the Privy Council upon an enactment in all respects identical with the present.\nIn the National Bank of Australasia v Cherry ([6]), the question arose as to the validity of an equitable mortgage of lands by deposit of title deeds originally given to secure advances to be made by a bank which was prohibited from lending money on such security by a provision in its statute of incorporation expressed in these words :\u2014\nProvided always, that, save and except as hereinbefore specially authorized, it shall not be lawful for the said corporation to advance or lend any money on the security of lands or houses.\nIt was argued that this prohibition was not founded on any considerations of public policy, but was simply a regulation for the -internal management of the bank, and therefore a security taken in infringement of the proviso was not void in the hands of the bank, and might be enforced as effectually as if it had been given to secure a past debt. The Privy Council, however, although holding under the particular facts of that case, that by force of a subsequent arrangement the security originally given for future advances had been converted into one for a pre-existing debt, virtually held that the clause of the Act there in question, although not in express words avoiding a mortgage for future advances given in violation of its terms, did, in effect, make such a security void in the hands of the bank. It is true that in a case, reported in the same volume, of Ayers v. The Gouhh Australian Banking Company ([7]), the Privy Council expressed doubts as to the effect of a similar clause in the charter of a bank * whether the consequences of an infraction of it invalidated the security or had any greater or other effect than to warrant proceedings on the part of the crown for a forfeiture of the charter. But the distinction between this last case and that first referred to consists in this, that whilst in the first case the prohibition was embodied in an Act of Parliament in the latter it was a mere provision of a Royal Charter, so that it could not be said to be illegal in the sense in which a direct contravention of a statutory prohibition is to be so regarded.\nIn the case of the National Bank v. Matthews ([8]), the Supreme Court of the United States held, that under a provision in the National Banking Act prohibiting securities by way of mortgage (the language of the Act, however, not being so stringent as in the present case) the security was not avoided. This decision, however, proceeded upon a principle of statutory construction peculiar to the American courts which admits considerations of the policy of an enactment as influencing its interpretation to an extent to which the decisions of the English courts are distinctly opposed ([9]). Whenever the doing of any act is expressly forbidden by statute, whether on grounds of public policy or Otherwise, the English courts hold the act, if done, to be void, though no express words of avoidance are contained in the enactment itself.\nIn Bartlett v. Vinor ([10]) Lord Holt says:\nEvery contract made for or about any matter or thing which is prohibited or made unlawful by statute, is a void contract, though the statute doss not mention that it shall be so, but only inflicts a penalty on the offender, because a penalty implies a prohibition, though there are no prohibitory words in the statute.\nIn Cope v. Rowlands ([11]) Baron Parke says, with reference to a distinction formerly made between acts done in violation of statutory provisions made for the protection of the revenue and those based on grounds of public policy :\nNotwithstanding some dicta apparently to the contrary, if the contract be rendered illegal, it can make no difference, in point of law whether the statute which makes it so has in view the protection of the revenue or any other object.\nAnd Mr. Sedgwick, in his work on statutory construction, approves of this doctrine as a general rule of statutory construction, saying, this would result in a simple and uniform rule, making void all contracts, growing out of acts forbidden by law, and barring all actions upon them; and he condemns the opposite doctrine, as acted upon in the American case of Harris v. Runnels ([12]), as introducing \" a distinction too nice and refined to be susceptible of practical application.\"\nNumerous other authorities might be quoted to the same effect ([13]). If however it should be considered requisite to show that the clause in question prohibiting the taking of security on lands for contemporaneous advances was introduced to sustain some purpose of public policy the observations of Lord cairns in delivering the judgment of the Privy Council in the case of the National Bank of Australasia v. Cherry, already cited, are directly in point. Lord Cairns there says:\nNow in the first place it was contended that the enactments contained in this clause were not founded upon any considerations of public policy, but were simply regulations for the internal management of the bank as between itself and its shareholders, and that they were to be considered as rules merely for the conduct of the directors, and altogether unaffected by those considerations of public policy which might lead to a wider construction of the Act.\nTheir Lordships are unable to adopt that argument. They cannot but see in this clause that there was some object on the part of the Legislature to regulate, indeed, the internal management of the affairs of the bank, but to regulate those affairs not merely, if at all, with reference to the interests of the shareholders, for it is difficult to see how the interests of the shareholders could be prejudiced by taking securities of this kind but rather to regulate those affairs with some regard to the interests of the public, who, for some reason or other, which it is not for their lordships to speculate upon, are, by this Act, supposed to have an interest in confining the bank to making advances of money without these solid items of security which are specified in this clause.\nIt appears, therefore, to their lordships that there are considerations of public policy involved in this clause, but it is also true to say that those considerations of public policy look to and deal with the management of the bank, and have for their object the limitation of the powers and authorities of the bank.\nThis judgment of the Privy Council, therefore, warrant us in determining that the transfer made to the bank in the present instance was wholly avoided by the 40th section of the Banking Act.\nThe foregoing considerations are founded on the \"principles of statutory interpretation which are established by English law, which would appear to be applicable to the construction of a statute of the Dominion applying alike to all the provinces, and in the present case applied to limit the powers of a corporation domiciled in the Province of Ontario. If however this is an incorrect assumption and the interpretation of the statute is to be governed by the law of the Province of Quebec, the question is not open for discussion, for it is expressly concluded by the 14th article of the Civil Code which declares that \" Prohibitive laws import nullity, although such nullity be not therein expressed.\"\nHad it been established in evidence that the proceeds of the promissory note for $26,000, which, according to the terms of the letter of Campbell to Mr. Coulson, the then manager of the bank, dated the 19th January, 1876, the day on which the mortgage was given him, were to be held by the bank as security for bills discounted, or thereafter to be discounted, or that any part of that amount had in fact been applied to take up bills upon which Campbell was at the time liable to the bank, that might have made the mortgage, wholly or pro tanto, as the case might be, a security for a pre-existing debt, and have thus taken it out of the operation of the 40th section, but I am unable to find the slightest proof of this. We must therefore take the transaction to have been a mortgage given, not to secure a past debt, but to cover a contemporaneous loan, and therefore void under the statute.\nThe other questions which were discussed in the Court of Appeal, namely, the question of the payment or satisfaction of the appellants' debt and the validity of the transaction between Campbell and his wife therefore become immaterial, for the appellants must wholly fail in their action if we determine the mortgage to be void under the Banking Act.\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER, J.:\u2014\nA new debt was really created by this $26,000, which was only discounted upon the security of this transfer. This certainly is in contravention of the Banking Act.\nOn this ground alone, I think the appeal should be dismissed.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nI entirely concur in the views of my learned brothers I think the act intended, though not clearly expressed, to void all such documents. There are other grounds on which, I think, the respondent would be entitled to judgment but as this embraces the whole case I think it is unnecessary to advert to them.\nTASCHEREU, J.:\u2014\nI am of opinion also that the judgment of the two courts below should be confirmed, and the appeal should be dismissed.\nGWYNNE, J. :\u2014\nThis is an action instituted by the Bank of Toronto against Arthur M. Perkins in his capacity of assignee of the estate of Samuel S. Campbell. Lucy Jane Stevens, wife duly separated, as to property from the said Samuel S. Campbell, the said Samuel S. Campbell and Brackley Shaw defendants.\nThe plaintiffs in their declaration allege that by an indenture of mortgage duly executed upon and bearing date the 19th January 1876 the said Samuel S. Camp~ bell since become insolvent, acknowledged himself tobe indebted to one Walter Bonnell in the sum of $15,000 and for security for the said amount hypothecated in favor of the said Walter Bonnell his heirs and assigns certain Property therein described, and that by another deed executed upon the same 19th day of January, 1876, the said Walter Bonnell being indebted as mentioned in the said deed to the plaintiffs in the sum of $26,000 as represented by a certain promissory note signed by the said Walter Bonnell and payable to his own order and endorsed by him, dated the 80th day of December, 1875, payable twelve months after the date thereof at the bank of Toronto and bearing interest at the rate of seven per cent. per annum, for collateral security for the repayment of the sum of $26,000, said amount of the said promissory note, or any balance or renewal thereof, the said Walter Bonnell assigned to the plaintiffs the said $15,000 secured by the mortgage of even date from Campbell to Bonnell.\nThat by deed of mortgage duly executed and bearing date the 14th day of June 1875 in consideration of the said Samuel S. Campbell having, in manner therein alleged, become indebted to his said wife, Dame Lucy J. Stevens or Campbell in the sum of $25,000, he, the said Samuel S. Campbell for securing payment to his said wife of said debt of $25,000, mortgaged and hypothecated to and. in favor of his said wife certain real property therein mentioned, comprising the land described in the mortgage from Campbell to Bonnell of the 19th June, 1876, so as aforesaid assigned to the plaintiffs. That by a deed duly executed by the said Samuel S. Campbell and bearing date on the 9th day of November, 1875, certain errors of description of some of the lands in the said mortgage of the 14th June, 1875, were rectified.\nThat subsequently, and on the 1st day of June, 1876, the said Samuel S. Campbell, by a deed of obligation then executed by him, acknowledged himself to be indebted to the defendant Shaw present and accepting in the sum of $45,000, and for security of the payment thereof in one year from the date of the said deed the said Samuel S. Campbell thereby mortgaged and hypothecated certain property therein described which he declared to belong to him, comprising, among other property, the land hypothecated to Bonnell by the mortgage of the 19th January, 1876; and that the said Lucy J. Stevens, wife of the said Samuel S. Campbell at the execution of the said deed of the 1st June 1876 intervened and granted priority of hypothec to the said defendant Shaw over her claim of $25000 created by the obligation in her favor of the 14th June, 1875.\nThe plaintiffs do not seek in this action to enforce payment out of the estate of Samuel 3. Campbell of any part of the amount of $15,000 received by the mortgage of the 19th January, 1873, so as aforesaid assigned to the bank; they merely Insist that the mortgage and obligation of the 14th June, 1875, should be declared to be fraudulent, null and void as against the plaintiffs, for, the following, amongst other reasons : because by law no sale nor contract can be effected between husband and wife; \u2014 that the said mortgage and hypothec amounts to and must be considered as a sale by the wife effected in favor of her said husband for the supposed interest and value in a stock-in-trade in a business carried on by the wife previous to such sale or hypothec that moreover the said wife of the said Samuel S. Campbell never having conveyed or transferred to her said husband any property or assets of the value described or mentioned in the said deed of mortgage and obligation by him granted to his wife, the value of such assets was fictitious, simulated and collusively made with the view to defraud the creditors of the said insolvent;\u2014that the said Lucy J. Stevens never had or possessed any interest to the amount stated in said deed; and further, that the said obligation and hypothec is null and void with respect to the plaintiffs as regards the property hypothecated, inasmuch as the declaration of ratification subsequently made by the said Samuel S. Campbell in favor of his wife, constitutes virtually a new hypothec which was never assented to or accepted by his said wife, who was not authorized in any legal manner to accept, execute or receive the same, and that the obligation and mortgage contained in the deed of the 1st June, 1876, executed by S. S. Campbell in favor of the defendant Shaw, and more particularly the declaration made by the said Lucy J. Stevens, granting priority of hypothec to the said defendant Shaw over her claim for $25,000 should be declared null and void with respect to the plaintiffs for the following amongst other reasons : Because the said obligation and mortgage was granted by the said S. S. Campbell, when insolvent, to the knowledge of the said defendant Shaw and because by the said deed the said S. S. Campbell, with the concurrence of his wife, pretends to grant to the said Shaw a priority of mortgage or hypothec over the pretended hypothec obtained by her illegally as aforesaid and that even in the event of such mortgage obtained by the said Lucy J. Stevens being valid and legal, she could not grant any priority of hypothec to the. said Shaw, but could only renounce in his favor to the hypothec by her obtained, and the said plaintiffs are entitled to have it declared that the said defendant Shaw cannot claim or pretend to have any priority of mortgage by virtue of the pretended renunciation of the said Lucy J. Stevens; the prayer of the plaintiffs' declaration is limited to the above purposes.\nTo this declaration Perkins, the assignee of Campbell, did not plead, Lucy J. Stevens, in short substance, pleaded that the deed of obligation and mortgage of the 14th June, 1875, sought to be set aside, was made in good faith and for valuable consideration, and after authority had been had to that effect from the court and that the same was, and is, legal and valid, and ought not to be set aside.\nThe defendant Shaw pleaded among other pleas: 1st. That the plaintiffs were not, at the date of the institution of the present action, hypothecary creditors on the lot of land described in plaintiffs' declaration, that the said obligation and hypothec from Campbell to Bonnell and which is alleged to have been transferred to plaintiffs was transferred as security for the payment of a promissory note of the said Bonnell, which has been long since paid by the proceeds of other collaterals transferred to plaintiffs by the said Bonnell as security for the payment of the said promissory note; and, 2nd. That the plaintiffs cannot by law pretend to be hypothecary creditors on the lot of land mentioned in the plaintiffs declaration as being hypothecated by Campbell to Bonnell, and which is pretended to have been transferred to the plaintiffs, inasmuch as neither Bonnell nor Campbell were indebted to the said plaintiffs for the said sum of $26,000 mentioned in said deed of transfer from Bonnell to the plaintiffs, and no legal consideration was ever given by Bonnell to Campbell for the said obligation, and Campbell was not then nor has he since been indebted in any sum to Bonnell, the said obligation and hypothec having been consented to by Campbell simply to enable Bonnell to borrow money on security of the land thereby hypothecated, and that the said mortgage and hypothec was transferred to the said plaintiff by Bonnell for money loaned by plaintiffs to him on the security of the said mortgage and hypothec, and as and for an advance then made directly and indirectly on the security of land against the Statutes in such case made and provided and beyond the power and authority of the bank, and that the allegations in the said transfer to the contrary are false and made with the fraudulent intent of avoiding the provisions of the Statutes respecting banks and banking.\nEvidence having been entered into upon the issues joined upon the above pleadings, the judge of the Superior Court, before whom the case came, being of opinion that the plaintiffs had failed to invalidate the mortgage from Campbell to his wife, and the grant of priority of hypothec in the obligation and mortgage from Campbell to Shaw of the 1st of June, 1876, dismissed the plaintiffs action as against Mrs. Campbell and defendant Shaw respectively with costs and against the defendant Perkins without costs.\nUpon appeal from this decision the Court of Queen's Bench in Montreal Mr. Justice Monk dissenting, affirmed the judgment of the Superior Court, not, however, for the reasons stated in that judgment, but upon the ground that as the Court of Queen's Bench found the fact to be that the bank had been paid the amount of the promissory note for $26,000 in full, and had, therefore no interest in contesting the hypothec given by Campbell to Shaw, nor the priority of hypothec given to him by Mrs. Campbell. The learned Chief Justice of the Court of Queen's Bench was of opinion that the deed of the 4th June, 1875, by which Campbell acknowledged to owe to his wife a sum of $25,000, and gave her a mortgage on his property for that amount is null and void and cannot be invoked against Campbell's creditors; that a married woman, separated as to property, could give to a creditor of her husband priority over her own claims upon the property; and lastly, that the transfer made to the plaintiffs of a mortgage to secure an advance made on a promissory note discounted at the same time that the transfer was made is an evasion of the Banking Act 85 Vic. ch. 5 s. 40 which forbids banks to advance on the security of real estate, and that this prohibition being in the public interest, a law of public policy the transfer made by Bonnell to the plaintiffs was null and void.\nThe issue joined upon the above second plea of the defendant Shaw appears to be the primary issue to be disposed of for if that issue should be determined against the plaintiffs, they have no locus standi in curia, and in such case it would not be proper to adjudicate in respect of the other issues upon the record as it is framed. If the plaintiffs have no loots standi in curia for the reason stated in the above plea of the defendant Shaw the question whether anything, or if anything, how much, remains due to the plaintiffs upon the note for $260000 or otherwise, is one which can arise only be- tween the plaintiffs and the estate of Bonnell, and not between the plaintiffs and the parties to this record, and for the same reason the plaintiffs would have no right to call in question the validity of the mortgage executed by Campbell in favor of his wife, so that no valid judgment upon that point could be rendered upon this record. Now that Shaw, as a hypothecary creditor of Campbell, has such an interest in the land in question as entitles him to dispute the title of the plaintiff thereto, cannot, I think, admit of a doubt, and he has done so by a plea specially framed for the purpose. In Ayers v. The South Australian Banking Co, ([14]) a similar point was made upon a clause in a bank charter, which said that it should not be lawful for the bank to make advances upon merchandize, but as a decision was unnecessary for the determination of the case, none was given. Lord Justice Mellish, delivering the judgment of the Privy Council in that case, says:\nUnquestionably, a great many questions might be raised on the effect of that clause in the charter which may be of great importance, but which also, being of great difficulty, their lordships do not think it necessary to given any opinion upon. There may be a question as to what are the transactions which come really within the clause, and whether this particular case does come within it. There may also be a question whether, under any circumstances, the effect of violating such a provision is more than this, that the crown may take advantage of it as a forfeiture of the charter.\nTheir lordships, however, expressed no opinion upon the point. In the same volume, however, is reported a case more directly in point of The National Bank of Australasia v. Cherry ([15]). In that case it appeared that one While who had an account with the bank in 1861 obtained leave to overdraw to the extent of \u00a310,000 on the security of the deposit of certain title deeds respecting lands; having, however, in 1866 overdrawn to an amount exceeding \u00a313,000, the bank brought an action against him for that amount and recovered judgment but agreed not to enforce such judgment in consideration that the title deeds so deposited should remain as security for the money then due, for which judgment was to be signed after the then approaching harvest, and the land sold for the liquidation of the debt. White, having become insolvent before sale of the land a bill was filed by the bank against his assignees in insolvency, claiming the benefit of the security, to which the assignees demurred upon the ground that the deposit of title deeds was for future advances contrary to the provisions of the Act constituting the charter of the bank; the demurrer having been allowed by the Supreme Court of Australia, the case was appealed to the Privy Council, where it was held that there being in 1866 when the bank recovered their judgment, a valid subsisting debt between the bank and White, the agreement then made was within the enabling part of the 7th sec. of the Act, by which the bank was authorized, among other powers, to take and hold, but only until the same can be advantageously disposed of for reimbursement only, and not for profit, any free held or leasehold lands and hereditaments and any real estate and any merchandise in ships which may be taken by the said corporation in satisfaction, liquidation or discharge of any debt due to the said corporation, or in security for any debt or liability bond fide incurred or come under previously and not in anticipation or expectation of such security.\nProvided always that save, and except as hereinbefore specially authorized, it shall not be lawful for the said corporation to advance or lend any money on the security of lands or houses or ships or on pledges of merchandise.\nLord Cairns in giving the judgment of the Privy Council in that case, says at page 806 ([16]): And again he says ([17]) :\nIt would seem to have been the object of the legislature in this clause not to make void the contracts for such advances as between the bank and their customers, in the same way, that in former times contracts open to the objection of the usury laws were made void, ( but rather to make it something ultra vires the bank to take, upon the occasion of contracts for those advances, securities of the kind mentioned in this section And this construction of the section would harmonize with what was very properly, as their lordships think, admitted at the bar on behalf of the respondents, that upon a transaction of the kind described in this bill the contract for the loan of money would be perfectly valid, and the question would be confined to a question as to whether the bank had the power to take the security which it took for the advance.\nHe then proceeds to show that in 1866 at a time when White might have resisted any claim of the bank founded upon the deposit of the deeds, he preferred for valuable consideration to make a fresh agreement with the bank by which he authorized the bank to retain the deed and promised that they should stand as security for the sum for which judgment was about to be signed; and he concludes that the transaction fell within the enabling part of the 7th sec. There is not here a word of a suggestion that no person but the crown by process to forfeit the charter could raise the point. The whole judgment of the Lord Chancellor excludes the possibility of such an opinion being entertained by the Privy Council however, all doubt, if there were any upon the point, was put an end to four years afterwards by the case of Riche v. Ashbury Railway Carriage Co. ([18]), which passed through the Courts of Exchequer and Exchequer Chamber and the House of Lords.\nFrom the judgment of Lord Chancellor Lord Cairns in which latter case a short extract is all that is necessary to establish upon the authority of the House of Lords the principle applicable to this case. At p. 673, he says, and this is the principle upon which the judgment in the case rests :\nI find Mr. Justice Blackburn, whose judgment (in the Court of Exchequer Chamber) was concurred in by two other judges who took the same view\u00bb expressing himself thus : I do not entertain any doubt that if, on the true construction of a statute creating a corporation it appears to be the intention of the legislature, expressed or implied. that the corporation shall not enter into a particular contract, every court, whether Law or Equity, is bound to treat a contract entered into contrary to the enactment as illegal, and, therefore, wholly void and to hold that a contract wholly void cannot be ratified.\nMy lords, that sums up and exhausts the whole case. in my opinion, beyond all doubt on the true construction of the Statute of 1862 creating this corporation, it appears that it was the intention of the legislature not implied, but actually expressed, that the corporation should not enter, having regard to its memorandum of association, into a contract of this description. If so, according to the words of Mr. Justice Blackburn, every court, whether of Law or Equity, is bound to treat that contract entered into contrary to the enactment, I will not say as illegal, but as extra vires, and wholly null and void, and to hold also that a contract wholly void cannot be ratified\nNow the Act which constitutes the plaintiffs' charter is the\" Dominion statute 84 Vic, c. 5, which enacts in sec. 39 that the bank shall have the power to acquire and hold real estate for its actual use and occupation and the management of its business, and to sell and dispose of the same and other property to acquire in its stead for the same purpose.\nIn sec. 40 that the bank shall not either directly or indirectly, lend money or make advances upon the security, mortgage or hypothecation of any lands or tenements, or of any ships or other vessels, nor upon the security or pledge of any share or shares of the capital stock of the bank, or of any goods, wares or merchandise except as authorized by this Act; and in\nSec. 41 that the bank may take, hold and dispose of mortgages and hypotheques upon personal as well as real property by way of additional security for debts contracted to the bank in the course of its business. Upon an Act similarly worded the late Sir John Robinson C. J. in the Court of Appeal of the late Province of Upper Canada in The Commercial Bank v. The Bank of U. C. ([19]) thus expresses himself :\nWhen it is shown that the mortgage in any case was taken by a bank \" as an additional security for a debt contracted to it in the course of its business,\" then the question occurs whether that can only be taken to mean a debt that had been previously incurred with it in the course of its business, or whether a mortgage may not be taken as an additional security for a debt that had no previous existence, but which the bank were about to allow a party to contract by advancing him money at that time in the proper course of their business, as for instance if any merchant had brought to the bank on the 21st May, 1855, for discount, a bill drawn by Henry Bull, jun., on Bull brothers, and accepted by the latter, could the bank properly have taken a mortgage from either party to the bill, or from the person who brought it and got the money, to secure them in the money which they advanced upon the bill ? That is not this case and I shall only, therefore say that as the words of the statute are not against it, so I think it might perhaps be held that the spirit and intention of the Act are not opposed to it, and that a mortgage so taken might be upheld when it appears that the mortgage was really and in truth taken to secure the transaction upon the bill, and not that the bill was created for the mere purpose of upholding and giving colour to the mortgage, that would be a question of fact upon which the conclusion that a jury might come to would be in general so uncertain that I dare say the banks will not think it prudent to risk their money on a real security in any such case, where the nature of the transaction might appear to be at all equivocal.\nNow, I do not desire to call in question any part of the opinion of the learned Chief Justice as here expressed as to the validity of a mortgage bon\u00e2 fide given or assigned to a bank by way of collateral security for an advance made by the bank upon regular business paper, or in the ordinary course of their business as bankers, concurrently with the giving or assigning to them of a mortgage upon lands as additional security, or to express any opinion upon that point inasmuch as sitting here as a juror, and having the duty imposed. upon me of finding the facts in the case, I have been unable to bring my mind to the conclusion that this is such a case; on the contrary, the conviction formed in my mind by the facts is that the transaction between Bonnell and the bank, of the 19th January, 1876, was primarily based upon the security of the mortgages upon real estate assigned to the bank by the deed of that date. That the note for $26,000 recited in that deed had not then been if ever it was in fact discounted or agreed to be discounted as an ordinary banking transaction. A note made by one payable to his own order twelve months after date is not ordinary business paper * that the note did not then constitute any debt due from Bonnell to the bank \u00b0 that it was not made for the purpose of being discounted by them in the ordinary course of their business as bankers, but was given existence for the mere purpose of upholding and giving color to the assignment of the mortgages, the whole having been assigned, and contrived for the purpose of evading the statute, and the mortgages were not assigned really and in truth to secure an independent banking transaction on the note.\nThe transfer of the mortgage is based upon the following recital in the deed of transfer :\nWhereas the said Walter Bonnell stands indebted to the said Bank of Toronto in the sum of twenty-six thousand dollars currency as represented by a certain promissory note signed by the said Walter Bonnell, and payable to his own order and endorsed by him, and dated at Montreal) the 30th day of December, 1875, and payable at twelve months from from the date thereof at the bank of Toronto, and bearing interest at the rate of seven per centum per annum \u00b0 and whereas the said Walter Bonnell desires to furnish the said bank with collateral security for the due and faithful repayment of his said indebtedness.\nThe deed then assigns, among other things: The sum of $15,000 currency being the amount of a certain mortgage granted by Samuel S. Campbell to the said Walter Bonnell, passed before the said undersigned notary, and bearing even date herewith and hypothecating lot No. 446 on the official plan of the St. Antoine ward, of the said city of Montreal.\nNow no such debt as that here recited did in truth then exist; no such note as that here recited had then been discounted by the bank or constituted a debt due from Bonnell to the bank but upon. the same day as the execution of the mortgage from Campbell to Bonnell, which was executed under instructions from the bank manager, and its transfer to the bank, namely, the 19th January 1876 Bonnell addressed a letter to the bank manager enclosing to him the note for $26,000, which letter is as follows '.\nMontreal, January 19th, 1876.\nTo The Manager, Bank of Toronto, Montreal:\nI hereby hand you my promissory note for twenty-six thousand dollars, made payable to my own order one year after date with interest at the rate of 7 per cent, per annum, the above note bearing date the 30th December, 1875, the proceeds of which you are hereby authorized to retain as collateral security for any sterling bills of exchange now or hereafter to be discounted by the bank of Toronto for me made by L. J. Campbell & Co., on Messrs. Hutchins and Macdonald of London, England, or other parties in Great Britain, and bearing my endorsement.\n(Signed) Walter Bonnell\nThos. Doucet, witness.\nThe signature of Mr. Doucet, who was the notary before whom the mortgage and transfer of it was executed, indicates the time when the note was made, and that it was ante dated for the purpose of upholding the recital in the transfer, is apparent. Now, the only drafts which are shown to have had then any existence upon which was Bonnell's name in any character were the following:\u2014a draft dated 19th January, 1876, by Bonnell (not said upon whom) for \u00a31,458 5s. sterling, endorsed by L. J. Campbell and Co., payable in 90 days; another of same date by Bonnell upon Hutchins and MacDonald, also at 90 days for \u00a32,000, also endorsed by L. J. Campbell & Co.; also notes drawn by Campbell & Co. and endorsed by Bonnell for $1850 $1100 and $3,000 respectively.\nNow, it will be observed that none of these drafts notes come within the description of the drafts which, by the letter of the 19th January, 1876, endorsing the note for $26,000, were contemplated as drafts collateral to which the proceeds of the note for $26,000 were, by that letter, authorized to be held and applied. All drafts, such as those referred to in the letter, had, therefore, yet to come into existence. The note, therefore, for $26,000 had no original as col\" lateral to which it could be held or applied at the time it was enclosed to the bank; but further, a note payable at twelve months to one's own order and endorsed to the Bank as collateral security for the payment of drafts and notes at ninety days discounted by the bank, upon which as drawer, maker or endorser, the bank had already the security of the maker of the note at twelve months, can, with no propriety, be said to be a banking transaction in the ordinary course of business nor could the bank going through the form in their own books of putting the proceeds of an apparent discount of such note to the credit of the maker of it to be held however, by the bank as security for the due payment of the drafts actually discounted as banking paper, be said, with any propriety to constitute a debt due to the bank contracted in the due course of banking business and due to the bank on the 19th January 1876 when the note was first placed in their hands. Then on the 20th April, 1877, when the bank manager, who negotiated the whole of this transaction, proves in Bonnell's insolvency for the debts due to the bank by Bonnell no claim whatever is made as for a debt due to the bank upon this note for $26,000. Upon the whole, therefore, as I have said, I can come to no other conclusion than that the note was given existence for the sole purpose of upholding and giving colour to the mortgage and its transfer, which latter contained a false recital of a debt due for the purpose of eluding a discovery of the true nature of the transaction; for this reason I am of opinion that the bank has no locus standi in curia, and that therefore we should not express any opinion upon the other points, which can only come into judgment if the bank had a locus standi, and that for the above reason and not for those relied upon, either in the Superior Court or in the Court of Queen's Bench in appeal, the plaintiffs action should be dismissed, as also should this appeal, with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs,\nSolicitors for appellants: R. & L.

J. Ritchie, Knt., C.J. and Strong, Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne, J.J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nInjunction 41 Tic. ch. 14 (P.Q.) Sale by Commissioner of Crown Lands of lands subject to current timber licenses. Effect of Licensee\u2019 s rights.\nUnder the provisions of the Quebec Act, 41 Vic, ch. 14, the D. of C. L. Co., in November, 1881, alleging themselves to be proprietors and in possession of a number of lots in the township of Whitton, P.Q., obtained an ex paste injunction, restraining G. B. H, et al from further prosecuting lumbering operations which they had begun on these lots. G. B. H. et al were cutting in virtue of a license from the government, dated 3rd May, 1881, which was a renewals of a former license By a report of the Executive Council of the Province of Quebec dated 1st April, 1881, and approved of by the Lieutenant Governor in Council on the 7th of the same month the Commissioner of Crown Lands was authorized to sell to the company the lands in question, and the company deposited $12,000 to the credit of the department to be applied on account of the intended purchase. On the 9th of May the company gave our a contract for the clearing of a portion of the land, and on the 19th July, 1881 the Commissioner executed a deed of sale in favor of the company, subject, amongst other conditions, \" to the current licenses to cut timber on the lots.\" Upon the writ being returned, the injunction was suspended. G. B. H. et al answered the petition and the Superior Court dissolved the injunction. On appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench, this judgment was reversed and the injunction applied for made perpetual. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada it was\nHeld,\u2014(Henry and Gwynne, JJ., dissenting,) that the D. of C. L. & C. Co, had not acquired any valid title to the lands in question prior to the 19th July, 1881, and that by the instrument of that date their rights were subordinated to all current licenses, and G. B. H. et al having established their right to possess said lands for the purpose of carrying on their lumber operations under a license from the Crown, dated 3rd May, 1881, the injunction granted ex paste to the D. of C. L. & C Co, in November; 1881, under the provisions of 41 Vic., oh. 14, (P.Q.,) had been properly dissolved by the Superior Court.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side), reversing the judgment of the Superior Court and maintaining a writ of injunction issued in the cause and declaring the same perpetual.\nThe proceedings in the court of original jurisdiction were commenced by the respondents, who, alleging themselves to be proprietors and in possession of a large number of lots of land in the township of Whitton, district of St. Fraficis, obtained an ex parte injunction from Mr. Justice Doherty, at Sherbrooke, restraining the present appellants from further prosecuting lumbering operations which they had begun on some of these lots, and ordering them forthwith to remove from the land in question, which comprised about 20,590 acres, their employees and contractors. Upon the writ being returned, the injunction was suspended; the defendants answered the petition by three pleas.\nThe first plea was a special d\u00e9n\u00e9gation of the allegations of the petition or declaration.\nThe second plea alleged in substance that plaintiffs' title dated only on 19th July, 1881, and was therefore subject to the timber license expiring 30th April, 1882; that plaintiffs had been guilty of suppression of material facts in their petition, whereby they got an ex parte injunction; that defendants had the possession of a year contemplated by the injunction act; that plaintiffs had not placed settlers on the lands according to the conditions of sale but were violating their contract with the Government.\nBy a third answer, the defendants pleaded that on the 7th April 1881 the date of the order-in-council they had a continuing right of possession in said lands for 20 years from the year 1872, and their rights could not be interfered with or affected by any other sales or locations than those made to bon\u00fb fide settlers\nThat the order-in-council of 7th April and all proceedings thereunder, were and are ultra vires, null and void in so far as the same could affect the defendants and their rights.\nThe following are the material facts of the case as appeared from the oral and documentary evidence given at the trial\nDuring the period of nearly ten years the respondents and their auteurs had continuously, during the lumbering business of each year, carried on business as lumbermen on timber limits, in the said township of Whitton, complying with the Government regulations to which said limits were subject and with the conditions of the licenses annually renewed and issued to them as giantess and owners of timber limits.\nWhile respondents were thus in possession of said timber limits in December 1879 and before the respondent company had corporate existence, Mr. Stock-well, now one of the company, and its manager, applied to the commissioner of Crown lands on behalf of certain English capitalists, for a grant or purchase of 4300,000 acres of unsettled lands in the townships.\nThis application was the beginning of a voluminous correspondence between Stockwell and the commissioner and resulted in an offer to sell 100000 acres to a company to be organized as suggested by the commissioner in the correspondence.\nThe respondent company was incorporated in England and proof of the fact furnished by Stockwell and $12,000 deposited by him to pay the first instalment of the purchase money, so soon as the sale should be made to the company.\nOf his negotiations and correspondence with Stock-well, apropos of the land in question, the commissioner drew up a journal report, embodying said correspondence and submitted the same to a committee of the executive council, who, having considered the matter, presented it to the Lieutenant-Governor for his approval l and on the 7th of April 1881, the report was approved by his honor\u2014thus constituting by this correspondence, so approved, what the parties to this cause agreed to call \" an order in council \"\nThis order in council contained inter alia the following provisions:\u2014\nThe sale if carried out will be made upon the following conditions: \u201c3rd. The sale shall be subject, with regard to each.\u201d lot or farm settled upon, to all the conditions and restrictions of an ordinary sale, as set forth in the blank form of receipt for first instalment attached hereto (as follows):\nNo. 115, Crown Lands Agency.\n$ 187\n[L.S.]\nReceived from the sum of being the first instalment of one-fifth of the purchase money of acres of land contained in lot, No. in the range of the township of P.Q., the remainder payable in four equal annual instalments with interest from this date.\nThis sale, if not disallowed by the Commissioner of Crown Lands, is made subject to the following conditions, viz.: The purchaser to take possession of the land within six months from the date hereof and from that time continue to reside on and occupy the s same, either by himself or through others, for at least two years, and within four years at farthest from this date clear, and have under crop, a quantity thereof in proportion of at least ten acres for every one hundred acres, and erect thereon a habitable house of the dimensions of at least sixteen by twenty feet. No timber to be cut before the issuing of the patent, except under license, or for clearing of the land, fuel, buildings and fences. All timber cut contrary to these conditions will be dealt with as timber cut without permission on public lands. No transfer of the purchaser's right will be recognised in cases wheel there is default in complying with any of the conditions of sale. In no case will the patent issue before the expiration of two years of occupation of the land; or the fulfilment of the whole of the conditions, even though the land be paid for in full. Subject also to current licenses to cut timber on the land and the purchaser to pay for any real improvements now existing thereon, belonging to any other party.\nAnd concluded as follows: Alter due consideration of the facts above detailed, the undersigned has the honor to recommend, that he be now authorized to c carry out the terms and intensions of his letter of 30th December, 1879, addressed to the aforesaid Frs. W. Stockwell with the modifications allowed by subsequent letter of the 13th April 1880, above embodied, a and to sell to the Dominion of Canada Land and Colonization Company the lands in question, in Accordance with the terms and conditions of the above mentioned letters.\nThe whole respectfully submitted.\nE. J. Flynn,\nCommissioner of Crown Lands.\nOn the 3rd of May, 1881, the appellants having in all respects complied with the conditions of their license, paid into the department the ground rent due for its renewal for the season of 1881-82, and after some delay received their license from the agent. This license was delivered to them on the 11th July, 1882. It is dated the 3rd May, the day on which the ground rent was paid.\nWhen the order in council was passed there had been sold by the crown land local agents some of the lots included in the list of lands to be sold to plaintiffs, of which fact the department at the time was unaware; and on the 4th day of May, 1881, the Department, acting by Mr. W. E. Collins, the clerk in charge Of the sales department, wrote to Mr. Stockwell as follows:\nF. W. Stockwell, Esq.,\nTownship of Gayhurst, Lot 33, in 3rd Range, 100 acres.\nThis completes the list of lands sold and approved of by department previous to 7th April last, date of the order in council reserving certain lands in favor of the Dominion of Canada Land and Colonization Company.\nYours respectfully,\nW. E. Collins.\nDept. of Crown Lands, Quebec, 4th May, 1881.\nTo this letter was annexed a list of Jots forming part of reserve of Dominion Land and Colonization Company, disposed of previous to date of order in c council authorizing such reserve, 7th April 1881.\nOn the following day the assistant commissioner Mr. E. E. Tach\u00e9, wrote the agent in the Saint Francis agency and sent him a list of the lands sold to plaintiffs.\nThe letter is as follows:\nSIR,\u2014 YOU are hereby notified that all the lands enumerated in the accompanying list have been reserved in favor of the Dominion of Canada Land and Colonization Co., by order in council of 7th ult you will be therefore guided accordingly. With regard to s sales made by you of any of said lands since the date of the above order in council including those entered in your April return, they of course are disallowed. You should inform the respective purchasers of such l lots that they will have to deal with above company as regards the purchase thereof, &c.\nOn the 9th of May the respondents concluded a contract for the clearing of the land and building of the houses with the knowledge of the Crown lands department.\nOn the 10th May the assistant commissioner, under the directions of the commissioner, telegraphed the Saint Francis agent not to renew the timber license on the lands sold.\nA copy of this order in council was shortly afterwards given to Mr. Stock well by the commissioner of Crown lands who told him at the same time, that it was all right, to go ahead; and in accordance with this permission, on the 9th of May the company give out a contract for the clearing of a portion of the land.\nOn the 19th of July 1881 the commissioner of Crown Lands in accordance with the approval which he had asked and obtained made and endorsed upon the order in council the following ruling, produced as defendants' exhibit No. 11.\n\"This is to certify that I the undersigned, commissioner of Crown lands, have sold, as by these presents, I do sell in virtue of the authority in me vested by the preceding order in council, and the law, to the said Dominion of Canada Land and Colonization Company the lots of land mentioned in the list hereunto annexed and authenticated by my signature, with the exception of the lots Nos. 10 and 11 in 5th range N. E. Whitton, and lot No. 17 in 7th range, and No, 8 in 9th range of same township; also of lot No. 44 in 6th range, Spalding; lots 42, 43, 47 and 48 in 5th range, lots No. 13, 14 and 42 in 6th range, and No. 31 in 3rd range of Ditch. field all which lots had been sold at the date of the said order in council, to wit: on the 7th April last, and were not then disposable. The said sale is thus made for the price or consideration, and subject to all the terms clauses and conditions mentioned and set forth in the said order in council and specially to the conditions indicated in the blank form of receipt or location ticket annexed to the said order in council to which no special derogation has been made, and amongst other conditions to the current licenses to cut timber on the lots and to the payment by the said company of all real improvements which may have been made by third parties on said lands.\nI acknowledge having received from the said company the sum of twelve thousand dollars on account of on as one instalment on the purchase money or price of sale as it is alleged in the said report or order in in council.\nIn witness whereof my hand and seal at Quebec this 19th day of July, 1881.\n(Signed) E. J. Flynn,\nCommissioner of Crown Lands P.Q.\nOn the following day he wrote Mr. Stock well officially, as manager of the company, enclosing him the order in council of the 7th April, and informing him that he had confirmed the sale to the company with some modifications.\nThe Superior Court held that the petitioners were not proprietors through a valid title of the lands in questing and in lawful possession thereof so as to entitle them to the remedy by injunction. The Court of Queen's Bench, on appeal, held that petitioners had proved that they were proprietors in possession.\nMr. Irvine, Q.C. for appellants.\nMr. Kerr, Q.C., and Mr. Brown for respondents. The arguments, statutes, and regulations, and cases relied on, are fully noticed in the judgments.\nRITCHIE, C. J.:\u2014\nI think the judgment of the Superior Court dissolving the injunction should not have been disturbed; that the petitioners are not the proprietors through a valid title to the lands in question and are not in such lawful possession thereof as to entitle them to the relief they seek by injunction. Hall's licenses were recognized as valid and subsisting by the government in dealing with the D. L. Co., and such dealings were expressly subject to such licenses, whereby \" the right to take and keep exclusive possession of the lands in question, subject to such regulations and restrictions as may be established by order in council is conferred on the licensees by the Con. Stats. Can ch. 23 sec. 2 and which can only be affected at the instance and in favour of the actual and bon tide settlers on their respective farms, in whose favour alone the reservations in the licenses are made\nSTRONG J.:\nThe respondents, who were petitioners in the court of first instance, sought an injunction to restrain the appellants from cutting timber on certain lands of the Crown to which the petitioners claimed an actual title as purchasers under a conditional agreement or promise of sale entered into by the Crown, through the agency of the commissioner of Crown lands for the Province of Quebec, dated the 19th July, 1881.\nThis agreement was made under authority of an order in council, approved by the Lieutenant Governor of the Province of Quebec on the 7th of April, 1881 The respondents claim the right to carry their title back to the date of this order in council but as it merely authorized the commissioner to carry out the terms of the proposals mentioned in it and approved by it, it is manifest that the order in council by itself conferred no title, and that the petitioners acquired none anterior to the 19th July, 1881, when, by an instrument under seal endorsed upon the order in council which is called \" the commissioner's ruling,\" and which was in substance, an agreement on behalf of the Crown to sell the lands to the petitioners or rather, to the locates whom the petitioners, should select, on the terms proposed, they for the first time acquired what I have called an inchoate title to the lands in question.\nThe appellants, however, assert a paramount title to cut timber on their lands under a license from the Crown dated the 3rd May 1881 and therefore prior in date to the title of the respondents which did not accrue until the 19th of July following. This priority in point of time of the appellants' license would alone have ben sufficient, in my judgment, to disentitle the respondents to the injunction which they asked for but when it appears as it does both from the order in council and L the agreement or commissioner's ruling\" of the 19th of July, that the rights of the respondents were expressly subordinated to all current licenses to cut timber and that the location tickets which they were to issue to the actual settlers to whom they might make sales upon the lands in question, were also to be expressly subject to such current licenses it is difficult to see how any serious doubt or question can possibly be raised as to the appellants' rights under the license of the 3rd May, 1881.\nThe order in council, as already stated, was a mere authority to the commissioner to make the sale if he should so think fit, and no rights were acquired by the respondents by force of it until the agreement of the 19th July was signed by the commissioner. Until the latter date nothing whatever had been done to interfere with the right of the Crown to sell the lands to other parties, if it should be thought fit, or to grant or renew licenses to cut timber; consequently the words c current licenses \" in the instrument of the 19th of July, 1881, must mean licenses then current, and cannot be restricted to licenses which were current on the 7th April 1881 the date of the order in council. The licence which had been issued or renewed to the appellants on the 3rd May previously was, therefore, according to the most strict and rigorous construction which can be given to the words, a valid and current license within the meaning of the exception. Then it is apparent that the rights of the petitioners, being thus made subject to those of the holders of timber licenses, the petitioners are not within the exception contained in the license in favor of actual settlers. They are not actual settlers as it is contemplated by the agreement that there shall be no actual settlement except by the persons to whom the petitioners may resell; and the exception contained in the agreement by the Crown with the petitioners and which is also required to be inserted in the location tickets, rendered this provision in the licenses inoperative against the appellants. Another sufficient reason for refusing an injunction is that the petitioners do not bring themselves within the Quebec statute, 41 Vic., ch. 14 sec. 1 sub-sec. 2 inasmuch as the Dominion Land Company are neither proprietors under a valid title, nor were they ever in possession of the lands in question.\nI may add that, in my opinion, the learned judge of the Superior Court at Sherbrooke was also entirely right in dissolving the injunction on another ground, that of insufficient disclosure of the facts on the applications for the ex parte injunction.\nMy judgment is therefore that this appeal should be allowed, and that the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench be reversed, and the order of the Superior Court be restored with costs to the appellants in both courts.\nFOURNIER, J.:\nFor the reasons given by Mr. Justice Tessier in the Court of Queen's Bench, and by Mr. Justice Doherty in the Superior Court I am in favor of allowing this appeal.\nHENRY, J.:\nThe question before us in this case is whether the judgment of Mr. Justice Doherty quashing and annulling the injunction previously granted by him on the petition of the respondents' company, should be sustained or reversed. On an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench that judgment was reversed; and, from the judgment of the latter, an appeal was taken to this court. The case was fully and ably argued before us, and now awaits our decision.\nThe interests involved are larger and I have given my best consideration to the law applicable to the peculiar circumstances of the parties and their relative positions and interests when the injunction was granted. The right of the respondents to an injunction, at the time when that in this case was granted, depends upon the legal position of the parties at the time, not only as to the title, but also as to the actual possession of the lands in question, or to the right of possession depending on title.\nTo determine the question at issue it is necessary, in the first place, to ascertain the actual position of the respondents' Company, both as to title and possession.\nThe evidence shows that, after negotiating with the respondents' company and others in its interests, for a period of about a year and a half, an order in council was passed, on the seventh day of April, 1881, by which the Government of Quebec agreed to sell to the company one hundred thousand acres of crown lands in that province, including the lands now in dispute on certain terms and conditions. That order in council embodied the result of the negotiations previously had, and, as such, was on the following day communicated to the agent and manager of the company by the Commissioner of Crown lands, who gave him to understand that he might \"go ahead.\" He at the same time handed him a copy of the order in council and gave him to understand that all had been done that was necessary to authorize the company to take possession of the lands under the terms of the order in council, The company had previously paid the first instalment required by the order in council and the regulations of the department, and almost immediately afterwards, in April, 1881, the company entered into and took possession of the lands they had so purchased and commenced to work thereon, and, before the issuing of the injunction, had expended between forty and fifty thousand dollars in cutting down 627 acres on 86 of which the wood cut down had been piled, 475 acres cleared up, four houses built, and two saw mills erected, This is shown by unimpeachable and uncontradicted evidence to have been the position of matters in October 1881. It is also shown that the company, at that time, was in the actual possession and occupation of the land immediately in question herein, and cleared on it ten acres. Such being the case I am clearly of opinion, that they were so in possession under a good title; and could bring an action for any trespasses committed upon the lands so in their possession, against any one interfering with such possession, unless under a paramount title. The company had purchased from the government, and had, up to the time of the issuing of the injunction, fully kept the terms of the agreement they entered into. Apart from objections which I shall hereafter refer to the government would have been estopped from forcing the company to give up the passion of the lands sold and of which by the consent of the former, the company went into possession, and expended money so largely, notwithstanding the peculiar mode provided by the previous regulations for the sale had not been adopted. I consider that without any statutory provision, the government might, by its inherent power, have sold and conveyed crown lands in the province. Before however a commissioner or other subordinate officer of the government could do so, legislative authority would be necessary; and, in conferring that power the mode and manner, and the terms upon which, he should act, would also be necessary to be prescribed, or in some way provided for. They were so provided for by orders in council from time to time. The act made certain provisions in regard to the sale and transfer of crown lands, but much was left to be provided for by orders in council. Sec. 10, sub-sec. 2, provides that:\nThe Lieutenant Governor in Council may, also, from time to time, make such orders as are necessary to carry out the provisions of this act, according to their obvious intent, or to meet cases which may arise, and for which no provision is made by this act. * * * But no such order shall be inconsistent with this act, save, that the powers herein given to the commissioner may be exercised by the Lieutenant Governor in Council and shall be subject to any order in council regulating or affecting the same from time to time.\nSec. 15 provides that:\nThe Lieutenant Governor in Council may, from time to time fix the price per acre of the public lands and the terms and conditions of sale and of settlement and payment.\nSec. 16 provides that:\nThe Commissioner of Crown Lands may issue under his hand and seal to any person who has purchased, or may purchase or is permitted to occupy, or has been entrusted with the care or protection of any public land, or as a free grant, an instrument in the form of a license of occupation, &c.\nIt makes further provision that:\nThe licensee may maintain suits at law and equity against any wrong doer or trespasser, as effectually as he could do under a patent from the Crown. * * * But the same shall have no force against a license to cut timber existing at the time of the granting thereof.\nThere are certain limitations of the executive power in the statute, but none applicable to the circumstances of this case; but, on the contrary, notwithstanding the power given to the commissioner and other subordinate officers, the Lieutenant Governor in Council is, by subsection 2 of section 10, fully authorized from time to time to make such orders as are necessary to carry out the provisions of the act, \" or meet such cases which may arise, and for which no provision is made by this act,\" and by section 15 the Lieutenant Governor in Council is authorized \" from time to time\" to \" fix the price per acre of the public lands, and the terms and conditions of sale and of settlement and payment\" and by the concluding paragraph, it is provided \" that the powers herein given the commissioner may be exercised by the Lieutenant Governor and Council and shall be subject to any order in council regulating or affecting the same from time to time.\"\nThe order in council of the 7th of April, 1881, having closed the negotiations with the company for the sale of the lands agreed upon, and the company having, during that month, gone into the possession of them, and commenced working thereon, the Assistant Commissioner of Crown Lands addressed a letter to the local agent as follows:\nProvince of Quebec, Department of Crown Lands, Quebec, 5th May, 1881:\u2014Sir, your are hereby notified that all the lands enumerated in the accompanying list have been reserved in favor of the Dominion of Canada Land and Colonization Company by order in council of 7th ult. You will therefore be guided accordingly.\nWith regard to sales made by you of any of said lands since the date of the said order in council, including those entered in your April returns, they of course are disallowed.\nYou should inform the respective purchasers of such lots that they will now have to deal with the above company as regards the purchase thereof. The amount paid on those disallowed sales are placed in deposit, to be refunded on orders to that effect.\nI have the honor to be,\nSir,\nCharles Patton, Esq., Your obedient servant,\nCrown Lands Agent, (Signed) F. E. Tach\u00e9,\nRobinson. Assist. Com.\nIt will thus be seen that on the part of the Government it was fully considered that an absolute sale had been made to the company, and that those who had purchased from the agent after the Order in Council of the 7th April, 1881, should, in the language of the assistant commissioner, in his letter just recited. \"have to deal with the above company as regards the purchase thereof.\" Under the plenary powers given by the statute to the Lieutenant-Governor in Council the company was put into possession under the sale. The company had paid the first instalment as agreed upon, and, having gone into possession and conformed to all the conditions of the sale had such an equitable title and interest as would between individuals have entitled them to specific performance when all the conditions on their part were fulfilled. Up to the issuing of the injunction the company had performed all the prescribed conditions and the Government could not at that time, have legally dispossessed them. They were therefore in a position to prosecute any mere wrong doer, who would have had to respect their possessory rights. This position cannot, I think, be successfully combatted. How, then does the claim of the appellants stand? They claim, under a timber license dated the 3rd of May, 1881, signed by the agent of the Commissioner of Crown Lands at Robinson but not issued until the 10th of July 1881 a month or two after the company was in possession under their purchase. That license was subject amongst others to the following condition embodied in it:\nThat all lots sold or located by authority of the Commissioner of Crown Lands prior to the date hereof, are to be held as excepted from this license, and lots so sold or located subsequently shall cease to be subject to it after the April following. And whenever the sales of any such lots shall be cancelled the said lots shall be restored to this license.\nThe party then who obtained a timber license took it with the full understanding that all lands sold or located, though included in such license were excepted from it and that the license was as to such lands a nullity; and a licensee, by accepting the license in that form and substance, virtually and effectually agreed that, as to lands so sold he would consider the license as inapplicable. I have before shown that by the statute, the Lieutenant Governor in Council was authorized to perform all acts as fully as the Commissioner of Crown Lands; and therefore a sale by the Order in Council carries with it the same results and consequences, as if made by the Commissioner. The sale in this case is shown to have been made immediately upon his report and recommendation, and by his sanction and authority, as a member of the council. The subsequent document signed by the Commissioner on the 19th of July could not affect the rights or position of the company under the previous Order in Council of the 7th April The appellants took the license with the condition I have just stated; and is it for them to resist the rights of the company by questioning the propriety or regularity of the sale ? If the government had previously sold or located by the terms of the timber license the lands so sold were, at the time of its issue, excepted from those covered by the license and no right to Out timber thereon passed by it to the appellants, and they are estopped from questioning any such sale. I think they are entirely estopped from so questioning the sale. If A lets to B certain lands for a specified term and at a certain rent but it is agreed that if A should sell any part or parts of such lands during the currency of the lease such lands should thereupon cease to be included in such lease could B after a sale by \u00c2 question the propriety of the sale ? Could he be permitted to say to \u00c2 you have sold at too low a price, or you have given too long terms for payment, or you have sold on improper conditions or without sufficient authority? But the case before us is much stronger for the lands in question were sold and locates before the license claimed under was issued and were never included in the license. Such, however, is set up in this case as a defence by the appellants.\nIt has however been contended that under the \"regulations\" the appellants were entitled by law to a renewal of the license for one year, from the 80th April 1881. If such were the case, they had to some extent an equitable claim, as between them and the government, for the renewal, which the government under other circumstances might have recognized. On looking, however, at clause 5 of the regulations of 1881, it will at once be seen that no such position could be sustained in the total absence of proof of the performance of conditions precedent to their acquiring such equitable right. On the 80 of April, 1881, not only their license had expired but their right also to demand a renewal thereof for another year. We must therefore look at the license issued to them on the 10th July 1881 exactly as we would had it been issued to one who had held no previous license. Their right of possession of the lands covered by the previous license ended on the 80th April 1881 and unless a new license issued they would be trespassers, if going upon the lands and cutting timber thereon. From the 30th of April, 1881, to the 10th July following, they were strangers to the possession, and, as between them and the Government, only got the right of entry on any of the lands included in the license on the day last named Then come the questions: 1st, whether the government having sold and received an instalment of the payment as agreed upon for the lands in question, and put the company in possession under the terms of the sale, could give the appellants the right to cut the very timber which had been previously sold to the company, and included in their purchase ? If the government did not on the 10th July 1881 own the timber on the lands sold to the company, how could it legally give the right to another to cut it down and convert it ? The company had a legal right to all the timber growing and being on the lands they purchased, and, when subsequently complying with the prescribed conditions, would be entitled, not to bare stumps, but to growing and valuable timber. It would be inequitable in the highest degree for the government, after selling the lands, including the timber, which in many parts of them most likely constituted its principal value,. and securing full payment of the sum agreed upon, to resell the same timber and then get paid twice for it. This, however, is the position we are asked to sustain. If this contention had been raised by the Government the doctrine of estoppel would be available and courts of law and equity would so answer it. The doctrine Of estoppel applies equally to and affects the appellants as privies of the Government as fully as it does the latter If the Government had no ownership of the timber on the lands in question if it was transferred with the lands to the company\u2014it could give no title to another. But even if the Government really, under all the circumstances, did not wholly part with that ownership, but merely gave the company the right to the possession of the lands with a quasi right of property in the timber for certain prescribed purposes, another important difficulty to the appellants' contention arises and that is whether the licenses issued on the 10th of July, 1881, gave the appellants the right to intrude upon the possession of the company and cut and carry away timber in which the company had an interest, were excepted from those covered by the license before recited which provided that all lots sold or located, up to the date of the license should be held as excepted from its operation. In this case the lots were not only sold and partly paid for, as provided by the Order in Council of the 7th April 1881 but they were ascertained and located and set apart by metes and bounds, and the company put into possession. They had been sold, and if so, the right to cut timber on them was not included in the license.\nIt has been contended that the only evidence of a sale is a patent or grant; and that after a party has purchased from the government, and been put into possession of the land purchased, the government can go on issuing timber licenses over the same lands between the time of the purchase and the granting of a patent. It is, to my mind, a monstrous proposition that the Government could, under any circumstances, sell the same property twice and get doubly paid for it.\nI am of the opinion that the license of the 10th July 1881 did not include the lands in dispute; and that the acts complained of by the respondent company were illegal and without justification.\nThe lands in question were sold to the company at the rate of 60 cents per acre. One-fifth of the purchase money to be paid down (which was done even before the passing of the order in council in question) and the remainder in four equal annual instalments with interest from the date of sale The second instalment did not fall due until the 7th April after the issuing of the injunction. The company was to establish at least 40 families on the lands during the first year &c., and but half that time elapsed from the date of sale.\nThe sale was subject, with regard to each lot, or farm, settled upon to all the conditions and restrictions of an ordinary sale as set forth in the blank form of receipt for the first instalment attached to the report of the commissioner.\nBy the terms of that blank form of receipt the purchaser was: \u2014\nTo take possession of the land within six months from the date. hereof; and from that time continue to reside on and occupy the same, either by himself or through others, for at least two years: and within four years at furthest from this date clear and have under crop a quantity thereof in proportion of, at least, ten acres for every one hundred acres and erect thereon a habitable house of the dimensions of, at least, sixteen by twenty feet * * * In no case will the patent issue before the expiration of two years of occupation of the land or the fulfilment of the whole of the conditions, even though the land be paid for in full, subject also to current licenses to cut timber on the land, and the purchaser to pay for any real improvements now existing thereon, belonging to any other party.\nSuch then are the conditions referred to, as contained in the blank form of receipt; and the company, when the injunction was issued, was actively engaged in performing them all within the prescribed time. The patents were not to issue except as provided for; and it matters not in my opinion whether they were provided to be issued to the immediate purchasers or to their assignees or appointees. If the conditions were performed the patents were earned as provided for; and until the lands were sold by the company they had a good equitable title to them.\nThat equitable title was given by the Lieutenant Governor in Council duly authorized in that behalf and legally bound to complete the titles for the benefit of the company when the conditions of the sale were fully performed. I think it makes no difference, as to the interim interests of the company, it having been provided that the patents, as to the greater part of the lands were not to be issued to the company but to their assignees or appointees. The company was given the whole right of dominion over the lands to sell to whom for such prices and upon such terms as the company should decide upon. The government reserved nothing in the shape of interest, but merely annexed to the sale certain conditions upon the performance of which the patents should issue having sold and received the consideration therefor, the government parted with, its immediate interest in the lands as owners and if so to whom was the transfer made? It could be to none other than the company. The latter did not take it in trust for any other party, but as its own. It had to run the risk of re-selling either at a profit or a loss. It was not in the position of an agent or trustee of the government, having only a naked trust, which in many cases creates no interest. It was, on the contrary, a purchase for value, and for a good consideration, by the terms of the contract, of the purchased property. There is nothing in the statutes or regulations, or the law, against the company occupying the position it held when the injunction was issued; and the only other question open is whether that position entitled it to that remedy.\nTo entitle a party to a writ of injunction, the statute requires, that a petitioner for such a writ, must be a proprietor through a valid title of the lands in question, and be in lawful possession. I have already shown that, in my opinion, the respondent company had a valid title The statute does not require anything more than such a title as would enable a party to recover damages done to the possession, as he might do when in possession under any license of occupation or ticket of location issued by a commissioner of Crown lands, and I consider the order in council of the 7th of April, 1881, a copy of which was on the following day given by the commissioner of Crown lands to the agent of the company with instructions to act thereunder, as effectual for the purpose of giving the right of possession as a ticket of location, but independently of that proposition the company was in possession under a valid purchase and it matters not whether that sale was made by the government or by a private party. The law applies in the one case as effectually as in the other. The actual possession of the company was clearly proved, and the statute provides that the writ may issue against \"any person who has not acquired the possession one year, and who has no valid title to the property.\"\nI have already shown that the possession of the appellants\u2014which, at best, was only for the specific purpose of cutting and carrying away timber \u2014ended on the 30th April 1881, that the appellants were not therefore in possession for one year as the statute provides, and that the license to them subsequently did not cover the lands in question. The provisions of the statute are therefore fulfilled in all particulars as to the right of the respondent company to the injunction.\nThe statute limits the common law right as we find it in England,\u2019 as, in the latter, an injunction will be allowed to restrain even a \u00b0 party in long possession from cutting down timber or in any way doing a permanent injury to the estate.\nIn the case of Loundes v. Bittle ([1]), Vice-Chancellor Kindersley gave an exhaustive judgment on the subject of injunction; and after reviewing the leading cases up to that time, (1864), says '.\u2014\nI have gone into the cases on this subject at more length on account of the difficulty in finding the principle upon which to act. That principle, however, appears to me this: where a defendant is in possession and a plaintiff claiming possession seeks to restrain him from committing similar acts to these, the court will not interfere unless indeed (as in Neal v. IRIX's) the act is so flagrant an act of spoliation as to justify the court in departing from the general principle. But, where the plaintiff is in possession, and the person doing the acts complained of is an utter stranger, not claiming under the colour of right, then the tendency of the court is not to grant an injunction unless there are special circumstances, but to leave the plaintiff to his remedy at law, though where the acts tend to the destruction of the estate the court will grant it. But where the person in possession seeks to restrain one who claims by adverse title, then the tendency will be to grant the injunction, at least, where the acts done either did or might tend to the destruction of the estate. In that case a perpetual injunction was granted. It will he observed, that in the second case put by the learned Vice-Chancellor, he says:\u2014\nThat where the plaintiff is in possession, and the person doing the acts complained of is an utter stranger, not claiming under the color of right, then the tendency of the court is not to grant an in junction unless there are special circumstances. * * * Though where the acts tend to a destruction of the estate, the court will grant it.\nHere, then, the cutting down and the carrying away of the timber could be nothing? less than the destruction of the estate. In large districts of the country the land is worthless for cultivation, as is the case with a good deal of that in question, and becomes worthless as soon as the timber is removed from it. The principal utility of an injunction is to prevent such spoliation by irresponsible parties, but it will also be seen that, where the person in possession seeks to restrain one who claims by adverse title, the tendency is to grant an injunction at least where the acts done either did or might tend to the destruction of the estate\nI am of the opinion that both by provisions of the statute and common law as above referred to the respondent company was entitled to the injunction, and I agree with a majority of the court below, that the same should be made perpetual with costs in all the courts.\nTASCHEREAU, J:\nFor the reasons given by Mr. Justice Tessier in the Court of Queen's Bench, I think that the plaintiff had no right to this injunction, and that the judgment of the Superior Court which quashed it was right. I am of opinion, therefore, to allow this appeal. The contention, that without an injunction the plaintiff would have necessarily been exposed to suffer an irreparable injury, is not serious. It is only since four years that this writ has been introduced into Quebec and to maintain the plaintiff's contention on this point, would be to say, that it is only since four years that, in the province of Quebec, a plaintiff can stop a defendant, pendente lite, from destroying or damaging the property in contestation. I would call this a libel on our laws.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nI am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs and that the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench in Montreal in appeal should be affirmed. A contrary judgment would in effect place it in the power of a single officer of the Executive Government to defeat what must have been known to be the intent and object of the land company in paying their money and in entering into the contract, which with the sanction and upon the suggestion of such officer they had entered into with the Executive Government of the Province of Quebec and so, in fact, to deprive the land company of the benefit of that contract after the payment of that portion of the purchase money which was accepted as such by the government of the province when the contract was entered into and after the disbursement by the company of a large sum of money upon the faith of the contract, and after the fulfilment by the company of all the terms and conditions of the contract upon their part agreed to be performed.\nThe circumstances under which the contract with the land company was entered into will best appear by reference to the report of the Commissioner of Crown Lands to the Executive Government of the Province of Quebec, dated the 3rd March, 1881, which contains the terms of the contract and which is entituled: \"On the application of the Dominion of Canada Land and Colonization Company for the purchase of certain public lands in this province\" In that report the under- signed Commissioner of Crown Lands has the honor to set forth that on the 13th December, 1879, he received the following application from Francis W. Stockwell, Esq. dated the fifth of said month.\"\nOn behalf of several English capitalists I have the honor to apply for three hundred thousand acres of crown lands situated in the townships of Price, Whitton, Marston, Ditchfield, Spalding, Gayhurst, Risborough, Marlow, Jersey, Shanley and Metgermette, or elsewhere. provided that the whole quantity is not obtainable in those townships. The object of the purchasers is to settle the lands in different sized farms, or to dispose of them to farmers from the Old Country. who intend more especially to go into the breeding of cattle for exportation to foreign markets, the purchase money to be paid cash in exchange for deeds at the prices named in the Settlers' Guide of 1871.\n(Signed,) Francis W.

After due consideration of the facts above detailed the undersigned has the honor to recommend that he be now authorized to carry out the terms and intentions of his letter of the 30th December 1879 addressed to the aforesaid Frs. W Stockwell with the modifications allowed by subsequent letter of the 131h April, 1880, above embodied, and to sell to the said Dominion of Canada Land and Colonization Company the lands in question in accordance with the terms and conditions of the above mentioned letters\nThe whole respectfully submitted.\n(Signed,) E. J. Flynn,\nCom. of Crown Lands.\nQuebec 30th March, 1881.\nTo the above report was annexed the lot of lands\nselected and agreed upon between the company and the Commissioner of Crown Lands as the lands affected by the above report and for the first instalment of the purchase money for which the company had, as stated in the report deposited the sum of $12,000 to the credit of the Department of Crown Lands.\nNow, it will be observed, that as appears by the above document the whole of the negotiations for the purchase of the said lands by the company were carried on by the company with the Executive Council of the province through the instrumentality and intervention of the Commissioner of Crown Lands, of which Executive Council he was himself a member, and that the terms and conditions of the proposed purchase and sale were settled and agreed upon by and between the company and the said Executive Council, the Commissioner of Crown Lands being the medium adopted for communicating to the company the terms and conditions of the sale as agreed to and required by the Executive Council of the province and that all this had taken place before the whole, as a matter of form merely, was submitted to the Lieutenant Governor in Council for his approval, which was done by a report of a Committee of the -Executive Council as follows:\u2014\nTo the Honorable Theodore Robitaille, Lieutenant Governor of the G Province of Quebec, &C., &c.: Report of a Committee of the Executive Council on matters referred to their consideration.\nPRESENT:\nThe Honorable Mr. Chapeau, in the chair.\n\"Mr. Ross.\n\"Mr. Loranger.\n\"Mr.Lynch.\n\u201cMr. Flynn.\nIn Council on land matters.\nMay it please Your Honour: The Committee have had under consideration the annexed report of the Honorable the Commissioner of Crown Lands, dated the thirteenth of March last, 1881, concerning the application of the Dominion of Canada Land and Colonization Company for the purchase of certain lands in the Province of Quebec and submit the said report for the Lieutenant Governor's approval.\n(Signed,) J. A. Chapleau,\nChairman of Committee.\nUpon this report the Lieutenant Governor signed his approval upon the 7th April, 1881.\nUpon the follow wing day the recognised agent of the company having expressed to the Commissioner of Crown Lands his desire to give out a contract for the purpose of fulfilling the terms agreed upon by the company and to commence clearing, the Commissioner delivered to such agent a copy of the above document, (with the list of lands thereto attached,) so approved by the Lieutenant Governor, informing such agent at the same time that all was right and that he might go ahead as soon as he liked in consequence of which the company entered into contracts for the outlay of, and did expend, a large sum of money amounting to from $40,000 to $50,000 in fulfilment of the terms and conditions upon which the sale had been agreed to by the executive council as embodied in the above document or act of council.\nNow, upon the delivery by the Commissioner of Crown Lands to the company's agent of a copy of the document so prepared by him with the sanction and under the direction of the executive council \"which upon their report, was approved by the Lieutenant Governor if not eo instanli of the original having been signed by the Lieutenant Governor, I am of opinion that a complete contract of sale of the lands specified was entered into by the executive government of the Province with the company upon which the company had paid and the Government had received the sum of $12,000 as and for the first instalment of the purchase money agreed upon, and that the Commissioner of Crown Lands could not thereafter by any act of his impose any terms, conditions or obligations upon the company greater than those contained in the document so approved or detract from the rights intended to be conferred upon the company and contracted for by them as embodied in such document so prepared and approved, without, at least, the special consent of the company in that behalf obtained. I cannot doubt that the company became liable to pay interest upon the balance of the purchase money from the date of the order in council defining the terms and conditions of the sale one of which was that the interest should accrue from the date of sale That this order in council was regarded as the contract of sale is apparent not only, as it appears to me, from the terms and conditions agreed upon\u2014from the reception of the first instalment of the purchase money\u2014and from the delivery of a copy of the terms and conditions of sale as agreed to by the council and signed and approved by the Lieutenant Governor with directions to the agent of the company to enter into possession and to proceed with the fulfilment of the terms and conditions of the sale upon the part of the company to be fulfilled, but also from the acts of the department of Crown lands as appearing in the letter of the 5th May, 1881, from the department to the Crown land agent in whose district the lands selected by the company and for which they had paid the first instalment of purchase money were situate, informing him that all the lands enumerated in the list forwarded to him had been reserved in favor of the Dominion of Canada Land and Colonization Company by order in council of the 7th April, and that he should therefore be guided accordingly; and that with regard to any sales, if any were made by him since the date of the said order in council they are of course disallowed, and that he should inform the respective purchasers of such lots that they would now have to deal with the above company as regards the purchase thereof; and by the telegram of the 10th May from the Crown lands department to the same agent, directing him not to renew licenses for timber lands comprised in the townships of Wilton, Spaulding, Louise and Ditch field until advised to the contrary. So perfected was the contract of sale that, in my opinion, there can be no doubt that upon the 8th of April it was lawful for the company to enter upon the lands and to proceed as they did in the fulfilment of the terms and conditions embodied in the document approved and signed by the Lieut-Governor on the 7th April l and that upon the fulfilment of those conditions by themselves and their assigns and nominees to be performed they would be entitled to demand and have letters patent issued to themselves as to the five thousand acres and to their nominees or assignees as to the residue.\nIt might be quite competent for the commissioner of Crown lands in consequence of the contract for sale of the lands to the company having been so perfected, to issue to the company under his hand and seal under the provisions of 32 Vic. ch. 11, sec. 16 of the statutes of the Province of Quebec, a license of occupation or a certificate of sale under 39 Vic., ch. 10 but no such license or certificate was necessary in order to effect a completion of the contract between the executive Government of that Province and the company this had already been completed by the terms and conditions of sale having been concluded and agreed upon, and if any such license of occupation or certificate should be issued it could not operate in the slightest degree to make any variation by addition to or detraction from the terms of sale which had already been agreed upon with the company, upon the faith of which, the instalment of purchase money paid and accepted at the time of the contract of sale being entered into had been paid and accepted. The above statutes, while they authorize the Commissioner of Crown Lands and his deputies or agents to issue licenses of occupation and certificates of sale after contracts of purchase have been entered into under the powers conferred upon the commissioner by orders passed in council prescribing the terms and conditions upon which ordinary contracts may be entered into by the commissioner and his deputies upon behalf of the Government, never contemplated depriving and, in my opinion, do not deprive the executive Government of the power vested in it to enter into contracts of sale of a special character upon such special terms in each case as may be agreed upon between it and applicants for the purchase of Crown lands, and expressed in orders in council passed pro re nat\u00fb. The 32nd Vic. ch 11 the 16th sec of which enacts that \"The Lieutenant-Governor in Council may from time to time, fix the price per acre of the public lands and the terms and conditions of sale and of settlement and payment,\" is as potential to enable the Government to enter into a special contract, as it is to enable it to prescribe the terms upon which the Commissioner of Crown lands and his deputies may in the ordinary course of business of the Crown lands office, enter into contracts upon behalf of the Government with intending purchasers. The authority which the Commissioner of Crown Lands and his deputies have under orders in council to bind the Government by contracts entered into by them upon behalf of the Government, is given for the purpose of facilitating the business of the Government with applicants for land upon the ordinary terms sanctioned by the council, but the fact that a portion of the power of the executive council is for convenience and the better despatch of business, conferred upon the commissioner cannot deprive the council (which prescribes and sets in its discretion limits to the powers of the commissioner) of its own independent power, of itself entering into special contracts as the supreme executive department of the Government, with applicants for land upon terms not authorized by the order in council regulating ordinary sales. The power given to the Commissioner of Crown Lands to issue licenses of occupation by the 16th sec. of the Act is limited to granting them to any person who has purchased or who may purchase or who is permitted to occupy, or who has been entrusted with the care or protection of any public land, or as a free grant, and the object and effect of such license if and when issued is not to create a contract but to afford evidence of a contract of some character having been entered into and to enable the person to whom the license is given, although not in actual possession, upon the production of it in any court of law or equity, to assert title against any person in possession equally as he could under letters patent, subject to the sole qualification that the license of occupation should have no force against a license to cut timber existing at the time of the granting of the license of occupation; as to wrongs of the nature of trespass upon a person in actual possession, such possession alone without any license of occupation would enable the person in possession to maintain an action of trespass against the trespasser. Contracts of sale entered into by the government with a purchaser and a license of occupation, are two wholly distinct things; as appears not only from the 16th section of the Act above referred to but from the 20th also and the 21st. By the 20th provision is made enabling the Commissioner of Crown Lands in certain cases of fraud or imposition or in case of non-compliance with any of the conditions of a sale, grant, location, lease, or license of occupation t to cancel such sale, grant, location lease, or license of occupation,\" and the 21st section makes provision for the case of any person refusing to give up possession of any land \" after the revocation or cancellation of the sale, grant, location lease or license of occupation thereof as aforesaid \" shewing plainly that the legislature regarded a sale and a license of occupation as two distinct things. The office of the contract of sale is to define the rights of the purchaser to the thing contracted for, and to show what the thing contracted for is the office of the license of occupation is merely to afford evidence of the existence of a right to possession sufficient to enable the holder of the license upon its mere production to maintain actions without necessitating any enquiry into the nature or terms of the contract in pursuance of which the license was issued, namely, whether it was a contract of sale, or of lease, or for mere temporary occupation, or for the protection of the land by the holder as caretaker, or for a free grant. In the case of ordinary sales contracted for with the Commissioner of Crown Lands, it may be convenient that the license of occupation given to a purchaser should contain the terms of the sale but it is not necessary that it should, no form for such license is given by the statute and it would be just as effectual for the purpose for which it is intended, namely, to enable the holder to maintain actions at law or equity if it should not contain any of the terms of sale. But where the terms of sale are of a special character, and are embodied in a written document prepared for the purpose of showing the terms and conditions of the sale, or in several written documents, as in this case, in letters addressed by the applicants to the Government, and in documents showing the action of the council thereon communicated by the council through the commissioner to the applicants these written documents containing all the terms and conditions of the contract constitute the contract, and effectually raise the question in issue between the parties to this litigation which is what is the proper construction to be put upon this contract and what is its effect as against the appellants who are claiming under another species of contract with the Government, called a timber license, in virtue of which they assert a right to cut and carry away the timber growing upon the lands which are the subject of the contract of purchase and sale entered into by and between the land company and the Government ?\nThe contention of the appellants is that the land company's title dates only from the date of the certificate of the Commissioner of Crown Lands of the 19th July, 1881, endorsed upon the original order in council, prescribing the terms and conditions as approved by the Lieutenant-Governor after having been agreed upon by and between the company and the executive council of the Province, but no such certificate was necessary to perfect the contract, that had. already been perfected and concluded by the signature of the Lieutenant-Governor upon the 7th April 1881, to the document containing the terms and conditions of sale as agreed to by and between the company and the executive council and acknowledging the receipt by the Government of the first instalment of the purchase money, or, at least, upon the delivery to the agent of the company by the Commissioner of Crown Lands upon the 8th of April of a copy of the document so approved and signed; any certificate signed by the Commissioner of Crown Lands if any had been issued, should have been, as it appears to me, to the effect that the executive government had upon the 7th April concluded a contract for the sale of the lands in question to the company upon the terms and conditions embodied in a document signed and approved upon that day by the Lieutenant Governor in Council. Such a certificate is the only one which, in my opinion, would correctly state what had taken place. I can conceive no object to be served by, or any necessity whatever for, the issuing of any certificate signed by the Commissioner of Crown Lands after the terms and conditions of the sale had been conclusively agreed upon between the company and the executive and the receipt of the first instalment of purchase money, unless it be to serve as evidence of a contract of sale having been previously entered into, a fact which independently of any certificate abundantly appears by the evidence in this case, which sets out at large all the negotiations for the contract, which was so as aforesaid, consummated by the formal approval of the Lieutenant Governor in Council to the terms and conditions as agreed upon between the applicants and the Executive Council.\nThe rights of the company, therefore, must be ascertained by putting a construction upon the document so signed, containing, as it does, all the terms and conditions of the sale, wholly independently of, and without any reference to the certificate of the Commissioner of Crown Lands endorsed thereon, to which the company have no occasion to refer, upon which they do not rely, and by which they cannot be prejudiced in the enjoyment of any of the rights contracted for by them as embodied in the document containing all the terms and conditions of their purchase. In construing this document, it is, however, necessary to consider the title upon which the appellants rely as giving them the timber growing upon the lands purchased by the company.\nThe appellants appear to have had, for several years, licenses issued in each year to cut timber upon the lands in question those licenses terminated on the 30th of April in each year; it was a term and condition of these licenses and was so of that in existence on the '7th April 1881 when the terms and conditions of the sale to the land company were finally and formally concluded by the signature of the Lieutenant Governor in approval of the terms as previously agreed to by the members of his executive council the party constitutionally competent to prescribe the terms of the contract with the land company\u2014that all lots of land mentioned in the timber license which should be sold or located by authority of the Commissioner of Crown Lands subsequently to the date of such license, should cease to be subject to it after the following 30th day of April and that whenever the sales of any such lots should be cancelled the said lots should be restored to the license. Now it is apparent that the words \"sold\" or l located,\" as used here apply the former to \u201ccontracts\" of sale and the latter to locations under license of occupation, whether to lessees, caretakers, persons having free grants, or having possession otherwise than as purchasers. That the word \" sold \" refers to the contract of sale is apparent from the provision that \" whenever the sales of any such lots shall be cancelled \" (which could only be done while the contract is in fieri, \" the said lots shall be restored to the license \" The effect therefore of this provision in the timber licenses is that all lots contracted to be sold during the year while the license is in force shall cease to be subject to any renewal of such-license made after the 30th day of April next after the date of such contract of sale.\nIf then the contract between the Executive Government of the Province of Quebec and the land company was complete, as I am of opinion that it was upon the 7th, or, at least, upon the 8th of April, 1881, the lots so contracted to be sold became exempt from the operation of any renewal of the appellants timber licenses, and consequently the renewal of their license in the month of July, 1881, by the local agent of the Commissioner of Crown Lands was ineffectual to give to \"the appellants any right to any timber growing upon the lands so contracted to be sold to the company which timber constituted a very material part of the thing which they had contracted to purchase and for which they had paid, and the Government had received from them the first instalment of the purchase money agreed upon Clause 3 in the terms and conditions of the sale to the company, which was relied upon by the appellants as in support of their contention that the timber was not to be exempt from the appellants license until letters patent should issue proves to my mind, quite the contrary: The first condition of the sale is that one fifth of the purchase money was to be paid down immediately after the passing of the order in council, namely, the order in council which in the preceding sentence of the Commissioner of Crown Lands report it is stated that he was authorised by the Executive Council of the Province of Quebec to state to the agent of the applicants, that if the parties whom he represented would form themselves into a company for the purpose of the scheme of colonization which they proposed, and would furnish proof of the legal existence of such company and would state their readiness to pay the first instalment of purchase money and to conform to the other conditions hereinafter mentioned the government of the province would be prepared to pass an order in council for the sale to such company of 100,000 acres of land, to be designated by mutual agreement between the Government or the Commissioner of Crown Lands and the company in some of the following townships, & c., &c.\nThe sale to be upon the following conditions: Then the third condition provides that \" the sale shall be subject, \" &c. &c. What sale can this be other than the sale which the Executive Government thus became pledged to make to the Land Company, and in respect of which it was provided in the first clause that the first instalment of the purchase money should be paid immediately upon the passing of the order in council, and which in a subsequent part of the document signed by the Lieutenant Governor is acknowledged to be paid; but to remove all doubt, the third clause provides that the sale upon which the first instalment of purchase money is to be paid, and which, as matter of fact, was paid before the execution by the Lieutenant Governor of the document containing the terms and conditions of the sale, shall be subject with regard to each farm or lot settled upon to all the conditions and restrictions of an ordinary sale as set forth on the blank form of receipt for first instalment attached hereto and not content with such reference adds \" as follows \" \" This sale is, &c, &c., made subject to the following conditions.\u201d Now what is the effect of this, but plainly to import into this sale to the Land Company the conditions endorsed upon the blank form of receipt for first instalment of purchase money in the case of ordinary sales, in so far as consistently with other special terms .. and conditions of this sale to the Land Company they could apply the condition. That the purchaser shall take possession of each farm or lot settled upon within six months from the date hereof and from that time continue to reside on and occupy the same by himself or through others for at least two years and within four years at furthest from this date clear, and have under crop a quantity thereof in proportion of at least ten acres for every one hundred acres and erect thereon a habitable house of the dimensions of at least sixteen by twenty feet, could not apply, for special provision to the contrary is made by the 2nd clause of the conditions of the sale by which it is prescribed that the company shall establish at least forty families during the first year after the sale, at least sixty families during the second year and fifty each of the third and fourth years, in no case allotting more than five hundred acres to any one family or settler, but the other conditions of an ordinary sale can and do apply; that is to say: \" This sale to the land company is made subject to the condition that no timber is to be cut upon any of the lots or farms settled upon before the issuing of letters patent for such, except &c, &c, &c.; \" and that \" all timber cut contrary to this condition will be dealt with as timber cut without permission on public lands; s and that \" no transfer of the purchaser's (that is, the land company's) rights will be recognized in cases where there is default in complying with any of the conditions of sale; \" and that ' in no case will the patent issue for any farm or lot settled upon (such farm or lot not to exceed 500 acres) before the expiration of two years from the occupation of the farm or lot by a settler, or before the fulfilment of the whole of the conditions '' of this sale to the land company, even though the land be paid for in full and \" this sale is subject also to current licenses to cut timber on the land, and the purchaser (that is, the land company) to pay for any real improvements now existing thereon belonging to any other party.\"\nIt is, to my mind, plain that it is this sale to the land company, the terms of which were being arranged between the land company and the Government of the Province of Quebec, that was to be subject to all these conditions, including this last as to current licenses to cut timber on the land; the only current license to cut timber was that which expired upon the 30th April, 1881. It is, to my mind, therefore, clear that the contention of the appellants which would have the effect of depriving the land company of the chief value of the thing which they contracted to purchase from the Government and the Government contracted to sell to the company and for which the latter have paid and the former received, the purchase money agreed upon, cannot be allowed to prevail.\nThe only other point is as to the right of the plaintiffs in the court below to obtain a writ of injunction under 41 Vic. ch. 4.\nThat the land company as purchasers for value under a valid contract entered into with them directly by the executive Government of the Province are in lawful possession of the lands in question, through a valid title in virtue of their contact of purchase made with the executive Government, wholly independently of any certificate signed by the commissioner of Crown lands within the meaning of the above Act, and so as to entitle them to the benefit of its provisions does not appear to me to admit of a doubt, and as against the defendants asserting a title which, in my opinion, they fail to establish, to take the timber growing on the land purchased by the company, the latter are entitled to protection by injunction, as indeed the only effectual remedy to enable them to protect the property they have purchased from irreparable injury amounting to the absolute destruction of the chief part of th.6 estate purchased, and the existence of which, as constituting part of the thing purchased, we can well understand, as indeed is sworn to in the case formed the chief motive which induced the company to make the purchase. The appeal therefore should, in my opinion, be dismissed, and the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench in Montreal in appeal, granting the injunction, affirmed.\nAppeal allowed with cost.\nSolicitors for appellants: W. & A.

This by-law was read twice only, and, although in the by-law it was set out and declared that the ratepayers should vote on said proposed by-law on the 16th November, it was on the 23rd November that the ratepayers voted on a by-law to grant a bonus to the appellant company, construction of the road to be commenced before the 1st May, 1872.\nAt the time when the voting took place on the by-law, there was no power in the municipality to grant a bonus. On the 15th February, 1871, the Act 34 Vic., ch. 48 (O.) was passed, which declared the by law as valid as if it had been read a third time, and that it should be legal and binding on all persons, as if it had been passed after the act.\nOn the same day of the same year, ch. 30 was passed, giving power to municipalities to aid railways by granting bonuses. The 37 Vic., ch. 43 (O.) was passed, amending and consolidating the acts relating to the company.\nIn 1871 the company notified the council to send the debentures to the trustees who had been appointed under 34 Vic. ch. 48 (O.). In 1872 the council served formal notice on the company, repudiating all liability under the alleged by-law. Work had been commenced in 1872, and time for completion was extended by 39 Vic. ch. 71 (O). No sum for interest or sinking fund had been collected by the corporation of the county of Peterborough and no demand was made for the debentures until 1879, when the company applied for a mandamus to issue and deliver them to the trustees.\nHeld, affirming the decision of the court below, that the effect of the statute 34 Vic. ch. 48 (O.), apart from any effect it might have of recognizing the existence of the railway company, was not to legalize the by-law in favor of the company, but was merely to make the by-law as valid as if it had been read a third time, and as if the municipality had had power to give a bonus to the company, and, there being certain other defects in the said by-law not cured by the said statute, the appellants could not recover the bonus from the defendants.\nPer Gwynne, J., (Fournier and Taschereau JJ., concurring). As the undertaking entered into by the municipal corporation contained in by-law for granting bonuses to railway companies, is in the nature of a contract entered into with the company for the delivery to it of debentures upon conditions stated in the by-law, the only way in Ontario in which delivery to trustees on behalf of the company can be enforced, before the company shall have acquired a right to the actual receipt and benefit of them by fulfilment of the conditions prescribed in the by-law, is by an action under the provisions of the statutes in force then regulating the proceedings in actions, and not by summary process by motion for the old prerogative writ of mandamus, which the writ of mandamus obtainable on motion without action still is.\nPer Henry, J., that if appellants had made out a right to file a bill to enforce the performance of a contract ratified by the Legislature, they would not have the right to ask for the present writ of mandamus.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, reversing a rule of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, granting a writ of mandamus, commanding the corporation of the county of Peterborough to issue debentures for $75,000 and interest, in accordance with the terms of a certain by-law respecting the Grand Junction Railway Company and the Peterborough and Haliburton Railway Company, alleged to have been passed by the county council, and adopted by the rate-payers.\nThe facts of the case will be found stated in the judgments of Ritchie, C.J., and Gwynne, J.\nMr. Robinson, Q.C., for appellants:\nThe question which arises on this appeal is whether the appellants are entitled under the by\u2011law in question and the subsequent legislation to a mandamus commanding the respondents to issue debentures of the corporation of the county of Peterborough for the sum of $75,000, and to deliver the same to trustees. The Court of Appeal decided the case principally upon the ground that there was no company in existence entitled to receive the money.\nThe most important question in view of the judgment appealed from is as to the incorporation of the Grand Junction Railway Company.\n[The learned counsel then referred to the several statutes which relate to the incorporation of this company, and which are referred to in the judgment of Gwynne, J., and contended that they clearly recognize and declare the existence of the Grand Junction Railway Company, and make valid and binding the by-law granting a bonus to that company. Citing Field on Corporations[1]; McAuley et al. v. Columbus, Chicago & Indiana Central Ry. Co.[2]; Thomas v. Dakin[3]; Conservators River Tone v. Ash[4]; Stebbins v. Jennings[5]; The Orville and Virginia Railroad Co. v. The Supervisors of Plumas County[6]; Neil v. Board of Trustees[7]; Bow v. Allenstown[8]; Liverpool Ins. Co. v. Manchester[9]; Illinois G.T. Ry. Co. v. Cook[10].]\nThe by-law is not merely declared legal, valid and binding, as if it had received a third reading, but it is added: \u201cThe said by-laws are hereby declared legal, valid and binding upon the corporations respectively, and on all others whomsoever.\u201d This is a distinct, independent enactment, complete and effectual in itself, and not affected or qualified by the words preceding, which it is said only declare it legal as if it had received the third reading, or by those succeeding, which it is said only direct the corporation to act upon it as if it had been proposed after the passing of the Act.\nThe reference to the provisional directors of the Grand Junction Railway Company in section 11 of 34 Vic., c. 48, O. shews that the company named in the Dominion statute is referred to. It is plain, beyond doubt, from the language of this Act, that the Legislature intended to make the by-law completely, and not only to a limited extent, binding upon the county, and that they regarded and intended to treat and recognize the Grand Junction Railway Company as a corporation to which the bonus could legally be given. This they had full power to do. It is true that a mere erroneous assumption or recital of fact or law in a statute is not conclusive, but it is otherwise if it be clear that the Legislature intended that the law or fact should be as recited, or if to deny the law to be as assumed by the Legislature would, in effect, be to abrogate the statute; and this case is of that character. The statute and the by-law confirmed by it are made inoperative by holding that there was no corporation or association competent to receive the bonus; Norton v. Spooner[11]; Postmaster General v. Early[12]; Hardcastle on Statutes[13].\nThe 37 Vic. ch. 43, passed by the provincial Legislature, in effect grants all the rights intended to be vested in the Grand Junction Railway Company under the statutes of the Dominion or of the Province, to the company under the same corporate name. This includes the right to the bonus in question, which was intended to be granted to the company by the statutes already mentioned.\nThe 39 Vic., ch. 71, Ontario, contains a further recognition of the company as existing before the 39 Vic., and the by-law in question as valid and in force. See sections 1, 6; Toronto & Lake Huron R.W. Co. v. Crookshank[14]; Smith v. Spencer[15].\nThe construction placed upon these statutes, it is submitted, defeats the plain intention of the Legislature\u2014an intention which they have clearly expressed, and which it was within their jurisdiction to carry out.\nThen as to the question of the trustees, one of the learned judges, Mr. Justice Cameron, held that no trustees had been duly appointed to whom the debentures could be delivered. All the judges of the Court of Appeal were of a contrary opinion.\nTrustees have been appointed in sufficient compliance with the by-law. It was not necessary that such trustees should have been appointed by name by the Legislature. They were appointed under the provisions made for that purpose by the statute, and were entitled under the terms of the by-law (section 7) to receive the debentures. Mr. Hector Cameron, Q.C., followed on behalf of the appellants:\u2014\nThe Legislature of Ontario, before passing 34 Vic., ch. 48, which makes valid and binding upon the corporation of Peterborough the by-law in question, had all the facts before them, and their intention, as is apparent by the language used, was to make the by-law in question as valid and as binding as if it had been read a third time and all defects were cured.\nAs to the point taken by respondents, that it is impossible to levy a rate without contravening sec. 10 of the Ontario Act, 34 Vic., ch. 48, I submit the allegation is not proved, and that there is no proof that it would have required more than two cents in the dollar to be levied at the time the by-law was passed. It is no answer to say we cannot pay a debt of 1870 because we have incurred debts since, which prevent us from levying more than two cents in the dollar. On this point I refer to Mr. Justice Patterson\u2019s judgment in the court below.\nThen as to laches. The bonus could legally be claimed only when the road was built to Peterborough, and only since eighteen months the road has been running as far as Peterborough.\nThe omission to file the plan is not an answer to this application for a mandamus. Such filing is essential only to the legal exercise by the company of their compulsory power to take land; but the question here is, has there been an actual commencement of the work in due time? Such a commencement has been proved, and the corporation cannot set up the non\u2011compliance with the statute as regards the plan, as forming a sufficient ground for their refusal to deliver the debentures. Stratford and Great Western Co. v. County of Perth[16]. Per Burton and Moss, JJ. [The learned counsel then argued that the Dominion statute 33 Vic., ch. 53 was not ultra vires, and that all the legislation which had taken place on this subject was intra vires.]\nMr. Bethune, Q.C., and Mr. Edwards, for respondent:\nThe learned counsel after referring to the different statutes relating to the incorporation of the respondents and arguing that the Dominion Statute 33 Vic. ch. 58, was ultra vires, and that the legislation of Ontario, in so far as it attempted to interfere with the Dominion legislation was and is void, and upon which points the court expressed no opinion, proceeded as follows:\nBut assuming the validity of these statutes, the appellants are not entitled to have the mandamus for which they ask for the delivery of the said debentures.\nThe legislation hereinbefore referred to has not had the effect of making valid the by-law.\nOn the 23rd of November, 1870, the by-law was submitted to the electors of the then county of Peterborough, and was carried by a small majority of the electors who voted upon it.\nAt the time of the submission of the said by-law, the said county of Peterborough had no power to pass any by-law for granting any bonus to any railway company.\nAt that time, the county of Peterborough consisted of the municipalities which at present compose it, and also of the municipalities which now compose the District of Haliburton, which has since been set apart without any provision whatever having been made for any portion of the debt proposed to be created by this by-law being borne by the district of Haliburton.\nSo far as the vote in that part of the former county of Peterborough, which now constitutes the county of Peterborough, was concerned, the majority of the rate- payers voted against the granting of the said bonus. The whole vote polled was less than the majority of the entire votes of the ratepayers of the then county of Peterborough.\nNo notice whatever was given of any intention to apply to the legislature to confirm the by-law of the county of Peterborough, nor, as the bill was originally introduced, was that object contemplated, so far as appeared on the face of the bill, and the respondents had no notice at all, until after the statute 34 Vic., ch. 48, was passed, that it was intended to affect the by-law which is in question here.\nThe first section of the statute confirms the by-law of Belleville; the first part of the second section confirms the by-law of Seymour, but in the second section there is also introduced a provision respecting the by-law in question.\nIt will be observed that the number of the by-law in question is not given in the said Act, and it is submitted that the description which is given in the act is not one which is apt to describe the by-law in question. It is not stated to be the by-law of the corporation of the county of Peterborough in express words, and the by-law which is thereon assumed to be made valid by the legislature is a by-law which was approved of by a majority of the duly appointed qualified voters in the county of Peterborough; the by-law in question was not approved of by a majority of the duly qualified voters in the county of Peterborough on the day named, but was only approved of by the majority of the voters who voted on the by-law. This section of the statute should not be construed so as to make valid the said by-law.\nSection 10 of the Act last mentioned provides that nothing contained in that Act should authorize any increased rate to be assessed for the purposes thereof beyond the rate limited in the Municipal Act of 1866.\nIt is clear that if this by-law be enforced, that provision of the statute will have to be violated.\n37 Vic. ch. 43, entitled, \u201cAn Act respecting the Grand Junction Railway Company,\u201d recited that the appellants had by their petition prayed that all Acts relating to the company should be consolidated, amended and reduced into one Act, and by the first section enacted that all the rights, powers and privileges intended to be vested in the Grand Junction Railway Company under the several statutes passed by the Parliament of the late Province of Canada, by the Parliament of the Dominion of Canada, and by the Legislature of the Province of Ontario, relating to the said company, were thereby declared to be vested in the shareholders of the company under the name of the Grand Junction Railway Company. Section 2 of that statute purported to repeal amongst other Acts the Act 16 Vic. ch. 43, already referred to, and the Act of the Parliament of Canada, 38 Vic. ch. 53. None of the other provisions contained in that statute are ex post facto in their operation, or in any wise affect the by-law which is here in question.\n39 Vic, ch. 71 (O.), sec. 6, assumed to confer upon the railway company power to consent to changing the line or route of their railway if requested by the county of Peterborough.\nThis was passed also without notice to the county of Peterborough, and has never been acted upon in any manner by the said county.\n42 Vic. ch. 57, by the 2nd section thereof, extended the time for the completion of the railway to the town of Peterborough to the year 1880, so far as a by-law of the town of Peterborough, which was provided for in the first section, was concerned; but this statute contains no reference whatever to and does not affect the county of Peterborough or the by-law in question here.\nNo rate has ever been struck for the levying of any of the sums of money necessary to provide for the payment of debentures referred to in the by-law.\nThe construction of the railway was not begun within the time limited in the Act of 1870 as the respondents contend, although the appellants allege that some work was done within the period of two years from the passing of the Dominion Act, yet the respondents submit that there could be no commencement of the work because the plan and book of reference containing the location of the railway was not then filed in the office of the clerk of the peace as required by the statute in that behalf.\nThe railway was certainly not completed to the town of Peterborough within six years from the passing of the Act.\nOn the 27th of June, 1872, the respondents served a notice upon the appellants repudiating the delivery of the debentures.\nNo demand was made for the said debentures until 29th of October, 1879.\nThe respondents also rely upon the reasons contained in the judgment of the judges in appeal, and upon the following authorities:\u2014Stratford & Lake Huron Railway v. Corp. of the County of Perth[17]; Brooks v. County of Haldimand[18]; Fry on Specific Performance[19]; The People v. Seneca, C.P.[20]; High on Extraordinary Remedies[21]; Luther v. Wood[22]; re Goodhue. per Strong, J.[23]; Hardcastle on Statutory Law[24].\nMr. Robinson, Q.C., in reply. RITCHIE, C.J.:\u2014\nUpon application of the Grand Junction Railway the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench of Ontario made the following order:\nUpon reading the rule nisi granted herein, before the Honorable Mr. Justice Osler, on Friday the twenty-first day of November, A.D. 1879, and the affidavit of service thereof, and upon hearing counsel for all parties, it is ordered that a writ of mandamus do issue out of this honorable court, commanding the said the corporation of the county of Peterborough, and John Burnham the warden, and Edgecombe Pearse the treasurer, and the said corporation and the said treasurer thereof for the time being, forthwith to issue debentures of the said corporation, to be sealed with the corporate seal of the said municipality, and signed by the said warden and treasurer thereof, or the warden and treasurer for the time being, for the sum of seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000) and interest thereon, in accordance with the terms of a certain by-law, entitled:\u2014\u201cA by-law to provide for the aiding and assisting in the construction of the Grand Junction Railway and the Peterborough and Haliburton Railway, and for the issuing of debentures therefor to the amount of one hundred thousand dollars, to be given by way of bonus to the said Grand Junction Railway, and the said Peterborough and Haliburton Railway Company, in the manner and proportion following; that is to say: Seventy-five thousand dollars to the Grand Junction Railway Company, and twenty-five thousand dollars to the Peterborough and Haliburton Railway Company,\u201d and to deliver the said debentures to the trustees respectively appointed for receiving and holding of moneys, or securities for moneys, awarded by way of bonus towards the construction of the Grand Junction Railway. And it is further ordered that the said corporation, and the said John Burnham and Edgecombe Pearse, or the warden and treasurer thereof for the time being, do pay the costs of and incidental to this application and the said writ of mandamus forthwith after taxation thereof.\nFrom this order the respondents appealed to the Court of Appeal of Ontario, which court reversed the judgment of the Queen\u2019s Bench and discharged the rule with costs. The present appeal is from this judgment, and, among the grounds of appeal, it is alleged that at the time of the passing of the said by-law there was no power on the part of the said municipality to grant the aid in question, and that the statute of Ontario, 34 Vict., ch. 48, sec. 1, had not the effect of making valid the said bonus; the respondents in their reasons against the appeal contending that: The Grand Junction Railway Company were and are entitled to the bonus referred to in the by-law in question, and that the municipality had the power to grant the bonus in question, and the Legislature of the Province of Ontario have expressly authorized, sanctioned and legalized the said by-law granting the said bonus.\nA number of points were raised, but as these are at the very foundation of the relators\u2019 right to ask for a mandamus, and as I think they must be decided unfavorable to them, and as this disposes of the matter, it seems to me quite unnecessary and useless to discuss the other questions.\nAs to the right of the municipality to grant a bonus in 1870, it seems clear that the special act of the Grand Junction Railway Company had not provided for giving assistance in that shape, and the general power to do so did not find its way into the municipal law until the passing of the act of 34 Vict., ch. 30 on 15th February, 1871.\nAnd as to the by-law, there is no pretence for saying that it has any effect, unless such as it has received from subsequent legislation, and the only legislation with respect to the by-law is the 34 Vict. ch. 48, and therefore any efficacy or vitality the by-law has or ever had, must be derived from this act, the 2nd section of which is as follows:\nSection 2. That the by-law numbered two hundred and forty-five, passed by the corporation of the township of Seymour, and intituled \u201cA by-law to provide for the aiding and assisting in the construction of the Grand Junction Railway, and for the issuing of debentures therefor to the amount of thirty-five thousand dollars, to be given by way of bonus to the said Grand Junction Railway Company by the municipality of the township of Seymour;\u201d also a certain by-law intituled, \u201cA by-law to provide for the aiding and assisting in the construction of the Grand Junction Railway and the Peterborough and Haliburton Railway, and for the issuing of debentures therefor to the amount of one hundred thousand dollars, to be given by way of bonus to the said Grand Junction Railway Company and the said the Peterborough and Haliburton Railway Company, in the manner and proportion following; that is to say: Seventy-five thousand dollars to the Grand Junction Railway and twenty-five thousand dollars to the Peterborough and Haliburton Railway Company,\u201d and which was approved of by a majority of the duly qualified voters in the county of Peterborough, on the twenty-third day of November, in the year of Our Lord, one thousand eight hundred and seventy, be, and the same is hereby declared legal, valid and binding, as if the same had received the third reading of the county council of the said county of Peterborough; the said by-laws are hereby declared legal, valid and binding upon the corporations respectively, and on all others whomsoever; and the said several corporations above-mentioned shall respectively proceed to issue debentures and act upon such by-laws in all respects in the same manner as if the said by-laws respectively had been proposed after the passing of this act.\nSection 11. A majority of the provisional directors of the Grand Junction Railway Company may at any time, at any meeting of which all the provisional directors shall have had notice by resolution, add to the numbers of said provisional directors such persons as they may think proper, and such persons so added shall have all the rights and powers they would have had, had they been named provisional directors in the act incorporating the said company.\nFrom the language of this statute, I am of opinion that it was passed on the assumption that the by-law intended to be validated had been regularly before the county council, had had two readings, in fact had gone regularly through all its stages before the council, had by them been duly submitted to the qualified voters of the county in the manner and at the time provided for by the by-law, had been voted on at the time and in the manner fixed by the council, and required no further action than to be read a third time and duly sealed, and the Legislature never intended arbitrarily to impose this bonus on the county of Peterborough apart from and independent of the county council and the ratepayers; had such been their intention, a simple enactment to that effect, without reference to any by-law or vote, would have accomplished that object; but, in my opinion, the Legislature intended merely to confirm and complete what they supposed had been acted on by the council, and regularly voted on and assented to by the ratepayers, by supplying the omission to read it a third time by practically dispensing with such reading.\nHad, then, this so-called by-law been before the council, read twice, and by them referred to the ratepayers? The evidence on this point is, to my mind, conclusive to the contrary.\nFirst we have the affidavit of Edgecombe Pearse:\nI Edgecombe Pearse, of the town of Peterborough in the county of Peterborough, clerk and treasurer of the said county, make oath and say:\n1. I am and have been ever since the early part of the year one thousand eight hundred and seventy clerk and treasurer of the said county of Peterborough.\n2. No by-law such as that mentioned and referred to in the rule nisi herein was ever passed by the council of the said county, nor any by-law granting aid to the said railway company, and there is no such by-law among the records of my office.\n3. In the month of October, one thousand eight hundred and seventy, a by-law was introduced in the said council, and read first and second time, proposing to aid the said Grand Junction Railway and the Peterborough and Haliburton Railway Company. The said proposed by-law was not drawn up in regular form, but consisted of a skeleton of a by-law and a number of resolutions and fragmentary parts, and was, according to the best of my recollection and belief, delivered to James Stratton in that form for publication in the \u201cExaminer\u201d newspaper, and the same was not returned to my office, to my knowledge, and the same is not now in my office, and is not now in existence to my knowledge.\n4. In the by-law as published in the said \u201cExaminer\u201d newspaper, on the twentieth day of October, A.D., 1870, and in the notice thereof, the day fixed for taking the votes of the ratepayers thereon, was the 16th day of November, A.D. 1870, such day being, according to the best of my recollection and belief, the day fixed by the council upon the second reading, and in the said newspaper of the twenty-seventh of October and following issues the same was changed to the twenty-third day of November.\n5. Such second reading took place on the fifteenth day of October, A.D. 1870, and on said day the council adjourned, and no meeting of the council was held between the said fifteenth day of October and the fourteenth day of December following, and there was no resolution or motion of the council passed, or any other authority given, to my knowledge, in any way by said council, to enable any person to make any alterations in such proposed by-law.\n6. No alterations were made in such proposed by-law by me, nor was I a party in any way to any such alterations, to the best of my recollection and belief.\n7. In the month of December, A.D. 1870, and also in January, A.D. 1871, respectively, there were unsuccessful motions in said council for a third reading of what purported to be the by-law in question, but the by-law which had passed the first and second readings was not then before the council, the proposed by-law, the third reading of which was moved, being that published, as I understood, in the \u201cExaminer\u201d newspaper of the twenty-seventh of October and following issues, and which contained, as I verily believe, some material changes from the by-law which passed such second reading.\nThen we have the affidavit of James Stratton:\nI, James Stratton, of the town of Peterborough, in the county of Peterborough, Collector of Customs, make oath and say:\n1. I was in the year one thousand eight hundred and seventy, publisher of the Peterborough \u201cExaminer\u201d newspaper, in which newspaper the alleged by-law in question herein to provide for the aiding in the construction of the Grand Junction Railway and the Peterborough and Haliburton Railway, was published in the month of October in that year.\n2. The then warden of the county, S.S. Peck, Esquire, the reeve of the township of Minden, and who, as a resident of that part of the county through which the Peterborough and Haliburton Railway was to pass, was interested in and strongly in favor of the proposed by-law, attended at the office of the said newspaper at the time of the first publication thereof, the same having been printed off from what was given to me as the original of such proposed by-law, as the same had passed the second reading before the council of said county.\n3. The said S.S. Peck, then in my presence made several material alterations in the by-law, and the same was printed with such alterations without being again submitted to or approved by the council of said county, and the by-law as published was in several material points different from that which had been furnished to me by the clerk of the council as having passed the second reading.\n4. I say that material alterations were made by the said S.S. Peck in the seventh, eighth, eleventh and sixteenth paragraphs of such by-law, although I cannot now particularly recall the matter of all of such changes.\n5. The proposed by-law was first published in the issue of the same newspapers of the twentieth day of October, the meeting or session of the council at which the by\u2011law had been proposed and passed through its second reading having been closed on the fifteenth day of October, and between the said publication on the twentieth, and the next on the twenty-seventh day of October, the said by-law was further altered in the eleventh and sixteenth paragraphs, and during such interval there was no session of the council to approve of or consent to such alterations.\n6. In the issue of said newspaper of the twentieth day of October, in the eleventh paragraph, the last two payments were to be made as follows: \u201cTo the further amount of five thousand dollars when a branch of the said road to the village of Minden shall have been completely graded; and for the further amount of five thousand dollars whenever such branch of the said road to the said village of Minden should have been completed,\u201d and in the issue of the said newspaper of the twenty-seventh day of October and following issues, the words \u201ca branch of\u201d and \u201csuch branch of\u201d were omitted.\n7. In the sixteenth paragraph of such by-law, and in the notice thereof, published with such by-law as first published on the twentieth day of October, it was set out and declared that the votes of the ratepayers of the municipality of the county of Peterborough should be taken on the said proposed by-law on Wednesday the sixteenth day of November, and in the issue of said newspaper of the twenty\u2011seventh day of October and following issues, that such votes should be taken on the twenty-third day of November, and in such notice the statement of the date of the first publication was changed from the twentieth to the twenty-seventh day of October, as set out in such notice.\n8. According to the best of my recollection and belief, the said changes in the last two paragraphs referred to, were also made by the said S.S. Peck. 9. I believe that such paper constituting the alleged by-law as delivered to me, was destroyed in my office as being no longer of any use.\nThen we have the affidavit of R.D. Rodgers:\nI, Robert David. Rodgers, of the village of Ashburnham, in the county of Peterborough, Esquire, make oath and say:\n1. I was, in the years one thousand eight hundred and seventy and seventy-one, a member of the council of said county, and in the latter year was warden of said county.\n2. The alleged by-law in question herein, was never properly before the council of said county, but on its first and second readings consisted merely of fragmentary and imperfect clauses and resolutions, and owing to the fact that material alterations were made therein after such second readings, and without the knowledge or consent of the council, the said alleged by-law as voted on by the ratepayers was never looked upon or regarded by the council as legal or valid.\n3. The council had not, nor had I, as such warden, any notice of the intention of the company to obtain the passing by the legislature of that part of the act thirty-four Victoria, chapter forty-eight, declaring such alleged by-law valid and binding, as if the same had received the third reading of the council, and such council were not in any way parties to or petitioners for such legislation.\nTwo efforts were made to induce the council to read this alleged by-law a third time. 1st on the 14th of December, 1870, when the council resolved that \u201cthe by-law having been found to be illegal, &c., be resolved that it be not read but be laid over till the next meeting of the council,\u201d at which meeting, on motion that it be now read a third time, passed and numbered, on a vote the motion was declared lost. No more appears to have been heard of this by-law by the council, or of any application to the legislature in reference thereto, till after the passing of the 34 Vict., ch. 48, and no application appears to have been made for the issue of any debentures from 1870 until 1879.\nIt is true that in answer to Stratton\u2019s affidavit, S.S. Peck states:\nThe said by-law was drawn by Mr. W.H. Scott, the county solicitor, to the best of my recollection and belief, and after being read a first time was referred to a committee of the whole council and considered in detail, and certain alterations were then made in it, and after being read a second time as amended, and its publication ordered, it was sent to Mr. Stratton, the publisher of the \u201cExaminer,\u201d for that purpose; but on seeing it in print, I discovered that it was incorrectly printed in some passages where alterations had been made in the committee of the whole, and I then caused Mr. Stratton to correct it so as to make it correspond with the by-law as read a second time by the council, and as there was not then sufficient time for the four weekly publications of the by-law as corrected before the day originally named in the by-law of the council for the voting upon it, after consulting such members of the council as I could communicate with, and with their approval, I altered the date for the taking the votes upon it, postponing it for a week so as to allow the requisite number of publications of the correct by-law to take place before the voting, and after being so published it was voted on and carried by a majority of the ratepayers who voted on it.\n4. It is not the fact that I made any material alteration in the said by-law (save that of the date for voting on it) to make it different from the by-law as it passed the second reading by the council, but on the contrary the alterations I made in it as first published were only made to correspond with the by-law as read a second time.\n5. When the by-law was brought up for a third reading, I voted against it, though in favor of granting the bonuses, because I preferred to have a new by-law passed rather than have one about which a question could be raised, or which would require an act to legalize it.\nI think this unsatisfactory affidavit, which does not show in what particulars the by-law first published was erroneous, nor what alterations he made, nor from what data he made the alterations, and, as he cannot deny having altered the by-law in a most material particular, viz.: the day on which the voting by the taxpayers was to be held, and which the by-law originally before the council named, and which could only be fixed by the council, and as he had no authority whatever to interfere with the by-law, and there is no record of any by-law in the archives of the municipality, I think it is entirely insufficient to negative the affidavit of the clerk and treasurer, whose duty it was to trans- mit the documents as they were before the council to the printer (and who says he did so), confirmed as it is by the evidence of Mr. Rodgers, a member of the council, who swears that, owing to the fact that material alterations were made therein after such second reading, and without the knowledge and consent of the council, the said alleged by-law, as voted on by the ratepayers, was never looked upon or regarded by the council as legal and valid: and this statement again confirmed by the minutes of the council, which show that the council had voted that the by-law had been found to be illegal; and no attempt being made to contradict in any way these statements, I can come to no other conclusion than that this alleged by-law was never read twice by the council, and was never submitted by them to the ratepayers, and was, in fact, never before the council, nor in any way acted on till it was attempted to have it read a third time as the by-law which had been twice read and submitted to the taxpayers, that the by-law read twice was never submitted to the taxpayers, and neither such by-law nor the altered document was voted on at the time fixed by the council for taking a vote. Can it then be said that under the terms of this section of the 34 Vict. ch. 48, the Legislature intended to validate as a by-law of this municipality a document never read before the council and never in any way dealt with or acted on by them? As to this statement Mr. Justice Burton says:\nWe find that, on a petition of the railway company setting forth that Belleville and Seymour had each passed by-laws granting a bonus to the company, and that the validity of such by-laws had been questioned for want of power in the municipality to grant it, and praying that those particular by-laws should be ratified, in the enacting part of the bill, founded on such petition, a few words are inserted referring to a by-law of Peterborough nowhere before refer red to either in the petition, the preamble, or in the published notices required by the standing orders of the House, and which it is stated was approved of by a majority of the duly qualified voters, and declaring that such by-law shall be legal, valid and binding as if the same had received the third reading of the county council of the said county of Peterborough.\nI think this is peculiarly an act as to which, if there is any doubt, a construction most favorable to the public should be adopted. Before going to the Legislature to obtain this substantially private act, and to create this heavy burden on the taxpayers, the promoters should have been careful to see that the information before the Legislature, on which they were asked to legislate, was full and accurate, and should have been cautious to ascertain that all the proceedings before the council and voters had been strictly regular and according to law, or, if there had been irregularities a curing of the irregularities should have been obtained from the legislature in express terms. The legislature having expressly named the omissions they intended to cure, courts cannot, in my opinion, be asked to extend this curative process by implication to irregularities and matters and things to which, so far as anything appears in this statute, their attention does not appear to have been called.\nI think on a fair construction of this act, no intention can be discovered to validate what, under the circumstances detailed in the affidavits, was no by-law at all; but, assuming a by-law to have been before the council, read twice and submitted regularly to the taxpayers, and, having received their assent, the Legislature intended to validate such a by-law by simply dispensing with a third reading and thereby supply that deficiency. But, there being in existence no such by-law, the act could not operate, by reason of the Legislature having acted on a misapprehension of fact. I think, therefore, the ratepayers, through the council, have a right now to raise this question in answer to this application for a mandamus, on the ground that it is not such a by-law as the Legislature contemplated making valid, and therefore the act is not applicable to it. It may be all true, if the third reading had taken place and the seal duly attached, that though the irregularities in the proceedings on the by-law might afford ground for a motion to quash, they could not as Mr. Justice Patterson suggests, be successfully urged as reasons for holding the by-law void in any proceedings upon it; but, in my opinion, this is by no means the question before us. This is not a question of quashing an existing by\u2011law, it is a question of the construction of a statute, and dependent thereon the question of the existence of a by-law. The contention is that by virtue of the statute a by-law exists. We are then to construe the statute and to discover what the intention of the Legislature was, and in my opinion that intention was to cure no irregularities, but merely to supply an omission, viz.: assuming everything to have been regular and legal, then and then only to treat it as if it had been read a third time, the very dealing with the third reading involving the absolute necessity of there having been two previous readings, showing clearly that the intention to make the passing of the act equivalent to a third reading was necessarily based on the by-law having had two previous readings.\nAgain we see in the statute another important and most material fact which no doubt operated largely on the mind of the Legislature. The statute says:\nAnd which was approved of by a majority of the duly qualified voters of the county of Peterborough on the 23rd November, 1870.\nDoes not the insertion of this most important statement show that the legislation was likewise based on this, viz.: That as the majority of all the ratepayers were willing that this burthen should be imposed on the county, it was reasonable that the minority should submit to the will of the majority? While this would be reasonable enough, it would be equally unreasonable that the burthen should be placed on the majority by the vote of a small minority, as was truly the case in this instance. We can only know the intention of the Legislature from the words in which it is expressed, and it would be, to my mind, a most violent construction to say that the Legislature intended to validate a by-law approved of by a small minority of the duly qualified voters, while, on the face of the Act, the Legislature has said the by-law to be validated was a by-law approved of by the majority of the duly qualified voters. Now, what is the true state of the case on this point?\nThe affidavits show, and it is not disputed, that the number of voters for the year 1870 were at least 3,000, exclusive of the village of Ashburnham and township of Stanhope.\nTotal votes polled for by-law...........................................................................\n556\nAgainst by-law...................................................................................................\n467\nMajority........................................................................................................\n89\nThat is 1,023 votes out of 3,000, leaving 1,911, so that in fact but a third voted, and of that third there was a bare majority of 89. Can we say in the face of such a statement in the law that it was the intention of the Legislature to validate a by-law not approved of by a majority of the duly qualified voters, but by so slim a majority of so small a minority of the voters?\nIn view of the uniform legislation of Ontario would it not have been most unjust to this municipality to impose on it this burthen without any action on the part of the municipal council, or any assent of the ratepayers? and, unless we are obliged to do so, we must not suppose the legislature intended to do so palpable an injustice[25]. This act was obtained at the instance of the relators, and must be construed strictly against them. If they have misled the Legislature by a misrepresentation of facts either intentionally or unintentionally, they cannot complain if such misrepresentation frustrates the object they have sought to obtain. It is clear that a statement of fact or law in a statute is not conclusive, but courts are at liberty to consider the fact, or the law to be different And then again in construing this act we are to remember that when an intention to impose a charge is doubtful, that meaning must be adopted which is most beneficial to the public[26].\nUnder all these considerations I cannot bring my mind to the conclusion that there was any by-law of the county of Peterborough made valid by the statute 34 Vict., ch. 48; at any rate this is made sufficiently apparent for the purposes of the application for a mandamus, and therefore I agree with the Court of Appeal in their conclusion, though not for the same reasons, and think this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThinking then as I do, there was no valid by-law I feel bound so to decide. To decide the case on such grounds as that the remedy is by suit, and not by mandamus, which can only arise in the event of there being a valid by-law, would be to my mind misleading, and induce further litigation, which, if I have arrived at a correct conclusion, I think should end here.\nFOURNIER, J., concurred.\nHENRY, J.:\nIt is unnecessary for me to go into all the particulars connected with the case after the exhaustive judgment delivered by the learned Chief Justice. I must say that I had from the beginning a good deal of difficulty in sustaining the by-law that is in question here. In fact, it would be rather against my own inclination that I have arrived at that conclusion, because I think the equities are really with the company. The company did all that the municipal body had any reason to expect, and, although it was not done exactly within the time, still the municipality derived all the contemplated benefit from the opening of the railway; and it would have given me satisfaction if I had been enabled to arrive at the conclusion that the procedure adopted by the company could be sustained. However, I have been reluctantly obliged to come to a different conclusion. Particular reference is made to the fact that the by\u2011law has been sustained and validated by the legislative action as to the third reading Now, it is in evidence that the by-law never was read, never was passed the first or second reading, and it appears to me that the statute only validated the want of the third reading. It does not undertake to validate anything further, and, if the by-law is in other respects irregular, it appears to me the statute does not cover such irregularity. There is no question as to the facts in connection with this matter. They are all pretty much agreed upon. The question arises whether, there being no law at the time to authorize the first submission of this rate to the voters, the statute should not have gone further and have validated that submission, but it is silent on that.\nI need not give a very positive opinion in reference to another point which was argued here, and that is as to the power, under our present constitution of the Local Legislature to alter a contract made or in existence between private parties. That the municipality here intended to enter into a contract, but did not, is patent on the face of the cir- cumstances which have been produced in evidence. Then the Legislature steps in and completes that contract. It appears to me that, if the Legislature has the power, under our present constitution, which is prescribed by the Imperial act, to complete or affect by legislation any contract entered into between a municipality and a railway company, there is nothing to restrain them from altering and interfering by legislation with a private contract between two individuals. I express no opinion as to the power of the Legislature of Ontario as to the act it has passed, but I would require some argument to convince me that the Local Legislatures, or even the Dominion Legislature, has the right to interfere so as to affect contracts entered into, or quasi-contracts entered into, between parties. It is a matter of great importance, and, of course, I give no opinion upon it here, but I may suggest it for the consideration of those who may be affected by legislation of that kind.\nI think the equities, as I have said before, are strongly with the company. I regret that, under the circumstances, I am not able to give effect to the legislation that has been passed to carry out the views which the company entertain, but I think I am bound to coincide with the judgment which has been delivered by the learned Chief Justice, and to say that the party is not entitled to the remedy which he claims in this suit\u2014that is, a mandamus. Another difficulty that suggests itself to my mind has not been removed. If the matter became by legislation a subject of contract between the parties, it appears to me that the parties had a legal remedy independent of that afforded by the writ of mandamus, and it is clearly laid down that a writ of mandamus should not lie where the parties had a legal remedy. I am in doubt whether the parties have made out a right to file a bill to enforce the per- formance of the contract ratified by the Legislature. If he had that right, he had not the right to ask for a mandamus. With the statement of these views, I concur in the judgment of the learned Chief Justice.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\u2014\nI concur in the judgment of the court, and am of opinion, for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Gwynne, whose notes I had communication of, that this appeal should be dismissed.\nI desire, however, to make an exception to what the learned judge says on the right of the Provincial Legislature to pass the act in question. So far I cannot say that I have any doubt on their right to do so, without, of course, thinking it necessary to decide the point at all in this case.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nThis was a motion made in the month of Nov., 1879, founded on affidavits, for a prerogative writ of mandamus to issue out of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench for the Province of Ontario, commanding the corporation of the County of Peterborough and the warden and treasurer thereof, for the time being, forthwith to issue debentures of the said corporation to be sealed with the corporate seal of the said municipality, and signed by the said warden and treasurer, or by the warden and treasurer for the time being, for the sum of $75,000 and interest thereon, in accordance with the terms of a certain by-law entitled, \u201cA by-law to provide for the aiding and assisting in the construction of the Grand Junction Railway and the Peterborough and Haliburton Railway, and for the issuing of debentures therefor to the amount of $100,000 to be given by way of bonus to the said Grand Junction Railway Company in the manner and proportion following, that is to say, $75,000 to the Grand Junction Railway Company and $25,000 to the Peterborough and Haliburton Railway Company,\u201d and to deliver the said debentures to the trustees respectively appointed for receiving and holding of moneys or securities for money awarded by way of bonus towards the construction of the Grand Junction Railway. The motion was made under the following circumstances:\nThe Grand Junction Railroad Company was originally incorporated by an Act of the Legislature of the Province of Old Canada, 16 Vic., ch. 43, with power to construct a railway over any part of the country between Belleville and Peterborough, and from the town of Peterborough to the city of Toronto to intersect the main trunk line of railway proposed to be constructed, and also from Peterborough aforesaid to some point west thereof on Lake Huron, as should be decided upon by the company. By a clause of the Railway Consolidation Act, which was incorporated with the special act, it was enacted that if the construction of the railway should not be commenced, and ten per cent. of the capital stock should not be expended thereon within three years after the passing of the special act, or if the railway should not be finished and put in operation in ten years from the passing of the special act, the corporate existence and powers of the company should cease. The same legislature by 16 Vic. ch. 37 incorporated the Grand Trunk Railway Company.\nBy 18 Vic. ch. 33, the Grand Junction Railway Company, together with certain other railway companies, were united with the Grand Trunk Railway Company, and by this act it was provided that the Governor in Council might, upon such terms and conditions as he should think fit, by Order in Council extend the period allowed by the several special acts therein recited for the completion of the railways and works thereby respectively authorized.\nNothing appears to have been done towards the construction of the Grand Junction Railway or towards the creation of the capital stock of the company prior to the passing of the Dominion statute 33 Vic. ch. 53. By that act, after reciting the incorporation of the Grand Junction Railroad Company by 16 Vic. ch. 43, and the amalgamation of that company with the Grand Trunk Railway Company, with the view of securing the construction of the Grand Junction Railroad under the auspices of the Grand Trunk Railway Company, but that the latter company had declined the construction of the Grand Junction Railroad, but were willing that the charter of the Grand Junction Railroad should be re-invested in and restored to those persons and corporations now interested in the construction thereof, and that divers persons named had petitioned Parliament representing the above facts, and had prayed that an act might be passed to revive the charter of the Grand Junction Railroad Company, and to place the said company in the same position as it held before its amalgamation with the Grand Trunk Railway Company, with power to make arrangements with the said Grand Trunk Railway Company for the use of part of their line, and for station and other accommodation at Belleville, and for other purposes, and that it was expedient to grant the prayer of such petition, it was enacted that all the powers, rights and privileges, vested in the Grand Junction Railroad Company by the act 16 Vic. ch. 43 should be and were thereby restored to and vested in certain persons therein named, and such other persons as should become shareholders in the said company after the passing of the said act, and that the said corporation in the act named should in all respects have, hold and exercise the said power as fully as the parties originally named in the said act 16 Vic. could and did hold and exercise the same, and all powers in respect of subscribing for and holding stock in the said company, and all other powers whatsoever by the said act granted to municipal corporations and others should be continued by this act, and might be exercised as fully and effectually as they might have been under the said act 16 Vic., and that the name of the said company should he the Grand Junction Railway Company. By the 6th sec. it was enacted that, as soon as one-tenth part of the authorized capital should be subscribed, the directors should have all the powers mentioned in the 10th sec. of the act of 16 Vic. By the 7th sec.\u2014that it should be lawful for the company and the Grand Trunk Railway Company to make arrangements for the use of a part of the line of the Grand Trunk Railway Company at or near Belleville, and for station accommodation, and for such other purposes connected with the working of the traffic from one line to the other as the said two companies might think for their mutual interest and the public convenience, and for payment of compensation for said accommodation as they might agree upon; and by the 8th sec.\u2014that the company should have power to construct their railway over any part of the country lying between Belleville and Peterborough, and thence to such point on the Georgian Bay as might be decided on, but not to the city of Toronto, and that the railway authorized should be commenced within two years and completed to Peterborough within six years from the passing of the act which received the royal assent on the 12th May, 1870. In the month of October, 1870, the municipal council of the corporation of Peterborough, not having any power to grant aid by way of bonus to this proposed railway, although the act of incorporation of the Peterborough and Haliburton Railway Company purported to confer upon them such a power as regards the railway of that company, caused to be prepared an instrument which received two readings in the council, and which professed to be a by-law to provide for aiding and assisting in the construction of the Grand Junction Railway and the Peterborough and Haliburton Railway, and for the issuing of debentures therefor to the amount of $100,000, viz., $75,000 to the former, and $25,000 to the latter.\nThis instrument, after reciting that the municipal council of the county of Peterborough had determined to give as a bonus the sum of $75,000 to the Grand Junction Railway Company, and the sum of $25,000 to the Peterborough and Haliburton Railway Company, subject to the provisions thereinafter contained, proceeded to enact, as follows:\n1. That a bonus of the sum of $75,000 be granted to the Grand Junction Railway Company, and a bonus of the sum of $25,000 be granted to the Peterborough and Haliburton, subject to the conditions hereinafter specified.\n2. That in order to procure the said sum of $100,000 the municipal council of the said county of Peterborough shall issue debentures of the said corporation to the amount of the said sum of $100,000 to be sealed with the corporation seal of the said municipality, and signed by the warden and treasurer thereof, and no one of the said debentures shall be for a less sum than $100.\n3. That the said debentures shall be made payable in 20 years from the day hereinafter appointed for the by-laws to take effect at the office of the treasurer, &c.\n4. That they should bear interest at 6 per cent.\n5. That for the payments of the said debentures a rate of 4 38\/100 mills in addition to all other rates should be levied annually.\n6. That the said respective sums should be paid to said respective companies in such debentures, so to be issued and taken and received by the said respective companies, in payment of such bonus at par value.\n7. That the warden of the said county of Peterborough shall pay and deliver such debentures to the amount of $75,000 to the said The Grand Junction Railway Co., or to whomsoever may be appointed by them to receive the same, at the time and in the manner following, that is to say, to the amount of $25,000 whenever and so soon as the said Grand Junction Railway shall have been completely graded from the eastern limit of the county of Peterborough to the town of Peterborough, and to the remaining amount of $50,000 whenever and, so soon as the iron of the said railway shall have been completely laid from the said eastern limit of the county of Peterborough to the said town of Peterborough, and then only upon the certificate of the Chief Engineer of the said railway of the performance of the said conditions, and upon the conditions hereinafter next mentioned, that is to say, that such proposed railway shall cross the river Trent at or near the village of Hastings, and shall thence proceed between the villages of Allandale and Keeve to the town of Peterborough, that the gauge of such railway shall not be less than 4 feet 8\u00bd inches.\n8. That in the event of any trustee or trustees being hereafter appointed by the Legislature for the receiving and holding of moneys or securities for moneys awarded by way of bonus towards the construction of the said Grand Junction Railway, the said warden shall within six weeks after the final passage of this by-law or within six weeks after the passage of such legislative enactment, which ever shall last occur, hand over and deliver such debentures to the said amount of $75,000 to such trustee or trustees, to be by them held and paid over and delivered to the said company in accordance with and subject to the provisions and conditions of this by-law, and not otherwise.\n9. That the warden of the said county should be a director of the said Grand Junction Railway Co.\n10. That unless the construction of the Grand Junction Railway as to that portion thereof within the county of Peterborough shall have been commenced on or before the first day of May, 1872, this by-law in so far as the same provides for the issue of the said debentures to the said amount of $75,000 shall become and be null and void and of no effect, and such of the said debentures thereupon issued, if any, cancelled.\n[The 11th and 12th clauses related exclusively to the Peterborough and Haliburton Railway.]\n13. That the rolling stock of both railways should have sliding axles, so as to permit to the rolling stock of each to be used upon the other and upon the Grand Trunk Railway.\n14. That in the event of any one portion and not the whole of this by-law becoming effete and of none effect under the provisions of the 10th and 12th sections thereof, by reason of one of such proposed railways not having been commenced within the time hereby limited for the purpose, the said rate to be levied as aforesaid shall be sufficient only to cover the interest and sinking fund for the redemption of the debentures remaining valid under that portion of this by-law remaining in force and eftect.\n15. That this by-law shall take effect and come into force on the 16th day of December, 1870.\nThe 16th section provided for taking the votes of the ratepayers upon the by-law and appointed the time and places for taking the poll of such votes.\nThis proposed by-law having received two readings the poll of the votes of the ratepayers thereon was taken upon the 23rd November, 1870, at which poll out of a number of freeholders in the county qualified to vote exceeding 3,000 in number, only 1,023 votes in all were cast, of which 656 were for approving of the by-laws and 467 against it.\nIt will be observed here that the time of this poll of votes being taken, assuming it to have been taken at the time authorized by the proposed by-law as voted on in council, a point about which there was a dispute, all that was necessary to perfect the by-law, in so far as it related to the grant of $25,000 to the Peterborough and Haliburton Railway, was that the by\u2011law should receive its third reading in the council of the municipality. At a meeting of the council held on the 14th December, 1870, for the special purpose of deciding whether the proposed by-law should be confirmed and passed or not, it was moved and seconded that the by-law granting $75,000 to the Grand Junction Railway and $25,000 to the Peterborough and Haliburton Railway be now read a third time, passed, signed, and the corporate seal of the county attached, and by way of amendment to that motion it was moved, seconded and resolved, that \u201cthe by-law granting a bonus to the Peterborough and Haliburton Railway Co. and the Grand Junction Railway Co having been found to be illegal, and very grave doubts exist as to whether an act can be obtained to legalize the same, owing to a majority of the municipalities having given an adverse vote thereon, and as the municipality of South Monaghan is not represented here, owing to the death of its late reeve, the by-law be not read a third time, but be laid over until the next meeting of council.\u201d At the next meeting of the council held upon the 27th day of January, 1871, it was moved and seconded: \u201cThat whereas at the last session of the municipal corporation of the council of Peterborough, the third reading of the by-law granting a bonus of $75,000 in aid of the Grand Junction Railway was, by resolution passed by said corporation in session assembled, postponed until the present session, and whereas the said by-law was submitted to the ratepayers of the said County of Peterborough in accordance with the provisions of the Municipal Act, and a majority of the votes cast having been in favor of the said by-law, be it therefore resolved that the said by-law be now read a third time, passed and numbered, and the corporation seal attached thereto.\u201d Upon this motion being made, it was found it was not in order, and upon a motion being thereupon made and seconded to the effect that the decision of the warden in ruling the third reading of the by-law to be out of order be not sustained, being submitted to the council, the council resolved that it should not be sustained, and thereupon the motion for the third reading of the by-law was submitted to the council, and there having been a tie of votes thereon, the warden gave his casting vote against the motion, which was thereby lost, and so the council refused to pass the said proposed by-law, and the same never did become a by-law passed and approved according to law by the council. Prior to the proposed by-law having ever been introduced in the council or read a first time, in the month of September, 1870, the Grand Junction Railway Company caused to be published in accordance with the provisions of the standing orders of the Legislature of Ontario, the following notice of an application to be made to the Legislature at its next sitting, namely:\n\u201cApplication will be made to the Legislature of the Province of Ontario at its next sittings for an Act to legalize and confirm any and all by-laws passed by any of the municipalities through which the line of the Grand Junction Railway passes, granting bonuses to the said company to assist in the construction of their railway. Also, for power to the corporations of the townships of Sidney, Thurlow, Rawdon, and the village of Sterling, and the corporation of the town of Belleville in the county of Hastings; also, the corporations of the townships of Seymour and Percy in the county of Northumberland, and the corporations of the townships of Asphodel and Otonabee in the county of Peterborough; also the corporations of the county of Hastings and county of Peterborough respectively, and any other municipal corporation whatsoever through which or near to which the said line of railway will pass, to grant bonuses to said company to assist in the construction of the said railway, with power to charge the same on all or part of the municipality so granting such bonuses, and for power to part of any of said corporations to grant such bonus, and to charge the part \u2018of such corporations so granting the same with the payment thereof,\u2019 and generally for all the powers in the premises necessary to make the said efficient and effectual and for other purposes.\u201d\nUpon this notice having been given and upon the petition of the Grand Junction Railway Co. the Act, 34 Vic. ch. 48 was passed. This act recited that:\nWhereas the corporation of the town of Belleville had passed a by-law granting aid by way of bonus to the Grand Junction Railway Co. to the extent of $100,000, and whereas the corporation of the town- ship of Seymour had also passed a by-law granting aid by way of bonus to the said railway company to the extent of $35,000, and whereas the validity of the said by-laws is questioned for want of power in said municipalities to grant such aid, and the said railway company have by their petition prayed * * * * for an act authorizing the several municipal corporations along, or contiguous to the line of their railway to grant aid by way of bonus to assist in the construction of the said railway, and it is expedient to grant the prayer of the said petitioners.\nTherefore it was enacted:\nThat the by-law numbered 233 passed by the corporation of the town of Belleville, granting $100,000 to the Grand Junction Railway Co., should be and the same was thereby declared legal and binding on the said corporation. And although this by-law, and a by-law of the township of Seymour, were the only by-laws particularly mentioned in the petition for the act which the petitioner desired to have made valid, it was, nevertheless, enacted by the 2nd section:\nThat the by-law numbered 245 passed by the corporation of the township of Seymour, and intituled, \u201ca by-law to provide for the aiding and assisting in the construction of the Grand Junction Railway, and for the issuing of debentures therefor to the amount of $35,000, to be given by way of bonus to the said Grand Junction Railway Co., by the municipality of the township of Seymour; also a certain by-law, intituled, a by-law to provide for the aiding and assisting in the construction of the Grand Junction Railway and the Peterborough and Haliburton Railway, and for the issuing of debentures therefor to the amount of $100,000, to be given by way of bonus to the said Grand Junction Railway Co., and the said the Peterborough and Haliburton Railway Co., in the manner and proportion following; that is to say, $75,000 to the Grand Junction Railway Co., and $25,000 to the Peterborough and Haliburton Railway Co.\u201d, and which was approved of by a majority of the duly qualified voters in the county of Peterborough, on the 23rd day of November, in the year of Our Lord 1870, be, and the same is hereby declared legal, valid, and binding, as if the same had received the third reading of the county council of the said county of Peterborough; the said by-laws are hereby declared legal, valid, and binding upon the corporations respectively, and on all others whomsoever, and the said several corporations above-mentioned shall respectively proceed to issue debentures and act upon said by-laws in all respects in the same manner as if the said by-laws respectively had been proposed after the passing of this Act.\nBy the 43rd section, it was enacted:\nThat any by-laws passed after the 19th day of December, 1870, and before the passing of this Act by any municipal corporation, along or near the line of the said the Grand Junction Railway Co.\u2019s proposed railway, and which have been voted upon by the people and sanctioned in the manner provided for in the municipal acts in force in this province, granting aid by way of bonus to the said railway company, shall be valid and binding upon the said corporations so passing the same as fully as if the said by-laws had been passed after the passing of this act.\nBy the 4th sec., power was given to all municipalities along the line of, or near to, the said proposed railway, to grant aid by way of bonuses to the company.\nBy sec. 5, like power was given as regards portions of municipalities desirous of aiding the company.\nBy sec. 6 it was enacted that:\nWhenever any municipality or portion of a municipality shall grant a bonus to aid the said company in the making, equipping, and completion of the said railway, the debentures therefor may, at the option of the said municipality, within six months after passing of the by-law authorizing the same, be delivered to three trustees, to be named, one by the Lieut. Governor iu Council, one by the said company, and one by the heads of the municipalities granting such bonuses, or the majority of them, who shall attend a meeting for that purpose, to be held at such time and place as the said company may appoint for that purpose, notice of which shall be sent to each reeve, mayor or warden by mail, at least fourteen days before the day appointed; all the trustees to be residents of the Province of Ontario: Provided that if the said reeves, mayor or warden shall refuse or neglect to name such trustee, or if the Lieutenant Governor in Council shall neglect or refuse to name such trustee within one month after notice in writing to him of the appointment of the other trustees, the company shall be at liberty to name such other trustee or trustees.\nBy the 7th sec., provision was made for the appointment of new trustees in the case of removal, death, or resignation of a trustee. By the 8th sec., it was enacted that:\nThe said trustees should receive the said debentures in trust; firstly, to convert the same into money; secondly, to deposit the amount realised from the sale of such debentures in some one or more of the chartered banks having an office in the town of Belleville, in the name of the Grand Junction Railway Municipal Trust Account. and to pay the sum out to said company, from time to time, on the certificate of the Chief Engineer of the said railway, in the form set out in Schedule A. hereto, or to the like effect, setting out the portion of the railway to which the money to be paid out is applied, and the total amount expended on such portion to the date of the certificate, and such certificate to be attached to the cheque to be drawn by the said trustees.\nBy the 11th sec., it was enacted that:\nA majority of the provisional directors of the Grand Junction Railway Co. may at any time, at any meeting of which all the provisional directors shall have had notice, by resolution, add to the number of said provisional directors such persons as they may think proper, and such persons so added shall have all the rights and powers they would have had had they been named provisional directors in the Act incorporating the said company.\nOn the 9th November, 1871, the Secretary of the Grand Junction Railway Co. mailed to the address of the then warden of the county of Peterborough, a letter in the following terms:\nDEAR SIR,\nThe Board of Trustees appointed under and in accordance with the provisions of Ch. 48, 34 Vic., of Ontario, to wit: John H. Allen, Esq., of Picton, trustee appointed by the Government, E.W. Holten, Esq., trustee appointed by this company, and Robert Cockhurn, Esq., of Campbellford, trustee appointed by the heads of municipalities granting bonuses to this company, having met and organized their Board by appointing E.W. Holten, Esq, of Belleville, chairman thereof, I do hereby, on behalf of the Grand Junction Railway Co., request that you will, with as little delay as possible, forward to the said E.W. Holten, Esq., Chairman of said Board, of Belleville, the debentures of the county of Peterborough, for the sum of $75,000, in pursuance of by-law No. of your municipality, granting aid to this company, intituled a by-law to provide for the aiding and assisting in the construction of the Grand Junction Railway and the Peter- borough and Hailburton Railway, and for issuing debentures therefor to the amount of $100,000.\n* * *\nNo notice appears to have been taken of this letter, if it was received. On the 27th day of June, 1872, the secretary of the Grand Junction Railway Co. was served with a notice, signed by the warden and county Clerk of the county of Peterborough, with the seal of the corporation attached, to the effect following:\nTo the Grand Junction Railway Company:\u2014\nThis railway company having failed to comply with the conditions contained and set out in a by-law of the County Council of Peterborough, entitled a by-law to provide for the aiding and assisting in the construction of the Grand Junction Railway and the Peterborough and Haliburton Railway, and for the issuing of debentures therefor to the amount of $100,000, to be given by way of bonus to the said Grand Junction Railway Co. and the Peterborough and Haliburton Railway in the manner and proportions following, that is to say, $75,000 to the Grand Junction Railway Co. and $25,000 to the Peterborough and Haliburton Railway Co., and for various other reasons, the Municipal Council of the Corporation of the County of Peterborough (without admitting that the said by-law ever was binding upon them) hereby gives notice to the said Grand Junction Railway Co. that the said corporation of the county of Peterborough claims and holds that the said by-law or so much thereof as relates to the said Grand Junction Railway Co. is effete and no longer binding or obligatory upon this corporation, and upon this and other distinct grounds the municipal corporation of the county of Peterborough will resist any action or proceeding on the part or behalf of the said Grand Junction Railway Co. to compel the issue of the debentures mentioned in the said by-law or any of them.\n[L.S.]\nDated this 25th day of June, 1872.\n(Signed,) JOHN WALTON,\nEDG. PEARSE, Warden.\nCounty Clerk.\nBy an act passed by the Legislature of the Province of Ontario on the 24th March, 1874, 37 Vic. ch. 43, after reciting that the Grand Junction Railway Co. have by their petition prayed that all the Acts relating to the said company should be consolidated and amended and reduced into one act, and that it was expedient to grant the prayer of such petition, it was enacted among other things that:\n1. All the rights, powers and privileges intended to be vested in the Grand Junction Railway Co. under the several Statutes passed by the Parliament of the late Province of Canada, by the Parliament of the Dominion of Canada, and by the Legislature of the Province of Ontario relating to the said company, are hereby declared to be vested in the shareholders of the said company under the name of the Grand Junction Railway Co.\n2. The acts passed in the sixteenth year of the reign of Her Majesty Queen Victoria and chaptered 43, and the Act passed in the 33rd year of the said reign and chaptered 53, be and the same are hereby repealed, but any act or proceeding taken, done, or had under any of the said Statutes shall remain valid and binding as if said Acts had not been repealed.\n3. All the provisions of the Railway Act, being ch. 66 of the Consolidated Statutes of the Province of Canada and amendments thereto, shall apply to the said company.\n4. All contracts made heretofore, by or with the said company, and which are now legal and subsisting, and all the rights and liabilities of and against the said company, shall continue in all respects binding upon and in favour of the said company, and shall not be altered or affected by any provision of this Act.\n5. All purchases made, deeds taken, proceedings had, and acts done in the location and construction of said railway by the said company, shall be held and taken to have been had and done under this act.\nBy the 7th sec. certain persons therein named as the then directors were declared to be directors until the next annual election to be holden under this act.\nBy the 19th sec. municipal corporations along the line of, or near to, the railway, were authorized to grant aid by way of bonus to the railway.\nSec. 21 and subsequent sections presented the manner in which the by-laws granting such aid in order to be valid, should be passed.\nSec. 34 provided for the delivery of the debentures to be issued in pursuance of such by-laws to trustees. By an act of the Legislature of Ontario, passed on the 10th February, 1876, 39 Vic. ch. 71, it was enacted that the time for the completion of the Grand Junction Railway Co. should be extended to the 1st day of May, 1881, and that the several by-laws passed by the several municipalities on the line of the said proposed railway, granting aid by way of bonus to the said company, and which have not now lapsed, shall stand and have the same effect as if the time in this act fixed for the completion of said railway had been in the acts now in force respecting the said company named and fixed as the time for completion of the said company\u2019s railway, and that none of said by-laws shall lapse by reason of the said extension of time, or the said railway not being completed within the time heretofore fixed for the completion of the same.\nOn the 4th March, 1879, the secretary of the Grand Junction Railway Co. addressed a letter to John Burnham, Esq., warden of the county of Peterborough, in the following terms:\nDEAR SIR,\nl have been instructed to inform you that E.W. Holten, Esq., Belleville, Ont., as Chairman of the Board of Trustees, appointed some years ago by the Government, the municipalities and the company, in pursuance of the statute to receive the debentures of the various municipalities granting aid to the Grand Junction Railway, and to pay them out in accordance with the conditions of the various bonus by-laws, some of the municipalities have handed in their debentures to the trustees, and it is very desirable that all should do so at once, so that our new contractors may thus have completed their monetary arrangements for the active prosecution of the work this year. I would therefore ask you, on behalf of your municipality, to have the necessary debentures prepared and forwarded to Mr. Holten without delay. If refusal is made to this request or unnecessary delay occurs in complying with it, I am instructed to say that steps will be taken to compel the issue and delivery of such debentures, and this letter will be used on such application. I may add that the other members of the Board of Trustees are, J.H. Allen, mayor of Picton, and Robert Cockburn, Esq., of Campbellford, so that the municipalities can have every confidence that the various conditions and stipulations of the respective by-laws will have to be fully performed ere a single debenture is handed over.\nThis letter having been laid before the council was submitted by them to their solicitor for his advice, who, being of opinion that the debentures could not be legally called for, the county clerk informed by letter the secretary of the railway company that no action would be taken towards issuing debentures until the right of the company to the same should be established. Accordingly in November, 1879, the motion for this mandamus was made.\nAmong the points raised upon the argument of the rule nisi, which was issued calling upon the corporation of the county of Peterborough to shew cause why the mandamus should not issue was one that the Dominion Act 88 Vic. ch. 53 was void; and that the Local Legislature of the province of Ontario could alone give to the railway company its corporate existence and powers; another, that the Ontario Statute 84 Vic. ch. 48 had not the effect of validating the bonus; another, that assuming the bonus by-law to have been made binding, the company had forfeited all claim to the bonus by non-compliance with the terms and conditions upon which the bonus viras granted; that there was no legal commencement of the road within the time specified in the by-law; that there could be no legal commencement of the road until the filing of the map and plan required by the Railway Act, which was not done, and, in fact, no right of way upon which to commence had been acquired within the county of Peterborough within the time limited by the terms of the by-law, namely, the 1st May, 1872, and that none of the Ontario acts had the effect of validating the by-law, and that the Legislature had not, within the provision and terms of the by-law in that behalf, appointed any trustees, and that therefore the company could not call for the debentures unless nor until they should become entitled to payment within the terms of the 7th sec. of the by-law.\nA majority of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench made the rule absolute for the writ to issue, being of opinion that it was not necessary to decide whether the Dominion Act, 33 Vic. ch. 53, was intra or ultra vires, and that the acts of the Ontario Legislature referred to, had the effect of recognizing the existence of the railway company as a corporation, and that the trustees named under the provisions of the Ontario statute, 34 Vic. ch. 48, were trustees within the contemplation and provision of the 8th sec. of the by-law. Mr. Justice Cameron, dissenting upon this latter ground, was of opinion that the rule nisi for the mandamus should be discharged. The case having been appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, that court was unanimously of opinion that the rule nisi for the mandamus should be discharged upon the point upon which the judgment of Mr. Justice Cameron was rested in the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, namely, that trustees appointed under Ontario statute 34 Vict. ch. 48 were not trustees within the terms of section 8 of the by-law. A majority of the court, however, also held, Mr. Justice Proudfoot not assenting, that the Dominion Statute 33 Vict. ch. 53 was ultra vires, and that consequently at the time of the passing of the by-law there was no Grand Junction Railway Co. in existence to whom the proposed bonus could be given, and that the Ontario statute 34 Vict. ch. 48 only had the effect of making the by-law as valid as if it had been read a third time, and as if there had been power to give a bonus, and did not cure the defect arising from there being no such company then in existence.\nI agree with the opinion of Mr. Justice Cameron expressed in his judgment in the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench for Ontario, and which has been concurred in by the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal in that province, to the effect that the trustees appointed under the provisions of the Ontario statute, 34 Vict. ch. 48, do not come within the scope of, or supply the place of, trustees referred to in the 8th section of the by-law in question; no enactment such as that referred to in that section, within six weeks after the passing of which the corporation of Peterboro undertook by the by-law to deliver the debentures to trustees thereby appointed, has ever been passed. For this reason, and for others, which appear to me to be abundantly sufficient to have justified the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench in refusing to grant the prerogative writ of mandamus moved for, it is unnecessary that we should, and I therefore do not, express upon a motion of this character any opinion upon the point raised affecting the validity of the Dominion statute, 83 Vict. ch. 53, as unnecessary for the determination of the question before us. Whenever, if ever, that point shall necessarily arise, many cases in the American courts can be usefully referred to[27].\nA point was also taken before us which does not appear to have been urged in the courts below, namely, that, as is contended by the corporation of Peterboro, the true construction of sec. 92, item 10, in connection with sec. 91, item 29 of the B.N.A. Act is, that the power to incorporate all railway companies, even those for the construction of railways wholly within the limits of any one of the provinces, is vested in the Dominion Parliament, the contention being that \u201crailways\u201d are among the local works, which, by sec. 92, item 10, are excepted from the jurisdiction of the local legislatures, and are by sec. 91, item 29, placed under the Dominion. Parliament. To this it was answered that the 92nd sec. item 10, only referred to railways \u201cconnecting the province with any other or others of the provinces, or extending beyond the limits of the province,\u201d but to this it was replied that railways \u201cconnecting one province with another or extending beyond the limit of the province\u201d would not be a local work, and that they plainly were local works which were intended; moreover, it was added that \u201clines of steam or other ships\u201d which were by the section in question placed in the same position as \u201crailways,\u201d could not be spoken of as \u201cconnecting one province with another or as extending beyond the limits of the province.\u201d The section certainly does not seem to be very felicitously expressed, if it was intended to refer only to lines of steam or other ships, or to railways as connecting one province with another, or as extending beyond the limits of a province; such works from their nature not being local, could not be excepted as such. It must be admitted, I think, that there is a point of some difficulty raised by the language of this section, and that it is of such a nature that unless absolutely necessary to the determination of the question before us, it should not be adjudicated upon by us on a motion like the present. When it does necessarily arise for adjudication it will also have to be considered, assuming that the exception as to railways must be read in connection with the words \u201cconnecting the province with any other of the provinces or extending beyond the limits of the province,\u201d whether the privilege conferred by section 7 of 33 Vic., c. 53, of using the Grand Trunk Railway under arrangements with that company for the purpose of the transport of traffic from one line to the other, be or not a privilege which could be conferred by the local legislature, and whether in effect the company incorporated, or intended so to be, by 33 Vic. c. 53, is not formed for the construction of a railway in connection with although not part of the Grand Trunk, but in connection with it, so as to be capable of having running powers over the Grand Trunk Railway, and so as not to be a local work within the jurisdiction of the legislature of Ontario.\nNow, assuming the by-law to have been made legal and binding by 34 Vic. c. 48, and that the company had a corporate existence and had fulfilled the condition mentioned in the by-law as conditions precedent to the company acquiring a right to receive the bonus, there cannot be a doubt that the company could sue for and recover the bonus in an action of debt on the by\u2011law. In Hopkins v. Mayor of Swansea[28] it was laid down that an action would lie against a corporation by a person who, by a by-law of the corporation, is intended to take a benefit under it. The by-law has the same effect within its limits and with respect to the persons upon whom it lawfully operates, as an act of Parliament upon the subjects at large; and the dictum of Lord Holt[29] that it would be absurd to say an act of Parliament should pass to give a man a benefit, and that he should not have an action for it, is equally applicable to the case of a by\u2011law confining it to the persons on whom it is intended to operate. At the time that this motion was made it is admitted that, although nine years had elapsed, the work had not progressed so as to entitle such company to receive any part of the bonus, but it it is said that now the work entitling the company to the whole is completed. If that be true the company has an action at law by which they can recover the whole amount. Upon the part of the corporation, however, it is contended that the bonus has been wholly forfeited by non-commencement within the prescribed time, a point which will necessarily arise in an action brought by the company to recover the amount which they claim to be now due, and upon which the corporation to be affected should be allowed the opportunity of taking the opinion of a jury in an action instituted in the ordinary manner. Under these circumstances I cannot see what possible object would be served by now ordering the debentures to be delivered to the trustees named under the provisions of the act, even if they came within the description of the trustees referred to in the by-law, while the right of the company to recover at all is contested, and the more especially as the corporation in June, 1872, gave notice to the company that they claimed that the company by non commencement within the time prescribed had forfeited all claim, and the company who had then the same right to call for delivery of the debentures as they had when this motion was made upwards of seven years later, do not appear to have ever questioned the correctness of this view expressed by the corporation of Peterboro, who, relying upon their exemption from liability, have never levied any rate under the by-law regarding it as forfeited. But further: by-laws of this description granting bonuses to railway companies, upon the faith of which the companies enter into contracts for completion of their roads, seem to me to be in the nature of contracts made by the corporations expecting benefit from the construction of the roads with the railway companies, that upon certain conditions named in the by-law being fulfilled by the railway company, the corporation will give a certain sum of money to the railway company; regarding the by-law in this light, and assuming the trustees named to be the trustees to whom by the by-law the corporation agreed to hand the debentures authorized to be issued by the by-law in advance of the performance by the company of the contemplated work, there does not appear to me to be any warrant in law for the company obtaining specific performance of such a contract by means of the prerogative writ of mandamus. Whether such a remedy in such a case would or not be a convenient mode of obtaining redress is a question with which we are not concerned; it is sufficient that it never has been applied to such a purpose.\nIn Rex v. The Bank of England[30], it was held that mandamus would not lie to compel the Bank of England to transfer stock. In Regina v. Turnpike Road Trustees[31], it was held that a mortgagee of tolls and toll houses has only an equitable right to enforce payment of principal and interest, and is therefore not entitled to a mandamus for that purpose. The writ of mandamus was applied to enforce the performance of duties, for the breach of which there was no adequate relief at law, not to enforce obligations arising out of contract in respect of which, by decreeing specific performance of the contract, the Courts of Equity had adequate, and indeed exclusive jurisdiction, until by the administration of justice acts in the Province of Ontario the courts of common law had conferred upon them the like equitable jurisdiction as Courts of Equity, to be exercised, however, not upon motion, but in an action brought according to the ordinary practice of the courts.\nAlthough by the C.L.P. Act the Legislature has extended the power of the courts in granting writs of mandamus, yet in Benson v. Paul[32] and in Morris v. Irish Land Co.[33] it has been held that the writ, as granted under the C.L.P. Act, does not lie to enforce the specific performance of duties arising out of personal contracts; and in Bush v. Beaven[34] the court, referring to these cases, says: In Benson v. Paul it was held that the right to a mandamus under C.L.P. Act does not extend to the fulfilment of duties arising from personal contracts, and though in the subsequent case of Morris v. Irish Land Co. it was held that the remedy is not restricted to cases where the old writ of mandamus would have lain, no case seems to have done away with, in respect of the action of mandamus, the doctrine which always applied to the writ of mandamus that it does not apply where there is any other remedy.\nTrue it is, that by force of the administration of justice acts in force in Ontario, which enabled the Common Law Courts to enforce an equitable claim equally as a Court of Equity could, specific performance of a contract might possibly perhaps have been obtained in an action for mandamus under the C.L.P. Act; but in that case the writ was obtainable only in an action brought for it, and not upon motion as the old writ of mandamus (call it \u201cprerogative\u201d or not signifies little) for which writ the motion in this case is, and as to which there has been no change whatever in the law in this respect. The Ontario statute 85 Vic. c. 14 provides a more speedy and summary method for pro-curing the issue of the writ, but it does not extend the area of the field of the application of the writ, or authorize the enforcement of contracts under it, by directing specific performance of them; that remedy can still, as formerly, be obtained only by suit, brought according to the ordinary proceedings of courts established for dispensing equitable relief.\nWith great deference for the opinion of the late Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, I cannot concur in the opinion expressed by him in Stratford v. County of Perth[35] that the Ontario statute 35 Vic. c. 14 extends the power of the courts to apply the old writ of mandamus issuable on motion to a purpose to which the writ was not applicable before the passing of that act. It cannot now, any more than before that act, be applied to enforcing specific performance of contracts; and, as it appears to me, that the undertaking entered into by a municipal corporation contained in these by-laws for granting bonuses to railway companies, is in the nature of a contract entered into with the company for the delivery to it of debentures upon conditions stated in the by-law, the only way in which delivery of the debentures to trustees upon behalf of the company, before the company shall have acquired a right to the actual receipt and benefit of them by fulfilment of the conditions prescribed in the by-law, is in the province of Ontario by action at law or in equity under the provisions of the statute in force there regulating the proceedings in actions, and not by summary process by motion for the old prerogative writ of mandamus, which the writ of mandamus obtainable upon motion without action still is.\nI concur with Mr. Justice Patterson in thinking that the effect of the statute, 34 Vic. c. 48, apart from any effect it may have of recognising the existence of the railway company, was merely to make the by-law as valid as if it had been read a third time, and as if the municipality had had power to give a bonus to the company. The third section of the Act, I think, strengthens this view, for it shews that the Legislature had no idea of asserting a right to force contracts upon municipal corporations as made by them, unless the by-laws containing the contracts should be legally approved by the ratepayers under the provisions of the Municipal Corporations Act in that behalf. It has been decided in the United States that no act of assembly of a sovereign state could make valid a contract which was actually void, for that would be making contracts for individuals without their consent[36]. If our Provincial Legislatures have in this respect a power which the sovereign States of America have not the intention to exercise, it should, at least, be expressed in language clear beyond all controversy, I can conceive nothing more to be deprecated in a free State than legislative assumption of a right to interfere with contracts against the will of the contracting parties. If then there be anything in the suggestion that no legal vote was ever taken upon the by-law in question by reason of some unauthorized alteration in the by-law as read in the council as to the time of taking the poll of votes, or as to the advertisement thereof, that, if established by evidence, will be open to consideration in any action which may be brought to recover the amount of the bonus which the railway company alleges has now been completely earned.\nFor these reasons, without expressing any opinion as to the validity or invalidity of the Act, 33 Vic. c. 53, or of the several acts of the Legislature of Ontario professing to affect the Grand Junction Railway Company, I think the writ of mandamus applied for in the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench should have been refused with costs, and that therefore this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIn the view which I take, I consider it to be premature to express any opinion upon the question, whether by reason of any alteration in the by-law after its first reading, the Act in question did or not make the by-law good, because as I consider the proceeding by writ of mandamus to be, for the reasons I have given, wholly unauthorised, the evidence or matters rather contained in the affidavits cannot conclude either party, nor can the question of fact as to the alleged alteration of the by-law be determined so as to conclude the parties, and to become the foundation of a judicial decision until the matter of fact is found by a competent tribunal upon an issue joined between the parties in a duly instituted action or suit at law or in equity.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Cameron, Appellbe and McPhillips.\nSolicitors for respondent: Scott and Edwards.\n[1] P. 33.\n[2] 83 Ill. 348.\n[3] 22 Wend. 94.\n[4] 10 B. & C. 391.\n[5] 10 Pick. 187.\n[6] 37 Cal. 354.\n[7] 31 Ohio 21.\n[8] 34 New Hamp. 372.\n[9] 10 Wall. 566.\n[10] 29 Ill. 237.\n[11] 9 Moo.

Ritchie, C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne, JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nFerry, disturbance of\u2014License to ferry, construction of\nThe Crown granted a license to the town of Belleville, giving the right to ferry \u201cbetween the town of Belleville to Ameliasburg.\u201d\nHeld,\u2014A sufficient grant of a right of ferriage to and from the two places named.\nUnder the authority of this license the town of Belleville executed a lease to the plaintiff granting the franchise \u201cto ferry to and from the town of Belleville to Ameliasburg,\u201d a township having a water frontage of about ten or twelve miles, directly opposite to Belleville, such lease providing for only one landing place on each side, and a ferry was established within the limits of the town of Belleville on the one side, to a point across the Bay of Quinte, in the township of Ameliasburg, within an extension of the east and west limits of Belleville. The defendants established another ferry across another part of the Bay of Quinte, between the Township of Ameliasburg and a place in the Township of Sidney, which adjoins the City of Belleville, the termini being on the one side two miles from the western limits of Belleville, and on the Ameliasburg shore, about two miles west from the landing place of the plaintiff\u2019s ferry.\nHeld (reversing the judgment appealed from), that the establishment and use of the plaintiff\u2019s ferry within the limits aforesaid for many years had fixed the termini of the said ferry, and that the, defendants\u2019 ferry was no infringement of the plaintiff\u2019s rights.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, affirming a decree of the Court of Chancery of that Province[1], declaring that the appellants had infringed the right of ferry of the respondent, and enjoining the appellants from continuing their ferry and from running any ferry boat between the townships of Ameliasburg and Sidney. The facts are fully stated in the report of the case in 27 Grant 411, and in the judgments hereinafter given.\nMr. Bethune, Q.C., for appellants.\nMr. C. Robinson, Q.C., for respondent.\nThe following cases were referred to on the argument: Fripp v. Frank[2]; Fraser v. Drynan[3]; Hopkins v. Great N. Rwy. Co.[4]; Pim v. Curell[5]; Huzzey v. Field[6]; Newton v. Cnbitt[7]; Smith v. Rall\u00e9[8].\nRITCHIE, C.J.:\nI do not think there was any infringment of the rights of the plaintiff by the defendant\u2019s ferry running from the township of Sidney, in the county of Hastings, to Ameliasburg, across the bay of Quinte, at the points indicated on the plan exhibit P. in this case.\nThe letters patent, dated the 26th April, 1858, on a petition by the municipality \u201cto grant a license to said municipality of one ferry from Belleville to Ameliasburg,\u201d did \u201cgrant full license and authority unto the municipality of the town of Belleville to establish a ferry between the town of Belleville to Ameliasburg aforesaid,\u201d and under this authority the municipality of Belleville did establish a ferry.\nThe regular starting place of the ferry thus established on the Belleville side was from the town of Belleville at the foot of the street, where a ferry dock was built for the purpose, across the bay to the \u201cferry point,\u201d at the Picton road, on which the town built a dock on the Ameliasburg side, immediately opposite the town of Belleville and within a prolongation of the west and east city limits of the said town. The terminus of the defendants\u2019 ferry on the Ameliasburg side, in the township of Ameliasburg, was over two miles from the western city limits of Belleville, across the bay of Quinte to a point in the township of Sidney, three miles from the said dock or starting place of plaintiff\u2019s ferry on the Belleville side, and it is two miles from defendants\u2019 ferry dock in Sidney to the town line.\nI think the letters patent clearly contemplated the establishment of a ferry between the town of Belleville and Ameliasburg, not merely a right, as contended, to ferry from Belleville to Ameliasburg and not from Ameliasburg to Belleville, or, in other words, a right to ferry one way only. I do not think, as contended, that the grant was void for uncertainty in not describing the limits of the ferry. I think the fair construction of the letters patent is to limit the right to establish a ferry within the limits of the town of Belleville, on the one side, to a point across the Bay of Quinte, within an extension of the east and west limits of Belleville, on the other side, and if there is any doubt on this point, the establishment and user of the ferry within these limits for so many years fixes the termini of the said ferry.\nThis is not a ferry between Belleville and Ameliasburg; its termini are at a greater distance than the statutes fix as interfering distances. There is evidence that this ferry is a public convenience, and the petition of the ratepayers, the resolution of the municipal council and the order in Council clearly show beyond all dispute the necessity and expediency of the ferry.\nIt would be most unreasonable and inconsistent to that part of the country if Belleville, under these letters patent, could claim the right to control and run or not, as might happen to suit Belleville, ferry boats all along the Bay of Quinte\nI think there has been no infringement of plaintiff\u2019s rights, and therefore the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nSTRONG, J.:\nThis is an appeal from a decision of the Court of Appeal, which affirmed a decree of the Court of Chancery restraining the defendant from maintaining and using a ferry across the bay of Quinte, between the township of Ameliasburg and the township of Sidney, and also directing an account of moneys received by the defendants in respect of the ferry in question during the year 1879, and ordering payment of the amount found due to the plaintiff.\nThe bill states the plaintiff\u2019s title to a ferry between the city of Belleville and the township of Ameliasburg, and alleges that the defendants have interfered with his rights by running a ferry boat between Ameliasburg and a place in the township of Sidney, which adjoins the city of Belleville, about two miles from the Belleville terminus of the plaintiff\u2019s ferry, and with having, for hire and reward, carried persons from Ameliasburg whose immediate destination was Belleville, and with having carried persons to Ameliasburg from Belleville, all of whom would, but for the defendants\u2019 ferry, have used and travelled by the plaintiff\u2019s ferry; and the bill further states, that thereby the defendants intended to and did divert the traffic from the plaintiff\u2019s ferry to his detriment and loss, that the only object of the defendants in establishing their ferry was to draw off passengers from the plaintiff\u2019s ferry, and that there is no occasion or reason for the defendants\u2019 ferry. The defendants do not admit the allegations of the bill, and consequently, under the practice of the Court of Chancery as established by its general orders, the plaintiff is bound to prove both his title to the ferry he claims and the disturbance of his right by the defendants.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s title consists, first, of a license from the Crown, under the Great Seal, dated the 26th of April, 1858, whereby the Crown granted \u201cfull license and authority unto the municipality of the town of Belleville to establish a ferry between the town of Belleville to Ameliasburg aforesaid, with power to sublet the same,\u201d subject to the terms and conditions of the license. This license contains no definition of the limits of the ferry, except in so far as such limits may be considered to be prescribed by the operative words of the license just stated, namely, a ferry between the town of Belleville and the township of Ameliasburg. On the 17th June, 1867, the corporation of the town of Belleville by deed, after reciting; amongst other things, that by the letters patent a lease of the ferry \u201cfrom the town of Belleville to the township of Ameliasburg\u201d had been granted, proceeded \u201cto demise and lease to Abraham L. Bogart, for fifteen years, the said ferry and the right to ferry to and from the town of Belleville aforesaid to the township of Ameliasburg aforesaid, as fully and to the same extent as the party of the first part might or could claim under the said lease or letters patent from the Crown.\u201d Subsequently, in the spring of 1874, Bogart assigned this lease, with the assent of the town of Belleville, to the plaintiff. The fact of the defendants having maintained a ferry and carried passengers for hire between the township of Ameliasburg and the opposite township of Sidney, situated on the same side of the Bay of Quinte as Belleville, is not disputed. The only color of title to such a ferry as that which the defendants have established is an order of the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario in Council, dated the 30th September, 1879, whereby it was ordered that a license under the great seal should issue to the township of Ameliasburg for a ferry between that township and the township of Sidney. No license was ever issued under this Order-in-Council, nor has the township of Ameliasburg ever executed any lease or license to the defendants, or authorized them to establish a ferry under the powers conferred upon them. The landing place of the defendants\u2019 ferry on the Belleville side is proved to have been upwards of 1\u00bd miles west of the westerly limit of Belleville.\nThe first question which arises is whether the license of the 20th April, 1858, authorised the town of Belleville to establish a ferry both ways, that is, a ferry from Ameliasburg to Belleville as well as one from Belleville to Ameliasburg. The ferry is differently described in the license itself, as well as in the lease subsequently made under it In the recital of the letters patent it is stated that the petition was for a license for a ferry from \u201cBelleville to Ameliasburg\u201d but in the operative or granting part of the same instrument it is differently described, the words of this part of the grant being:\nNow, therefore, know ye that we do by these presents grant full license and authority unto the municipality of the town of Belleville to establish a ferry between the town of Belleville to Ameliasburg aforesaid.\nI think there can be no doubt, but that the construction put upon this grant by the court below was the correct one, and that what was granted was a ferry both ways. We cannot construe the words of the letters patent literally\u2014so construed, they would be insensible; we must either reject the word \u201cto\u201d and substitute the conjunction \u201cand\u201d for it, or we must reject \u201cbetween\u201d and substitute \u201cfrom.\u201d It seems to me that the argument in favor of the former construction, as stated in the judgment of Mr. Justice Patterson, is conclusive. The ferry was being established for the use and benefit of the public, and we must therefore so interpret the grant as best to sustain that object\u2014not so as to confer a mere monopoly for the profit of the individual licensee. The statute under which the license was granted clearly shows that it was intended to provide for the establishment of steam ferries running both ways, and not for ferries one way only. The lease by the town of Belleville, which is also very inaccurate in the language in which it describes the ferry, must likewise be taken as demising a right co-extensive with that conferred by the license. The operative words in the granting part of the lease are \u201cthe said ferry and the right of ferry to and from the town of Belleville aforesaid to the township of Ameliasburg aforesaid as fully and to the same extent as the party of the first part might or could claim under the said lease or letters patent from the crown.\u201d If we take out the words \u201cto the township of Ameliasburg as aforesaid,\u201d and read the lease as of a ferry \u201cto and from Belleville\u201d as fully and to the same extent as confirmed by the letters patent upon the town, there can be no doubt about what was meant, and I cannot consider this description, which we should get by so reading the instrument, narrowed by the insertion of the words, \u201cto the township of Ameliasburg,\u201d rather the words \u201cto and from Belleville\u201d call upon us to interpolate the words \u201cand from\u201d before the \u201ctownship of Ameliasburg;\u201d and so reading it, we get a complete, sensible and accurate description of what was no doubt intended to be granted\u2014a ferry co-extensive with that which the letters patent had granted to the town, viz., one to and fro between Ameliasburg and Belleville.\nIt seems clear that the provision originally contained in 8 Vic., ch. 50, now embodied in Rev. Stats. Ont., ch. 112, sec. 3, providing that no exclusive privilege of a right of ferry should extend for any greater distance than one mile and a half of the point at which the ferry is usually kept, does not apply to steam ferries licensed under 20 Vic., ch. 7. The Commissioners, in revising the statutes, have adopted this construction, for sec. 3 of chapter 112 expressly makes the exception of ferries granted to municipalities under the subsequent provisions of the Act (ch. 112), which are a re-enactment of the provisions of 20 Vic., ch. 7.\nSection 5 of ch. 112, which is an exact reproduction of the similar provision in 20 Vic. ch 7, under which this license now in question was granted, is in these words:\nSuch license shall confer a right on the municipality or municipalities to establish a ferry from shore to shore on such stream or other water and within such limit and extent as may appear advisable to the Lieutenant-Governor in Council and be expressed in such license.\nReferring to the letters patent we do not find any description or definition of the limits of the ferry beyond those contained in the operative words of the grant which, as before stated, and according to the proper construction, describe it as \u201ca ferry between the town of Belleville and Ameliasburg.\u201d The exclusive limits of the ferry must be taken, therefore, to be the town of Belleville, on one side of the bay, and the township of Ameliasburg, on the other. These at first, no doubt, seem to be very extensive limits, but when we consider that the grant is subject to an absolute power of revocation by the Crown, any objection on this head ceases to appear of importance.\nTherefore, taking the limits of the ferry to be the limits of the town of Belleville on one side, and those of the township of Ameliasburg on the other, we have to determine whether the defendants, by the maintenance of a ferry from a point in the township of Ameliasburg to a point in the township of Sidney west of the limits of the town of Belleville, have been guilty of any disturbance of the plaintiff\u2019s ferry. And I am clearly of opinion that this question must be answered in the negative. Although the 8 Vic., ch. 50, has no direct application to the license granted to the town of Belleville, yet it may be called in aid to assist in the interpretation to be given to the words \u201csuch limit and extent\u201d used in the 20 Vic., ch. 7, in the section already extracted from the Revised Statutes. Referring, then, to the provision of the 8 Vic., ch. 50, which fixes the limits of a ferry at one mile and a half on each side of the point at which it is usually kept, we find very distinctly what is meant by \u201climits,\u201d and by the words \u201climit and extent,\u201d and for what purpose such limits are defined; for the words of the earlier statute are that\u2014\nWhen the limits to which the exclusive privilege of any ferry extends are not already defined, such exclusive privilege shall not be granted for any greater distance than one mile and a half on each side of the point at which the ferry is usually kept.\nThe limits, therefore, being used in the first statute for the purpose of defining the exclusive right of ferry, we are at liberty to conclude, construing the two statutes as in pari materi\u00e2, that the limit and extent required in licenses to be issued under the later Act, were also to be the limits of the exclusive privilege. Then, what is meant by the term \u201cexclusive privilege?\u201d It must mean that, within the limits defined, no person shall, without being guilty of unlawful interference, maintain a ferry, but that without the limits there shall be no exclusive privilege, and consequently that no amount of practical interference shall be taken to be unlawful or actionable as constituting a disturbance of the franchise of the licensee. This must necessarily mean within the same limits on both sides of the river or stream, for otherwise the very object and purpose of fixing the limits of a ferry, which is to prevent the uncertainty which arises in the case of ancient ferries in England, and in respect of other ferries without defined limits, would be defeated. That this is the object of defining the limits of the ferry is, if it is not sufficiently obvious without any demonstration, very clearly shown by a note in Kent\u2019s Commentaries[9], where it is said:\nIt has been usual in the grant of a franchise to exclude in express terms all interference within specified distances. This practice has become highly expedient, considering the doctrine referred to in a subsequent part of this note. By a general Act in Illinois a ferry or toll bridge privilege created by statute excludes all other establishments within three miles of the same. * * * This is an affirmance of the common law rule, and it is the wisest course, for it prevents all uncertainty and dispute as to what are reasonable distances in the given case, and what would amount to an unlawful interference.\nOn the whole, therefore, it appears very clear that it was intended by the statute that the limits and extent to be defined should be those within which it should be deemed a disturbance of the licensee\u2019s franchise to interfere by the establishment of another ferry, and that as regards anything done without those limits, the licensee should have no right to complain. The defendants have not therefore by running a ferry boat between the townships of Ameliasburg and Sydney been guilty of any interference with the plaintiff\u2019s rights. As regards the provision included now in the 10th sec. of the Revised Statutes, ch. 112, I am of opinion that it has no application to the case of a person who \u201clessens the tolls and profits\u201d of a licensee of the Crown, by ferrying without the limits of the licensed ferry. The section can only be applicable to the case of a disturbance, by ferrying within the limits of the licensed ferry, or by some unlawful act other than ferrying without the limits. The language of this section in terms only applies to persons who unlawfully ferry, or who unlawfully do any other act or thing whereby the licensee\u2019s profits are lessened. The unlawful ferrying referred to must mean a ferrying within the exclusive limits of the licensed ferry, or otherwise there would be no use in defining the limits of the exclusive privilege, as the statute has so carefully done; for a contrary construction would at once let in all the uncertainty which it was the very object to prevent in requiring a definition of the limits; and the \u201cother unlawful act or thing\u201d means some \u201cact or thing\u201d distinct from ferrying, such as forcibly obstructing the landing from the ferry and other unlawful acts which may be suggested, entirely distinct from maintaining a ferry without the limits.\nIt is true that the maintenance of a ferry and the taking of tolls for ferrying without the license of the Crown, is at common law illegal, as unduly infringing the prerogative of the Crown, but it is an illegality for which, so long as there is no unlawful interference with the private rights of other ferrying proprietors, there is no remedy but such as the Crown may think fit to resort to, to restrain or abate it.\nIn my judgment the decree of the Court of Chancery must be reversed and the bill dismissed with costs, and the appellant must have his costs in this Court and in the Court of Appeal.\nFOURNIER, J.:\u2014\nI agree with Chief Justice Haggarty in the court below that the defendants\u2019 ferry is no infringement of plaintiff\u2019s right, and therefore I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed.\nHENRY and TASCHEREAU, JJ., concurred. GWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nI am of opinion that the plaintiff, by selecting the ferry point on the Ameliasburg side, as his landing place, has adopted the termini of his ferry, and that there has been by the defendants in this case no infringement of plaintiff\u2019s rights.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Delaney & Oslrom.\nSolicitors for respondent: Blake, Kerr, Lash & Cassels.\n[1] 7 Ont.

Ritchie, CJ., and Strong, Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne, JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nConsignment of goods subject to payment\u2014Agreement that purchaser shall not sell\u2014Passing property.\nThe plaintiff consigned crude oil to A, who was a refiner, on the express agreement that no property in the oil should pass until he made up certain payments. Without making such payments, however, A sold the oil to the defendants without the knowledge of the plaintiff.\nHeld,\u2014(Affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario,) that although the defendants were purchasers for value from A, in the belief that he was the owner and entitled to sell the oil in question, the plaintiff, under his agreement with A, having retained the property in the oil, and not having done anything to estop him from maintaining his right of ownership, was entitled to recover from the purchasers the price of the oil.\nAPPEAL by the defendants, Forristal and McIntosh, from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] dismissing an appeal of the said defendants from a judgment of the Court of Chancery.\nThe action was instituted by Jhon McDonald to recover the value of five car loads of oil said to have been converted to their own use by Forristal & McIntosh, who were carrying on business at the city of London as refiners of and dealers in oil.\nMcDonald claimed the oil under an agreement between him and another defendant Adams, and the defendants Forristal & McIntosh claimed by purchase and delivery from the defendant Adams. The agreement under which the plaintiff claimed is referred to at length in the judgment of Ritchie, C.J.\nMr. Gibbons for appellant.\nMr. Street, Q.C., for respondent.\nThe arguments are fully noticed in the judgments.\nThe following authorities were referred to:\nWalker v. Hyman[2]; Pickering v. Busk[3]; Crossman v. Shears[4]; Chitty on Contracts[5]; Higgins v. Burton[6]; Campbell on Sales[7]; Johnson v. Credit Lyonnais Co.[8]; Rumball v. Metropolitan Bank[9].\nRITCHIE, C.J.:\nThis case certainly does not come within the Act respecting contracts in relation to goods entrusted to agents. Adams was in no sense the agent of McDonald, nor was he in any way entrusted with these goods, shipped to him by McDonald, to sell, consign, or part or deal with them. His position with reference to these goods was simply for the purpose of safe custody and refining the crude oil under an agreement, dated 20th December, 1880, between Adams and McDonald, within two weeks after each delivery or shipment by McDonald to Adams. The said agreement stipulating that: \u201cThe crude oil so shipped is to remain the sole property of the said McDonald, and to be held in his name until the sum of one dollar and sixty cents per barrel has been paid for it, and the shipment of it to the said Adams is not, nor is the refining of it by him, to be taken to change the property in the said oil from the said McDonald to the said Adams, but upon payment for each lot the same is to be transferred from the said McDonald to said Adams. In case default shall be made in payment of any of the moneys hereby secured, the said McDonald is entitled to possession of the said refinery, and of the crude or refined oil then being therein, and he may, after due notice to said Adams, sell and dispose of the same, but the said refinery shall not, nor shall any of the fixtures or machinery be sold until after the expiration of one \u2018 month from the time of default, and the said Adams shall again be entitled to resume possession of the said refinery at any time before sale has been made, upon payment of all arrears and costs and charges. And for the purpose of better enabling the said McDonald to take possession in case of default, the said Adams is to be, and hereby becomes, tenant to the said McDonald of the said refinery, the said such tenancy to continue until the objects intended by this assignment have been realized. In case the said McDonald acquires a new lease of the premises during the continuance of these presents, he shall transfer the same to the said Adams upon payment of all the monies hereby intended to be secured, and of all expenses connected therewith. In case Adams shall make default in paying the said sum of one dollar and sixty cents per barrel within the period of two weeks after shipment to him, according to the terms being, he shall not be entitled to call for any more oil from the said McDonald until he shall have paid all arrears in full.\u201d\nAdams, having no authority to sell, could not, by making a sale, transfer the property of McDonald to Forristal. I can discover nothing in the conduct of McDonald, nor the neglect of any duty by him, by which he enabled Adams to hold himself forth to the world as having, not the possession only, but the property in this crude oil, so as to estop him, Mc Donald, from asserting his right to it. Adams\u2019 general and principal business was that of a refiner of crude oil and though he may have made occasionally sales of crude oil, it is quite clear such sales were exceptional, and not in the general and ordinary course of his business, and I think the learned Judge Proudfoot was quite justified in coming to the conclusion that McDonald did not deal with Adams as a seller to others of crude oil but as a refiner. This, in my opinion, he had a perfect right to do, and I am of opinion the alleged sale or transfer by Adams to Forristal, of which McDonald had no notice, in payment of a prior indebtedness, of this crude oil, the property in which had never passed from McDonald, and the possession which Adams had was for the purpose of refining only, on the conditions contained in the agreement, was a fraud on him. Arriving therefore, at the conclusion that Adams was not entrusted with these goods as an agent at all; that they were placed in his hands as a refiner to refine them; that McDonald was guilty of no negligence, and did not give either authority, or ostensible authority, to Adams to sell these goods, nor did he do anything to estop him from maintaining against the defendant his right of ownership, I think the judgments of the court of first instance and of the Court of Appeal quite right, and therefore this appeal should be dismissed with costs. STRONG, J.:\u2014\nIn my opinion the decree of the Court of Chancery in this case was perfectly correct and must be maintained. There can be no question that the property in the oil never passed to Adams. This is expressly stipulated in the agreement of the 20th December, 1880, by the provision of that instrument which is in the following words:\nThe crude oil so shipped is to remain the sole property of the said McDonald and to be held in his name until the sum of $1.60 per barrel has been paid him for it, and the shipment of it to the said Adams is not, nor is the refining of it by him, to be taken to change the property in the said oil from the said McDonald to the said Adams, but upon payment for each lot the same is to be transferred from the said McDonald to the said Adams.\nIt was quite competent to the parties to make this agreement, as an unpaid vendor may always reserve the property in goods sold,\u2014the passing of the property being in every case a matter of intention which can be controlled by the contract of the parties.\nConsequently Adams could transfer no property unless the case can either be brought within the Factors Act, or there was such conduct on the part of the respondent as estops him from denying that the property was vested in the appellants by the sale which Adams assumed to make to them, for sale in market overt, is, of course, out of the question. If any authority is wanted for this position, nothing can be clearer than the following statement of the law by Mr. Justice Blackburn in Cole v. N. Western Bank[10]; that learned judge there says:\nAt common law a person in possession of goods could not confer on another, either by sale or by pledge, any better title to the goods than he himself had. To this general rule there was an exception of sales in market overt, and an apparent exception where the person in possession had a title defeasible on account of fraud. But the general rule was that, to make either a sale or pledge valid against the owner of the goods sold or pledged, it must be shown that the seller or pledger had authority from the owner to sell or pledge, as the case might be. If the owner of the goods had so acted as to clothe the seller or pledger with apparent authority to sell or pledge, he was at common law precluded as against those who were induced bon\u00e2 fide to act on the faith of that apparent authority, and the result as to them was the same as if he had really given it.\nThat the Factors Acts do not apply, is a proposition concluded by authority, since the goods were not entrusted to Adams as the factor or agent for sale of the respondent[11] and for the reason that Adams did not in fact carry on the business or calling of a factor. That there was no estoppel is equally apparent from the same authorities, and especially from the case of Cole v. N.W. Bank. Adams had, it is true, the possession, but no case has ever decided that the owner of goods is estopped merely because he has entrusted with the possession of his property a person who, being engaged in a business in the course of which he sells goods of the same kind as those which have been delivered to him as a bailee, in breach of his duty, has wrongfully sold the goods of his bailor as his own. If this were so, no man could safely leave his watch with a watchmaker who sells watches, or his carriage with a carriage maker who sells carriages, to be repaired.\nIn the judgment of Mr. Justice Blackburn already quoted from occurs this passage:\nFor example, if a furnished house be let to one who carries on the business of an auctioneer, he is entrusted as tenant with the furniture, being in fact an auctioneer, but it never was the common law, and could not be intended to be enacted, that if he carried the furniture to his auction room and then sold it, he could confer any better title on the purchaser than if he had as an auctioneer acted for some other tenant who committed a similar larceny as a fraudulent bailee; or, to come nearer to the present case, that a warehouseman or wharfinger, who, as such, is entrusted with the custody of goods, if he happens also to pursue the trade of a factor, can give a better title by the sale of the goods than he could if they had been entrusted to some other warehouseman who employed him to sell.\nIt is true that, if, in addition to the possession, the indicia of the property (not merely documents authorizing the holder to acquire the possession, for such latter documents can be of no greater effect than the actual possession itself) are handed over, then a sale by the party so entrusted, though in breach of faith, will operate as an estoppel in favor of a purchaser in good faith, who has relied on the prim\u00e2 facie title with which the true owner has invested his bailee. This was the true ratio decidendi of Lord Ellenborough\u2019s judgment in Pickering v. Busk[12]; and is also, though with some hesitation, stated as law by Lord Tenterden in Dyer v. Pearson[13], both of which cases were decisions at common law; that of Pickering v. Busk having been decided in 1812, before any of the Factors Acts had been enacted.\nThe case which is most like the present, and which seems decisive of it is that of The City Bank v. Barrow[14]. In that case hides had been sent to a tanner near Montreal to be tanned and re-shipped to the owner in England. The consignee, who, in the course of his business, purchased hides and from them manufactured leather, pledged the hides which had been consigned to him to be tanned, together with others of his own, to a bank, which acted in perfect good faith, as security for advances. It was held by the House of Lords that the bank had no title against the true owner, and was liable for the value of the hides which had been sold. There can be no doubt but that this case correctly states and applies the law of England, though it may be doubtful whether it as accurately states the law of Quebec, which was assumed to be in this respect identical with the English law.\nWere we to hold in this case that Adams was able to transfer a good title to the oil in question, we should be establishing the principle that in all cases possession is evidence of title, and this rule that possession is equivalent to title, although it is undoubtedly the law of France, and of many other countries whose legal system is founded on that of the French code, and amongst others, and in a restricted sense and as applicable only to commercial transactions, that of the Province of Quebec, has never been recognized as a rule of the law of England; if it had been, there never would have been any necessity for the enactment of the statutes known as the Factors Acts, and the numerous cases which have arisen on those Acts, and have led to so many refined distinctions, might all have been solved without difficulty, for, in that case, all inquiry would have been limited to two questions of fact\u2014the actual possession of the person assuming to sell or pledge and the bon\u00e2 fides of the vendee or pledgee.\nTherefore, notwithstanding the very able and ingenious argument of the learned counsel for the appellants, I am constrained to say that I heard nothing from the bar, and on subsequent consideration I have found nothing in the authorities, to throw a shadow of doubt on the decision of the court below.\nMy judgment is that the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER and TASCHEREAU, JJ., concurred.\nHENRY, J.:\nI concur with the other members of the court who have expressed their views, that the appeal in this case should be dismissed. McDonald was the owner of the property in question, and never conveyed his title to Adams. He placed it with him as bailee, for a special purpose, which did not include the power to sell. In fact, it was specially agreed that he should not sell or dispose of it in any way himself. There is nothing to show that he was in any way the agent of McDonald. Evidence was given on the trial that Adams was in the habit of selling refined oil, and, on one or two occasions, had sold crude oil,\u2014but it was only when he was overstocked and had not the means to convert it; but his business was that of a refiner,\u2014of converting oil from the crude to the refined state. I have no doubt the law applicable to this case is as stated by the learned Chief Justice, and my brother Strong. A man cannot give a title to property to which he has no title himself. A bailee cannot, because he has merely possession of property, give a title which he has not himself. If a livery stable keeper hires a horse and carriage to a party to drive out, and gives him possession of it for the time being, no one would pretend for a moment, that if he sold the horse and carriage he had hired, the owner could not look to the purchaser for them. The same principle applies to this case. The bailee undertook to sell the property in his possession, and applied the funds to pay an old debt to Forristal. The transaction under the circumstances was a fraud upon McDonald Forristal knew the terms by which Adams came in possession of the property.\nI have no doubt that under the law applicable to the case and the evidence that the judgment of the ViceChancellor was the correct one, and ought to be sustained, and therefore the appeal should be dismissed with costs GYWNNE, J.:\u2014\nAlthough the defendants are, in my opinion, purchasers for value from Adams in the belief that he was the owner of and entitled to sell the oil in question, still I am of opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to retain the judgment rendered in his favor in the courts below. That Adams was not an agent entrusted with the possession of the oil within the meaning of ch. 121 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario is clear from the judgment of the Exchequer Chamber in Cole v. The North Western Bank[15]. No question arises here which might arise in a case of conflicting evidence of the terms of an oral contract and of the intention of the parties thereto, namely, whether the provision as to the property not passing until payment was not inserted as an attempt to restrict the rights already acquired by the vendee, to whom, by force of other terms of the contract, it was apparent that the intention of the parties was that the property should pass upon delivery. Here the question arises upon a sealed instrument carefully prepared, the true construction of which I think is that the crude oil was delivered to Adams for the purpose of being refined at his refinery, the keeping open of which in operation was the main object in view, and the intention of the parties is clearly and, I think, reasonably, expressed to be that the property in the oil, notwithstanding its change from the crude state to refined, should not pass from the plaintiff to Adams until payments should be made in the manner stated in the instrument. I am of opinion also that the case does not come within the doctrine of Pickard v. Sears[16], or Freeman v. Cooke[17], as explained in Swan v. N.B. Australasian Co.[18], approved of in Johnson v. Credit Lionais Co. in the Court of Appeal (1); so as to deprive the plaintiff of his common law light of re-claiming his property from the defendants, although purhasers for value, and without notice, from Adams,who, in violation of the terms upon which he had acquired possession of the plaintiff\u2019s property, assumed to deal with it as his own. The appeal, therefore, must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Gibbons, McNab & Mulken.\nSolicitors for respondents: Street & Beecher.\n[1] 29 Grant 300.\n[2] 1 Ont.

J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Gwynne, JJ.\nON APPPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nInsolvent Act of 1875\u2014Unjust preference\u2014Fraudulent preference\u2014Presumption of innocence.\nW., the respondent, was a private banker who had had various dealings with one D., and had discounted for him at an exorbitant rate of interest notes received by D. in the course of his business. D's indebtedness on new transactions amounted to a large sum of money, but, being a man of a very sanguine temperament, he had entered into a new line of business, after obtaining goods on credit to the amount of $4,000 or $5,000, upon a representation to the parties supplying such goods that, although without any available capital, he had experience in business.\nAbout twelve days after he had commenced his new business, being threatened by a mortgagee with foreclosure proceedings, he applied to W., who advanced him $300, part of which was applied in paying the overdue interest on the mortgage, and the surplus in retiring a note of D's. held by W. D. executed a mortgage in favor of W. and was granted a reduced rate of interest on his indebtedness and was told he would have to work carefully to get through. D. became insolvent about four months afterwards. In a suit by McR., as assignee, impeaching the mortgage to W. it was\nHeld,\u2014(Affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal,) that McR. had not satisfied the onus which was cast upon him by the Insolvent Act, of shewing that the insolvent at the time of the execution of the mortgage in question contemplated that his embarrassment must of necessity terminate in insolvency.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], reversing the decree of the Court of Chancery, which declared a mortgage, executed by one Depew in favor of the respondent Whyte, void, as being an unjust preference of Whyte over the other creditors of Depew, and ordering Whyte to pay over to the appellant, as the assignee in insolvency of Depew, the sum of $465.\nMr. Robinson, Q.C., and Mr. J. H. McDonald for appellant:\nMr. Gibbons for respondent:\nThe points relied on and the authorities cited appear in the judgments hereinafter given, and in the report of the case in the court below.\nRITCHIE, C. J.:\nThe mortgage which it is alleged was made in contemplation of insolvency, whereby it is claimed defendant obtained an unjust preference, and which is now on that ground sought to be set aside, was made on the 30th October, 1879. The insolvency occurred on the 21st February following.\nThe defendant was a private banker who had had various dealings with the insolvent, discounting notes taken by insolvent from his customers at exorbitant rates of interest, and it would seem almost obvious to any ordinary prudent man of business at rates such as no legitimate business would justify, and it is not at all to be wondered at that the end was insolvency, but this by no means settles the question.\nThe insolvent is described as a man of a very sanguine temperament, who evidently did not view his business transactions in this light. Mr. Justice Burton, in delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, states the facts as they appear in the case thus:\nAt the time of giving the mortgage now in question, the insolvent had ceased to carry on the business in which he had been previously engaged, and had commenced a mercantile business, having purchased goods entirely upon credit from several wholesale houses in Toronto.\nIt appears that when his dealings with Whyte commenced, he owned a property in Morpeth, subject to a mortgage for $600, the value of which he places at $1,000, but which the defendant places at a larger figure.\nThis property he exchanged with one Minnis for a leasehold property in Leamington, containing four and a half acres, and a village lot with a small house upon it. There was a sum of money to be paid to Minnis on the exchange, although the parties differ as to the amount; but whatever it was, was advanced by the defendant, and included in a mortgage which was given to him for $ 1,000 on the 1st March, 1878.\nThe insolvent acquired, in addition to this property, a farm of about fifty acres, and that known as the Brown street. Both the farm and the four and a half acres were subject to mortgages, to one Setterington, prior to Whyte's mortgage.\nAnd there was a mortgage on the Brown street property of $500, prior to that in favour of the defendant. The defendant's mortgage on that property, which is for $1,500, is the one impeached. The last property was, in fact, sold under Setterington's mortgage, and realized $465 over and above his incumbrance, which sum the defendant received, and is ordered by this decree to pay over to the plaintiff as assignee of the insolvent's estate.\nThe account given by the insolvent in reference to what took place on the execution of this mortgage, is given in his evidence and shows that an advance was then made by the defendant of $300, the greater portion of which went to pay off interest on the prior mortgages held by Setterington, and a balance to retire a note held by the defendant.\nIt was then arranged that the insolvent should have an extension of two years for the notes due to the defendant at a considerable reduced rate of interest, provided the interest was duly paid upon them as they matured.\nAnd the learned judge again says:\nWe find then in this case that, some days prior to the execution of the mortgage impeached, the insolvent had embarked in a new business; having been entrusted by his creditors with some $4,000 or $5,000 worth of goods upon a representation that he had no available capital, but that he had experience in business, that he was shortly afterwards threatened with proceedings by Setterington which, if persisted in, must have closed his business; and that in this emergency he applied to the defendant, who advanced him sufficient to meet the overdue interest and gave an extension of his own claim at a reduced rate of interest, that the defendant intimated to him at that time that he would have to work very carefully in order to get through, and the learned Chief Justice thinks that this intimation was sufficient to bring home knowledge of his position to the insolvent, even if he did not know it previously, but the insolvent denies this, and says that he did not understand this meaning, but supposed that it was given by way of advice, that he himself thought he would get through if he had time. We have in addition to this, that he was a man of very sanguine temperament.\nHaving, therefore, but a few days before this transaction succeeded in obtaining $4,000 or $5,000 worth of goods from parties knowing he had no available capital, but believing he had experience in business, and getting a further advance, and an extension of time, and a reduction of the rate of interest from defendant, I think the natural inference would be that a man with such a sanguine temperament would easily delude himself with the idea that certain prospects of success were before him; we have seen him all along doing a business at a ruinous rate of interest, we see him now with that interest reduced, payment of capital postponed and with a large stock of goods purchased on credit to start afresh in a new business. I can find nothing in the evidence that would justify me in saying that the insolvent obtained these goods with the wicked intent of defrauding those that furnished them, as would have been the case if, at the time of obtaining them and of giving this mortgage he contemplated insolvency; on the other hand I think the legitimate inference, in view of his sanguine character, and judging him by his previous dealings, and the assistance obtained by the large advance of goods, is that he was not thinking of insolvency, but was rather, in view of the fresh start he was getting, looking forward to a career of business success.\nIt must be remembered that the insolvency did not occur till nearly four months after the transaction now impeached. Fraud is not to be presumed, but, on the contrary, the burthen is on the plaintiff to show affirmatively that, at the time the transaction was entered into, the insolvent contemplated insolvency; to establish this it is clearly not sufficient to show merely that the trader was insolvent when the transfer was made, for it by no means necessarily follows that a man in embarrassed circumstances contemplates insolvency; many men struggle on in hope of retrieving their affairs and avoiding insolvency long after their affairs become embarrassed, anticipating they may rally and come round. In the absence of any direct evidence I find it impossible to say, judging from the surrounding circumstances and the position and character of the insolvent, that at the time he made this transfer he contemplated that his embarrassments must of necessity terminate in insolvency, and that with a view to that end he made the transfer. In Gibson v. Routts[2], Tindal, C.J., says:\nContemplation of bankruptcy, I take to mean, where the party believes bankruptcy to be the necessary result of his condition, and such belief is operating upon, his mind at the time of making the payment.\nOn the other hand I think all the circumstances tend to the conclusion that the insolvent then entertained a bon\u00e2 fide hope or expectation that his property and his new business would extricate him from his difficulties, though I am very free to confess that few prudent business men, judging by his past business career, would be likely to look on his business prospects in the same favorable light. Under all these circumstances, I am not prepared to say that the plaintiff has shown, beyond a reasonable doubt, that when the transfer was made the trader was insolvent, and that he contemplated insolvency.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nThe question which we have to decide in this case, purely of one fact, is, whether the respondent took the mortgage of the 12th October, 1879, in contemplation of the insolvency of the mortgagor, and with the intent of obtaining an unjust preference over his other creditors. The insolvency did not occur until the 21st February, 1880, so that the presumption created by the statute against transactions of this kind, occurring within thirty days previously to the insolvency, does not arise, and the burthen of proving the transaction to have been fraudulent lies on the assignee who has impeached the mortgage. I am of opinion that all the surrounding circumstances warrant the conclusion arrived at by the Court of Appeal, that neither the respondent nor the insolvent then contemplated failure, and that, on the contrary, both parties then hoped and anticipated that Depew, the insolvent, would eventually be able to surmount the difficulties in which he was admittedly at the time involved. The statute does not provide that every security given by a debtor, when in circumstances of pecuniary embarrassment, shall be void, even though those embarrassments afterwards culminate in insolvency. The words of the clause in question are:\nIf any sale, deposit, pledge, or transfer, be made of any property, real or personal, by any person in contemplation of insolvency, by way of security for payment to any creditor * * * whereby such creditor obtains, or will obtain, an unjust preference over the other creditors, such sale, deposit, pledge, transfer, or payment, shall be null and void.\nAll depends upon the intention of the parties, and if it can be shown that the creditor acted in good faith, his security is unimpeachable whatever may be the result of the debtor's embarrassments. Each case must, therefore, be decided upon its particular circumstances, and is not to be determined by the application of any general rules, or presumption of either law or fact, laid down in decided cases. In the present case, it appears to me, that the surrounding facts do not warrant the inference of fraud. I do not found this conclusion on the direct evidence, though this is in favour of the respondent, for it is proved that the insolvent, with the assistance of the respondent's partner Martin, did make up a rough statement of his assets and liabilities which showed a surplus. What I proceed upon is, that the conduct of the insolvent at the date of the mortgage, and his situation in regard to his business, was such as to make it impossible to suppose that he then contemplated becoming insolvent. Only a few days before this transaction of the mortgage, he had begun a new business as a retail dry goods merchant, with a large stock of goods, which he had been enabled to obtain from merchants in Toronto wholly on his own credit, and from this source he anticipated considerable profits, and such as might have warranted the expectation that, by the time the respondent's debt, which was deferred for two years, became due, he would, from his store and from the profits of his farm and the sale of village lots, be able to meet his payment to the respondent and in the meantime pay for the goods. It is, therefore, out of the question to say that Depew himself supposed he was on the eve of insolvency. On the contrary, it is apparent that he supposed he was entering upon a flourishing business, and that all that was required to make his success certain was the concurrence of the respondent in an arrangement which he proposed as to further time. As regards the respondent himself, he certainly seems to have been more doubtful, but from what is stated to have passed between him and Depew, and from the nature of the advice he gave the latter, I think it is evident that he too anticipated that with good management Depew might get through his difficulties. As to the new advance which was made, I admit no importance ought to be attached to that, as it seems all to have been applied to the payment of debts in which the respondent was interested. Had it been otherwise applied, that alone would have been sufficient to have repelled any prim\u00e2 facie presumption of fraud. I think, however, the circumstance of the extension of time, the reduction of the rate of interest, the expectations which seem to have been entertained respecting the profits of the new business, the conduct of the respondent, in abstaining from any interference with the stock in trade, are all so many circumstances inconsistent with fraudulent intent and in favor of bona fides sufficient to rebut any presumption arising merely from the financial condition of the debtor, and that it would be impossible to say that the respondent supposed Depew to have been on the eve of insolvency, and took the security to secure himself an unjust preference. The case, I admit, is a suspicious one, but that is not enough to avoid the security. In administering the bankruptcy law the English courts will not avoid transactions of this kind on evidence inducing suspicion merely[3], and the same rule ought to be applied to cases of alleged preference coming under this 133rd clause. In Newton v. Ontario Bank[4], the affairs of the insolvent as known to the secured creditor, the bank, were in a condition to lead it to suspect his approaching insolvency, but the Court of Appeal nevertheless held the transaction to be valid. I think, therefore, that the decision of the Court of Appeal was the correct conclusion on the evidence, and that we ought to adhere to it.\nAnother point was argued, that of pressure; it was contended by the respondent's counsel that the mortgage was given under such pressure from the respondent, that it alone was sufficient to rebut all presumption of fraud and to establish that there was no unjust preference within the meaning of the statute, and it was contended that the case of Davidson v. Ross[5] was not law and ought not to be followed. In the view of the facts already stated, it is unnecessary to consider the question, and I am not prepared to say that the evidence would justify us in holding that the mortgage was given under the influence of pressure, but as the question of law was fully and ably argued, I think it not irrelevant to say that, had we been compelled to decide the point, I should not have been prepared to have acquiesced in the decision arrived at by the Court of Appeal in Davidson v. Ross. But, opposed as that case is to a long line of authority on the construction of similar enactments in England, extending back for more than 100 years, (Harman v. Fisher[6] was decided by Lord Mansfield in 1774), and especially in direct conflict with two decisions of the Privy Council upon Colonial statutes, identical in their terms with that under consideration in the present case, I should have felt compelled to dissent from it. And I think it right to add that, not only does the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Davidson v. Ross appear to me to be at variance with authority, but that, without regard to previously decided cases, it is open to the objection, that it places a construction upon this 133rd section of the statute, and upon the 89th section of the Act of 1869, inconsistent with the very language in which these clauses are expressed; for I am unable to see how it can be said that a creditor, who obtains payment or security as the direct result of the pressure to which he has subjected his debtor, has obtained an unjust preference. The necessary consequence of the decision of the Court of Appeal in Davidson v. Ross would be that, so soon as a trader, subject to the Insolvent Acts, became unable to meet his engagements, his assets from that time formed a trust fund for the payment of the whole body of his creditors, and no single creditor could obtain by means of pressure an actual payment out of them without being liable to account to the other creditors. This, however, would be a proposition which, so far as I know, has never yet been either embodied in a statutory form or propounded by judicial decision.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER, J., concurred.\nHENRY, J.:\nIt appears to me the only point to be decided by this court is that which is raised by the allegation that the transfer was made in this case in contemplation of bankruptcy. The mortgage in question not having been made within the 30 days referred to in the statute, it is necessary for the party making the allegation to prove it. Now, there is no proof, I take it, offered here that would remove all reasonable doubts from the mind of a judge or jury as to the fraudulent intent of the insolvent. The plaintiff is bound to prove that when the mortgage was given the party did so in contemplation of bankruptcy, or he is bound to prove that it was in some other way a fraudulent transaction. It is, however, only alleged that the transfer was made in contemplation of bankruptcy, and, therefore, under the statute, was void. I must say that if I were called upon to decide as a juror in this case, I would say there was no evidence here that fraud was contemplated, or that the transfer was made in contemplation of bankruptcy. We cannot set aside the agreement of parties merely on suspicion. There may have been on the part of this man an expectation of going into insolvency, but I think the facts in evidence do not show that such was the case. Here was a large stock of goods recently obtained by the insolvent; he was pressed to pay interest on mortgages due to other parties; the defendant had a claim against him which he might enforce at any moment; the insolvent needed funds to pay up the interest on the mortgage. It was necessary, then, to carry out the very object he had in view\u2014obtaining a fresh start in business\u2014to get an advance of money. This property that was assigned had been previously mortgaged to another, and when it was sold it paid but a small portion of the defendant's original debt; after paying the $300 he advanced and interest, there was a very small sum, not exceeding $100, that would go to the credit of the original debt. The defendant gave the insolvent $300, and gave him time for two or three years for the payment of his original debt. He made the advance more for the purpose of assisting the insolvent to carry on his business than for the purpose of securing the original debt which he owed him. That is the view which I take of it, and it is a reasonable one under the evidence. I think the party alleging this act to have been done in contravention of the Insolvent Act has totally failed to prove it, and I therefor concur with my learned brothers in saying that the appeal should be dismissed and the judgment of the court below confirmed.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nThe learned counsel for the appellant contended, that the affirmance of the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in this case would be equivalent to a reversal of the judgment of the same court in Davidson v. Ross, as reported in 24 Grant 22.\nThere is doubtless much said in the judgments of some of the learned judges, who delivered judgments in Davidson v. Ross, which, if necessary to be considered in the determination of this case, would, in my judgment, require much further argument and careful consideration before all that is there said could be adopted by this court, but those observations have no application to the present case, which proceeds solely upon the view taken in the court of the matter of fact, whether the mortgage was or not executed in contemplation of insolvency. The court was of opinion that it was not, and I do not see sufficient ground for dissenting from this opinion. Indeed the observations in Davidson v. Ross to which I have alluded do not seem to have been necessary for the determination of that case, which also proceeded upon the view taken by the learned judges of mere matters of fact. The deed impugned there was executed within thirty days preceding the insolvency attaching, and so under the Act had to be presumed to have been executed in contemplation of insolvency. Two of the learned judges were of opinion that the presumption raised by the Act could not be rebutted. Two others were of opinion that it could be, but was not in point of fact, so that the court was unanimously of opinion that the impugned deed was established to have been executed in contemplation of insolvency.\nThe learned Chief Justice was of opinion that the parties by whom the deed was executed were not debtors of the person in whose favor it was executed, in which case it would have been a deed executed in contemplation of insolvency and without any consideration whatever therefor; the other judges were of opinion that the parties who executed the deed were debtors of the person in whose favor it was executed, but then the consideration clearly was merely an old debt due to the person in whose favor it was executed, and the majority of the court was of opinion that there was no sufficient evidence of the deed having been executed under pressure, which was relied upon, although certainly they say that in their opinion pressure would make no difference, however great the pressure might be, as I read their judgment. Now, the facts thus established constituted precisely what according to the old law had always been known under the legal term of \"preferential assignment to a favored creditor,\" so that the observations of the learned judges who commented largely upon the meaning of the expression \"unjust preference\" as used in the act seem to be merely obiter dicta, the soundness of which will require consideration whenever a case shall arise presenting facts showing a sale or transfer \"by way of payment to a creditor\" (which is what the section deals with) which can with propriety be said to be \"unjust\" and a \"preference\" having any features which distinguish it from what independently of the statute has always been known under the name of \"preferential assignment\" to a favored creditor.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Rose, Macdonald, Merritt & Coatsworth.\nSolicitor for respondent: G.

Ritchie, Kt., C.J.; and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Taschereau, JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNS WICK.\nContract\u2014Sale of goods\u2014Payment\u2014Appropriation\u2014Non-suit.\nThe Albert Mining Co. (respondent) brought this action to recover for coal sold and delivered to appellants during the years 1866, 1867 and 1868.\nS. and M., and one McG. were partners carrying on business under the name of the Albertine Oil Company, the defendant S. furnishing the capital. The contract for the coal was made by S. who was a large stockholder in the plaintiff company and entitled to yearly dividends on his stock. The agreement, as proved by plaintiffs, was that S. purchased the coal for the Albertine Oil Company, the members of which he named, that the president of the plaintiff company told S. they would look to him for payment, as the other partners were poor; that the terms of sale were cash on delivery on board the vessels; and that S. agreed that the dividends payable to him on his stock should be applied in payment for the coal; that in consequence of this arrangement the plaintiffs credited the Albertine Oil Company, with the amount of S.'s dividends as they were declared from time to time down to August, 1866, leaving a balance of $912 due to S. It also appeared that the coal delivered was charged in the plaintiffs' books to the Albertine Oil Company, and that the bills of lading on the shipments of the coal were also made out in their name, and that some time afterwards a notice signed by S. and M., was given to the plaintiffs, complaining of the inferior quality of the coal, and claiming damages in consequence. In the latter part of the year 1868, S. repudiated the agreement to appropriate his dividends to the payment of coal, and refused to sign the receipts therefor in the plaintiffs' books. He had signed the receipt for the dividend of 1866. The present action was then brought (in 1873) against S. and M., the surviving partners of the Albertine Oil Company, McG. having died, to recover the value of the coal. S. shortly afterwards brought an action against the plaintiffs for the dividends; the claim was referred to arbitration and an award was made in favour of S. for upwards of $15,000, which the plaintiffs paid in July, 1874. The receipt given for the payment stated that it was in full satisfaction of the judgment in the suit of S. against the Albert Mining Company, and it appeared (though evidence of this was objected to in the present action) that it included the dividends for the years 1867 and 1868.\nThe learned judge before whom the action was tried, non-suited the plaintiffs, but the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia set aside the non-suit.\nHeld,\u2014(Reversing the judgment of the court below) Strong, J., dissenting, that there being clear evidence of the appropriation of S.'s dividends in pursuance of agreement made with him, and therefore of the plaintiffs having been paid for the coal in the manner and on the terms agreed on, the plaintiffs were properly non-suited.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, by which a rule to set aside a nonsuit was made absolute.\nThe facts of the case, as proved on the trial, appear in the judgment of the learned Chief Justice hereinafter given, and in the report of the case in the court below[1].\nMr. Weldon, Q.C., and Dr. Barker, Q.C., for appellants, referred to the following cases: Eyles v. Ellis[2]; Bodenham v. Purchas[3]; Hills v. Meynard[4]; Henderson v. Stobart[5]; Lyth v. Ault et al[6]; Cochrane v. Green[7]; Walter v. James[8].\nMr. Gilbert, Q.C., for respondents, referred to the following cases:\nGraves v. Key[9]; Lee v. Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Co.[10]; Farrar v. Hutchinson[11]; Skaife v. Jackson[12]; Wallace v. Kelsall[13].\nRITCHIE, C.J.:\nThis is an action for goods sold and delivered, tried before his honor Mr. Justice Weldon at the Circuit Court, St. John, May, 1881, when a nonsuit was ordered by the learned judge, and which nonsuit was subsequently set aside by the Supreme Court.\nThe facts of the case, as proved on the trial, are as follows:\nThe respondent company were the proprietors of coal mines near Hillsborough, Albert county. The appellant Spurr was a large stockholder in the company, and the company in 1866, and for several years afterwards, was paying large dividends.\nIn the early part of the year 1866 the appellants and one John McGrath, since deceased, formed an incorporated company which they called The Albertine Oil Company, to make oil from the coal mined by the respondents.\nMr. Henry Gilbert, the President of the Albert Mining Co., in his evidence, says:\nI am President of the Albert Mining; was so in 1866-7. I know Spurr, Moore and McGrath. The latter was living in 1866. Spurr, Moore and McGrath composed the Albertine Oil Co. Q. Had you in 1866, in March or April, conversation about coal in your office, and he (Spurr) wanted 3,000 for the Albertine Oil Co.? A. I asked who they were. He said he, McGrath and Moore in Spurr's Cove (or above the falls). He furnished capital and mill, and they did the work; Moore did the work, and McGrath sold the oil; he wanted that quantity for that year. We made up the order for coal. I agreed with him he should get it at $11 per ton; he agreed to that. In 1866, that it should be paid by the Oil Co. The next year the same. He wanted the same quantity for 1867. In August, 1867, the price of oil fell off. I went to Spurr's house at Chipman's Hill. The quantity was to be reduced to 2,000 tons; he had received some coal before that. I proposed to cancel. He would take 2,000, and the balance was cancelled. Nothing more said. Nothing said about price the second year. We sent him the bill of lading and an invoice; he was directed to do this. This was in 1866 and 1867, I directed Ketchum to ship on Spurr's order.\nCross-examined by Mr. Weldon\u2014\nHe was to pay cash on delivery\u2014put on board at Hillsboro'; free on board, and cash on delivery. I sold to Spurr on these terms. I told Spurr the others were poor, and I looked to him. He was to turn the dividend in his stock. He was a large stockholder, and his dividend was to go pay for the coal. That was the arrangement of the Oil Company. A dividend in 1864. He (Spurr) got his dividend, 7th August, 1864. Credited to Oil Company by Mr. Ellman. Spurr signed 4th Oct., 1866. Credited to Oil Co., 29th Nov., 1866, $5,760; 5th April, 1867, $3,040. Credited by Ellman to the Albertine Oil Company. Credited to the Albertine Oil Company, 26th Dec, 1867, $4,800, all carried to the Oil Company account. 10th August, 1868, credited to Albertine Oil Co. The Oil Co. paid. There would be $6,770 on this, leaving $900 due to Spurr.\nRe-examined, Tuck\u2014\nSpurr repudiated the dividend in 1868. He was off fishing in 1867. After 16th October, 1868, he disputed; I agreed to credit the dividends in June, 1866 and 1867, and he agreed to do so. After this, suit was commenced. That it was before this suit was commenced he repudiated; between 1868 and 1869 he repudiated, and would not sign the books for the dividend after that.\nI think the evidence shows clearly that the sale was to the Albertine Oil Company composed of Spurr, Moore & McGarth, and not to Spurr individually, though the fair inference is that this sale would not have been made had not the President of the Albert Mining Company considered Spurr a responsible party, and the partner on whose credit he especially relied for payment, though I can discover no indication whatever of any intention of relieving the other partners from liability. There is clear evidence that Spurr agreed that he would allow his dividends in the Albert Mining Company to be appropriated by that company in payment of the coal, and unless Spurr had made this arrangement, the fair inference is, I think, the coal, which appears to have been a cash article and the sale a cash transaction, that is, the dividends were to be appropriated and to be accepted as cash by the Albert Mining Company, would not have been furnished by the Albert Mining Company to the Albertine Oil Company.\nThe contract of sale having been made by Spurr on behalf of the Albertine Oil Company, it can hardly be presumed that Spurr did not communicate the terms of so all important a contract to his co-partners, and the liability of such co-partners would continue only until the coal was paid for in the manner and at the time stipulated by the agreement by virtue of which the purchase was made and the coal supplied.\nThe coal having been furnished and the dividends having been so appropriated in payment therefor, in my opinion, on such appropriation, the transaction between the Albert Mining Company and the Albertine Oil Company was closed in accordance with the terms of the arrangement on which the coal was bought and sold.\nThe agreement amounts to this, that for the coal supplied to and received by the Albertine Oil Company the appropriation of the dividends should be considered as payment, and places the parties in the same situation as if the dividends had been actually paid in money to Spurr by the Albert Mining Company and then returned by him to that company in payment for the coal therefore so soon as the Albert Mining Company under this agreement appropriated, by the authority of Spurr, the dividends to the payment of the coal, their claim against the oil company ceased in like manner. This is doing no more than treating that as a payment which the parties themselves have agreed should be so regarded.\nIn Spargo's case[14] James, L. J., said:\nIf there was on the one side a bon\u00e2 fide debt payable in money at once for the purchase of property, and on the other side a bon\u00e2 fide liability to pay money at once in shares, so that if bank notes had been handed from one side of the table to the other in payment of calls, they might legitimately have been handed back in payment for the property, there is no necessity that the formality should be gone through of the money being handed over and taken back; but that if the two demands are set off against each other the shares have been paid for in cash.\nMellish, L. J., said:\nIt is a general rule of law that in every case where the transaction resolves itself into the payment of money by A. to B., and then handing it back again by B. to A., if the parties meet together and agree to set the one demand against the other, they need not go through the form and ceremony of handing the money backwards and forwards.\nIf Spurr, after the coal was supplied and the dividends appropriated in payment thereof, attempted as a stockholder to claim payment of the dividends from the Albert Mining Company, the evidence in this case shows he would have been trying to obtain such payment after he had received satisfaction for the same, and no such claim could be successfully sustained, and any such claim, if made, should have been resisted by the Albert Mining Company. If Mr. Spurr has received the benefit of his dividends in paying for the coal and has since been paid the same dividends in cash, it is clear he has been twice paid. Whatever suspicions the evidence in this case may raise on this point, the record of the suit and award under which it is contended they were paid Spurr not being in evidence, and no evidence of the matter submitted to the arbitrators or of the proceedings before them, we have no sufficient legal evidence to show it unless from the items on which the award and judgment for $15,279.98 was based on the receipt given by Weldon in the evidence of Schofield on this point objected to, and which should have been rejected. But even if this was shown by satisfactory legal evidence, I do not see how it could affect this case, for the question we are now trying is not one between Spurr and the Albert Mining Company, as to whether he has or has not been paid twice over for his dividends; but the question is between the surviving partners of the Albertine Oil Company and the Albert Mining Company, and that is whether the Albert Mining Company have been paid for the coal supplied the Albertine Oil Company in the manner and on the terms agreed on.\nI cannot discover that there was any question to be submitted to the jury, such as the court below assumes, because there was clear uncontradicted evidence of an actual appropriation of the dividends, after the receipt of the coal by Spurr and his co-partners, whereby the co-partnership debt was paid and which payment, as against either the Albert Mining Company or his copartners, he could not legally repudiate.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nI have come to the conclusion that the judgment appealed from setting aside the non-suit and granting a new trial was right and ought not to be disturbed. Granting that the evidence objected to, shewing of what items the sum recovered by the judgment in favor of Spurr against the company was made up, was inadmissible, as it undoubtedly was, being a mere admission by Mr. Weldon, Spurr's attorney in the action, and therefore not binding on the other parties, or even on Spurr himself, it still appears to me that there was evidence to go to the jury.\nThere were two questions of fact to be tried\u2014the first being, who were the vendors under the contract made by Spurr with Mr. Gilbert, acting on behalf of the Albert Mining Company\u2014Spurr alone, or the partnership firm trading under the designation of the Albertine Oil Company; and secondly, in the event of the first issue being found for the plaintiff, payment, for although there does not appear to be any plea of payment in the record, the parties at the trial and the court below also seem to assume that the defence was admissible under the general issue.\nAs to the first issue\u2014it can scarcely be doubted that there was evidence for the jury, for although Mr. Gilbert says he told Spurr he should look to him for payment, yet this is not incompatible with the sale being to the firm, and the claim for damages, in respect of the inferior quality of the coal, afterwards put in by the Company, was at least an admission of their having been the purchasers, sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to have the case sent to the jury.\nThen, as regards payment, the burden of that issue was of course on the defendants, and they, no doubt, gave some evidence in support of it when they established by Mr. Gilbert, the president of the company, that Spurr \"was to turn the dividend on his stock; that he was a large stockholder, and his dividend was to go to pay for the coal.\" This, coupled with the further proof given by Mr. Schofield, that the dividends payable to Spurr were actually credited in the company's book to the Oil Company, made a prim\u00e2 facie case of payment. But, at most, these were facts for the consideration of the jury, and should not have been treated as conclusively showing payment for the following reasons:\nFirst, it was not proved by Mr. Gilbert that Spurr ever actually assented to the appropriation of his dividends which the company assumed to make. All that Mr. Gilbert says is, that he \"was to turn the dividends on his stock,\" thus rather implying that, though Spurr agreed to pay in this way, there was to be some further act or assent on his part, upon the application of the dividends to the debt for the coal was to be made. At all events the evidence was susceptible of such a construction, and that is sufficient for the purpose of shewing that the question was one of fact for the jury, and not one which the judge should have taken into his own hands to decide as he did by non-suiting. I need not say that the entry in the books of the company was not conclusive against the plaintiffs, it was quite open to explanation just as a receipt may be explained and shown to have been given under a misapprehension and without any actual payment. Further, it cannot possibly make any difference that the dividends were not paid over to Spurr until after this action was brought; the question is, had there been a payment at that date, and it is quite consistent with the facts that there had been no payment, that the dividends were still retained by the company, for if the jury, as judges of fact, should find that the plaintiffs were never authorized to apply the dividends in the way they had assumed to do without a further reference to Spurr, it was clear there was no payment, and that the dividends, although standing in the plaintiffs' books credited to the Oil Company, were still in the hands of the Albert Mining Company as so much money due by them to Spurr, which, if the purchasers of the coal were the partnership firm known as the Oil Company, they could not even set off against the amount due to them for the price of the coal.\nThe question was of course wholly one for the jury, but my own conclusion from the evidence would be that there never was any actual and completed appropriation of the dividends by Spurr, that there never was anything more than a promise by him to apply the dividends on the debt for the coal, some further authority being contemplated by him, before the company were to be entitled to charge him and credit the Oil Company with the profits payable to Spurr. I merely mention this, however, to show that there was a real substantial question of fact on the evidence which should have been left to the jury to try, and not of course with the view of now assuming to decide that question.\nFor these grounds, which are precisely the same as those assigned by the learned Chief Justice of New Brunswick, for the judgment of the majority of the court below, I think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER, J., concurred with Ritchie, C. J.\nHENRY, J.:\nThe bargain for this coal was made by the one company with the other. The evidence abundantly shows it. It was given under the express undertaking of Spurr to allow his dividends, as they arose, to go in payment of the coal. The terms of the company were cash, and it is not unreasonable to suppose they would not have accepted that arrangement as cash unless they made this stipulation originally. The first question is, \"Was this an undertaking of Spurr's for the Albertine Oil TASCHEREAU, J.:\nI have come to the same conclusion.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Delaney & Ostrom.\nSolicitors for respondents: Blake, Kerr, Lash & Cassels.\n[1] 22 N.

J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Taschereau, JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK.\nCharter Party\u2014Damage to ship\u2014Unavoidable delay\u2014Refusal of charterers to load\u2014Action by shipowners.\nBy a charter party of December 11th, 1878, it was agreed that plaintiff's vessel, then on her way to Shelburne, N.S., should proceed with all possible despatch, after her arrival at Shelburne, to St. John, and there load from the charterers a cargo of deals for Liverpool; and if the vessel did not arrive at Shelburne on or before 1st of January, 1879, the charterers were to be at liberty to cancel the charter party. The vessel arrived at Shelburne in December, and sailed at once for St. John. At the entrance of the harbor of St. John she got upon the rocks and was so badly damaged that it became necessary to put her on the blocks for repairs. Although she was repaired with all possible despatch, she was not ready to receive her cargo until 21st of April following, prior to which time\u2014on 26th March\u2014the charterers gave the owners notice that they would not furnish a cargo for her. The owners sued for breach of the charter party, and on the trial defendants gave evidence, subject to objection, that freights between St. John and Liverpool were usually much higher in winter than in summer; that lumber would depreciate in value by being wintered over at St. John, and also as to the relative value of lumber during the winter and in the spring in the Liverpool market; and it was contended that the time occupied in repairing the damage was unreasonable and had entirely frustrated the object of the voyage. The judge directed the jury that if the time occupied in getting the vessel off the rocks and repairing her was so long as to put an end, in a commercial sense, to the commercial speculation entered into by the shipowners and charterers, they should find for the defendants. The verdict being for the defendants, the court below made absolute a rule for a new trial.\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, it was\nHeld (affirming the judgment of the court a quo), that as there wag no condition precedent in the charter that the ship should be at St. John at any fixed date, and as the time taken in repairing the damage was not unreasonable, and the delay did not entirely frustrate the object of the voyage, the charterers were not justified in refusing to carry out the contract.\nAppeal from judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[1] making absolute a rule for new trial.\nThis was an action brought by the respondents, owners of a vessel called the \"Venice,\" against the charterers (appellants) for a breach of the charter party in refusing to load her. Plaintiffs, owners of the ship Venice, agreed with defendants by charter party dated 11th December, 1878, that the Venice should proceed with all possible despatch after arrival at Shelburne, N. S., to St. John, N. B., or so near thereunto as she may safely get, and there load from the charterers, their agents or assigns, a full and complete cargo (including deck load, if lawful and desired by the master), to consist of deals and battens, &c., and being so loaded should therewith proceed to Liverpool, Great Britain, discharging same and delivering same on being paid freight as follows:\nShould vessel not arrive at Shelburne on or before 1st January, 1879, charterers to have the privilege of cancelling this charter by giving Mr. Schofield notice to that effect next day; otherwise this charter to remain in full force and effect.\nFreight payable on deals, battens, and other sawn lumber on the intake measure of quantity delivered, and measuring charges, if any, to be borne by the charterer.\nCargo to be delivered alongside at St. John, N. B., at shippers' risk and expense.\n(The act of God and rulers, the Queen's enemies, fire and all and every other dangers and accidents of the seas, rivers and navigation, of whatever nature and kind soever, during the said voyage, always mutually excepted).\nCargo to be furnished at St. John, N. B., as fast as required by master, and twelve running days are to be allowed the merchant (if the ship be not sooner despatched) for discharging cargo.\nThe declaration alleged that:\nThe plaintiffs did all things necessary on their part to entitle them to have the agreed cargo loaded on board the said ship therein at St. John aforesaid, and that the time for so doing has elapsed, yet the defendants made default in loading the agreed cargo, and the plaintiffs claim ($2,000) two thousand dollars.\nDefendants pleaded a number of pleas inter alia:\n3. That the defendants were prevented from loading the said vessel by perils of the sea, which rendered the said ship or vessel unable to perform her intended voyage within a reasonable time after the making of the said charter party, and the said agreed voyage was rendered impossible and its object wholly frustrated. 7. That the said ship or vessel was so damaged and injured by perils of the sea as to be wholly unfit to perform the voyage intended by said charter party, and so long a space of time elapsed before she was repaired and ready to proceed on her said voyage that all benefit and advantage from said intended voyage was wholly lost to the said defendants, whereby the said defendants were released from the performance of their agreements in said charter party contained.\n9. That the said ship or vessel was by perils of the sea prevented from receiving her said intended cargo, and from proceeding on her said voyage for so long a time that the said intended cargo was becoming injured and damaged, and the said defendants were compelled, in order to prevent such damage, to ship the said cargo by another vessel; and the said defendants lost all benefit and advantage from said intended voyage, whereby they were discharged from the performance of their agreements in said charter party contained.\n10. That the said ship or vessel was by perils of the seas prevented from receiving her said intended cargo, and from proceeding on her said voyage for so long a time that defendants were compelled to remove said intended cargo from where it was stored, whereby they lost all advantage from said intended voyage; whereby they became released from the performance of their agreement in said charter party contained.\nVessel arrived at St. John about 19th December, got on rocks at mouth of harbour, and was not in a condition to receive cargo. The owners proceeded with all reasonable despatch to repair the vessel, but on the 26th March, her repairs not then being completed, the plaintiff addressed the following letter to the agent of the ship:\nSt. John, N. B., 26th March, 1879.\nS. Schofield, Esq., City.\nDear Sir,\u2014In consequence of the great delay in the performance of your part of the charter of the barquentine Venice, chartered by you to us under date 11th December, 1878, we hereby give you notice that we cannot supply cargo to said vessel, and consider the charter null and void.\nYour truly,\n(Signed), P. pro. Carvill, McKean & Co\nR. A. Macintyre. St. John, N. B., 26th March, 1879.\nMessrs. Carvill, McKean & Co., St. John.\nDear Sirs,\u2014In reply to your letter of this date, I have to inform you that there has been no delay in regard to the Venice, except what was the unavoidable result of her getting on shore in Courtenay Bay, in December last. She is yet undergoing repairs of the damage sustained at the time referred to, but as soon as the same are completed and the vessel is ready for loading, I shall notify you and demand the cargo which you agreed to ship by her.\nIn the meantime, I beg to inform you that I claim that the charter party made between us, and dated 11th December, 1878, is still in force and will continue to be so, until it is fulfilled or cancelled by mutual consent of both parties.\nYours truly, S. Schofield.\nSt. John, N.B., 21st April, 1879.\nMessrs. Carvill, McKean & Co., St. John:\nDear Sir,\u2014You will please take notice that the barquentine Venice, 625 tons register, is now fully repaired again, and in a loading berth at Walker's wharf, ready to receive and load the cargo for which she was chartered to you as per charter party, dated 11th December, 1878.\nThe cargo will be required at the rate of forty standard per day, commencing at once.\nYours truly,\nAdolf Beryman,\nMaster. S. Schofield,\nAgent for Owners.\nDefendants did not load the vessel; she was not ready to receive cargo until this demand was made.\nMr. Gilbert and Mr. Millidge for appellants:\nThe voyage contemplated and for which the Venice was chartered was a voyage carrying acargo of deals from Saint John to Liverpool, and there is an implied contract that she will commence that voyage within a reasonable time, which is not filled by a delay of nearly four months. And had there not been the clause excepting the perils of the seas, the charterers would have been entitled to an action against the owners for not being ready to take the cargo within a reasonable time. It is true they are protected by the clause excepting the perils of the seas, but this clause is a mutual agreement and enures to the benefit of both parties. The effect of it is as if the charterer had said to the ship owner, \"you have agreed to have your vessel ready to take in a cargo within a reasonable time, but if any of the excepted perils occur you will be released from the performance of your agreement by reason of such perils.\" And on the other hand it is a declaration or agreement made by the owner to the charterer: \"you have agreed to provide and load on board my ship a cargo to be ready on her arrival, but if by reason of any of the excepted perils I am unable to have my vessel ready to take your cargo within a reasonable time you will be released from the performance of your agreement to provide a cargo for my vessel, or in other words, if any of these contingencies against which we have provided occurs, we are mutually discharged from our agreements and the contract is at an end.\" It is a fair construction of the agreement that by making the excepting clause mutual the intention of both parties must have been that in the event of the contingencies provided against occurring, both parties should be discharged from the performance of their several agreements, the one from carrying a cargo, the other from providing a cargo to be carried.\nAssuming that the defendants are incorrect in their claim that the word mutual in the excepting clause enures to their benefit, on what principle is the contract to be construed?\nIt is scarcely within the range of probability that the idea that the vessel having arrived safely at Shelburne, within a day or two's voyage of Saint John, should have been wrecked and so damaged as to require four months to repair, ever entered into the contemplation of either of the parties to the contract. And it is not within the range of possibility that if it had occurred to them, that the defendants knowing the advantage of having their deals delivered at Liverpool in winter or early spring, knowing that the freight they were to pay was exceptionally high, and knowing that they were bound to clear their deals from where stored before the first of April, would have agreed that in case of such an accident the plaintiffs should have four months, or as much longer as might be necessary, to repair their vessel and still hold them bound to provide a cargo for her and at so exceptionally high rate of freight, or that the plaintiffs would have bound themselves to repair the vessel, no matter how great the damage short of total loss, at no matter how long it might take, as quick as possible, and hold her ready for the defendants to load, no matter what changes might take place in the freight market. The only reasonable provision any sane man on either side would have made, had such a contingency been presented to them, would be that in case of such a contingency occurring both parties should be discharged from the contract, and free to act as they deemed best.\nThe questions whether the delay was so unreasonable as to frustrate the whole object of the contemplated voyage, and whether the time of getting the ship repaired was so long as to put an end, in a commercial sense, to the commercial speculation entered into by the ship owners and the charterers, are questions of fact and not of law, were raised by the pleadings and fairly left by the learned judge (who tried the case) to the jury, and found by them in the affirmative.\nThe cases relied upon were the following: Geipel v. Smith[2]; Jackson v. Union Marine Insurance Co.[3]; Dahl v. Nelson[4]; Rankin v. Potter[5].\nMr. Weldon, Q.C., for respondents:\nIn the case of Jackson v. Union Marine Insurance Co. the jury found: 1. A constructive total loss of the ship, which however, was not approved of by the court, and the case was argued without that element in it; 2. That the time nesessary for getting the ship off and repairing her so as to be a cargo carrying ship was so long as to make it unreasonable for the charterers to supply the agreed cargo at the end of such time; and 3. That the time was so long as to put an end, in a commercial sense, to the commercial speculation entered upon by the shipowner and charterers; or, in other words, that the object of the voyage as contemplated and understood by the shipowner as well as the charterers\u2014that a specific cargo for a specific purpose should be carried from Newport to San Francisco, and where time was essential, was wholly frustrated.\nBut in this case the object of the voyage was not wholly frustrated. The mere speculation as to the rise and fall of the market, or of freight, or the ordinarily better state of a market at a particular time, is not the object of the voyage as contemplated between the parties, or the risk of which the shipowner agrees to run.\nThe case falls within the principle of the following cases:\u2014Tarrabochia v. Hickie[6]; Hurst v. Osborne[7]; McAndrew v. Chappell[8]; Chipsham v. Vertue[9]; Jones v. Holm[10]. See also the case of Dimeck v. Corlett[11].\nRITCHIE, C. J.:\nThe defendants' contention on this appeal is that the object of chartering was to have the cargo carried in winter, but that when the vessel was ready to receive cargo the time for a winter voyage had expired.\nThe only evidence we have in reference to a winter voyage, or the difference between a winter and a spring or summer voyage, is as follows:\nGeorge McKean.\u2014We entered into the charter party on 11th December; freights were high then. Cargo was ready on 1st January, 1879. It was lying at Miller & Woodman's mill. I left St John in February, 1879, for England. The vessel was not ready to receive the cargo before I left; had she been offered up to that time, I was ready with cargo to load her.\nQ.\u2014What would be the effect on the commercial value of that cargo of keeping it until April 21 for shipment? A.\u2014The cargo would be deteriorated by the action of the weather, and it would have had to be removed, as we were bound to clear the wharf for Miller & Woodman. We had bought the deals from Miller & Woodman, and agreed to clear the wharf to allow them to commence sawing by 1st April.\nQ.\u2014What would be the difference in value in Liverpool on those deals between the 1st February and 1st May? A.\u2014They had fallen in price fully 10s. a standard.\nQ.\u2014Is there any special advantage to the charterer to send to Liverpool a winter cargo as against a cargo arriving in the late spring or early summer? A.\u2014There is a very special advantage, because this is the only open port in the winter, and the cargo therefore will arrive on a bare market. Cargo arriving during the winter season can be sold from the quay, thus avoiding storage. Cargo leaving here in April will sometimes get in before cargo from gulf ports. Large number of ships from Miramichi and gulf ports get away by middle of May; but great part leave about 1st June.\nRobert A. McIntyre.\u2014Q. What would be the effect on the commercial value of that cargo, of keeping it until 21st April for shipment? A.\u2014The deals get stained, and thus depreciate in value; and new deals being mixed together, the cargo will not sell as well.\nQ.\u2014Is there any advantage to the shipper in sending forward an early winter cargo of deals from St. John to Liverpool, as against a similar cargo shipped as soon as she could possibly load on and after 21st April? A.\u2014I have been in Liverpool, but I have no personal knowledge of the deal trade, except what I have got from correspondence papers.\nWitness: A cargo shipped in winter is much more valuable than one in spring, because it goes in free from competition from other ports, and it is generally sold on arrival free from all stowage charges.\nThis evidence does not show that there is such a substantial difference between a winter and a spring voyage for deals from St. John to Liverpool, that while the one may reasonably be undertaken as a mercantile speculation, the other could only be a mercantile failure? On the contrary, the advantages put forward of a winter voyage from St. John, are that winter voyages from that port are exceptional, by reason of the open harbour of St. John, and that such voyages do not come into competition with the usual spring or summer voyages from other deal ports which are closed by ice in winter. Therefore, if a cargo from St. John, shipped in contemplation of arriving in Liverpool in the winter, does not reach that port until the spring, the voyage is not lost, the cargo is still at its destination in the due course of the deal trade, though possibly not under quite as favorable circumstances as if it had arrived earlier, and therefore is wholly unlike a fruit cargo or ice cargo, or a cargo to be delivered for a certain specific purpose, when the benefits of the voyage are entirely lost by delay.\nNothing whatever is said in the charter party of a winter voyage, nor is any time fixed within which the ship shall be ready to load and sail from St. John. I do not think there is any sufficient evidence to justify the conclusion that in entering into this charter both parties understood and agreed that it was confined to a winter voyage. Had such been the intention, it should have been so expressed in the charter party, and there is no implied contract that I can discover as to when the vessel should be ready to commence the voyage. The fact that it was stipulated that the vessel should be at Shelburne by a certain day, or, if not, that the charterers might elect to cancel the charter, would indicate that to this extent time was deemed of importance, and the charterers thus secured that in due course and without accident the ship would reach St. John and be in a position to take in cargo promptly; but the absence of any stipulation fixing the time when she should reach St. John, and be ready to load, would, in like manner, appear to indicate that if the vessel arrived at Shelburne within the time limited and proceeded from thence to St. John with all reasonable despatch, each party took upon themselves the risk of her arrival at St. John and of the period when she would be in a position to receive cargo and ready to sail. The parties not having expressly provided that unless the vessel was loaded and ready to sail by a specified day the charter party would be at an end, as was said in Dimeck v. Corlett[12], \"Courts ought to be slow to make such a stipulation for them,\" I think the question in this case is, was the delay so great as to destroy the voyage or merely to retard it?\nTo enable a charterer to put an end to the contract, the delay must be such as frustrates the object of voyage; in other words, the voyage both parties contemplated must have become impossible. In this case the time necessary to get the ship repaired so as to be a cargo carrying ship was not, in my opinion, so long as to put an end, in a commercial sense, to the commercial speculation entered into by the ship owners and charterers; a voyage, undertaken after the ship had been sufficiently repaired would not, in my opinion, have been a different voyage, either as to the port of loading and discharge, of a different adventure. I cannot discover anything to justify the conclusion that these charterers contemplated a winter voyage so as necessarily to raise an implied condition that the ship should be ready in time to receive the cargo for such a voyage, and so to make it a condition precedent, whereby, she not being so ready, the contract was put an end to.\nThe question therefore is: Did the voyage, by reason of the time lost, or delay caused by this accident, become a different voyage from that agreed for. In other words, did the delay deprive the charterers of the whole benefit of the contract, or entirely frustrate the object of the charterer in chartering the ship? If so, it is an answer to an action, for not loading the cargo[13]. But if the vessel was in a condition to be repaired, and it is evident she was, the repairing having been done with all reasonable despatch, the delay was nothing more than a temporary obstruction to the voyage, which did not enable either party to put an end to the contract. Had freights in the meantime largely risen, the ship owners could not, in my opinion, when the ship was repaired and ready to take in cargo on the 21st April, have refused to receive cargo from the charterers if offered on that day. If the liability to carry continued, the liability to ship likewise necessarily continued.\nThe observations of Bovill, C. J., in Jackson v. Union Marine Insurance Co.[14], strike me as so peculiarly applicable to this case, that I may be pardoned quoting them at length:\nUpon a charter party where the charterer does not stipulate for the arrival of the vessel by any particular date, the risk of her non-arrival, by reason of weather and the accidents of navigation, always rests with the charterer; and, where the stipulation is simply that the ship will proceed to the loading port with all convenient speed, the dangers of the sea excepted, the ship owner performs his part of the contract, and there is no breach of it by him, if without his default the arrival of the vessel is delayed only by the accidents and dangers of the sea, even although that delay may prevent the loading of the vessel at the usual time, or so as to be profitable to the charterer.\nThe law has no power to make a contract different from that which a person has entered into; and, where a shipowner does not agree that his vessel shall arrive at the loading port by any particular day, but only that she shall proceed there with all convenient speed, or, what the law would imply, that she shall proceed and arrive within a reasonable time, and expressly stipulates that this shall be subject to the dangers and accidents of the seas and navigation, I do not see how that exception is to be got rid of, or how a contract with such an exception can properly be construed as, or converted into, an absolute engagement on his part that his vessel shall proceed or arrive within a reasonable time, as if there were no exception. If the contract could be so treated, it must be equally open to the shipowner to put an end to it, and this in some cases might be productive of the greatest inconvenience to the charterer.\nI quite admit the great inconvenience and possible loss to both shipowner and charterer, when any serious delay is caused by the necessity for heavy repairs arising from sea perils; but the answer to such an argument, as it seems to me, is, that, if either party desires to protect himself from such risk or inconvenience, he should introduce stipulations into the contract with that object; and if, instead of doing so, both parties agree that the vessel is to proceed and load subject to the accidents of navigation, which they expressly except, I think it is not competent for either of them afterwards to claim to be absolved from his contract by reason of an accident of navigation which he has expressly agreed shall be excepted.\nI am of opinion this appeal should be dismissed.\nSTRONG, J.:\nI have had an opportunity of reading the judgment of the Chief Justice, and I entirely concur in his reasons given in this case.\nFOURNIER, J., concurred.\nHENRY, J.:\nAt the first blush of this case I was rather of the opinion that under the peculiar circumstances presented by the evidence, it was of importance that the provision that the vessel should be at Shelburne at a particular time (which is distant only a day or two sail from St John) was intended and understood by the parties to be a provision made to ensure reaching the winter markets by the shipping of the cargo at an early date. There is very little doubt on my mind that that was the intention of the parties, and that it was perfectly understood by them both; that the high price they agreed to pay for freight, which is higher in winter than in summer, and which the party is enabled to pay by the advantages which he secures by getting his lumber into Liverpool before the spring trade opens, which is shown to be of very great importance by the evidence fully shows this. And he who does not ship in time not only loses largely in price but loses also in the accommodation that he would otherwise receive in the docks at Liverpool. Taking these all together, I have no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that that was what the parties meant and understood, but then, as the learned Chief Justice has very well said, have they put that into their agreement? The words \"in reasonable time, dangers of the sea only excepted,\" only required the parties to be at the place when they possibly could under the exception, and if the shipowner is prevented by accident in navigation from arriving at port within what would otherwise be reasonable time, that may be set up as a reasonable excuse. There is no doubt there are exceptions to that rule in the case of ice and other perishable articles, where it is understood that the voyage is to be made at a certain season and the cargo would otherwise be useless. Fruit and ice come within that classification, and I thought at first that under the peculiar circumstances of this case, it might be brought under the rule applicable to them, but I find that it is not so, according to the agreement. The decisions all go to show that the parties must provide for it in the contract. That is not done here, and I am of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed. There is a case, however\u2014Jackson v. The Union Marine Ins. Co.[15]\u2014 which is a case of a shipment of iron. There the vessel was on her way to receive the iron, when she was wrecked. She was damaged in such a way that it took some time to repair her, and the parties suggested in one of their letters that time was of importance to them, because the rails were wanted for a railway about to be put in operation. There was no proof of that fact, however, given, and if that case really could be taken as law governing such transactions, then I would have felt bound to have given the benefit of that decision to the charterers in this case. I find, however, that is rather an exception, and that it is not in accordance with the general rule of law laid down as governing the contract. I must, therefore, reluctantly come to the conclusion that the contract was still in force when the owners of the ship offered her services to the charterers, and at the time when they refused to furnish a cargo.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\nI have come to the same conclusion, for the same reasons as the learned Chief Justice,\u2014to dismiss this appeal. I think it is better to adhere to the rule that if parties wish to protect themselves against accidents of this kind, they should say so in their contracts.\nGWYNNE, J., concurred.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: G.

Ritchie, Knt.; C.J., and Strong, Fournier, henry, Taschereau and Gwynne, JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nPromise of sale, Construction of\u2014Condition precedent\u2014Mise en demeure\u2014Arts. C. C. 1,022, 1,067, 1,478, 1,586, 1,537, 1,538, 1,550.\nOn the 7th December, 1874, T. G. by a promise of sale, agreed to sell a farm to D, M., then a minor, for $1,200 of which $500 were paid at the time, balance payable in seven yearly instalments of $100 each with interest at 7 per cent D. M. was to have immediate possession and to ratify the deed on becoming of age and to be entitled to a deed of sale, if instalments were paid as they became due, \" but if on the contrary D. M. fails, neglects, or refuses to make such payments when they come due, then said D. M. will forfeit all right he has by these presents to obtain a deed of sale of said herein mentioned farm and he will moreover forfeit all monies already paid, and which hereafter may be paid, which said monies will be considered as rent of said farm and these presents will then be considered as null and void and the parties will be considered as lessor and lessee.\"\nAfter D. M. became of age he left the country without ratifying the promise of sale, he paid none of the instalments which became due, and in 1879 T. G. regained possession of the farm. In October 1880 D. M. returned and tendered the balance of the price and claimed the farm.\nHeld,\u2014Reversing the judgment of the court below (Strong and Taschereau, JJ., dissenting,) that the condition precedent on which the promise of sale was made not having been complied with Within the time specified in the contract the contract and the law placed the plaintiff en demeure, and there was no necessity for any demand, the necessity for a demand being inconsistent with the terms of the contract, which immediately on the failure of the performance of the condition ipso facto changed the relation of the parties from vendor and vendee to lessor and lessee APPEAL from a judgment rendered by the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) ([1]) con-firming the judgment of the Superior Court in favor of the respondent.\nThis action Was to compel the appellant to granit to the respondent a deed of sale of a farm situate in the parish of St. Theodore, in compliance with a promise of sale made before Legris, a notary public on the 7th December, 1874.\nThe appellant pleaded, that the respondent had not fulfilled the conditions of the promise of sale which had thereby become inoperative. The Superior Court however, maintained the action and condemned the appellant to give to the respondent a deed of sale in due form and to deliver over to him the property claimed, and this judgment was affirmed with costs by the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench (appeal side).\nThe appeal is from this latter judgment.\nThe circumstances which have given rise to the suit are as follows:\nBy a deed passed before' Legris, a notary public, on the 7th December, 1874, the appellant promised to sell the farm in question in this cause to the respondent, then a minor, but assisted by Roderick McLennan, his father, who promised to have the transaction ratified by his son, when he should have attained the full age of twenty-one years.\nThis promise of sale was made for the sum Of $1,200, of which $500 were paid at the time, and as to the balance of $700, the respondent promised to pay it to the appellant in seven yearly consecutive payments of $100 each the first of which would fall due on the first day of October, 1875, with interest at the rate of seven per cent per annum, to reckon from the first day of October 1874. The deed contains the following provision, which has given rise to the present litigation:\nIt is especially covenanted and agreed upon between the said M parties hereto, that if the said Duncan McLennan makes regularly the said payments of one hundred dollars said currency, when they kill fall due respectively, together with the interest, till the full payment of said sum of seven hundred dollars, then and in that case the said Thomas Grange will be bound, as he doth hereby bind himself to give the said Duncan McLennan a free and clear deed of sale of said farm ; but on the contrary, if the said Duncan McLennan fails, neglects or refuses to make the said payments when they come due, then the said Duncan McLennan will forfeit all right he has by these presents to obtain a deed of sale of said herein mentioned farm, and he will moreover forfeit all monies already paid and which might hereafter be paid which said monies will be considered as rent of said farm, and these presents will then be considered as null and void and the parties hereto will be considered as lessor and lessee.\nAt the date of this promise of sale Roderick McLennan was living on the farm with the respondent and the other members of his family. The respondent became of age in the month of January, 1875, and con-tinned to live on the farm with his father for about a year after he had become of age. He then left to reside in the United States, and has not come to Lower Canada since, except once, on a visit of three or four days, in the fall of 1880.\nThe respondent never ratified the promise of sale, as he was bound to do, on his coming of age, and neither, he, nor his father Roderick McLennan, has paid to the appellant any portion of the principal and interest accrued on the balance of $700 due on the price stipulated in the said promise of sale. The appellant has moreover been obliged to pay the municipal and school taxes and the seigniorial charges due on said property\nAfter waiting for several years without receiving either principal or interest, the appellant sought to get back the possession of his property, and on the 6th day of May, 1879, Robert McLennan who was still in possession of it, and who, it seems, had furnished the $500 which had been paid to the appellant, when the promise of sale was passed, consented to resiliate the same and to give up to the appellant possession of the farm, on condition that he should be allowed to occupy the house till the 1st of November following (1879). A deed was passed to that effect.\nSubsequently, Robert McLennan, refused to give up the possession of the house, and the appellant obtained a judgment of ouster, and finally recovered the possession of the house also.\nIt was not till the 23rd of October 1880 after the appellant had been in possession of the farm for nearly eighteen months, and of the house for about a year, that a tender was made to him in the name of the respondent of the sum of $997311 as the balance in principal and interest of the price stipulated in the promise of sale of the 7th of December, 1874.\nThis tender was made through a notary, and was accompanied by a demand on the appellant to grant to the respondent a deed of sale in the terms of the promise of sale.\nThe appellant having refused to comply with this request, the respondent brought this action whereby he renewed his tender and claimed that the appellant be ordered to give a regular deed of sale of the property in question, and to deliver him the possession of the same.\nMr. Doutre, Q.C., and Mr. Joseph, for appellant, and Mr. Laflamme, Q. C., and Mr. Cross, for respondent.\nThe points and authorities relied on by counsel are reviewed in the judgments hereinafter given.\nRITCHIE, C. J.:\nI think that article 1478 which says that \" A promise of sale with tradition and actual possession is equiv-lent to sale,\" means that Where there is a contract of sale and tradition is made, and actual possession given with a view of there and then consummating such sale by such tradition and actual possession, such a contract of sale and such tradition is equivalent to a sale but not as in Noel v. Laverdure ([2]), where the contract provided that the tradition and actual possession should not be equivalent to the sale or as in this case where such an operation would be inconsistent with the stipulations of the contract of sale or as likewise in this case where a fair construction of the contract of sale leads to the irresistible inference that it was not the intention of the parties that actual possession should be equivalent to a sale in other words does not apply to such a case as this where the terms of the contract of sale show clearly that it was not the intention of the parties that the sale should be brought to a\" completion or considered a complete sale The tradition and actual possession in like manner as the contract of sale was, in my opinion, to be subject to the condition that if the payment\\s were not made, and conditions complied with, such tradition and actual possession was to be a tradition and possession not under the contract of sale but to be considered as the possession of a lessee holding under the vendor as lessor, for the contract expressly provides that:\u2014\n\"The said Duncan R. McLennan will take possession of said farm and appurtenances immediately, and will enjoy the same on the following conditions.\" That the tradition and actual possession only became such a tradition and actual possession as contemplated under Art. 1478 on fulfilment by the vendee of the conditions of the contract of sale that then and from thenceforth only was the tradition and actual possession such a tradition and actual possession as within the promise of sale would be equivalent to a sale ; in other words that until the conditions were fulfilled, the occupier of the property was in no better position than a tenant whether it was R. McLellan, on his own behalf, (for it would appear that the property was in reality bought for him, and, so far as paid for, paid for with his money) or on behalf of his son mentioned in the contract of sale as the vendee. On conditions being fulfilled the sale was then consummated and then for the first time the plaintiff became entitled to the property as his own or to claim a deed of sale. That it was not a real sale, subject to a revocatory condition, but to my mind, it was in every sense of the word a conditional sale, and until the conditions were complied with there was no intention that there should be a complete sale, or that the property should be transferred.\nThe authority from Aubry & Rau ([3]), cited by the learned Chief Justice in the court below, seems to cover the case:\nLa condition suspensive venant \u00e0 d\u00e9faillir, l'obligation et le droit qui y est corr\u00e9latif sont, ipso facto, \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer comme n'ayant jamais exist\u00e9. Ainsi, par exemple, l'acqu\u00e9reur qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en possession de la chose par lui acquise sous condition, serait oblig\u00e9 de-la restituer avec tous ces accessoires et avec les fruits qu'elle a produits.\nI therefore have come to the same conclusion as the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Appeals, viz., that the condition precedent on which the promise of sale was made, not having been complied with within the time specified in the contract, the contract and the law placed the plaintiff en demeure, and there was no necessity for any demand, the necessity for a demand being entirely inconsistent with the terms of the contract which immediately on the failure of the performance of the condition ipso facto changed the relation of the parties from vendor and vendee to lessor and lessee, and therefore the respondent not having fulfilled his obligation, is not in a position to insist on the appellant granting and executing to him a deed of the property in question, and therefore that this appeal should be allowed, the judgment of the court below reversed, and the action of the respondents dismissed.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nWas of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed for reasons given by Taschereau, J., in his judgment, with which he concurs.\nFOURNIER, J.\u2014\nL'action de l'Intim\u00e9 (demandeur en cour inf\u00e9rieure) \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur une promesse de vente en date du 7 d\u00e9cembre 1874 et avait pour but de forcer l'appelant \u00e0 lui livrer la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9e dans cette promesse de vente et de lui en passer titre, sinon que le jugement de la cour en tiendrait lieu.\nCette promesse de vente fut faite en consid\u00e9ration de la somme de $1,200, dont $500 furent pay\u00e9s comptant et la balance stipul\u00e9e payable \u00e0 raison de $100 par ann\u00e9e avec int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 sept p. c. Le demandeur \u00e9tait alors mineur, mais son p\u00e8re comparut a l'acte pour accepter pour lui. L'Intim\u00e9 s\u2019obligea de ratifier cet acte \u00e0 son \u00e2ge de majorit\u00e9.\nLe diff\u00e9rend qui s \u00e9l\u00e9ve entre les parties est au sujet de l'effet \u00e0 donner \u00e0 la clause suivante:\nIt is specially covenanted and agreed upon between the sail parties hereto, that if the said Duncan E. McLennan makes regularly the said payments of one hundred dollars said currency, when they will fall due respectively, together with the interest, till the full payment of said sum of seven hundred dollars, then and in that care the said Thomas Grange will be bound, as he doth hereby bind him* self to give to said Duncan R, McLennan a free and clear deed of sale of said farm ; but on the contrary, if the said Duncan JR. Mc Lennan fails, neglects, or refuses to make the said payments, when they came due, then the said Duncan R..McLennan will forfeit all right he has, by these presents, to obtain a deed of sale of said herein - mentioned farm, and he will moreover forfeit all monies already paid which might hereafter be paid, which said monies will be considered as rent of said farm, and these presents will then be considered null and void and then the parties hereto will be considered as lessor and lessee.\nLe jugement de la cour Sup\u00e9rieure, confirm\u00e9 par celui de la majorit\u00e9 de la cour du Banc de la Reine, a refuse de donner effet \u00e0 cette convention. Les principaux motifs de cette d\u00e9cision se trouvent dans les consid\u00e9rants du jugement prononce en cour Sup\u00e9rieure par l'honorable juge Papineau. Quant aux raisons du jugement de la majorit\u00e9 de la cour du Banc de la Reine, on ne les trouve ni dais les factums ni dans le dossier, qui ne contient que celles de l'honorable juge en chef sir A. A. Dorion qui diff\u00e9rait d'opinion.\nPour en arriver \u00e0 cette conclusion l'honorable juge Papineau para\u00eet s'\u00eatre fond\u00e9 sur les raisons suivantes: lo d\u00e9lai accord\u00e9 pour le paiement des sept cents piastres, balance due sur le prix convenu ; 20 que le d\u00e9fendeur (l'appelant) n'a jamais fait annuler la dite promesse de vente vis-\u00e0-vis du demandeur, (l'Intim\u00e9) ; 30 que le paiement de la dite balance du prix n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9.\nIl y a encore plusieurs autres consid\u00e9rants donn\u00e9s par l'honorable juge que je me dispense dindiquer ici, car je suis d'opinion, pour les raisons d\u00e9velopp\u00e9es dans les notes de l'honorable sir A. A. Dorion, qu'ils sont insuffisants pour soutenir ce jugement. Je ne m'arr\u00eaterai doncqu'\u00e0 ceux ci-dessus indiqu\u00e9s\nLa condition cit\u00e9e plus haut est-elle suspensive de l'effet de la promesse de vente jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l'accomplissement de la condition de paiement ? La peine de d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance stipul\u00e9e en cas de d\u00e9faut de paiement doit-elle avoir son effet de plein droit, sans autre mise en demeure que cello resultant de la convention et sans l'intervention des tribunaux ?\nCes deux questions n'en doivent faire qu'une seule, car, Si la convention doit en loi produire l'effet convenu, ii ne saurait \u00eatre question de mise en demeure et d'intervention des tribunaux\nLa pr\u00e9tention de l'Intim\u00e9 est que la promesse de vente dont ii s'agit ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 suivie de tradition et do possession, elle doit \u00eatre, en vertu de l'art. 1478 C.C., consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme \u00e9quivalente \u00e0 la vente, et no pouvait \u00eatre annul\u00e9e par un jugement pronon\u00e7ant d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance contre lui\nL'Appelant pr\u00e9tend an contraire quo cette promesse ne peut avoir d'effet qu'\u00e0 l'accomplissement des conditions de paiement, qu'\u00e0 d\u00e9fant de paiement la promesse do vente, en suspens jusque-l\u00e0, se trouve an\u00e9antie.\nComme le fait justement observer l'honorable juge-en-chef Dorion, l'art. 1478 ne pout aucunement appuyer la pr\u00e9tention de l'Intim\u00e9, que la promesse dont il s'agit ici \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 la vente. Car dans cet article il no s'agit quo d'une promesse de vente pure et simple, et non pas d'une promesse de vente accompagn\u00e9e do conditions sp\u00e9ciales. Ici les parties sont formellement convenues quo l'Intim\u00e9 n'aurait pas droit \u00e0 un titre de vente \u00e0 moins d'avoir pay\u00e9, aux termes convenus la balance des $700 sur le prix do vente et que dans le cas de non paiement la promesse do vente deviendrait nulle et so transformerait en un bail de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et que les $500 pay\u00e9es iraient en d\u00e9duction du loyer. Est-il possible on pr\u00e9sence d'une d\u00e9claration de volont\u00e9 aussi clairement formul\u00e9e, do pr\u00e9tendre que cette promesse est \u00e9quivalente \u00e0 la vente ? Los parties ont pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment dit le contraire ; elles ont effectivement dit: s'il n'y a pas do paiements, ii n'y aura pas do vente mais bail de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 on question. Il no pout pas, dans ce cas, y avoir do r\u00e9solution do cette promesse, parce que la condition n'ayant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 accomplie, la promesse n'a produit aucun effet. Aucun droit \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 nest pass\u00e9 \u00e0 l'Intim\u00e9, son occupation apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9faut de paiement devant \u00eatre continu\u00e9e \u00e0 titre de bail.\nCette transformation de la promesse de vente en un bail, ou d'un contrat en un autre peat se faire en vertu de l'article 1022 C.C.:\nLes contrats produisent des obligations et quelque fois ont pour effet do lib\u00e9rer do quelque autre contrat, ou do le modifier.\nC'est en vertu de ce principe que la Cour de Cassation a admis la validit\u00e9 dune condition par laquelle des parties en se mariant avaient stipul\u00e9 que la communaut\u00e9 de biens, limit\u00e9e par leur contrat de mariage, deviendrait une communaut\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 l'ouverture des successions respectives des p\u00e8res et m\u00e8res des contractants ([4]).\nQu'une promesse de vente puisse \u00eatre l\u00e9galement faite avec des conditions suspensives ou resolutoires, cela ne saurait \u00eatre mis en doute d'apr\u00e8s les autorit\u00e9s suivantes.\nCes autorit\u00e9s reconnaissent qu'une promesse de vente est susceptible des m\u00eames conditions que la vente.\nTroplong, ([5]) commentant l'art. 1589 du code Napol\u00e9on, dit:\nPuisque la promesse de vente est \u00e9quivallente \u00e0 la vente, ii faut dire qu'elle est susceptible des memos conditions suspensives et r\u00e9solutoires quo la vente. Il est m\u00eame assez ordinaire qu'elle soit conditionnelle.\nEt au n\u00ba 134 l'auteur ajoute:\nSi celui \u00e0 qui la promesse a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite no se pr\u00e9sente pas \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque indiqu\u00e9e pour passer contrat, il faut distinguer s'il y a un terme indiqu\u00e9 ou bien si la convention no porte pas de d\u00e9lai.\nDans le premier cas, la convention est r\u00e9solue do plein droit et le promettant est d\u00e9gag\u00e9.\nDans le second cas il faut suivre la marche quo nous avons trac\u00e9e au No 117. Pothier ([6]) dit:\nLes promesses do vendre se font do deux mani\u00e8res: Avec ou sans limitation do temps. Lorsque quelqu'un s'est oblig\u00e9 do vendre une chose dans un temps d\u00e9termin\u00e9, il est d\u00e9charg\u00e9 de plein droit do son obligation par le laps de temps.\nLaurent, ([7]) parlant do la promesse do vente conditionnelle. dit:\nLa promesse de vente peut-elle \u00eatre faite sous condition ? L'affirmative n'est pas douteuse: l'art. 1854 le dit do la vente, et la promesse bilat\u00e9rale vaut vente Il faut en dire autant do la promesse unilat\u00e9rale, elle forme aussi un contrat ; donc elle peut \u00eatre faite sans condition. On applique, dans ce cas, les principes qui r\u00e9gissent la condition\nLa promesse de vendre se trouve souvent ajout\u00e9e \u00e0 un bail comme promesse de vendre sans quo le preneur promette d'acheter; la promesse peut aussi \u00eatre bilat\u00e9rale, soit pure et simple, soit sous condition\nSi la promesse do vente \u00e9tait bilat\u00e9rale, et pure et simple, quoi-qu'ajourn\u00e9e \u00e0 la fin du bail, par exemple, il y aurait vente et translation de propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Partant l'indemnit\u00e9 (duo pour expropriation) appartiendrait \u00e0 l'acheteur. Mais que faut-il d\u00e9cider si la promesse est conditionnelle ? La vente conditionnelle no transf\u00e8re pas la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, tandis quo la vente \u00e0 terme la transf\u00e8re. Tout d\u00e9pondra donc do l'interpr\u00e9tation du contrat. Est il conditionnel, l'indemnit\u00e9 sera due, et l'acheteur no peut la r\u00e9clamer parce qu'il n'y a pas encore do vente.\nUne promesse de vente contenant des conditions analogues \u00e0 celle dont ii s'agit a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnue comme l\u00e9gale.\nDans la cause do Noel vs Laverdure ([8]) ii a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la condition dans une promesse de vente, memo suivie do possession',\u2014que telle promesse ne serait pas \u00e9quivalante \u00e0 la vente, \u00e9tait valable. Il y avait une convention sp\u00e9ciale \u00e0 cet effet afin d'\u00e9viter au cas de d\u00e9faut de paiement du prix, la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 et les frais d'une vente par le sh\u00e9rif. La l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 d'une pareille condition a \u00e9t\u00e9 admise.\nDans le cas actuel, la condition changeant la promesse de vente en un bail a aussi pour but d'\u00e9viter les frais de poursuite et d'expropriation. Il est plus facile et moins dispendieux d'expulser un locataire que de prendre une action en r\u00e9solution de promesse de vente pour rentrer en possession do sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9. L appelant avait int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 faire cette stipulation et ii avait le droit de la faire\nMais ici d'apr\u00e8s la nature de la condition il no peut pas y avoir n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de demander la r\u00e9solution, car il n'a pas exist\u00e9 d'obligation, la condition y faisant obstacle. Voici ce quo dit \u00e0 ce sujet Demolombe ([9]):\nLa condition vient-elle \u00e0 manquer?\nRien de plus simple.\nLe contrat est \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer do plein droit, ab initio comme s'il n'avait jamais exist\u00e9.\nQuod si sub conditione res venierit, del Paul, si quidem defecerit conditio, nulla est emptio, sicuti nec stipulatio. (L, 8 ff. De Perii et comm. rei vendit\u00e6.)\nD'o\u00f9 nos anciens ont d\u00e9duit cette maxime.\n\u201cActus conditionales, defectu conditione nihil est,\" 386. Le plus souvent quand la condition manque, tout est dit de plein droit comme nous venons de le remarquer, et ii n'y a rien \u00e0 faire de part ni d'autre. S'il \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9, par exception, que la chose qui faisait l'objet do l'obligation e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 livr\u00e9e au cr\u00e9ancier conditionnel, ii serait tenu de la rendre avec tous ses accessoires, et m\u00eame dans le cas, g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement aussi, avec les fruits qu'elle aurait produit ; car aucun contrat ne s'est form\u00e9, et il n'y a aucune cause d'o\u00f9 puisse r\u00e9sulter un appel juridique quelconque (comp. infra. Nos 409\u2014410. Toullier t. III, No 548 ; Zacharie, Aubry & Rau, t. III, p. 51 ; Bufnoir, p. 315.\nAubry & Rau ([10]) disent:\nLa condition suspensive venant \u00e0 d\u00e9faillir, l'obigation et le droit qui y est corr\u00e9latif, sont ipso facto, \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer comme n'ayant jamais exist\u00e9. Ainsi par exemple, lacqu\u00e9reur qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en possession de la chose par lui acquise sous condition, serait oblig\u00e9 de la restituer avec tous ces accessoires et avec les fruits qu'elle a produits.\nLarombi\u00e8re, vol. 2, p. 118, Nos 1, 2 et 3, or art. 1176 & 1177, C. N. et p. 120, No. 6. Laurent ([11]) dit:\nLes parties, en traitant sous conditions, font d\u00e9pendre l'obligation de l'accomplissement do la condition donc si la condition d\u00e9faillit, il n'y a pas d'obligation. D'ordinaire, les parties ne font aucun acte d'ex\u00e9cution tant que la condition est en suspens ; dans cens\u00e9s le contrat n'a jamais produit d'effet, les parties sont cens\u00e9es n'avoir jamais trait\u00e9. Si le cr\u00e9ancier avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en possession il devrait restituer la chose avec tout ce qu'il en a per\u00e7u.\nLes conditions impos\u00e9es par l'appelant sont aussi conformes \u00e0 l'article 1079 de notre code qui les permet en ces termes:\nL'obligation est conditionnelle lorsqu'on la fait d\u00e9pendre d'un \u00e9v\u00e9nement futur et incertain, soit en la suspendant jusqu'\u00e0 ce que l'\u00e9v\u00e9nement arrive, soit en la r\u00e9siliant, selon que l'\u00e9v\u00e9nement arrive ou n'arrive pas.\nLa condition stipul\u00e9e par l'Appelant suspend l'ex\u00e9cution de la promesse jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'il y ait en paiement ; en cons\u00e9quence, il ne peut pas y avoir r\u00e9siliation parce qu'il n'y a pas en d'obligation. C'est en consid\u00e9rant la condition dont ii s'agit non comme suspensive, mais simplement comme r\u00e9solutoire d'une obligation compl\u00e8te que la Cour du Banc de la Reine a cru devoir faire application, au cas actuel, des principes concernant la r\u00e9solution des contrats en France, mati\u00e8re sur laquelle il existe une difference notable entre notre code et celui de France.\nOn peut encore citer comme s'appliquant \u00e9galement \u00e0 l'effet de la condition suspensive, ce que Laurent ([12]) dit au sujet do la condition r\u00e9solutoire expresse:\nCe qui la caract\u00e9rise et la distingue do la condition r\u00e9solutoire tacite dont nous parierons plus loin, c'est qu'elle op\u00e8re do plein droit. En effet, l'art. 1183 dit quo la condition r\u00e9solutoire expresse \"op\u00e8re la r\u00e9vocation do l'obligation.\" La loi n'ajoute pas que la r\u00e9vocation se fait do plein droit, mass c'est bien l\u00e0 le sons des expressions qu'elle emploie ; c'est le seul accomplissement do la condition qui r\u00e9sout le contrat, il no faut pas autre chose, ni commation, ni demande judiciaire. La raison en est tr\u00e8s simple: c'est quo telle est la volont\u00e9 des parties contractantes formellement exprim\u00e9e. et la volont\u00e9 des parties fait bien loi (art. 1134). Voir aussi les Nos 115,117,118.\nJe citerai encore du m\u00eame auteur au sujet de la condition r\u00e9solutoire son opinion sur l'effet de cette condition. Elle doit avoir d'autant plus d'importance dans son application \u00e0 l'effet de la condition suspensive que l'auteur dit que la condition r\u00e9solutoire implique une condition suspensive ; l'acheteur sous condition r\u00e9solutoire, dit-il, est d\u00e9biteur sous condition suspensive.\nAu No. 129, m\u00eame volume, Laurent dit encore:\nSi la condition r\u00e9solutoire stipul\u00e9e par les parties op\u00e8re do plein droit c'est que telle est leur volont\u00e9 et leur volont\u00e9 tient lieu de loi\nApr\u00e8s avoir donn\u00e9 les raisons pour lesquelles dans le cas de la condition r\u00e9solutoire tacite ii n'en est pas de m\u00eame, l'auteur continue au No. 130 les d\u00e9veloppements sur l'effet de la condition r\u00e9solutoire expresse:\nDe l\u00e0 suit que dans le cas do r\u00e9solution expresse, le juge r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement n'intervient point. C'est le contrat qui d'avance a prononc\u00e9 la r\u00e9solution si tel \u00e9v\u00e9nement arrive ; des l'instant o\u00f9 la condition s'accomplit, le contrat est r\u00e9solu, Il n'y a rien \u00e0 demander, il n'y a donc pas d'action \u00e0 intenter. Quant ii y a une contestation sur le point do savoir si r\u00e9ellement la condition s'est accomplie telle quo les partie l'avaient stipul\u00e9e le d\u00e9bat doit naturellement \u00eatre porte devant les tribunaux, mais la seule question que le juge aura \u00e0 d\u00e9cider, c'est la question de fait. Ce n'est pas lui qui prononcera la r\u00e9solution, il se bornera \u00e0 d\u00e9clarer que la condition \u00e9tant accomplie, le contrat est r\u00e9solu en vertu do la volont\u00e9 des parties contractantes. Le juge n'aurait m\u00eame pas besoin de faire cette d\u00e9claration, il suff\u00eet qu'il soit constat\u00e9 que la condition s'est r\u00e9alis\u00e9e ; des lors la volont\u00e9 des parties re\u00e7oit son ex\u00e9cution et le contrat est r\u00e9solu A. plus forte raison le juge ne peut-il pas d\u00e9cider quo le contrat no sera pas r\u00e9solu quoique la condition r\u00e9solutoire soit accomplie. Ce serait violer l'art. 1134 d'apr\u00e8s lequel la convention tient lieu de loi, et cette loi oblige le juge aussi bien que les parties contractantes\nAu No. 151 le m\u00eame auteur dit encore:\nLa condition r\u00e9solutoire expresse no donne pas lieu \u00e0 une action en r\u00e9solution, puisque le contrat est r\u00e9solu de plein droit en vertu du contrat m\u00eame. Il peut seulement y avoir lieu entre les parties \u00e0 des demandes en restitution.\nD'apr\u00e8s ces autorit\u00e9s il est clair que ni la mise en demeure ni l'action en r\u00e9solution ne sont n\u00e9cessaires pour faire produire \u00e0 la condition r\u00e9solutoire les cons\u00e9quences dont les parties sont convenues. A plus forte raison en doit-il \u00eatre de m\u00eame dans le cas de la condition suspensive ou il n'a pas exist\u00e9 d'obligation.\nAinsi que l'a observ\u00e9 l'hon. juge en chef Dorion, avant la publication de notre code civil les tribunaux ne donnait pas \u00e0 ces conditions leur plein et entier effet. Ils avaient pour habitude de les modifier suivant certaines r\u00e8gles d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9, dont ils faisaient application suivant les circonstances de la cause. Toutefois, m\u00eame avant le code, la jurisprudence \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard avait \u00e9t\u00e9 chang\u00e9e par un jugement du 30 septembre 1854, dans la cause de Richard vs. La Fabrique de Notre-Dame de Qu\u00e9bec, ([13]) rendu par la Jour du Banc de la Reine, alors pr\u00e9sid\u00e9e par sir L. N. Lafontaine, Bart., juge en chef, et compos\u00e9e des juges Panet, Aylwin, et C. Mondelet ; dans cette cause il fut d\u00e9cid\u00e9 \" que dans un bail d'un bane dans une \u00e9glise, par laquelle ii est stipul\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 d\u00e9faut de paiement du loyer aux termes et \u00e9poques fixes, des lors et \u00e0 l'expiration des dits termes le dit bail sera et demeurera nul et r\u00e9solu de plein droit, et que le bailleur rentrera en possession du dit bane, et pourra proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une nouvelle adjudication d'icelui, sans \u00eatre tenu de donner aucun avis ou assignation au preneur, n'est pas une clause qui doit \u00eatre r\u00e9put\u00e9e comminatoire, mais qui doit avoir son effet.\" D'apr\u00e8s le rapport de cette cause, un des arguments, de l'honorable juge Duval, qui prit part au jugement, en premi\u00e8re instance, est rapport\u00e9 comme suit:\nThe rule, in relation to this matter, is that parties to contracts have a right to insert in such contracts all clauses or conditions which are not cotra bonos mores, or against law. Such being the rule it is difficult to understand, as it has been pretended by the Plaintiff, why this covenant should not be enforced.\nL'hon. juge Meredith, actuellement juge en chef de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, apr\u00e8s avoir cite les remarques de Toullier an sujet du refus des tribunaux de donner effet aux conditions r\u00e9solutoires, dit:\nThis jurisprudence has been condemned as arbitrary and unjust by our most eminent jurists ; and I have no hesitation in saying that I think it so.\nIl cite \u00e0 l'appui de son opinion un grand nombre d'autorit\u00e9s auxquelles je r\u00e9f\u00e8re.\nLe principe sanctionn\u00e9 parce jugement re\u00e7ut l'approbation des codificateurs de notre code civil comme on peut s'en convaincre par les remarques suivantes que l'on trouve dans leur premier rapport, p. 19, (1865).\nLes inconv\u00e9nients qui r\u00e9sultent do Ia r\u00e8gle qui regarde certaines clauses des contrats comme seulment comminatoires et cons\u00e9quemment ne devant pas \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9es, sont indubitables et se pr\u00e9sentent chaque jour. Sous la jurisprudence qui s'\u00e9tait form\u00e9e, les tribunaux modifiaient les stipulations des contrats, ou sans en tenir compte, substituaient, \u00e0 la volont\u00e9 \u00e9crite des parties, une \u00e9quit\u00e9 douteuse pour ajuster leurs droits. Dans ce pays cette intervention n'a peut-\u00eatre pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pouss\u00e9e aussi loin, mass en principe elle est \u00e9galement sujette \u00e0 objection, et quoique soutenue do l'autorit\u00e9 de Dumoulin et do Pothier, elle ne para\u00eet pas devoir son origine au code Justinien, ni justifi\u00e9e par aucune l\u00e9gislation positive do la France. Les raisons donn\u00e9es par les deux \u00e9minents jurisconsultes sont certainement peu satisfaisantes. Toullier qui discute la question au long, d\u00e9clare quo les tribunaux se sont arrog\u00e9 ce pouvoir qui, par la suite, est pass\u00e9 en usage. Quoi qu'il en soit, ii est certain quo la doctrine de l'intervention judiciaire alors quo le sens du contrat est clair, est d\u00e9sapprouv\u00e9e par les juristes modernes. Deux des commissaires sont d'opinion do sugg\u00e9rer Un changement de la loi en force par projet d'amendement soumis. De l'autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, M. le commissaire Morin croit plus s\u00fbr et plus \u00e9quitable de s'en tenir \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle en force. En cons\u00e9quence le sujet est respectueusement soumis.\"\nLa l\u00e9gislature a adopt\u00e9 la suggestion de la majorit\u00e9 des commissaires. Mais on fait observer que cet article n'est pasindiqu\u00e9 dans le code comme \u00e9tablissant un droit nouveau. La raison en est claire c'est que les codificateurs eux-m\u00eames n'ont consid\u00e9r\u00e9 l'usage \u00e9tabli par les cours que comme un abus contre lequel ils se sont prononc\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant contraire \u00e0 la loi. Ce qu\u2019ils ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 c'est que la loi pr\u00e9vaudrait contre l'usage des cours. Lorsqu'ils ont fait cette d\u00e9claration l'usage \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 r\u00e9pudi\u00e9 par le jugement de la cour du Banc de la Reine. Il s'agit donc dans cette cause de consacrer un principe d\u00e9j\u00e0 admis.\nOn pr\u00e9tend aussi que la condition, soit suspensive soit r\u00e9solutoire, ne peut produire son effet qu'apr\u00e8s la mise en demeure. La r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette objection est d\u00e9j\u00e0 donn\u00e9e par l'autorit\u00e9 cit\u00e9e plus haut de Laurent. J'ajouterai celle de Merlin ([14]).\nSuivant les principes du droit romain, d\u00e8s Qu'une obligation renferme un terme pr\u00e9cis, on est oblig\u00e9 d'y satisfaire, sans qu'il soit besoin a ce sujet d'aucune sommation: mais dans nos usages, il en est autrement: un d\u00e9biteur n'est exactement en retard ou en demeure de payer, de donner ou faire ce qu'il doit, que du jour qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 judiciairement interpell\u00e9 \u00e0 cet effet, \u00e0 moins qu'il n'y ait \u00e0 cet \u00e9gar\u00e2t par la convention unc stipulation pr\u00e9cise qu'une telle obligation se remplira dans un tel temps, auquel car la stipulation faisant une partie essentielle de la convention, on ne peut y manquer sans encourir la peine attach\u00e9e au retard que l'on met \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cuter.\nIl est \u00e9vident qu'en pareil cas la mise en demeure r\u00e9sulte du caract\u00e8re m\u00eame de la stipulation,\u2014ou que le d\u00e9biteur v a renonc\u00e9 en adoptant une condition qui la rend impossible. En effet dans le cas actuel, McLennan avait d\u00e9lai jusqu'au ler octobre pour faire le premier des sept paiements qui lui restaient \u00e0 faire. En vertu de l'art. 1090 C. C. \"ce qui n'est d\u00fb qu'\u00e0 ferme ne peut \u00eatre exig\u00e9 avant l'\u00e9ch\u00e9ance.'' Donc, jusqu'au ler octobre, l'Appellant n'avait rien \u00e0 demander ; mais le lendemain la d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance \u00e9tant arriv\u00e9e quelle mise en demeure pouvait-il faire ? Demander paiement c'e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 renoncer an b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de la d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance. Lui demander de r\u00e9silier la promesse de vente ? Elle l'\u00e9tait par l'effet de la convention. Il n'y avait donc qu'\u00e0 demander possession de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, et an cas de refus la contestation, comme le dit Laurent, ne devait reposer que sur la question du fait de savoir si la condition a \u00e9t\u00e9 accomplie ou non. La mise en demeure dans ce cas n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire,\u2014si elle l'\u00e9tait, elle a en lien en vertu de l'art. 1067. \" Le d\u00e9biteur, dit cet article, peut \u00eatre constitu\u00e9 en demeure soit par les termes m\u00eames du contrat, lorsqu'il contient une stipulation pue le seul \u00e9coulement du temps pour l'accomplir aura cet effet.\" C'est ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu entre les parties de la mani\u00e8re la plus claire et la plus positive. Cette mise en demeure est suffisante p\u00f3ur pouvoir exiger l'ex\u00e9cution du contrat. Demolombe, en parlant de la mise en demeure lorsqu'on vent exiger non pas l'ex\u00e9cution du contrat, mais des dommages et int\u00e9r\u00eats r\u00e9sultant de sa non-ex\u00e9cution, dit: ([15])\nD'autre part, si le d\u00e9biteur doit \u00eatre constitu\u00e9 en demeure c'est parce que le silence du cr\u00e9ancier peut l'autoriser \u00e0 croire quo celui-ci \u00e0 consenti tacitement \u00e0 lui accorder ce d\u00e9lai: telle est. Avons-nous dit, la pr\u00e9somption du l\u00e9gislateur.\nLa convention dont ii s'agit repousse tonte id\u00e9e d'une pr\u00e9somption accordant in d\u00e9lai\u2014puisqu'ii est stipul\u00e9 que l'obligation sera imm\u00e9diatement an\u00e9antie et transform\u00e9e en in bail.\"\nPour mieux \u00e9tablir la proposition que la mise en demeure n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire dans le cas de stipulation expresse de r\u00e9solution, je citerai encore in arr\u00eat de la cour de Cassation que l'on trouve dans Dalloz ([16]).\nLes art. 1184 et 1244 C. Nap., qui permettent aux tribunaux d'accorder un d\u00e9lai au d\u00e9biteur contre lequel soit la r\u00e9solution soit l'ex\u00e9cution d'un contrat sont demand\u00e9es, no sont point applicables au cas o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 stipul\u00e9 que la r\u00e9solution du contrat aurait lieu de plein droit dans les formes et apr\u00e8s les d\u00e9lais convenus entre les parties. De Paraza, 254.\nD'apr\u00e8s les autorit\u00e9s et les d\u00e9cisions ci dessus cit\u00e9es ii r\u00e9sulte bien clairement que les motifs adopt\u00e9s par ] l'honorable juge Papineau fondes sur le terme de paiement la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de la mise en demeure et de l'intervention des tribunaux ne sont pas fond\u00e9s et qu'une condition expresse de la nature de celle dont il s'agit doit avoir son effet de plein droit sans aucune mise en demeure et sans l'intervention des tribunaux.\nIl a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9 et discut\u00e9 plusieurs autres questions, mais \u00e9tant d'avis que le d\u00e9faut d'accomplissement des conditions express\u00e9ment stipul\u00e9es a eu pour effet d'an\u00e9antir la promesse de vente il serait tout \u00e0 fait inutile de les examiner. D'ailleurs, sur les questions incidentes, comme sur la question principale, je concours pleinement dans les raisons donn\u00e9es dans son jugement sur cette cause par Sir A. A. Dorion, J.C. En cons\u00e9quence, pour les raisons qu'il a si habilement d\u00e9velopp\u00e9es et pour les motifs ci-dessus expos\u00e9s, je suis d'opinion que l'appel devrait \u00eatre allou\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nHenry, J.:\u2014\nThe only difficulty that presented itself to my mind in the argument on this case Was the objection presented as to mis en demeure. On looking at the authorities I have come to the conclusion that that proceeding was unnecessary. The parties themselves provided by their agreement, one to sell for a certain sum of money the land to the other by paying so much down and the balance by instalments, and there was a provision in the agreement that if he did not meet these installments he should become the lessee of the party who sold the land, and, not only that, but he should forfeit the amount he had already paid. If the matter stopped there, possibly the party might find a necessity to resort to legal proceedings, but the plaintiff himself went to the United States and I believe only lately returned. This agreement was entered into six or seven years ago. The father paid the money and was the real party to the transaction, but the contract was made out in the name of the son. The son being away the father went into possession, and after being in possession and failing to make any payment he became the actual tenant of the party who sold the land, and, after remaining some time in possession, an action for ejectment was brought against him, and he was dispossessed. It appears to me all these proceedings, the agreement of the parties and all that was done afterwards are sufficient to satisfy any reasonable mind that there was no necessity for taking any proceedings to put this party in default. The son went away and left the father in possession and never looked after the property since ; the father enters into all these arrangements and afterwards he becomes a tenant. Six or seven years afterwards the son says ', \" You did not put me en demeure and therefore at the end of this time I will come and offer you the amount that was due and simple interest.\" It would be an act of injustice to require the party to take simple interest for his money and lose the opportunity of investing these amounts as they became due. I should say under the circumstances it was not even an equitable offer. I think if he came into any English court and claimed specific performance of the agreement, it would be a matter the court would take into consideration if they at all allowed him to set that as a case against the party. They would say to him: \" No you have not paid this as you should have done by instalments, and if you ask us to enforce this agreement, we will enforce the adoption of equitable principles, and not only payment of simple interest but interest on each instalment as it fell due.\" Under the circumstances I do not see any equity in favour of the respondent in this case ; the equities are all in favour of the appellant, and besides that, this was simply a., conditional sale, a sale to be fully effected only on the full payment of all the instalments. The party having allowed himself to be put out of possession, I do not think he has a right to come in at this time and ask the other party to give him specific performance of the contract.\nTASCHEREAU, J:\nI am f opinion to dismiss this appeal for the reasons contained in the consid\u00e9rants of the judgment of the Superior Court, whose judgment was confirmed by the Court of Appeal, upon these same reasons, I presume as we have no notes (in the case) from the learned judges of that court who formed the majority.\nThat there was a sale by Grange to McLennan can admit of no doubt. There was res, pretium, and consensus. There was the translation of the actual possession and such a complete transfer to McLennan of a full title and of all rights to that property that McLennan gave upon it, and Grange accepted, a mortgage for the security of the balance due on the price of sale\nThis sale was unaccompanied with a clause r\u00e9solutoire\u2014in default of payment at the dates agreed upon\u2014not at all in default of ratification by McLennan, when he would become of age as has been said. This would however, be immaterial, as McLennan did in fact ratify the said purchase by his continuing to keep the property sold to him, when a few weeks after this deed he became of age, and as fully as possible, though impliedly only.\nSir A. A. Dorion the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Queen's Bench, who dissented from the judgment says: The parties have in effect declared that until the respondent should pay the $700 remaining on the stipulated price of sale, he should be the tenant of the appellant, and the $500 paid should be taken in payment of the rent, and that if the balance of $700 and interest was regularly paid as the several instalments became due, the respondent should then be entitled to claim a deed of sale of the property leased.\nWith greatest deference for the learned Chief Justice whose opinions have always such weight, I think that this is a mis-interpretation of the contract between the parties. How can it be said that they in effect declared. that McLennan would be only a tenant until he raid the balance of the stipulated price of sale, when by the very deed McLennan gives and Grange accepts a mortgage on that property for that balance of the price of sale ? Grange evidently could not take a mortgage on the property if the title of that property had continued to be vested in him, and the fact that he accepts a mortgage from McLennan upon that same property is to me the most complete evidence that he then and there divested himself in favour of McLennan of the title to it.\nThen, as to that clause stipulating forfeiture of the payments made and a lease, in default of the payments to be made. For how long was that lease to be ? There is nothing in the deed about it. Could Grange have taken advantage of this to elect McLennan from the ground, when he failed to make the first payment\u2014not a year after the deed\u2014and yet keep the $500 paid thus getting a yearly rent of $500 for a property he sold for $1,200. I believe not ; yet this is what he really contends for.\nThen, suppose McLennan had paid $1,100, that is to say all the instalments up to the last but had failed to make this last one can Grange contend that he could have kept these $1,100 and yet consider McLennan as his tenant, and eject him at his, Grange's, will, as no length for the lease is fixed? Keep both the $1100 and the land ? I say, undoubtedly, no. Yet, that is what his propositions would inevitably lead to.\nThis deed is, as I have said, nothing else but a deed of sale with a clause resolutoire in default of payment And, it being so, an action was necessary to have the dissolution of the said deed declared. The code has made no changes in the old law on this point, arts. 1536, 1537, 1538, 1550. it has, as new law decreed that a special stipulation as to dissolution for non-payment is necessary ; it has made changes as to prescription of action in such cases. It has also decreed, as new law that the stipulation is not to be considered as comminatory, but that the judgment of dissolution is pronounced at once, adding that: \"Nevertheless the buyer \" may pay the price with interest and costs at any time before the rendering of the judgment.\"' Meaning clearly that though the dissolution had been stipulated though the date fixed for the payment has lapsed, though the vendee had not paid, though even the vendor has taken an action to have the sale dissolved yet the vendee at any time, before judgment on the action, can go up to the vendor and force him to accept the price of sale, and so relieve himself from the stipulated consequences of his default.\nAnd adds art. 1550 (as new law), \" If the seller fail to bring a suit for the enforcement of his right of dissolution within the stipulated term, the buyer remains absolute owner of the thing sold \" ([17]). So that here by an express provision of the code, Grange having failed to bring a suit for the dissolution of the sale McLennan remained so far absolute owner of the property sold.\nBut, says the appellant, by the very terms of the deed no summons of any kind was necessary, and McLennan was en demeure by the very terms of the Act: Art. 1067 C. C.\nThis cannot help the appellant. The price here was gr\u00e9vable and non portable, that is to say, payable at McLennan's domicile, art. 1152 C. C, (and at date of first payment, he was in the country.)\nOr, dans ce dernier cas, (says Demolombe) ([18]), il ne suffit pas pour quo le d\u00e9biteur soit constitu\u00e9 en demeure qu'il existe contre lui une des trois causes, desquelles nous venons de dire quo la mise en demeure peut r\u00e9sulter: soit un texte de la loi soit une clause do la convention soit une sommation. Il faut un autre quo le cr\u00e9ancier constate, par une sommation, ou autre acte \u00e9quivalent, qu'il s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au domicile du d\u00e9biteur. La convention porte, par exemple, que le d\u00e9biteur sera, de plein droit, constitu\u00e9 en demeure par la seule \u00e9ch\u00e9ance du terme, et sans qu'il ait besoin de sommation. Eh bien ! le d\u00e9biteur no sera en demeure, par la seule \u00e9ch\u00e9ance du terme, des quo 'a dette \u00e9tait gr\u00e9vable.\nAnd all the authors agree on this.\nSo that, even taking the appellant's own interpretatation of this deed as to this the respondent was never legally put en demeure to pay the amount of his purchase. Of course, that the payment of it is a condition precedent to his getting a full deed, he does not deny. He has offered the full amount before instituting his action and even before it was all due, and has deposited it in court. If the appellant had taken an action to have this sale dissolved, the respondent would clearly, according to the code, have been in time, at any period of the case before judgment, to pay the price of sale and prevent the dissolution. Because he paid before the appellant instituted any action at all, the appellant would have us declare that he is too late. With the two courts below I cannot reach that conclusion.\nThen art. 1184 of the code Napoleon, expressly enacts that the party who has to complain of the default by the other party to fulfil his engagements has the choice either to demand a specific performance of the obligation, if possible, or that the contract be dissolved ; but that the dissolution must be asked by an action in justice. That is what art. 1065 of our code expressly (except as to the last part) says, and the Codifiers say ([19]), that they have not expressly re-enacted this art. 1184 of the code Napoleon because its enactments, so far as consistent with other articles of our code are contained in this art. 1065 of our own code.\nAnd though, under art. 1088 with us as in France under art. 1183 a resolutive condition effects of right, when accomplished, the dissolution of the contract, yet, when this condition depends on the act of one of the parties,\nOn no peut exercer le droit r\u00e9sultant de la condition, qu'en le faisant ordonner par le juge, parce qu'alors elle tient do la clause p\u00e9nale.\nLa r\u00e9solution, ni la peine, no sont acquises de plein droit: elles doivent \u00eatre prononc\u00e9es en justice, encore quo le contraire soit stipul\u00e9 au contrat ([20]).\nThese authorities, and the general principle of our law demonstrate that an action in justice is necessary to ask the dissolution If not taken the creditor is supposed to have waived his right to ask it, and to have granted delay to his debtor for the payments due. Arts. 1537 and 1538 of our code I have already referred to, make this as plain as possible as to sale. See also Delvincourt ([21]) and authorities cited in Code Civil annot\u00e9 par Lahaye ([22]).\nIt is clear that this right to ask the dissolution of the sale for non-payment, is a right given to the vendor and not to the vendee who according to all authority, would be estopped from invoking his non-execution of this contract to ask the rescision of it. The vendor has an action for the price of sale, though the contract stipulated that the sale would be rescinded by non-payment on the part of the vendee ([23]). Here the appellant was bound to notify McLennan by some act that he intended to avail himself of his right to have this sale rescinded and to hold him, McLennan, as his tenant only. The appellant had to make or declare his option to ask the dissolution, if he intended to avail himself of his privilege. The lease provided for in the deed never began, never was inexistence. If the appellant had sued the respondent for the price of sale, this one could never have contended that the contract had ipso jure lapsed that he was only a tenant, and on these grounds have refused to pay the price of sale.\nAs to moveables, the code has thought it better that the dissolution of the sale for non-payment should take place without the necessity of a suit, but it has declared so, in express terms, by art. 1544, so giving it here again clearly to be understood that for immoveables, a suit is necessary.\nIn fact the law under art. 1536 1537 1538 and 1550 is now clearly that \" No sale of immoveables shall be rescinded for default of payment of price unless there is an express clause to that effect, and not then, until judgment of rescision is pronounced, and the judgment may be prevented if the buyer pays the price, with interest and costs, after action is commenced, at any time before judgment.\" This being so, McLennan having duly offered the price of sale to Grange, even before an action of dissolution, he surely must have been in time to do it since he would have been in time after an action bad been brought.\nFor these reasons, I am of opinion that the judgment of the two courts below maintaining the plaintiff's action is right and that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nGWYNNE, J.:\nI find it difficult to put upon an instrument, so in-artistically and equivocally expressed as that upon which this case turns, a construction which can be said to be clearly free from doubt. I think, however, it does appear to have been a very prominent, and, indeed, the most prominent, feature in the intention of the parties to the instrument, that in case of default in payment of any of the instalments of the purchase money agreed upon, the instrument should operate only as a lease, and that the payments already made should, in such case be treated as paid on account of rent. Now, this important feature in the intention of the parties would be wholly frustrated, if by reason of the clause which speaks of the vendor having an hypothec on the property for the purchase money the instrument should be construed as a completed sale. The construction therefore which has been put upon the instrument by the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Queen's Bench in Montreal, in appeal, appears to my mind to be most in accordance with what was the real intention of the parties to the instrument, and effect, I think, should be given to such intention, although not very felicitously expressed by the notary who prepared the deed. I am of opinion, therefore, that the appeal should be allowed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Doutre, Joseph & Dandurand.\nSolicitors for Respondent:Davidson & Cross.\n[1] 3 Dorion's Q.

Ritchie, C.J., and- Strong Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne, J J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nWilly Construction of\u2014Art. 889, Civil Code Liability of universal legatee for hypothec on immoveable bequeathed to a particular legatee\nOn the 30th April, 1869, H. S. being indebted to J. P. in the sum of $3,000, granted a hypothec on certain real estate which he owned in the city of Montreal. On 28th June 1870 H. S made his will in which the following clause is to be found \"That all my just debts, funeral and testamentary expenses be paid by my executors hereinafter named as soon as possible after my death. By another clause he left to W. H. in usufruct. and to his children in property, the said immoveable which had been hypothecated to secure the said debt of $3,000. In 1879 H. S. died, and a suit was brought against the representative of his estate to recover this sum of $3000 and interest.\nHeld,\u2014(Reversing the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Strong. J. dissenting.): That the direction by the testator to pay all his debts included the debt of $3000 secured by the hypothec.\nPer Fournier. Taschereau and Gwynne J J.: When a testator does not expressly direct a particular legatee to discharge a hypothec on an immoveable devised to him art. 889 of the C C does not bear the interpretation that such particular legatee is liable for the payment of such hypothecary debt without recourse against the heir or universal legatee. APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) confirming the judgment of the Superior Court (Montreal) ([1]).\nAn action was brought by kate Ann Parkin against the respondent N. B. Corse, as sole surviving executor of the last will and testament of the late Hiram Seymour for the recovery of $3,150 and interest due under an obligation of date the 30th April, 1869, given by the late Hiram Seymour to the executors Of \"the late fames Parkin, and transferred to the plaintiff Kate Ann Parkin, by which the house and premises, No. 9 Beaver Hall, were specially hypothecated, the said obligation being duly registered. The respondent thereupon called en garantie the now appellants, special legatees under the last will and testament of Hiram Seymour, requesting them to discharge the debt, alleging that the universal legatees under Hiram Seymour's will had notified him not to pay the debt but to claim it from the special legatees. The appellants refused to take up the tail el cause. of Crose and \"pleaded to this action en garantie, The following question of law was submitted to the court, viz:\u2014\nDoes the special legatee of an immoveable property, hypothecated by the testator for a debt of his own due at the time of his death, take the property subject to the hypothec upon it, or is the universal legatee, or legatee by general title, bound to discharge the hypothec that is, to pay the debt, when not obliged to do so by the will?\nThe chief \"point submitted to the court turned upon the interpretation of articles 735, 740, 741 and 839 of the civil code Lower Canada,\nThese articles are as follows :__\nArt. 735 .An heir who comes alone to the succession is bound, to discharge all the debts and liabilities. The same rule applies to a universal legatee. A legatee by general title is held to contribute in proportion to his share in the succession. A particular legatee is bound only in case of the insufficiency of the other property, and is also subject to hypothecary claims against the property bequeathed, saving his recourse against those who are held personally.\nArt. 740. An heir universal legatee, or a legatee under general title, who, not being personally bound, pays the hypothecary debts charged upon the immoveable included in his share, becomes subrogated in all the rights of the creditor against the other coheirs or co-legatees for their share.\nArt. 741. A particular legatee who pays an hypothecary debt for which he is not liable in order to free the immoveable bequeathed to him, has his recourse against those who take the succession, each for his share, with subrogation in the same manner as any other person acquiring under particular title.\n[Art. 889. if before or since the will the immoveable bequeathed have been hypothecated for a debt of the testator remaining still due or even for the debt of a third person, whether it was known or not to the testator, the heir, or the universal legatee, or the legatee by general title, is not bound to discharge the hypothec, unless he is obliged to do so by the will]\nA usufruct established upon the thing bequeathed is also borne without recourse by the particular legatee. The same rule applies to servitudes.\nIf, however, the hypothecary debt of a third person, of which the testator Washington, affect at the same time the particular legacy and the property remaining in the succession, the benefit of division may reciprocally be claimed.\nMr. Doutre, Q. C, for appellants ;and Mr. Slrachan Bethune Q. C and Mr. Robertson, Q. C, for respondent. The arguments of counsel and authorities relied on are fully noticed in the judgments of the Court of Queen's Bench reported in 26 L. C. Jurist, p. 79, and in the judgments hereinafter given.\nRITCHIE, C.J.\nThe clauses in the will and codicils relied on are the following:\nThirdly\u2014That all my just debts, funeral and testamentary ex- penses be paid by ray executors hereinafter named as soon as possible after my death.\nNow therefore I give, devise and bequeath to the said Wm. Harrington during the time of his natural life the use usufruct and enjoyment of my house No. 19, Beaver Hall Terrace Montreal aforesaid, with the lot of ground on which the same is built as afore-] said, the whole as described in the said will, and after the death of the said Wm. Harrington, I give, devise and bequeath the same em pleine propri\u00e9t\u00e9 to the four children issue of his marriage with my said late daughter Laura, and to the survivors of them in equal proportions, share and share alike\nAnd by the said codicil the said testator ratified and confirmed said last will.\nBy article 919 \"The Testamentary Executor pays. the debts and discharges the particular legacies with the consent of the heir, or of the legatee who receives the succession, or, after calling in such heir or legatee, with the authorization of the court This article and article 889, read in connection with the evidence in this case, leaves in my mind no difficulty in satisfactorily determining this case without discussing the other question raised.\nThis places the office and duty of executors on a very different footing from that of an executor under the English law, where the absolute duty is cast on the executor of paying the debts of the deceased without any consent or authorization, and therefore while it may be said, under the English law, that a clause directing the executor to pay the debts of the testator is a mere formal one, adding nothing to the position or legal obligations 0f the executor, it is under article 919 C. C, clearly defined and affects the position and duty of the executor and imposes on him others than that obligatory by the law without such a provision Viz., absolutely to pay the debts without either consent or authorization, and that the testator intended that this was to be an absolute duty obligatory on the defendant sufficiently to relieve the immoveable bequeathed from the hypothecary debt appears from the clause read in connection with the other \"provisions of the will which, to my mind, very clearly indicates that such bequest was free from such hypothecary claim. The will shows, in no uncertain manner, in my opinion, that the daughter was to be on a par with her sisters which court not be if this hypothecary debt wiped away the bequest to her.\nTherefore there is a clear indication on the face of the will as well as in the express words of the code, that he intended to oblige his executor to pay all his debts, including the hypothec in question, and the appeal should be allowed.\nSTRONG, J: was opinion that the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by the majority the Court of Queen's Bench.\nFOURNIER, J.:\u2014\nLa premi\u00e8re question soulev\u00e9e en cette cause est de savoir lequel, du leorataire universel, ou du l\u00e9gataire particulier, doit, depuis l'adoption de l'article 889, 0. C, acquitter une dette en paiement de laquelle le testateur a hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9 un immeuble compris dans un legs particulier. 2o. D'apr\u00e8s les dispositions du testament dont il s'agit en cette cause, y ail lieu de faire application an cas actuel de l'article 889?\nAvant la promulgation du Code Civil cette question ne prouvait souffrir de difficult\u00e9 Il est indubitable que dans l'ancien droit fran\u00e7ais c'\u00e9tait \u00e0 l'h\u00e9ritier on l\u00e9gataire universel \u00e0 acquitter l'hypoth\u00e8que grevant une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 comprise dans un legs particulier. Lea codificateurs charg\u00e9s de d\u00e9clarer quel \u00e9tait l'ancien droit \u00e0 ce sujet ont formellement exprim\u00e9 leur opinion comme suit (1):\nIf a thing bequeathed by a particular title be pledged or hypothecated for a debt due by the testator, or for any other debt, which, either before or after his will\u00bb be known to affect the particular legacy, the heir, or the universal legatee by general title, is bound to free it from such debt.\nL'article 889 a-t-il chang\u00e9 l'ancien droit sous ce rapport et impose au l\u00e9gataire particulier au lieu de l'h\u00e9ritier ou l\u00e9gataire universel l'obiigaiion de payer cette hypoth\u0141que? La Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, si\u00e9geant \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, dont le jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par une majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc de la Reine a d\u00e8cid\u00e8 cette question dans l'affirmative\nLarticle 889 est ainsi con\u00e7u:\nSi, avant le testament, ou depuis, l'immeuble l\u00e8gu\u00e8 a \u00e8t\u00e8 hypoth\u00e8c qu\u00e9 pour une dette rest\u00e9e due, ou m\u00eame s'il se trouve hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9 pour la dette d'un tiers, connu ou non du testateur, l'h\u00e9ritier ou le l\u00e8gataire universel, ou \u00e0 titre universel, n'est pas tenu de l'hypoth\u00e8que, \u00e0 moins qu'il n'en soit charg\u00e9 en vertu du testament.\nL'usufruit constitu\u00e9 sue la chose l\u00e8gu\u00e8e est aussi support\u00e9 sans recours par le l\u00e9gataire particulier. Ii en est de m\u00eame des servitudes.\nSi, cependant, l'hypoth\u00e8que pour une dette \u00e9trang\u0141re, inconnue au testateur, affecte en m\u00eame temps le legs particulier et les biens demeur\u00e9s dans la succession, rien n'emp\u00eache que le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de division ait lieu r\u00e9ciproquemtnt.\nDans le cas particulier dont il s'agit il \u00e8tait \u00e0 peine n\u00e8cessaire d'entrer dans l'examen de la premiere question, mais puisqu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e8e, il vaut mieux dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public qu'elle soit d\u00e9cid\u00e9e de suite. Apr\u00e8s avoir non-seulement lu mais \u00e8tudi\u00e9 attentivement, les savantes dissertations des honorables juges de la Cour du Banc de la Reine sur ce sujet je me suis convaincu que les raisons donn\u00e8es par les honorables juges Tessier et Cross devaient l'emporter sur celles de leurs coll\u00e8guss, et je pense, comme eux, que l'article 889 n'a\n(1) No. 140 p. 363 Nos, 4 et 5 des Donations testamentaires. pas change l'ancien droit \u00e0 cet \u00e8gard. C'est encore, suivant moi \u00e0 l'h\u00e9ritier ou au l\u00e8gataire universel \u00e0 acquitter 1 hypoth\u00e8que grevant une propri\u00e9t\u00e8 comprise dans un legs particulier.\nLe testateur \u00e2, en outre, luimeme d\u00e8cide cette question par les dispositions de son testament.\nPar l'article 3 de son testament ii ordonne en ces termes le paiement de ses dettes:\nThat all my just debts, funeral and testamentary expenses be paid by my executors hereinafter named, as soon as possible after my death.\nMais, objection, cette clause est insuffisante pour d\u00e9charger le l\u00e9gataire particulier de l'obligation d'acquitter l'hypoth\u00e8que. Les ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires \u00e9tant d\u00e9j\u00e0 obliges par la loi de payer les dettes du testateur (art. 919), cette clause est de style et n'ajoute rien aux obligations l\u00e9gales do l'ex\u00e9cuteur, et elle n'est pas une preuve one le testateur avait l'intention de faire payer par les l\u00e9gataires universels une dette hypoth\u00e9caire payable par le l\u00e9gataire particulier. Jo ne puis adopter cette mani\u00e8re de voir.\nLa comparaison de la disposition testamentaire au sujet du paiement des dettes avec l'article 919, semble conduire \u00e0 une conclusion tout-\u00e0-fait contraire. Les pouvoirs de l'ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire an sujet du paiement des dettes sont tr\u00e8s restreints d'apr\u00e8s cet article. us ne le sont aucunement d'apr\u00e8s le testament qui ail l'ob\u00e9it de notre examen En effet l'article 919 dit:\nIl (l\u2019ex\u00e9cuteur) pale les dettes et acquitte les legs particuliers, du consentement de l'h\u00e9ritier ou du l\u00e9gataire qui recueillent la succession, ou iceux appel\u00e9s, avec l'autorisation du tribunal.\nVoil\u00e0 bien des formalit\u00e9s auxquelles la loi assujett\u00eet l\u2019ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire dont les fonctions n'ont pas \u00e8t modifi\u00e9es par une extension de pouvoir qu'il est loisible an testateur de faire suivant l'article 921.\nL'ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire ordinaire ne penta donc, suivant l'article 919 payer ni une dette ni un legs sans avoir obtenu le consentement de l'h\u00e9ritier ou l\u00e9gataire universel s'il ne fait pas les d\u00e9marches n\u00e9cessaires pour obtenir le consentement ii est alors oblig\u00e9 de lui faire des sommations pour les appeler au paiement ou du moins leur en donner un avis pr\u00e9alable. .A d\u00e9faut de ces proc\u00e9d\u00e9s il doit recourir \u00e0. l'autorisation judiciaire. Dans le cas actuel l'ex\u00e9cuteur est en vertu de 1 article 3 du testament dispens\u00e9 do recourir \u00e0 toutes ces formalit\u00e9s.il a un pouvoir g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et absolu de payer les dettes et les legs sans recourir \u00e0 toutes ces formalit\u00e9s. Si l'intention du testateur e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 de laisser ses ex\u00e9cuteurs soumis aux restrictions locales il so serait content\u00e9 de les nommer sans d\u00e9finir leurs obligations. Mais ii est \u00e9vident qu'il a voulu exercer le privil\u00e8ge que donne l'article 921 de \" restreindre ou \u00e9tendre les pouvoirs, les obligations et la saisine do l'ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire, et la dur\u00e9e de sa charge.\"\nLorsque l'on compare l'article 3 du testament avec la clause contenant la nomination des ex\u00e9cuteurs ii no penta plus y avoir de doute sur la signification \u00e0 donner \u00e0 l'obligation impos\u00e9e dans ce cas de payer toutes les dettes. Le testateur se dessaisit entre leurs mains de tons ses biens, tant mobiliers qui immobiliers. Il prolonge l'exercice de leurs pouvoirs au del\u00e0 do la dur\u00e9e l\u00e9gale. Il leur donne le pouvoir de vendre tous ses biens immobiliers, non l\u00e8gues, \u00e0 tels prix et conditions qu'ils croiront avantageux, et enfin le pouvoir d'administrer tous ses biens comme s'ils leur appartenaient \u00e0 euxm\u00eames. Ii n'\u00e9tait gu\u00e8re possible de donner \u00e0 des ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires des pouvoirs plus \u00e9tendus que ne le comporte cette clause. Ils avaient non-seule ment le devoir de payer toutes les dettes mais ils avaient \u00e9galement le pouvoir de vendre toutes les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s. N'est-il pas \u00e9vident, en prenant ensemble les deux clauses du testament que le testateur a soustrait l'ex\u00e9cution de ses derni\u00e8res volont\u00e9s \u00e0 l'op\u00e9ration de la loi. il a profit\u00e9 des pouvoirs que lui donnait l'article 921 pour faire sa propre loi aux ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires. Dans lex\u00e9cution des devoirs qu'il leur a trac\u00e9s il ne leur a fait d\u2019autre loi que ses volont\u00e9s manifestes par le testament, et ii ne les a soumis en outre \u00e0 d'autres r\u00e8gles que celles que leur dicteraient leur conscience, leur prudence et leur bon jugement comme hommes d'affaires\nL'effet de telles dispositions \u00e9tait \u00e9videmment de mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 l'article 889 tout aussi bien que les autres articles concernant le paiement des dettes, la saisine des immeubles la dur\u00e9e de l'ex\u00e9cution testamentaire.\nL'obligation de payer toutes les dettes r\u00e9sultant in\u00e9vitablement du testament, peu--on distinguer entre les dettes celles qui sont garanties par hypoth\u00e8ques de celles qui ne le sont pas, lorsque le testateur n'a pas distingu\u00e9? A moins que la loi n'ait fait \u00e0 ce sujet une distinction qui s'impose, on ne peut pas non plus faire cette distinction sans enfreindre la volont\u00e9 du testateur et sans faire pour lui une distinction qu'il n'a certaine\" ment pas voulu faire.\nMais la loi fait-elle une distinction entre une dette garantie par hypoth\u00e8que et celle qui ne l'est pas. La premi\u00e8re est-elle d'une nature diff\u00e9rente de la seconde formole-t-elle une clase distincte soumise A des principes diff\u00e9rents? La loi ne fait aucune diff\u00e9rence \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Une hypoth\u00e8que ne peut pas exister par elle-m\u00eame et ind\u00e9pendamment d'une dette dont elle est l'accessoire. Elle n'est (l'hypoth\u00e8que) dit le code, art. 2017, qu'un accessoire et ne vaut qu'autant que la cran\u00e9e ou obligation qu'elle assure subsiste. Il faut in\u00e9vitablement en conclure qu'en disant \u00e0 sea ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires de payer toutes ses dettes le testateur dans le cas pr\u00e9sent a compris Cgalement celles qui \u00e9taient garanties par hypoth\u00e8ques.\nEn venir \u00e0 une autre conclusion serait dans le cas actuel contrevenir aux intentions du testateur * ce serait d\u00e9ranger la distribution \u00e9quitable et, autant que les circonstances le lui ont permis \u00e9gale de ses biens entre ses enfants. Le testateur avait trois filles et deux gar\u00e7ons. Parmi les biens de sa succession se trouvent trois maisons situ\u00e9es an Beaver Hall Hill Montr\u00e9al \u00e9tant les Nos. 19 21 23. Il donne \u00e0 sa fille Maria Eliza Seymour veuve de Jean Bruneau, en usufruit la maison No. 21, et la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ses enfants pour \u00eatre partag\u00e9e par \u00e9gales proportions. Le No. 23 est l\u00e8gue en usufruit \u00e0 son fils (7. E. Seymour et \u00e0 sa femme, et apr\u00e8s leur d\u00e9c\u00e8s en pleine propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 leurs enfats. A Laura Seymour, \u00e8pouse, depuis d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e, de l'appelant, ii l\u00e8gue la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du No. 19 pour en disposer comme bon lui semble.\nA dame Charlotte Seymour, \u00e9pouse de B. J. Heinse, ii l\u00e8gue $4,000, avec cette d\u00e9claration:\u2014\nThis b\u00e9quets I desire my daughter to regard as an expression of love and esteem, she being by God's blessing amply provided for. I have therefore not placed her on a par with my other daughters in this my will who are more in need of it.\nSon fils, Melancthon H. Seymour, ayant eu par anticipation tout ce qu'il aurait eu droit d'avoir dans sa succession, il lui fait en outre remise de tout ce qu'il peut lui devoir.\nIl donne encore \u00e0 ses deux filles Maria Eliza veuve Bruneau, et Laura, \u00e9pouse de Harington, $3000 chacune, payables apr\u00e8s la mort de leur m\u00e8re.\nIl y a un legs en faveur do cette derni\u00e8re de tous les biens mobiliers contenus dans la maison No. 23\nEnfin, il veut qu'apr\u00e8s la mort de son \u00e9pouse et l'ex\u00e9cution de ses divers legs d\u00fbment faite (and after the foregoing bequests duly made), que le r\u00e9sidu de sa suecession, quel qu'en soit le montant, soit \u00e9galement divis\u00e9 entre ses trois filles, ci-dessus nomm\u00e9es, par parts \u00e9gales (share and share alike), les instituant ses l\u00e9gataires r\u00e9siduaires.\nIi termine son t\u00e9stament par la clause cit\u00e9e plus haut d\u00e9finissant les pouvoirs des ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires.\nCe testament ne d\u00e9montre-t-il pas clairement que l'intention du testateur \u00e9tait de r\u00e9gler lui-m\u00eame sa succession et de n'en rien laisser \u00e0 l'op\u00e9ration de la loi I Ne fait-ll pas voir en m\u00eame temps \u00e0 l'\u00e9vidence qu'il voulait autant que possible conserver l\u00e9galit\u00e9 entre ses enfants surtout entre ses filles en donnant la raison pour laquelle ii ne place pas Madame Heiusley sur un pied d'\u00e9galit\u00e9 [on a par) avec ses deux: aurres filles. Il donne encote \u00e0 chacune de ces premi\u00e8res une somme de $3,000, et, elfin les institue toutes trois par parts \u00e9gales l\u00e9gataires r\u00e9siduaires. On voit aussi qu'il voulait mettre ses deux fils sur un pied d'\u00e9galit\u00e9 par la d\u00e9claration qu'il fait, que son fils, M. Ii Seymour, ayant d\u00e9j\u00e0 re\u00e7u sa part, ii lui fait rem\u00e8de de cc qu'il peut encote lui devoir. Peut-on croire apr\u00e8s toutes ces d\u00e9clarations, et surtout apr\u00e8s l'injonction formelle de payer toutes ses dettes que le testateur avait en vue de d\u00e9ranger le partag\u00e9e si bien ajust\u00e9 de sa succession en laissant porter \u00e0 l'un des l\u00e9gataires seul la charge d'acquitter l'obligation de $3,000, effa\u00e7ant une des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s l\u00e9gu\u00e9es. Ii n'y a certainement pas song\u00e9 un instant. Mais on peut dire qu'il avait Pu avoir l'id\u00e9e de la difficult\u00e9 si ing\u00e9nieusement soulev\u00e9e ici difficult\u00e9 que ne soup\u00e7onnait certainement alors ni les testateurs ni les notaires. On pourrait dire encote qu'il a pris les moyens n\u00e9cessaires de la trancher en ordonnant le paiement de toutes ses dettes comme premi\u00e8re disposition do sa succession En se mettant au point do vue du testateur on comprend mieux toute la pot\u00e9e de cette declaration La mort de sa femme et celle de Laura Madame Harrington ont forc\u00e9 le testateur de modifier son testament par deux codicilles. Les dispositions de ces codicilles n'affectent aucunement la signification que doit avoir dans le testament l'injonction de payer toutes les dettes. Par le premier de ces codicilles il institue en cons\u00e9quence du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de sa femme ses deux fils l\u00e9gataires r\u00e9siduaires conjointement avec ses trois filles. Ainsi ii y a maintenant cinq l\u00e9gataires r\u00e9siduaires au lieu de trois. Par le deuxi\u00e8me, en cons\u00e9quence do la mort do Madame Harrington, l\u00e9gataire en pleine propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la maison No. 19, il institue Harrington mantra de cette derni\u00e8re, l\u00e9gataire en usufruit et leurs quatre enfants l\u00e9gataires en pleine propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Ce codicille semble n'avoir pas eu d'autre objet que d'\u00e9tendre la lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 du testateur jusqu'\u00e0 l'appelant, qui par le pr\u00e9d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son \u00e9pouse se trouvait \u00e0 ne recevoir aucun avantage personnel dans la succession du testateur L'id\u00e9e de r\u00e9parer cette omission semble avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 l'unique preoccupation du testateur. Pensait-il par hasard que le legs de $3,000 et la part attribu\u00e9e dans le r\u00e9sidu de la succession \u00e0 Madame Harrington passeraient aux enfants de cette derni\u00e8re? Malheureusement ii n'en peut \u00eatre ainsi. Ces legs sont devenus caducs par le pr\u00e9d\u00e9c\u00e8s de leur more. Ii ne reste \u00e0 ces petits-enfants du testateur que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la maison No. 19.\nQu\u2019arrivera-t-il si la pr\u00e9tention do faire porter aux l\u00e9gataires particuliers la charge de payer seuls l'hypo toque affectant la maison No. 19 qui leur est l\u00e9gu\u00e9e, est maintenue? Prives sans doute par pure inadvertance des deux autres legs faits \u00e0 leur m\u00e8re, ils so verraient encore enlever la meilleure partie de leur legs s'ils \u00e9taient condamn\u00e9s \u00e0 payer l'hypoth\u00e8que do $3,000 affectant la maison qui leur est l\u00e9gu\u00e9e. En recherchant dans les dispositions du testament quelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 l'intention du testeur est-il possible d'en, arriver \u00e0 une conclusion semblable? Rien ne me parait avoir\u00e8t\u00e8 plus loin de l'intention du. testateur dont les dispositions repoussent toute id\u00e9e d'un pareil r\u00e9sultat.\nBien plus les l\u00e9gataires universels dans ce cas n'\u00e9tant J. l\u00e9gataires que du r\u00e9sidu de la succession aux conditions formellement impos\u00e9es par le testateur aux ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires, savoir: 10 paiement de toutes les dettes 20 ex\u00e9cution de tons les legs particuliers, ne faut-il pas avant que l'on puisse constater un r\u00e9sidu faire d\u00e9falcation de toutes les dettes et de tous les legs particuliers.\nSi les ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires saisis de tons les biens veulent ex\u00e9cuter leur mandat (trust) c'est l'op\u00e9ration qu'ils sont obliges de faire avant de remettre aux l\u00e9gataires universels le r\u00e9sidu des biens Ceci est d'autant plus \u00e9vident que h\u00e9 testateur en ne d\u00e9passant son actif assurait \u00e0 son point de vue l'ex\u00e9cution de touts ses lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9s\nIl me parait, en cons\u00e9quence, clair que ha nature du testament dont ii s'agit rend impossible l'application an cas actuel de l'article 889.\nIl me semble que cette question ne pourrait gu\u00e8re \u00eatre soulev\u00e9e que dans un cas o\u00f9 h\u00e9 testateur n'ayant fait aucune disposition quant an paiement de ses dettes, c'est alors \u00e0 la loi \u00e0 r\u00e9gler cc qui ne l'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 par le testament. J'ai donn\u00e9 \u00e0 cette importante question si habilement trait\u00e9e de part et d'autre dans les savantes dissertations des honorables juges qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9s \u00e0 exprimer leurs opinions, toute l'attention qu'elle m\u00e9rite ;cependant je n'ai arriver \u00e0 la m\u00eame conclusion que ces Honorables juges sur l'interpr\u00e9tation \u00e0 donner \u00e0 l'art. 889, et je suis d'opinion que celle qu'ils ont adopt\u00e9e ne devrait pas pr\u00e9valoir.\nJe me permettrai d\u2019ajouter que l'interpr\u00e9tation de l'art. 889 adopt\u00e9e par la majorit\u00e9 de ha Cour du Banc de ha Reine no pent manquer d'entra\u00eener des cons\u00e9quences de la plus haute gravity. Cette question soulev\u00e9e en Cette cause pour la premi\u00e8re fois, n'a jamais attir\u00e9, que je sache l'attention des testateurs ni des notaires Si cette interpr\u00e9tation devait pr\u00e9valoir que d'arrangements de famille, faits depuis la publication du code civil vont \u00eatre troubl\u00e9s. N'y aurait-il pas lieu dans ce cas \u00e0 l'intervention de la l\u00e9gislature pour donner \u00e0 l'interpr\u00e9tation qui paraitra la plus en harmonie avec l'esprit du code civil, la sanction l\u00e9gislative?\nHENRY, J.: \u2014\nI think the intention of the testator is very clear to divide his property among his daughters, and I think the direction to the executor was merely intended to take away the right of the party in whose favour the bequest was made to call upon the heir at law to pay off the hypothec. The effect of the law in the Province of Quebec is a little different from what it would be in other provinces. The executors in the other provinces and in England are called upon to pay the debts while in Quebec they have nothing to do with the debts unless the testator calls upon them to do so. In this will there is a clear direction to pay all the debts and it includes this hypothecary debt as well as the other debts. I think, therefore, the appeal should be allowed.\nTASCHEREAU J.:\u2014\nOn both of the points urged by the appellant, I am of opinion to allow this appeal.\nIn addition to the cogent reasoning of Tessier and Cross, JJ., in the Court of Queen's Bench, in support of the view that art. 889 of the code does not make a \"particular legatee liable without recourse for the debt of the testator hypothecated upon the immoveable bequeathed to him, I remark that the said article of the civil code relates only to immoveables ;and this not inadvertently, since art. 140 of the report of the codifiers, which it purports to amend, gives the law both as to pledge of moveables and as to hypothec of immoveables, so that clearly as to moveables, the rule is still that a a debt of the testator is not payable by the particular legatee. If, for instance, he leaves to his particular legatee a watch which, at his death, is pledged for a certain debt, this debt has to be paid by the heir or universal legatee. Have the codifiers intended that a different rule should prevail as to immoveables? Up to the code, moveables and immoveables have certainly always been on the same footing in this respect, and there were no reasons that I can see for creating a difference between them. I entirely concur in the reasoning of Tessier and Cross, JJ., in the Court of Appeal, and hold with them that this article does not bear the interpretation that the particular legatee is liable for the payment of the debts hypothecated on the immoveable left to him, without recourse against the heir or universal legatee.\nOn the other point, I am also with the appellant.\nI am of opinion that if, as held by the courts below the law was now that unless otherwise ordered by the testator, the particular legatee is liable for the debt hypothecated on the immoveable bequeathed to him the respondent here would even then not be liable for the debt in question in this cause, because Seymour the testator has ordered the contrary. The clause of his will relating thereto is\nThat all my just debts, funeral and testamentary expenses be paid by my executors hereinafter named as soon as possible after my death.\nDoes not this mean, nay, more, say, in as clear terras as possible, \"all my debts? \" Can it be read as meaning only his chirographary and not his hypothecary debts? I cannot see upon what principle this could be done. Now, when the testator said \"all my debts\" we cannot make him say \"not all my debts,\" or may be \"no debt at all,\u201d for this debt in question here may be the only one the testator owed.\nThis debt of $3,000 Seymour had contracted on the 30th April, 1869. On the 28th June, 1870, he begins his will by ordering his executor to pay all his debts, and then makes to the respondent and others certain particular legacies. This, it seems to me shows not only that the testator intended these particular legacies to be free from all debts, but that he had this particular debt in his mind when he ordered his executor to pay all his debts. I cannot accede to the proposition that we may treat, as a matter of form and of no meaning what soever, this clause of the will by which Seymour orders the payment of his debts. I know of no rule under which we would be authorized to set at nought any part of a will under pretence that it is merely a matter of form. This clause like all the others, must have its execution. If the law is as it was before the code, that the particular legatee is not liable for the debts of the testator, the appellant must succeed independently of this clause of the will. lf, on the contrary, the law was now, as held by the courts below, that the particular legatee must pay, without recourse, the debt hypothecated upon the imnoveable bequeathed to him uneless the heir or universal legatee is obliged to do so by the will then the clause of the will ordering all the debts to be paid by the executor is far from being a clause banale. To say that, as the law orders the executor to pay the testator's debts, this clause of Seymour's will means nothing, seems to me to be taking for granted that it does not include the debt hytothecated on the property bequeathed to the appellant. The law does not order the executor to pay this particular debt if the interpretation given to the code by the majoritv of the court below is correct but tills clause of Seymour's will does it, as I read it, in as plain terms as possible.\nTwo arr\u00eats of the Parlement de Paris cited in l Mei lin's s Rep. ([2]), relating to the meaning of the words in a will \" pay my debts,\" have some analogy with the present case.\nIn the first case the will was as follows: \u2014\n\"Je legue \u00e0 Madame de Mailloc et \u00e0 Madame de Buvron tout ce que je peux leur donner je les prie de faire prier Dieu pour moi, payer mes dettes et r\u00e9compenser mes domestiques.\" Cette disposition (says Merlin} a fait na\u00eetre Ja question de savoir si les h\u00e8ritiers des propres devaient contribuer aux dettes. Une sentence par d\u00e9faut du ch\u00aate-let avait prononc\u00e9 l'affirmaiive. Mais par arr\u00e8t rendu le 22 juin 1728 cette senetence a \u00e9t\u00e9 infirm\u00e9e et ii a \u00e9t\u00e9 ordon\u00e9\u00e9 que les h\u00e9ritiers jouisaient des propres sans \u00eatre tenus de contribuer \u00e0 aucune dette.\nThe second case is given by Merlin as follows:\nLa dame de Talard faisant son testament, s'\u00e9tait expiiqu\u00e9 en ces termes: \"Je veux que mes dettes soient pav\u00e9es surmes biens patrimoniaux. J'institue le prince de Rochefort l\u00e8gataire universel de tous mes sus-dits biens en toute jouissance et propri\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 la charge toutefois de payer les dettes de ma succession et acquitter sur les biens fonds les legs quej'ai faits.\" Apr\u00e8s samorrt, contestation entre les h\u00e9ritiers et le l\u00e9gataire universel pour la contribution aux dettes. La difficult\u00e9 naissait de ce que la dame de Talard avait d'abord charsg\u00e9 ses biens patrinoniaux d'acquitter les dettes, et qu'elle en avait ensuite charg\u00e9 son l\u00e9gataire universel, auquel elle ne pouvait laisser qu'une partie de ses propres. Le l\u00e9gataire universel disait que, dans do pareilles circonstances, il fallait consulter le droit commun, suivant lequel les reserves coutumi\u00e8res contribuent aux dettes avec les objets compsis dans le legs universel: \"Mais par sentence des requetes du palais, du 24 avril 1755, confirm\u00e9e par arrtt rendu le 17 juillet de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e, sur les conclusions de M. joly de Fleury avocat-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, le parlement de Paris a jug\u00e9 que les h\u00e9ritiers ne contribueraient pas aux dettes pour les reserves coutumi\u00e8res, et que le l\u00e9gataire universel le paierait seul.\"\nI am of opinion to allow the appeal and to dismiss the action en garantie, with costs in the three courts against the respondent. I remark that, though, the registration of the obligation upon which is based the principal action is admitted at the enqu\u00e9te, such registration is not alleged either in the principal demand nor in the declaration en garantie. In the first, such an allegation was not necessary, but was it not in the second? I also remark that the action is upon a transfer to the plaintiff by the original creditors of the sum due by the late Seymour, and that the only signification of that transfer alleged by the plaintiff is a signification to Corse. If Corse, as held by the court below, was not liable for this sum is the signification of the transfer upon him sufficient?\nGWYNEE, J.:\u2014\nAlthough I fully concur in the judgment of my brother Taschereau (which I have had the opportunity of seeing) upon the question which has been so fully and ably discussed by the learned judges in the courts below and by the learned counsel in their arsrument before us as to the true construction of the expression in article 889 of the civil code of the Province of Quebec namely:\u2014\" L'h\u00e9ritier on le l\u00e9gataire universel ou \u00e0 titre \"universel n'est pas tenu de l'hypoth\u00e9que,\" as it is in the French text and \"The heir or the universal legatee \" or the legatee by general title is not bound to dis-c charge the hypothec,\" as it is in the English text, still it is not, in my opinion, necessary that our judgment should be rested on that point for, assuming the true construction to be that the universal legatee is not bound to pay the mortgage debt, I am of opinion that upon the other point argued the appellants are entitled to our judgment in their favor. The article provides that:\nIf before or since the will an immovable bequeathed be hypothecated for a debt of the testator remaining due or \u00e9vent for the debt of a third person, whether it was known or not to the testator the heir, or the universal legatee or the legatee by general title is not bound to discharge the hypotheque unless he is obliged to do so by the will.\nReading then these words d discharge the hypotheque \" as synonymous with \" pay the mortgage debt,\" l am of opinion that the testator has, by his will, sufficiently clearly expressed his intention to be that the special legatee shall in this case enioy the immoveable bequeathed free from all liability to pay the debt secured by hypothec upon it, for payment of which special provision is made by the will.\nConstruing the words used in the article as above, a somewhat similar provision is made by the English Act, 17th and 18th Vic, ch. 113, by which it was enacted that when any person should, after the 31st December, 1854, die seized of or entitled to any estate or interest in any land or other hereditaments which should, at the time of his death, be charged with the payment of any sum or sums of money by way of mortgage, and such person should not, by his will, or deed, or other document, have signified any contrary or other intention, the heir or devisee to whom such land or hereditaments should descend or be devised should not be entitled to have the mortgage debt dis charged or satisfied out of the personal estate, or any other real estate of such person, but that the lands or hereditaments so charged should as between the dif ferent persons claiming through or under the deceased person, be primarily liable to the payment of all mort gage debts with which the same shall be charged, every part thereof, according to its value, bearing a proportionate part of the mortgage debts charged on the whole thereof\nIt will be convenient to review the decisions upon this Act. In Woolstencroft Woolstencroft ([3]) the question arose before Sir J. Stuart, V.C., whether a direction by the testator to his executors to pay all his debts out of his estate made his personal estate primarily liable for the payment of a mortgage debt charged on real estate devised by his will. The learned Vice-Chancel lor was of opinon that the mortgage debt must be paid out of the personal estate, and he stated the ground of his decision to be that where there was a direction by the testator that his debts should be paid by his executors, that exonerated the mortgaged estate. In the same year but after the above decision of Sir J Stuart, the question arose before Vice-Chancellor Sir W. Page Wood in Pewibrooke v. Friend ([4]) under a will whereby a testator directed that all his just debts, funeral and testamentary expenses should be paid as soon as might be after his decease * but he did not direct the payment to be out of any particular fund, nor did the will contain the words that the payment was to be made \" by his executors,\" and he devised a house which he occupied to his wife in fee. The testator had created an equitable mortgage on the house by deposit of title deeds before his death, and the question was whether or not the personal estate should pay this mortgage The Vice-chancellor held that this will contained no sufficient expression of intention of the testator that the mortgage should be paid otherwise than under the provisions of 17th and 18th v\u00efc, ch 113, that is by the specific devisee of the house, and he supports this conclusion by the following language:\nThe testator doss not say that the debts are to be paid out of his personal estate or by his executors. Had he used the words \" by my executors \" there would have been something on which to build the conclusion that he meant to express an intention that the general statutory rule should not apply. There would have been more room for argument if the \"property had been devised in strict settlements but the gift to the widow being in fee, there was nothing to prevent a sale for payment of the mortgage debt immediately after the testator's decease. Woolstencroft v. \"Woolsencroft came up before Lord ' Chancellor Lord Cumpbell in appeal ([5]) \"who reversed the decision of Sir J. Stuart V.C. The Lord Chancellor says:\nI will not say that the words here relied upon are mere words of style, like the pious phrases with which wills usually begin, but they do not seem to me to show that the testator had in his mind the option given him of making the debt fall upon the mortgaged land or on the personal estate. He does not say that the payment is to be out of his personal estate, but out of his estate generally, and the real estate being charged with all the debts, and the payment having to be made by the executors, the executors would have the means of effecting a sale of part of the real estate, if necessary for that purpose.\nAnd Pewbrooke v. Friend having been cited the Lord Chancellor says that there the Vice\u2014Chancellor, Sir W. Page Wood, seemed to him, merely by the observation made by him, to intend to distinguish the decision of Sir J. Stuart in Woolstencrott v. Woolstencrott from the case of Pembroke v. Friend ; and the Lord Chancellor attributed no weight to the words \" by my executors,\" used in the will in the case before him because he held and laid down as a rule that a testator could only signify his intention that the personal estate should pay the mortgage debt by express words, declaring that the devisee of the land mortgaged should take the land free of the debt ; that the same rule should be observed with respect to exempting the mortgaged land from the payment of the mortgage debt as was before observed with respect to exempting the personal estate, the mortgage land being by the statute made primarily liable as the personal estate had been previously ;but in Meliish v. Val lins ([6]), Sir W. Page Wood takes the opportunity of showing that the learned Lord Chancellor had fallen into an error in laying down the above rule, arising from a want of due appreciation of the principle upon which the rule of law that to exempt the personal estate express words to that effect must be used was established, and he held that the rule as laid down by the Lord Chancellor, could not be of general application, and he held that a bequest of personalty, subject to the payment thereout of all the testator's just debts, following a devise of land in mort-devise which devise made no reference to the mortgage sufficiently indicated the intention of the testator to be that the land should not be primarily liable to the payment of the mortgage debt, and the decree was that according to the true construction of the testator's will the mortgage debt and interest ought to be borne by and \"paid out of his personal estate in exoneration of his real estate.\nIn Allen v. Allen ([7]) where a testatrix had an estate which she had herself mortgaged, and another estate which had been mortgaged by a former owner, and she devsed the former for sale and payment of certain legacies, and the residue of her real and personal estate, including that which had been mortgaged by a former owner,to the defendants,directing that mortgages, debts, or other incumbrances on her residuary real and personal estate should be exclusively borne by the premises charged therewith, and that \" all her debts and funeral and testamentary expenses should be paid out of her said residuary real and personal estate, Lord Romilly, Master of the Rolls held that the mortgage debt incurred by herself was primarily payable out of the residuary real and personal estate, and not out of the mortgaged estate.\nIn Newman v. Wilson ([8]) where a testator, by his will, devised an estate which he had subletted to a mortgage to his wife for life and afterwards to four of his children and their issue and he devised all his freehold and leasehold estates and all other his real estate except What he otherwise devised by his Will unto trustees for sale, and he bequeathed all his personal estate to the same trustees upon trust to call in and convert, and he declared that his trustees should stand possessed of the monies to arise from the sale of his real estate and from the calling in and conversion of his personal estate, upon trust, in the first place, to pay his funeral and testamentary expenses and certain legacies ;and it was held that the personal estate and the real estate devised in trust for sale were primarily liable to pay the mortgage debt on the estate devised to the wife for life &c., &c\nIn Rowson v. Harrison ([9]), where a testator directed that all his just debts and funeral and testamentary expenses should be paid and discharged by his executors thereinafter named, as soon as conveniently might be after his decease, out of his personal estate, the master of the rolls, holding this case to be governed by the judgment of the Lord Chancellor in Woolstencrott v. Woolstencrott held that this will did not indicate the intention of the testator to be that the devisee of the land mortgaged should take the land otherwise than as primarily charged with the mort-gage debt but in Eno v. Tatam ([10]) vice-chancellor Sir J. Stuart held that a devise of personal estate, subject to the payment of the testator's debts funeral and testamentary expenses, was a sufficient indication of intention to make the personal estate the primary fund for the payment of a debt charged upon an estate particularly devised- The learned Vice-Chancellor there said:\nIf I find a will in which there is some intention contrary to the mortgage being a burthen upon the mortgaged estate. I am bound by the language of the Act.\nFinding there that there was such intention, he came to the conclusion that the devisee of the personal estate did. not take anything until she should pay thee mortgage debt.\nThe Lord Justices, Sir J. L. Knight Bruce and Sir George Turner, upon appeal ([11]), affirmed this decision, r and laid down the rule that the mortgaged estates are not liable where the debts are directed to be paid out of some other fund ;and Sir George Turner, referring to the observations of Lord Campbell in Woohtencroft v. Woolstencroft, that the same rule which was applied to exempt the personal estate, should now be applied to exempt the mortgaged estate, says that he thought that meant no more than that the intention must appear and that if it meant that it was necessary for the expressions to show an intention not merely to charge some other fund with the debt, but also to discharge the estate mortgaged, then he was not prepared to follow the decision;and in Moore v. Moore which was a case similar to Roson v. Harrison the same lords justices ([12]), following their decision in Eno v. Tathanm overruled the decision of the Master of the Rolls which was similar to that in Rowson v. Harrison. In Maxwell v. Hyslop ([13]), Vice Chancellor Malins', who approved of Lord Campbell's judgment in Woohtencrott v. Woohtencrott, and who says that if the Appeal Court had not decided the other way he should have gladly followdd it, lays down the rule, as settled by the decisions, to be,\u2014that whenever a tesato has mortgaged his estates and, by his will provides a fund, either his residuary personal estate, or an estate devised for the purpose, or the general personal estate and other property mixed up with it, or in other words, when he provides a fund of any description whatever for the payment of his debts, that is an indication of an intention that the land is not to be the primary fund, but that the personal estate, or the particular fund provided, is to exonerate it from the mortgage debt.\nBy an Act passed by the Imperial Parliament on the 25th July, 1867, 30th and 81st Vic. ch. 69 which was passed to explain the operation of 17th and 18th Vic, ch. 13, it was enacted that in the construction of the will of any person who might die after the 31st day of December, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-seven, a general direction that the debts or that all the debts of the testator shall be paid out of his personal estate, shall not be deemed to be a declaration of an intention contrary to, or other than the rule established by the said Act, unless such contrary or other intention should be further declared by words expressly or by necessary implication referring\" to all or some of the testator's debts or debt charged by way of mortgage on any part of his real estate. In Browtison v. Lawrence ([14]) which came before the Master of the Rolls in 186S, after the passing of the above Act but in which the question arose upon the will of a testator who had died in 1860, the Master of the Rolls after reviewing Woolstencrott v. Wooistencroft Pembroke v Friend and Eno v. Tatham was of opinion that in construing the wills of testators who have died between the 31st of December, 1854 and the 1st of January 1868 he must follow Woostencroft v. Woolstencrott, or Eno v. Tatham, according as the words of the will in each particular case came within the exact authority of one or other of those decisions holding the rule to be that where a testator directs his debts to be paid out of some particular fund or property, or description of property, out of which, according to the rule established by the statute, they would not be primary liable he must be taken to signify an intention to exclude the statutory rule but where he merely directs his debts to be paid or to be paid out of his estate generally, he does not sigfnify an intention to exclude that rule.\nIn Coote v. Lowndes ([15]) the testator had excluded any such conclusion as an intention that the mortgage g debt should be paid out of the personalty, by the disposition in his will whereby he had expressly directed that the devisees in trust of his real estates should, during the minorities of the cestuique trust, receive the rents and profits and by and out of the same keep down any annuity which might be charged on the premises and the interest of any sum which might be charged by way of mortgage on the same premises. The alteration made in the English law upon the subject by the Imperial Statute 30th and 31st Vic ch 69 makes decisions under that Act inapplicable to the present case but if the true construction of article 889 be as for the purpose of the present discussion I have assumed it to be then as such a construction is at variance with the provisions of the Code Napoleon in like cases, and with the law of other countries where the civil law prevails and corresponts with the provisions of the Imperial statute, 17th and 18th Vic. ch. 113,we may have recourse to the decisions under this Act to assist us in the determination of the present question.\nNow the principle to be derived from the above English cases is that, if from any provision, express or by necessary implication, in the testator's will, we find his intention to have been that his debts generally, without any specific directions as to his mortgage debts should be paid out of any particular fund, or part of his estate other than the mortgaged estates, such intention must prevail and the will must be construed as imposing a primary obligation upon such particular fund, or part of his estate, for the payment of his mortgage debts (as well as his other debts) in relief of the mortgaged estates particularly devised ;and for the purpose of arriving at the testator's intention upon the point, no particular form of words is necessary, but, as in all other questions arising under the will, the testator's intention is to be gathered from a perusal of the whole will.\nNow the testator in his will declares his intention to be:\nThat all my just debts, funeral, and testamentary expenses be paid by my executors hereinafter named, as soon as possible after my decease.\nIn connection with this clause, and as incorporated with it, we must turn to the clause appointing the executors here referred to, which is as follows;\nI appoint my well tried and trusty friends Edwin Atater and Norton B. Corse, both of the said city of Montreal, Esquires, into whose hands I hereby divest myself of all my property, real or personal, and hereby expressly continuing their powers as such, beyond the year and day limited by law, and with full power to my said executors, or the survivor of them, to sell and dispose of all real estate to me belonging, and not hereby bequeathed, for such prices and on such terms and conditions as he or they may deem most advantageous, and to sign all conveyances and deeds of sale thereof, and to administer generally my said estate as if the same belonged to them personally.\nNow these clauses, taken together, express the clear intention of the testator to be to devise the whole of his personal estate to his named executors and to give then complete power of disposition over all of his real estate not bequeathed by the will to enable his executors with such particular portion 01 his estate, to administer his estate generally, and in the course of such administration to pay all his debts as soon as possible after his decease. The bequeathed real estate is specially excepted from the real estate over which in such administration of the testator's estate his executors should have any control, and the clause operates as a charge of all testator's debts upon the whole of his personalty and that portion of his realty not specifically bequeathed, thus displaying? a manifest intention of the testator that his bequeathed realty, of which the tenement and dwelling house in question is a part, should be exempt. The usufructuary life-estate devised to the testator's wife can plainly operate only upon the real estate excepted from the estate, over which, for the purposes of administration, control is given to the executors and such personal estate, if any, and such real estate, over which the executors were given control, as should remain after the complete administration of the testators estate, and consequently after the payment of all his debts.\nThe devise to the wife is as follows:\nI give, devise and bequeath to my dearly beloved wife, Dame Tamer Murray, the use, usufruct and enjoyment during her natural life of all my property, whether real or personal, moveable or immovable, moneys, stocks, funds, securities for money and in fine everything that I may die possessed of, without any exception or reserve and without being obliged to render an account thereof to any person whomsoever, hereby constituting my said wife my universal usufructuary legatee and devisee.\nThen, after the death of the wife, the particular realty in question, of which the testator's intention was that his widow should enjoy during her life the complete usufructuary enjoyment, without being obliged to render an account to any person whomsoever, is devised in fee simple to one of his daughters. The fact that the testator's widow died in his life time and that he thereupon made a codicil to his will, providing that the devisees in fee in remainder should immediately upon testator's death enter into possession of the estates by the will devised to them after the death of the testator's wife can make no difference in the determination of the question before us. Then, by the codicil made after the death of testator's daughter Laura, to whom the fee simple estate in remainder after the death of the testator's wife in the tenement . and dwelling house in question, was by the will devised, the use, usufruct and enjoyment of that tenement and dwelling-house was devised to William Harrington, husband of testator's daughter Laura, for the term of his natural life and after his death the same was devised en pleine propri\u00e9te to the four children issue of his marriage with testator's daughter Laura and to the survivors of them, in equal proportions. And by this codicil William Harrington had as full use, usufruct and enjoyment of the property in question for the term of his natural life as the testator's widow, if she had survived him would have had.\nIn view of the whole will, whereby it is apparent that the testator was making provision for his wife and his children, and their issue, equally out of his estate, after the whole of his debts being first paid out of the personalty and so much of his realty as was not specifically bequeathed, I am of opinion that the testator has, by his will, expressed a manifest intention that his mortgage debts as well as his other debts should be paid out of his personal estate devised to his executors, and out of the fund created by the sale of such testator's real estate over which special power, for the purpose of administration, was given to ,his executors, which power could only be exercised if the personalty should prove to be insufficient, and that the mortgaged estate should not be primarily liable for the debts charged upon them. A contrary decision would, in my opinion, defeat the plain intention of the testator, as appearing in his will. The appeal therefore should be allowed with costs and the judgment rendered by the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec should be reversed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs\nSolicitors for appellants: Doutre & Joseph.\nSolicitors for respondent Robertson & Fleet.\n[1] 26 26 L.

The words in the 6th section of the Patent Act, 1872, \u201cnot being in public use or on sale for more than one year previous to his application in Canada,\u201d are to read as meaning \u201cnot being in public use or on sale in Canada for mort than one year previous to his application.\u201d\n3. That the Minister of Agriculture or his Deputy has exclusive jurisdiction over questions of forfeiture under the 28th section of the Patent Act, 1872, and a defence, on the ground that a patent has become forfeited for breach of the conditions in the 28th section, cannot be supported after a decision of the Minister of Agriculture or his Deputy declaring it not void by reason of such breach.\nPer Henry, J.\u2014The jurisdiction of the Commissioner is administrative rather than judicial, and he may look at the motive and effect of an act of importation, and a single act, such as the importation of a sample tending to introduce the invention, is not necessarily a breach of the spirit of the conditions of the 28th section.\nUnder the 7th and 48th sections of the Patent Act, 1872, persona who had acquired or used one or more of the patented articles before the date of the patent, or who had commenced to manufacture before the date of the application, are not entitled to a general license to make or use the invention after the issue of the patent.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming a decree of the Court of Chancery dismissing the bill of complaint with costs.\nThe bill of complaint alleged an infringement by the respondents of the appellants\u2019 patented machine for purifying flour during its manufacture. The patent in question, No. 2257 for a \u201cFlour Dressing Machine,\u201d is for a combination and arrangement of parts to effect the purification of flour, and consists of a sieve down which the middlings, (the residuum of the meal after removing the very finely pulverized flour and the very coarse bran,) are made to travel, by giving it a shaking or reciprocating motion by proper machinery, of a fan and air spout placed on the box above the sieve or shaker to produce, when put in motion, an upward draft of air through the meshes of the sieve; of proper apertures being made below the shaker in the case enclosing the whole apparatus, to admit the air at that point, and finally of a brush arranged upon guides to move continually against the under side of the shaker. The appellant, Smith, was the discoverer of the process of purification which was unknown before he invented the above combination.\nThe history of the invention, as stated by Mr. Smith and other witnesses in the case is stated in the judgment of Mr. Justice Patterson in the court below[2], and in the judgment of Henry, J., hereinafter given.\nIn answer to appellants\u2019 claim, the respondents contended that the novelty or combination was not patentable; that the patent was void: 1st. because prior patents had been issued in Canada to one Sherman and to one Lacroix, and that in a suit of this nature the patent to Lacroix could not be impeached, but sec. 29 of the Patent Act, 1872, points out the method of impeaching a patent namely by scire facias; 2nd. because that the patent was in public use by patentee in the United States; 3rd. because the patentee imported the machine into Canada after the expiration of 12 months from the issue; 4th. because the patentee failed to commence or carry on the construction or manufacture of the invention within two years from the date of the patent, and also because the respondents commenced to manufacture the article complained of prior to the application of Smith for a patent in Canada, and under sec. 6 of the Patent Act, the respondents have the right to continue such manufacture and sale. Some of the objections relied on by the respondents as avoiding the patent were previously heard and adjudicated upon by the Deputy Minister of Agriculture, under 28th section of the Patent Act, the Deputy Minister of Agriculture upholding the validity of the appellants\u2019 patent.\nMr. Bethune, Q.C., and Mr. Howland for appellants: On the question of patentable novelty relied on Crane v.

McQuewan[47].\nRITCHIE, C.J.:\u2014\nThis is a very important case. The main and substantial question raised and on which the case was decided in the court below, was whether the machine was a patentable machine, and the learned judges of the Court of Appeal held that the combination, though admittedly producing a useful result, was nevertheless not patentable in law.\nAfter a careful consideration of the evidence, I have arrived at the conclusion that this machine was a new combination of old machinery or instruments, whereby a new and useful result was obtained by which a new effect was produced which is stated to have revolutionized the manufacture of a certain description of flour producing a materially better article, and therefore, I think, it is the subject of a patent. I think where the patent is for a combination, the combination itself is the novelty and also the merit, and this view is, in my opinion, abundantly supported by the following authorities.\nIn Harrison v. Anderston Foundry Co.[48] the Lord Chancellor says:\nIt is, as I read it, a claim for a combination; that is to say, a combination of all the movements going to make up the whole of the mechanism described. It must for the present at least, be assumed that this combination as a combination is novel; that it is, to use the words of the Lord President, a new combination of old parts to produce a new result, or to produce a known result in a more useful and beneficial way. It is not doubted that a combination of which this may be said is the subject of a patent.\nIn Penn v. Bibby[49], the head note is as follows:\nThe new application of any means or contrivance may be the subject of a patent, if it lies so much out of the track of the former use as not naturally to suggest itself, but to require some application of thought and study.\n* * *\nLord Chelmsford, L.C., says:\nIt is very difficult to extract any principle from the various decisions on this subject, which can be applied with certainty to every case; nor, indeed, is it easy to reconcile them with each other. The criterion given by Lord Campbell in Brook v. Aston[50] has been frequently cited (as it was in the present argument), that a patent may be valid for the application of an old invention to a new purpose, but to make it valid there must be some novelty in the application. 1 cannot help thinking that there must be some inaccuracy in the report of his lordship\u2019s words, because, according to the proposition, as he stated it, if the invention is applied to a new purpose, there cannot but be some novelty in the application. Lord Chief Justice Cockburn approaches much nearer to the enunciation of a principle, or at least of a rule, for judging these cases, in Harwood v. Great Northern Railway Co.[51], where he says, \u201calthough the authorities establish the proposition that the same means, apparatus, or mechanical contrivance, cannot be applied to the same purpose, or to purposes so nearly cognate and similar as that the application of it in the one case naturally leads to application of it when required in some other, still the question in every case is one of degree, whether the amount of affinity or similarity which exists between the two purposes is such that they are substantially the same, and that determines whether the invention is sufficiently meritorious to be deserving of a patent.\u201d In every case of this description one main consideration seems to be, whether the new application is so much out of the track of the former use as not naturally to suggest itself to a person turning his mind to the subject, but to require some application of thought and study. Now, strictly applying this test, which cannot be considered an unfair one, to the present case, it appears to me impossible to say that the patented invention is merely an application of an old thing to a new purpose.\nIn Murray v. Clayton[52], the head note is as follows:\nWhere a machine, for which a patent had been granted, was shewn to produce work more expeditiously, more economically, and of a better quality than any previous machine:\u2014Held (reversing the decision of Bacon, L.C.,) that the patent could not be invalidated on the ground that the machine was formed by the mere arrangement of common elementary mechanical materials, producing results of the same nature as those previously accomplished by other mechanical arrangements and construction. The public exhibition of a machine in which there are defects, owing to which it proves an entire failure, does not affect the validity of a subsequent patent for a machine, in which, though similar in some of its details to the former, the defects are remedied so as to produce a serviceable machine.\n* * *\nAnd Sir W.M. James, L.J., says:\nThis evidence shews that the defendants, when competing for government work, with all the knowledge they possessed from this previous user, which is said to be an anticipation of the plaintiff\u2019s patent, never thought of anything in any way like the machine which the plaintiff invented; and it is scarcely possible to get stronger evidence of the entire novelty of the plaintiff\u2019s machine. The machine, too, when produced, is so simple and so completely adapted to effect its object, that one feels disposed to wonder how people could have gone on for thousands of years making bricks without ever having thought of it; but that is the case with many noted inventions\u2014when the thing is once hit it seems a marvel that it was not hit before.\nCannington v. Nuttal[53] decided that a patent might be sustained, though each principle or process in it was well known to all persons engaged in the trade, to which the patent relates, provided that the mode of combining these processes was new and produced a beneficial result; and provided also that the specification claimed not the old processes, or any one of them, but only the new combination; and it was held that a direction to a jury that if the combination has been and was useful the patent could be supported, though each separate process employed in it was previously known was correct.\nIn Crane v. Price[54], Tindal, C.J., says:\nSuch an assumed state of facts falls clearly within the principle exemplified by Abbott, C.J., in The King v. Wheeler[55], where he is determining what is and what is not the subject of a patent, viz.: It may perhaps extend to a new process, to be carried on by known implements or elements, acting upon known substances, and ultimately producing some other known substance, but producing it in a cheaper or more expeditious manner, or of a better or a more useful kind. And it falls also within the doctrine laid down by Lord Eldon in Hill v. Thompson[56], viz.: There may be a valid patent for a new combination of metals previously in use for the same purpose, or for a new method of applying such materials; but in order to its being effectual, the specification must clearly express that it is in respect of such new combination or application.\nThere are numerous instances of patents which have been granted when the invention consisted in no more than the use of things already known, the acting with them in a manner already known, the producing effects already known, but producing those effects so as to be more economically or beneficially enjoyed by the public. It will be sufficient to refer to a few instances, in some of which the patents have failed on other grounds, but in none on the objection that the invention itself was not the subject of a patent.\n* * *\nAnd at page 605:\n\u2026in point of law, the labor of thought or experiment, and the expenditure of money, are not the essential grounds of consideration upon which the questions, whether the invention is or is not the subject matter of a patent, ought to depend; for if the invention be new and useful to the public, it is not material whether it is the result of long experiments and profound research, or whether of some sudden and lucky thought, or of mere accidental discovery. The case of monopolies in\u2014Darcy v. Allein[57]\u2014states the law to be \u201cthat where a man by his own charge and industry, or by his own wit or invention, brings a new trade into the realm, or any engine tending to the furtherance of a trade that never was used before, and that for the good of the realm, the king may grant him a monopoly-patent for a reasonable time.\u201d\nIn Hayward v. Hamilton[58], Mr. Baron Pollock says:\nIn our judgment it is properly and fairly described; it is described as a patent claiming the construction of something by a combination of things, many of which\u2014possibly all of which\u2014may be old, in such a manner as to produce a result that is new, and a result which is valuable when it is treated as a commercial article. I do not think it is necessary to refer to the older cases on this subject. No doubt Crane v. Price[59] was in one\u2019s mind during the whole of the argument of this case. But we have a recent dictum on this point\u2014indeed, it is more than a dictum, because it is contained in the judgment of the House of Lords by the Lord Chancellor in the case of Cannington v. Nuttall[60]; and what the Lord Chancellor says is this: \u201cFew things come to be known now in the shape of new principles, but the object of an invention generally is the applying of well known principles to the achievement of a practical result not yet achieved; and I take it that the test of novelty is this; is the product which is the result of the apparatus for which an inventor claims letters patent effectively obtained by means of your new apparatus, whereas it had never before been effectively obtained by any of the separate portions of the apparatus which you have now combined into one valuable whole for the purpose of effecting the object you have in view.\u201d That seems to me as clear and as reasonable a definition as one can well have of that branch of the subject.\n* * *\nIn all these cases the real question must depend very much upon the extent to which the subject-matter, to which the particular apparatus or particular contrivance is applied, is cognate in its character, and wherever you find it is cognate in its character, and that there is not sufficient novelty in the combination which is put forward, then the patent cannot stand. If, however, it is otherwise, if the subject-matter is not cognate, or if the combination is really new, or if what is done comes within the language which was used in Crane v. Price, and in the later case of Cannington v. Nuttall, so as to show that there is in substance a new commercial product, then the patent is good.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nI am compelled to dissent from the conclusion which has been arrived at by the other members of the court in this appeal, for I think, upon the first ground taken in the very able judgment of Mr. Justice Patterson in the court below, the plaintiff\u2019s invention was not one entitled to the protection of a patent. Without going into any detailed examination of the evidence, which would now serve no useful purpose, but referring to the analysis of it contained in the judgments delivered in the Court of Appeal, and adopting the conclusions there arrived at, it appears to me very clear that the only invention of which the appellant can be entitled to claim the merit, is the combination of what is called \u201cThe Complete Middlings Purifier\u201d with the brushes worked by machinery instead of by hand. The machine without the attachment of the brushes is not claimed to be new. Then the application of the brushes moved by hand to what is called the bolt or sieve of a middlings purifier is also admitted by Smith to be old. The decree of the Court of Appeal, therefore, seems to me to be in exact conformity with the decree of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division in the case of Saxby v. The Gloucester Waggon Co.[61], where it was held that as any person of ordinary skill and knowledge of the subject, placing two inventions, known previous to the discovery of that covered by the plaintiffs patent, side by side, could effect the combination of the two in a manner similar to the plaintiffs invention without making any further experiments or obtaining any further information,\u2014the patent obtained by the plaintiff was void. Upon the principle of this decision and upon the authorities referred to by Mr. Justice Burton applied to the facts in evidence, I am of opinion that the plaintiff was not entitled to a patent, and that the judgment of the Court of Appeal affirming the decree dismissing the bill was correct and should be affirmed. FOURNIER, J.:\u2014\nI have read my brother Henry\u2019s notes in this case, and for the reasons contained in his notes, I am in favor of allowing the appeal.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\u2014\nI also fully concur in that judgment.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nThis is an action commenced by the appellants by a bill in chancery in Toronto, Ontario, amongst other things, to restrain the respondents from denying the validity of a certain patent of invention issued to George Thomas Smith, one of the appellants, and from making and constructing, using, or vending to others to be used, the machine, or any other machine, or machines, or part, or parts of a machine, or machines, embodying or involving the said patented invention, or any part thereof. And from causing or procuring other persons to manufacture, use or vend to others, to be used, any of the same, and from infringing the said letters patent or causing, or procuring the same to be infringed.\nThe bill was amended twice, and several answers were given to it. The case was decided by the learned Chancellor, before whom it was heard, against the appellants, not on the merits of the claim for the patent, but rather on the ground that the patentee had not complied with the terms of the patent in regard to the manufacture, in Canada, of the combined machinery described in the patent; and in regard to the importation into Canada, after twelve months, of the same. He says, however, that apart from such objections:\nI am inclined to think\u2014I would not say, that it is more than an inclination of my opinion\u2014I would say, that the patent is not in itself void, upon the evidence before me. What the other evidence is I do not know, but upon the other points I think the plaintiffs\u2019 case fails.\nAfter a good deal of consideration of the bill and answers, I am of opinion, that the main and important question raised by the pleadings and evidence is that upon which the judgment of the Appeal Court below was given. That judgment substantially admitted, and I think properly, that Smith was the real inventor of the art or process as contended for by the appellants. Being such, and having therefore been entitled to the patent which he obtained at the time it was issued, the court below decided that the subject-matter was not patentable.\nThe claim made in his application was for a machine called a \u201cMiddlings Purifier,\u201d consisting of the combination described in this patent. The object was to remove from what is called the \u201cMiddlings,\u201d produced in the grinding of wheat, by the operation of specific gravity, light fibrous impurities and fine particles of bran required to be separated to produce the finest quality of flour. The process is, therefore, \u201cpurification\u201d as well as \u201cseparation\u201d, the latter being all that can be effected by bolts or sieves only.\nIt is alleged in the appellants\u2019 factum and sustained by evidence that \u201cbefore the plaintiffs\u2019 invention it had been the object of millers to make the least possible quantity of middlings, as it had been found impossible to separate the fine particles of bran and other impurities from the coarse flour granules by sifting; and the middlings, when re-ground, made an inferior quality of flour. Since Smith\u2019s invention and discovery of the process of purification, this practice has been reversed; and millers now seek to make only coarse flour or middlings at the first grinding, in order to obtain the benefit of the purifying process, as it has been found that, by that process, certain light fibrous impurities can be removed, which the old process of sifting left, even in the finest flour.\u201d\nThe process of purification is by causing a thin stream of middlings to descend a slightly inclined sieve or bolt, through the meshes of which a current of air is drawn up by an exhausting fan, so as to pass upward through the middlings as they pass over or through the sieve or bolt. The current of air passing through this thin stream of middlings, lifts, and carries away, the light impurities, leaving the pure middlings, which have a greater specific gravity, to be ground into flour. It was found, however, that the current of air from below the sieve or bolt, by creating a resistance to the descent of the fine particles passing through the sieve or bolt, and, by accumulating them upon the under side of the sieve or bolt-cloth, clogged the latter so much, that unless constantly removed, the fan would fail to draw air through the cloth, the upward current of air would cease, and purification would not take place. The upward current of air through the sieve or bolt was the chief factor in producing the desired results; but it, when operating alone, by its action clogged up the sieve or bolt, and its beneficial operation was prevented. Before the invention, by Smith, it was attempted to keep the seive or bolt clear by hand brushing; but after a reasonable trial the attempt was abandoned, as it was found costly and unsatisfactory. Smith directed the experiments made in that way, and when the owner of the mill, where they were tried, discontinued them, he (Smith) made the combination of the machinery for which the patent issued to him. The result was most satisfactory, and its value may be, to some extent, estimated when flour of such superiority was, through its means, produced that was worth, and sold for, about three dollars a barrel more than that produced by any means previously known or used. It was, in regard to the public interests, a most valuable combination; and the public therefore became largely indebted to him who made it.\nWas that combination entitled through a patent to protection?\nThe result, in this case, is produced by the combined and simultaneous action of the draft upwards created by the fan and the continuous operation of the brush or brushes worked by the machinery as described in the specification. It was the simultaneous action which produced the result. It could not have been obtained by the independent action of either. It was, therefore, to all intents and purposes, a combination that produced simultaneous results\u2014it is true, a combination of old elements; but it is one in which the constituents so entered it that each qualified the other. Referring to the judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States in Pickering v. McCulloch[62], cited by Mr. Justice Burton in the court below, I may say that the constituents in this case are fully up to the standard therein adopted; they are \u201cjoint tenants\u201d of the domain of the invention, seized each of every part per my et per tout; and not mere tenants in common, with separate interests and estates.\nBy the co-operation of the constituents a new machine of a distinct character and function was formed; and a beneficial result produced by the cooperating action of the constituents, and not the mere adding together of separate contributions. The importance and value of the invention to the public in the case of the invention in question, cannot, under the evidence, be questioned; the circumstances connected with the discovery of the invention are not necessarily a matter for judicial inquiry, according to the ruling of Chief Justice Tindal in Crane v. Price and others[63]. In delivering judgment in that case, he said;\nBut in point of law, the labour of thought or experiments, and the expenditure of money, are not the essential grounds of consideration on which the question whether the invention is or is not the subject-matter of a patent, ought to depend. For if the invention be new and useful to the public it is not material whether it be the result of long experiments and profound research, or whether by some sudden and lucky thought, or mere accidental discovery.\nThere have been some most important inventions made by mere accidental discovery, and after being discovered the great wonder has been, that what appears after discovery so palpable, had never been discovered before. Such may be said to some extent of the discovery in this case; but that is no reason why the inventor should not get the benefit of his discovery, through its protection, as provided by law. The person entitled to a patent, is one who has invented any new and useful art, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement in any art, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, not known or used by others before his invention thereof; and not being in public use, or on sale, for more than one year, previous to his application in Canada, with the consent or allowance of the inventor thereof\u201485 Vic. ch. 6.\nThe evidence leaves no doubt on my mind that Smith was the first and only inventor of the combination he claims in his specification; and I feel as little doubt that the other parties who obtained the two other contesting patents became acquainted with the value of the combination by obtaining the knowledge of his discovery. There are one or two minor objections raised to his patent which I will hereafter dispose of. Setting out, then, with the affirmative proposition that Smith was the bon\u00e2 fide inventor of the combination in question, the only important remaining question is, was the dis- covery and invention in question the proper subject for protection by letters patent?\nAs some of the authorities I intend to refer to are decisions in cases in England, it is proper to ascertain what legislation affected the rights of parties to patents in that country. It will be seen that the right there depended on legislation, not nearly so liberal or extensive as that of the Canadian Act, or the patent laws of the United States. Curtis in his work on patents[64] says:\nIn England the corresponding system has rested upon a proviso in the statute of monopolies, which excepted from the prohibitions of that act letters-patent, granted by the Crown for the sole working or making of any manner of new manufactures within this realm to the first and true inventor or inventors of such manufactures, which others at the time of the making of such letters-patent and grants did not use, so they be not contrary to the law, nor mischievous to the state.\nThe principle upon which the exception referred to was made, was clearly that he who has first exercised the right of invention has bestowed something upon society, which ought to procure for him thereafter, at least for a time, the exclusive right to make or use that thing.\nThe same writer[65] referring to the English statute says:\nThe subjects of patents which could be lawfully granted were to be \u201cnew manufactures\u201d or \u201cthe working or making of new manufactures\u201d invented by the grantee, and which \u201cothers\u201d at the time of the grant \u201cdid not use.\u201d Hence it was apparent that something of a corporeal nature, something to be made, or at least the process of making something, or of producing some effect or result in matter, or the practical employment of art or skill, and not theoretical conception or abstract ideas, must constitute the subjects of exclusive. privileges which the Crown was authorized to grant. See The King v. Wheeler[66]. Referring to the decision in Boulton v. Bull[67], Mr. Curtis says:\nThe distinction to which this case gave rise and which greatly extended the meaning of the term \u201cmanufacture,\u201d is this, that although a principle or a rule in mechanics, or an elementary truth in physics cannot be the subject of a patent, yet a new principle, rule or truth, developed, carried out, and embodied in the mode of using it, may be the subject of a patent. A mere principle is an abstract discovery incapable of answering the term \u201cmanufacture;\u201d but a principle so far embodied and connected with corporal substances as to be in a condition to act and produce effects in any art, trade, mystery, or manual occupation becomes the practical manner of doing a particular thing. It is no longer a principle, but a \u201cprocess.\u201d\nHe refers, to sustain those views, to the decision of Eyre, C.J., in Boulton v. Bull[68], a quotation from which will be found at page 3. His Lordship there says:\nIt was admitted at the argument at the bar that the word \u201cmanufacture\u201d in the statute was of extensive signification, that it applied not only to things made but to the practice of making, to principles carried into practice in a new manner, and to the results of principles carried into practice * * * Under the practice of making we may class all new artificial manners of operating with the hand, or with instruments in common use, new processes in any art producing effects useful to the public.\u201d * * * When the effect produced is no substance or composition of things, the patent can only be for the mechanism, if new mechanism is used, or for the process, if it be a new method of operating, with or without old mechanism by which the effect is produced. To illustrate this: The effect produced by Mr. David Hartley\u2019s invention for securing buildings from fire is no substance or composition of things; it is a mere negative quality, the absence of fire. The effect is produced by a new method of disposing iron plates in buildings. In the nature of things it could not be for the effect produced. I think it could not be for making the plates of iron, which, when disposed in a particular manner, produced the effect, for those things are in common use. But the invention consists in the method of disposing those plates of iron so as to produce their effect; and that effect being a useful and meritorious one, the patent seems to have been properly granted to him for his method of securing buildings from fire. His Lordship thus concludes his judgment:\nNow, I think these methods may be said to be new manufactures, in one of the common acceptances of the word, as we speak of the manufactory of glass, or any other thing of that kind.\nHere, then, is laid down most explicitly the doctrine deduced from the English statute for patents under the terms \u201cnew manufactures, or the working or making of new manufactures.\u201d It is exactly the case before us under Smith\u2019s application for the \u201ccombination\u201d or \u201cmethod\u201d he claims. The specification or claim made by Smith admits that the elements of the combination were old, and that other machines had existed, in which some of those elements had been found working together, though never arranged in the combination, and adapted to the purpose described. It is therefore objected that the mere combination is not patentable. His patent being confined to the combination, the court below decided he was not entitled to it. That decision, in my opinion, is not only contrary to the doctrine laid down by Eyre, C.J., before in part recited, but to the current of the decisions since, both in England and the United States, which establish the position that a new arrangement of old parts producing new results beneficial to the public is patentable. See the cases referred to in the appellant\u2019s factum: Crane v. Price[69]; Lewis v. Davis[70]; Cannington v. Nuttal[71]; Murray v. Clayton[72]; Union Sugar Refining Co. v. Mathieson[73]; and also Hailes v. Van Wormer[74]\nIn Hailes v. Van Wormer, Mr Justice Strong said:\u2014\nAll the devices of which the alleged combination is made are confessedly old. No claim is made for any of them singly as an independent invention. It must be conceded that a new combination, if it produces new and useful results is patentable, though all the consti- tuents of the combination were well known, and in common use before the combination was made. But the results must be a product of the combination, and not a mere aggregate of several results, each the complete product of one of the combined elements.\nThe combination claimed by Smith is, in principle, the same as in the case of the disposition of the iron plates, the subject of the decision of Eyre, C.J., before in part recited. The constituents were old, but the combination or method was new. The result in the one case was but preventive in regard to security against fire, but the other was the production, by means never before known or used, of a superior quality of flour never before produced, and by a very cheap and available process. If the inventor in the one case was entitled to a patent for a useful discovery, upon no principle could it be refused to the other. Smith\u2019s combination was, in the terms of the concluding sentence above quoted of the judgment of Mr. Justice Strong, the means of producing a direct and combined result, not a mere aggregate of several results. There was but one result and it was produced, and could only be produced by the simultaneous action of the constituents. The operation of the combined constituents was performed on the mixed product of the result of grinding, consisting of fine flour, middlings, bran and impurities, whilst the same was, by the necessary mechanical contrivances, passing through the bolt, and at no other time. The draft upwards by itself was useless, and the constant and simultaneous aid of the brushes was necessary to enable that draft to be effective. By operating the constituents, unless simultaneously, the object could not be obtained. There was, therefore, by their union and simultaneous action, and in no other way, produced the important results shown by the evidence. To give the inventor a patent for his combination was no favor. By law he was entitled to it as being well earned. Although unnecessary, I will quote some further authorities. Whitman, in his work on patents, says[75]:\u2014\nA machine is rightfully the subject of a patent whenever a new or an old effect is produced by mechanism new in its combinations, arrangements, or mode of operation. A machine is rightfully the subject of a patent when well known effects are produced by machinery entirely new in all its combinations, or when a new or an old effect is produced by mechanism of which the principle or modus operandi is new.\nAgain[76]:\nThere may be a patent for a new combination of machines to produce certain effects, whether the machines constituting the combination be new or old.\nAt page 238, under a classification of \u201cInventions pertaining to Machines,\u201d he includes:\nThose, where all the elements of the machine are old, and where the invention consists in a new combination of those elements, whereby a new and useful result is obtained Most of the modern inventions are of this latter kind, and many of them are of great utility and value. See Union Sugar Refinery v. Mathieson[77].\nHe might have added that numerous inventions have been carried out and perfected by the co-operation of many minds or by the application of varied genius to the same object, year after year and age after age.\nAt page 241 the same author says:\nWhere the result or effect is a greatly improved article of manufacture it may be the test from which inventions may be inferred.\nLet us now look at Curtis, another American authority on Patents In his treatise he says[78]:\nThere may be a patent for a new combination of machines to produce certain effects, whether the machines constituting the combination be new or old. In such cases the thing patented is not the separate machines, but the combination.\nAnd he cites six American decisions to sustain the proposition. At page 20, in a note, he cites a decision of Abbott, L.C.J., in The King v. Wheeler[79], in which I find his Lordship saying in respect of the right of a person to a patent:\nOr it may perhaps extend also to a new process to be carried on by known implements or elements acting on known substances and ultimately producing some other known substance by producing it in a cheaper or more expeditious manner, or of a better and more useful kind.\nHe also cites from Webster\u2019s Patent cases (Cornish v. Green)[80] from which I extract the following:\nThe use of all materials in other combinations may have been known before; but if they are used in a new combination producing a new result, there will be a good subject for a patent for a \u201cmanufacture;\u201d as there is, in respect to \u201cmachinery,\u201d when the same thing is effected.\nThe right to obtain a patent for a new combination of old constituents producing a new and useful result is fully admitted in a comparatively recent case (Clark v. Adie)[81], and such is unequivocally alleged by lord Gordon, who says:\nThere is no doubt whatever that there may be a patent right in a combination, and there may be a patent granted for improvements in machinery, but in order to carry out the patent in a legal and proper manner, there ought to be distinct intimation given to the public of what was the intention of the party proposing to take out the patent, with a view to prevent others infringing on what he claims as his invention. There may possibly be cases of subordinate combinations protected by a patent as my noble and learned friend on the woolsack has explained.\nI will refer to but one more case, Harrison et al v. The Anderston Foundry Company[82]. In his judgment in that case the Lord Chancellor Cairns says:\nIn my opinion the first claim is also sufficient in point of form. It is, as I read it, a claim for a combination, that is to say, a combination of all the movements going to make up the whole of the mechanism described. It must for the present, at least, be assumed that this combination, as a combination, is novel; that it is, to use the words of the lord president, a new combination of old parts to produce a new result, or to produce a known result in a more useful and beneficial way. It is not doubted that a combination of which this may be said, is the subject of a patent. If there is a patent for a combination, the combination itself is ex necessitate the novelty.\nLord Hatherly, referring to the case of Foxwell v. Bostock[83], says:\nIt could not have been meant in that case to say that where that happens, which may well happen, that a person arranging his machinery in a totally different way from the way in which it has ever before been arranged, although every single particle of that machinery is a well known implement, produces an improved effect by his new arrangement, that new arrangement cannot be the subject of the patent. It may be said that the levers may be perfectly well known in their mode of action, and it may be that all the other portions of the machinery to which the patent relates may be perfectly well known; but if he says: \u201cI take all those known parts and I adjust them in a manner totally different from that in which they have ever before been adjusted; I have found out just what it is that has made these parts, though they have been used in machinery, fail to produce their proper effect, and it is this, that they have not been properly arranged. I have, therefore, reconsidered the whole matter and put all these several parts together in a mode in which they never were before arranged, and have produced an improved effect by so doing.\u201d I apprehend it is competent for that man so to do. That, my lords, I apprehend, is the principle of a patent for a combination.\nUnder all the authorities I have quoted, and many others that I might have quoted, I cannot conceive that any doubt should exist that the combination claimed by Smith is the proper subject of a patent. I have considered the reasons given for the decision in Harwood v. The Great Northern Railway Co.[84] upon which the judgment in the court below was principally rested, but I cannot perceive any similarity in the principle upon which that case was decided and the case before us. In that case there was really no new result. The constituents were all admitted to be old\u2014there was no combination, as such, but the mere application of grooved plates in connecting rails of railways; and the principle was decided not to be new because the same kind of grooved plates had previously been applied for connecting timbers in the construction of bridges. It was, however, clearly admitted in that case that a new combination of old materials, producing a new and useful result, is properly the subject of a patent.\nAn objection has been taken, that under one or other of the conditions imposed upon a patantee under section 28 of the Patent Act, Smith\u2019s patent became null and void. The proviso to the provisions of that section is as follows:\nAnd provided always that in case disputes should arise as to whether a patent has or has not become null and void under the provisions of this section, such disputes shall be settled by the Minister of Agriculture or his deputy, whose decision shall be final.\nThe evidence shows that a complaint, by petition, was made to the Minister of Agriculture under the provisions of that section in 1876 setting forth that the three patents to the appellant, including the one in question, were null and void under the provisions of that section. After a lengthened and exhaustive investigation, in which both parties were represented by able counsel before Mr. Tach\u00e9, the Deputy Minister of Agriculture, he, in a very logical and sound judgment, in which he reviewed the law and commented on the evidence, decided that Smith had not forfeited his patent rights or any of them, in any of the three patents. The statute makes his decision final; and, in view of the whole subject, I have arrived at the conclusion that parliament intended that it should be so; and that it was intended solely as a matter for ministerial, and not for judicial, determination. But in case of any doubt, on that subject, I will add that, having well considered the case, as presented before him, I would have come to the same conclusion as he did. I think the law as laid down and explained by him in his exhaustive, and, I will add, able judgment, cannot properly be questioned. I concur fully in his conclusions, as I do also in his reasons. The patent now in question, being one of the three referred to in the judgment just mentioned, was issued for five years from the 18th of April, 1873. The judgment of the Deputy Minister of Agriculture was given on the 15th February, 1877. The extension of the patent was given on the 30th of March, 1878, for a further period of five years. The infringement is admitted by the respondents, and having dealt with the case, as presented at the argument before us, I have only to express my opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs, and the necessary decree ordered for the plaintiffs on the bill filed by them.\nGWYNNE, J.:\nAt the close of the argument of this case I was of opinion that the only point requiring further consideration was that upon which the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario proceeded, namely, that the combination in virtue of which the patentee claims that his patent should be sustained, was not, in point of law, the proper subject of a patent, the learned counsel for the appellant having, in my opinion, fully answered in his very able argument all the other objections. Now, upon the question whether the combination is or not the proper subject of a patent\u2014it appears to me, I confess, not to be altogether immaterial, although not conclusive, that after a protracted contestation, which must have involved enquiry into the patentable character of the combination, the plaintiff Smith obtained a patent in the United States. Apart from this consideration, however, there was not in the case of Harwood v. The G.N. Ry. Co.[85], upon which the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in the present case rests, any difference of opinion as to the rule of law there enunciated, namely, that one cannot have a patent for a well-known mechanical contrivance, merely when it is applied in a manner or to a purpose which is not quite the same, but is analogous to the manner or the purpose in or to which it has been hitherto notoriously used; the point upon which considerable difference of opinion did exist, arose on the facts of the case, namely, whether an additional result was not obtained by the application of grooved fish plates to connecting the rails of railways over that which had been obtained by the application of grooved plates to connecting timbers in the construction of bridges. It does not seem to have been doubted that, if a new result had been obtained, it would have been a good subject for a patent. It is, however, equally a rule of law which was not disputed in Harwood v. Great Northern Railway Company, that a new combination of old materials producing a new beneficial result is the valid subject of a patent.\nThe difficulty in these cases consists in the application of the rules of law to the circumstances of each case, not in any conflict of opinion as to what are the rules of law. The question in this case is, what rule of law is applicable to the circumstances of the present case? And with deference to the opinions of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, I do not think that the present case comes within the rule enunciated in Harwood v. The Great Northern Railway Co., upon which the judgments of the House of Lords and of the Exchequer Chamber in that case was rested. There the patent was for constructing fishes for connecting the rails of railways, with a groove adapted for receiv- the heads of the bolts or rivets employed for securing such fishes, and the application of such fishes for connecting the rails of railways in the manner in the specifications described, and by his specifications the patentee stated the advantages of the groove to be two, namely, that it serves to receive the square head of the bolts, and to prevent their turning round when they are being screwed in, and further that it renders the fish lighter for equal strength, or stronger for an equal weight of metal, than fish if made of equal thickness throughout. Upon the trial it was found as a fact that \u201cchannelled\u201d\u2014that is \u201cgrooved\u201d\u2014iron had been used before the patent for the double purpose of obtaining increased strength and preventing the bolt heads from turning round, but that they were not used for the purpose of fishing. It was also found as a fact that the use of iron plates ungrooved for fishes was known, and that for strengthening timbers in bridges and bolting them together, the use of iron plates grooved was known, and that the special advantages when so applied, of securing the bolt heads and of affording equal strength with less material were also known, Now, under these circumstances, the only question was, as stated by lord Westbury in the House of Lords, whether there could be any invention in the plaintiff taking a thing which had been used as a fish for a bridge, and using it as a fish for a railway\u2014the purpose of the application in both cases and the result being the same. That the application of a series of brushes, as used in Smith\u2019s machine in the case before us, to the bolting surface of a flour bolt in combination with a current of air made to pass through the bolt by means of an air chamber or fan, is new, does not appear to be disputed; indeed, in the judgment of the Court of Appeal, it is admitted that there is no evidence that any one before Smith made use of this combination; that the result obtained by the use of this combination is wholly new there is no doubt, for, by this mode of making flour, it is admitted that a quality of flour superior to anything before known is obtained, and that, in fact, thereby a complete revolution is wrought in the manufacture of flour. Under these circumstances, I cannot see how Harwood v. The Great Northern Ry, Co. can apply. So neither can Saxby v. Gloucester Waggon Company[86]. There it was held, that the combination of two formerly known articles, which had been the subject of patents, was not the subject of a patent because no new result was obtained by the combination different from that which had been obtained by the previous inventions; and the question seems to have been whether, admitting that no new result was obtained by the combination, it could be said that to make it, called forth the exercise of the inventive faculties so as to justify the application to it of the term invention. The cases of Haywood v. Hamilton[87] and Cannington v. Nuttal[88], are more applicable: that the combination of known things so as to create a new and artificial result is the subject of a patent; and that the combination first used by Smith does create such a result there can, I think, be no doubt. The combination, therefore, does come within the meaning of invention as applied to patents.\nThe purpose for which the brushes are applied in this case is different from that for which they were applied in the Buchholz machine for making semolina or cracked wheat. In the latter, they were used for forcing upwards the particles of cracked grain which were too large to pass through the meshes of the bolting cloth; in Smith\u2019s patent they are used for the purpose of brushing down- wards the fine flour underneath the cloth, which after having passed through it are forced back against the cloth by the current of air going upwards, and which is thus impeded. The combination having been first used by Smith and applied by him to produce a wholly new result, which is highly beneficial and of the greatest utility in the manufacture of flour, the combination is, in my opinion, the proper subject of a patent, and the infringement being admitted, the plaintiffs are entitled to a decree in the court below for an account and a perpetual injunction. The appeal, therefore, should be allowed with costs and a decree ordered to be entered accordingly for the plaintiffs in the Court of Chancery with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Howland, Arnoldi & Ryerson.\nSolicitors for respondents: Ball & Ball.\n[1] 7 Ont.

Notary, duty of\u2014Arts. 646, 650 C. C. P. Q. Appeal.\nA., who had a claim against the insolvent estate of Dr. B. purchased a right of redemption Dr. B. had at the time of his death in a certain piece of land; and in order that B., et al., (the respondents Dr. B's. children) who were perfectly solvent, should accept the succession of Dr. B. A. caused to be prepared a deed of assignment by a notary of this right of redemption to B. et al. who, a few days after the death of their father, had been induced for a sum of $50 to consent to exercise this right of redemption. The notary who prepared the deed without the knowledge of B. et al., returned it to A., telling him that he did not like to receive the deed because he believed that in signing it B. et al. made themselves heirs of Dr. B, and beside she believed that if B. et al. knew that in signing the deed they accepted the succession of their father, and were responsible for his debts, they would not sign. Another notary residing at a distance was sent for by A to whom he gave the deed as prepared, and the notary then went to the residence of B. et al. read the deed to the parties, and without any explanation whatever passed and executed the deed of cession whereby B. et al. became responsible for the debts of their father. On being informed of the legal effect of their signature, B. et al. formally renounce to the succession of their father There was also evidence that B. et al. had done some conservatory acts and acts of administration for their mother but it was not proved that in any of these transactions they had taken the quality of heirs.\nHeld, That, although the amount claimed by the declaration was made to exceed $2000 by including interest which had been barred by prescription the appeal would lie. That the acceptance of an insolvent succession is null and of no effect when it is the result of deceit and corrupt practices artifices and fraud. That as A. in this case obtained the signatures of B. et al, to the deed in question by fraud; the latter should not be burdened with the debts of their insolvent father.\nThat it is the duty of a notary when executing a deed to explain to an illiterate grantor the legal and equitable obligations imposed by the deed and consequent on its execution. [Henry, J, dissenting. J]\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) ([1]) affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, dismissing the present appellant's action.\nThe appellant alleged in his action, that, by deed of transfer, made in the city of Montreal on the 80th November, 1863, Charles Paphenus Anaclet Boucher transferred to the said appellant an amount of eight hundred dollars ($800.00), to have and to take, in principal and interest, in the succession of the late Fran\u00e7ois Boucher, upon the moneys appertaining to the said Boucher, in the said succession, by and in virtue of the wills of the said late Francois Boucher and of the late J. Olivier; that the said transfer was served upon the Rev. C. P. O, Morrison, one of the interested parties in the said successions.\nThat, on the 24th of September, 1869, the said plaintiff cancelled the said deed of transfer but reserved to himself all the rights which he could have against the said C. P. A. Bouch\u00e9r, for the sum of $445.93, a balance which he declared was still due him on the said transfer to which the said C. P.A. Boucher, represented by\u2014Mousseau, Esq., his attorney ad litem, consented; that the interest accrued upon the said sum of $445.93, amounts to $349.81; that by a deed of sale, dated March 8th, 1867, the said C. P. A. Boucher sold to the firm of Ayotte and March arid a piece of land, for $660, paid in cash; that, in May, 1869, the said land was sold by the sheriff for hypothecary debts contracted by the said C. P. A. Boucher and existing? at the time of the said sale and that the said firm of Ayotte & Marchand received nothing from the proceeds of such sale; that the said sum of $660 and the interest accrued thereon amounts to $1,283.70, and is still due by the heirs of C. P. A. Boucher; that, on the 80th of April, 1867, the said Noe O. Marchand transferred to the said appellant the half of the said land, as well as the half of all his rights in the said firm \u00ab that the said transfer was served by a notice published twice in the newspapers, in August, 1880, and a copy deposited in the office of the prothonotary, in September, 1880; that the said C. P. A. Boucher contracted marriage with S. Salmon on the 25th of January, 1881; that from the said marriage have issued and are still living, seven children, among whom are the respondents * that the said C. P. A. Boucher died on the 16th March, 1872, without having made a will, leaving his said seven children as his heirs; that the respondents were the only ones who accepted the succession of the said C. P. A. Boucher, by taking the quality of heirs in authentic deeds and particularly in a deed of assignment of a right of redemption their father had in a certain piece of land executed on the 2nd April, 1872, before H. G. Fusey, notary public, and by performing other acts of heir ship. And appellant demanded $2,029.54.\nThe respondents pleaded a general denial of the facts alleged in the demand and especially by another defence, that they had not accepted the succession of the said C. P. A. Boucher; that, on the contrary, they had renounced it by deed before J. O. Chalut, notary, on the .23rd of May, 1877, and, consequently, that they were not liable to pay any of the amounts claimed by the action; that the deed of assignment of the right of redemption, of the 2nd April, 1872, pleaded by the appellant as being on the part of the respondents a deed of acceptance of the succession of the said C. P. A. Boucher, had been consented to by the respondents without any cause or consideration whatever ; that the said deed was obtained from the respondents by the deceit and corrupt practices of the appellant, and they asked that it be declared, that the acceptance which they were alleged to have made, by the said deed of assignment was the result of the deceit of the appellant and that it be annulled and declared null and of no effect\nThe respondents also pleaded that the deed of transfer consented to by Marchand to the appellant had never been served.\nThe Superior Court by its judgment of the 16th of March, 1882, maintained the claims of the respondents and dismissed the action of the appellant. This judgment was confirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench sitting in appeal, at Quebec, in October, 1882.\nFrom this judgment the appellant appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nThe question which arose on this appeal was whether under the circumstances there had been a valid acceptance by the respondents of their father's succession.\nMr. Laflamme, Q.C., for appellant :\nThe respondents accepted their father's succession formally, by taking the quality of heirs and styling themselves as such in an authentic deed of transfer of tights of redemption made by them and dame Suzanne Salmon to the appellant on the 20th April, 1872.\nThe naked question therefore is : Was the deed of transfer of the right of redemption the result of fraud, deception and artifices on the part of the appellant? I contend that the evidence throughout positively shoes that it was not. Respondents first attempted to fasten fraud on the appellant, from the fact that he employed a notary residing in the adjoining parish, instead of the resident notary at Maskinong\u00e9, to draw the deed. The reason of appellant's conduct is simple. When the deed was drawn there was but one resident notary at Maskinong\u00e9, a gentleman named Galipeau.\nBut it is said that if respondents had known the responsibility they were assuming, they would never have signed the deed.\nIt is possible but is it a valid reason in law that because one has not foreseen the consequence of one's own act that one is not to be held accountable for it? The doctrine is, to say the least, new, that gives a party the right to repudiate his acts because they do not prove advantageous,\nBut, even supposing appellant was aware that by signing the deed respondents were performing an act the cons\u00e9quences of which might prove disadvantageous to them should such a contract be set aside on the ground of fraud? Why, we see in every-day business, transactions in which persons, not foreseeing all the cons\u00e9quences, enter into contracts which turn out disastrously. Has the law any resource in reserve to compensate the losses of unfortunate speculators who freely and voluntarily bind themselves to an obligation, in the hope of reaping a profit? With Demolombe ([2]) we hardly think so.\nAll the authorities say that a contract to be null for fraud or deception the fraud must have taken place with regard to the object itself, and not with regard to the consequences, and we believe that opinion to be founded not only in law but on common sense. [The learned counsel also contended upon the facts there had been a tacit acceptance]. Mr. Hould for respondents :\nThe acceptance is tacit when the heirs perform an act which necessarily implies an intention to accept, there is no evidence to that effect here.\nAs to the express acceptance relied on, we submit that the conduct of the appellant showed such deceit and bad faith as to preclude him from reaping any benefit resulting from the signatures of the respondents to the deed of cession in question.\nThe learned counsel then commented on the evidence and cited Laurent ([3]); Demolombe ([4]); Pothier ([5]); Dalloz ([6]); Bedarride, De la Fraude ([7]); and arts 984, 991, C. C. L. C.\nRITCHIE, C. J.;\u2014\nThe right of the appellant to recover in this action depends upon the acceptance of the succession of C. P. A. Boucher by respondents.\nI think the Superior Court and the majority of the Court of Queen's Bench were justified in coming to the conclusion that the heirs of C. P. A. Boucher were imposed on by the appellant in obtaining from them for a nominal consideration equal to $7.14 to each of the heirs, the passing of the deed of assignment of April 2, 1872, sixteen days after the death (16th March, 1872,) of the said C P. A. Boucher, imposing liabilities and burdens out of all reason in comparison with the consideration proposed to be paid, by establishing thereby their acceptance of the succession of their father, which he well knew to be insolvent, and thereby making them responsible for his debts of Which appellant now claims to be a creditor to the extent of $2,079, the appellant well knowing, as the evidence establishes, that the heirs were entirely ignorant of such being the effect of their so passing the said deed; and likewise well knowing from the notary who prepared the deed, that if they were aware of such being its effect they would not sign the said deed; the appellant knowing all which, and the youth and inexperience of the heirs, adopted means to keep them in ignorance by securing the services of a notary resident in another parish and passing by his own notary in the parish in which all parties resided, and to whom he had applied in the first instance to prepare the deed, and who actually prepared it, but who evidently would not pass it without explaining to the heirs its nature and effect, which, if done, would, as the said notary intimated to the appellant, prevent the heirs from executing it. The conduct of the notary is to be applauded, as the conduct of this appellant in his endeavors to obtain an advantage by means of the ignorance and the keeping in ignorance of these heirs is to be reprobated.\nIt appears to me to be the duty of a notary. to explain to an illiterate grantor, if he has reason to believe he does not understand the legal and equitable obligations imposed by a deed and consequent on its execution, its nature and effect, more particularly so, when the deed is prepared by him at the instance and by the instruction of the vendee, and such party is especially benefited by the deed by its ulterior and indirect effect; and if such a vendee purposely withdraws the passing of such a deed by a grantor so situate from the notary who prepares it because he knows he will not pass it without informing the grantor of circumstances within his knowledge, which would, if known to him, prevent his executing it; or if, without ascertaining that the grantor so situate fully understands its legal effect, to avoid and prevent the grantor receiving explanations and information relative thereto, and procures a strange notary ignorant of the circumstances, rendering its execution so disastrous to the grantor, such as in this case, (the insolvency of a succession) to pass the deed with unquestionably the sole view that the grantor may be kept in ignorance of the consequences, and thereby of imposing burthens on this illiterate and ignorant grantor for his benefit, the party so acting is, in my opinion, guilty of such bad faith as to preclude him from reaping the benefit resulting from the execution of such a deed, as if it had been bond fide executed with the knowledge of its effects and full intention that such effects should result therefrom.\nIn this case it is clear from the testimony of the notary Galipeau that the sole object of the appellant in getting the heirs to sign the act of cession, was to fix them with the debts of their father ; that he was in-formed and well knew that if they knew that such would be the effect they would not execute the instrument, and he purposely, by changing the notary, prevented them from obtaining such information, but availing himself of their ignorance, knowingly practised on. such ignorance and obtained the deed which he could not otherwise have done had he acted in good faith and permitted the notary who drew the deed to explain its nature and effect to those illiterate people which it was his duty to do. It was not reticence alone it was in this case, not simply a suppressio veri on appellant's part, but by his acts he prevented the heirs from obtaining the information from a legitimate sources showing a determination to keep them in ignorance, and to take advantage of that ignorance, and so gain an advantage over them. Therefore I think he obtained the deed in bad faith, and this alleged acceptance having been the result of the evil practices and artifices of the appellant, amounting to fraud, is therefore null and of no effect, and cannot be relied on by the appellant to burthen these children for his benefit with the debts of their insolvent father.\nHaving got rid of the effect of the deed of cession I think: the children did no other act whereby they can be held to have accepted the succession of their late father; in the acts and matters relied on, they only acted as the agents of their mother and in obedience to her orders.\nSTRONG, J., concurred with Fournier, J., in dismissing the appeal.\nFOURNIER, J. :\u2014\nLes Intim\u00e9s sont poursuivis en cette cause comme les h\u00e9ritiers de leur p\u00e8re, feu le Dr Boucher, pour la somme de $2,079000 que l'appelant pr\u00e9tend lui \u00eatre due en vertu de divers titres cites en sa d\u00e9claration.\nLe Dr Boucher n'a laiss\u00e9 que fort peu de choses dans sa succession, une vente judiciaire de ses biens ayant en lieu peu de temps avant sa mort, arriv\u00e9e le 17 mars 1872. Il poss\u00e9dait, comme gr\u00e8ve de substitution, certains biens dont, \u00e0 sa mort, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 revenait \u00e0 ses enfants. Lors de son d\u00e9cas, il \u00e9tait reconnu comme insolvable.\nSa veuve, dame Suzanne Salmon, et ses enfants ont continu\u00e9 de demeurer dans la maison qu'occupait le Dr Boucher lors de son d\u00e9cas. Il n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait d'inventaire de sa succession qu'\u00e0 la mort de son \u00e9pouse arriv\u00e9e le 10 avril 1877.\nL'appelant pr\u00e9tend qu'ils sont devenus ses ' d\u00e9biteurs pour avoir le 2 avril 1872, pris la qualit\u00e9 d'h\u00e9ritiers de leur p\u00e8re, dans un acte de cession d'un droit de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 appartenant \u00e0 sa succession; et aussi pour s'\u00eatre en diverses circonstances, immisc\u00e9s dans les affaires de la succession, sans avoir fait d'inventaire.\nLes intim\u00e9s out ni\u00e9 formellement toutes les allegations de la demande, et sp\u00e9cialement la. qualit\u00e9 d'h\u00e9ritiers que leur attribue l'appelant. Ils ont all\u00e9gu\u00e9 qu'au contraire ils avaient renonc\u00e9e \u00e0 la succession do leur p\u00e8re, par acte devant J. O. Chalut, notaire, le 23 mai 1877. Quant \u00e0 l'acta de cession du 2 avril 1872 dans lequel ils paraissent avoir pris la qualit\u00e9 d'h\u00e9ritiers, ils all\u00e8guent qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 onsenii par eux sans aucune cause ni consid\u00e9ration; que le dit acte a \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenu par des moyens do dol et de fraude pratiqu\u00e9s contre eux par l'appelant et ils en demandent l'annulation\nL'action du demandeur a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, et ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Bane do le Reine. C'est de ce dernier jugement dont l'appelant se plaint.\nLes intim\u00e9s soutiennent le jugement qui leur a donn\u00e9 gain do cause, et pr\u00e9tendent, de plus, qu'il n'y en a pas d'appel \u00e0 cette cour. Le montant de la demande est de $2,079000, mais dans ce montant est comprise une somme pour int\u00e9r\u00eats qui \u00e0 la face memo do la d\u00e9claration, sont prescrits et pour lesquels l'appelant n'a certainement pas droit d'action. Cette somme disent les Intim\u00e9s, doit \u00eatre d\u00e9duite do la demande, \u00e0 laquelle elle n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9e quo pour rondre la cause appelable, en en portant le montant \u00e0 uno somme exc\u00e9dant $2000. Los intim\u00e9s n'ont point plaid\u00e9 en droit \u00e0 cette partie do la demande, et aucun jugement s\u00e9par\u00e9 n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu sur cette partie do la demande, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e in toto par los deux cours. Le jugement dont so plaint l'appelant est le renvoi d'uno demanda do $2079.00. Il a donc droit d'en appeler. Il est vrai qu'\u00e0 l'argument l'appelant est force d'admettre qu'une partie do sa demanda n'est pas fond\u00e9e, mais ii n'en a pas r\u00e9duit le montant par aucun acte formel. Il a droit au jugement do la cour sur cette parte comme sur le surplus b\u00e9 sa demande, Cette cour a admis dans plusieurs circonstances que c'est le montant de Ia demande qui sort do base pour d\u00e9terminer le droit d'appel et non pas celui du jugement. La cause ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue appelable par le montant demande dans les conclusions ii faudrait pour lui faire perdre ce caract\u00e8re, une r\u00e9duction do cette demande soit par un acte de proc\u00e9dure do la part du demandeur, soit par un jugement pass\u00e9 en form de chose jug\u00e9e. Aucune de ces circonstances ne Se rencontrant dans lecas actuelle le demandeur a droit d'appeler du jugement qui a renvoy\u00e9 sa demande. Voir \u00e0 ce sujet Bidoche ([8]) :\nNo. 138. Demandes r\u00e9duites. Si la demande originaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9duite pendant l'instance, ce sont les derni\u00e8res conclusions qui fixent la comp\u00e9tence, quant au ressort.\nCe principe est confirm\u00e9 par une longue suite d'arr\u00eats cites au m\u00eame endroit.\nNo. 139. Toutefois la r\u00e9duction des conclusions du demandeur ne rend l'appel non recevable qu'autant quo los conclusions rectificatives ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises en pr\u00e9sence du d\u00e9fendeur : autrement ce serait lui enlever un moyen do recours contre lequel ii a d\u00fb compter.\nSur le m\u00e9rite les faits de la cause donnent lieu aux deux questions suivantes : lo. Est-ce par le dol et la fraude quo l'Appelant a obtenu des intim\u00e9s la d\u00e9claration d'h\u00e9ritiers quills ont faite dans l'acte do cession du 2 avril 1872? 20. Les autres faits d'immixtion dans les affaires do la succession reproch\u00e9s aux Intim\u00e9s constituent-ils, dans les circonstances o\u00f9 ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accomplis, une acceptation do la succession de leur p\u00e8re?\nEn examinant la preuve on est d'abord frapp\u00e9 par l'empressement que l'appelant a mis \u00e0 faire faire l'acte du 2 avril 1877. La loi donnait aux intim\u00e9s un d\u00e9lai de trois mois pour faire proc\u00e9der \u00e0 un inventaire des biens d\u00e9laissas par le Dr Boucher et en outre un d\u00e9lai do quarante jours apr\u00e8s l'inventaire termin\u00e9, pour prendre une d\u00e9cision sur l'acceptation ou la renonciation \u00e0 cette succession. L' appelant, qui a eu bien des transactions avec le Dr Boucher et que paraissait an fait de ses affaires, savait que celui-ci avait un droit de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 sur une certaine terre vendue \u00e0 Lafreni\u00e8re et R\u00e2telle, Il fit pr\u00e9parer un transport de ce droit en sa faveur par le notaire Galipeau Ce transport pr\u00e9par\u00e9 d'avance et \u00e0 l'insu des Intim\u00e9s contenait la d\u00e9claration d'h\u00e9r\u00e9dit\u00e9 sur laquelle l'Apelante b\u00e2se sa demande d'une condamnation contre les Intim\u00e9s. Il avait un grand int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 faire compromettre ainsi les intim\u00e9s qui sont propri\u00e9taires de certains biens qu'ils tiennent de leur grand-p\u00e8re \u00e0 titre de substitution. Il savait que la succession de leur p\u00e8re \u00e9tait insolvable et qu'il courrait le risque de perdre sa cr\u00e9ance, pour partie du moins, s'il ne parvenait \u00e0 s'as-, surer un recours personnel contre les Intim\u00e9s en leur faisant prendre la qualit\u00e9 d'h\u00e9ritiers. C'est ce qu'il a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 faire d'une mani\u00e8re qu'il a pu croire habile mais qui n'est que malhonn\u00eate et ne peut en cons\u00e9quence lui assurer aucun avantage.\nLe notaire Galip\u00e9a apr\u00e8s avoir pr\u00e9pare le projet d'acte d'acceptation, le remit \u00e0 l'appelant. Comprenant les graves cons\u00e9quences qu'auraient cette acceptation pour les intim\u00e9s, il d\u00e9clara qu'il n'aimait pas \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cuter lui-m\u00eame persuad\u00e9 que si les Intim\u00e9s en comprenaient les cons\u00e9quences, ils refuseraient leur consentement. Le t\u00e9moignage de Galip\u00e9as \u00e0 ce sujet m\u00e9rite d\u2019\u00eatre cit\u00e9 tant par rapport \u00e0 son importance sur la question de dol que pour la doctrine extraordinaire qu'il expose sur la nature de ses. devoirs envers les parties qui passent des actes devant lui. Il est n\u00e9cessaire de s'\u00e9lever contre Ia fausse doctrine qu'il a Cnonc\u00e9e \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\nAu sujet de la passation de cet acte voici ce qu'il dit :\nC'est moi qui avais alors l'habitude do faire los actos du demandeur; j'\u00e9tais alors et je suis encore le notaire qu'il emploie; je r\u00e9side, dans le village de Maskinong\u00e9, comme le demandeur lui. m\u00eame, \u00e0 une distance de quelques arpents.\nIl n'y avait pas longtemps alors quo feu Charles Paphenus Anaclet Boucher \u00e9tait mort; je ne me rappelle pas si l'inventaire des biens de la succession du dit feu Charles Paphenus Anaclet Boucher \u00e9tait alors fait : dans tous los cas la succession do feu C. P. A. Boucher passait alors pour insolvable, d'apr\u00e8s la renomm\u00e9e; c'\u00e9tait l'opinion g\u00e9n\u00e9rale dans la paroisse.\nJe crois bien quo lo demandeur savait alors quo la succession do feu Charles Paphenus Anaclet Boucher passait pour \u00eatre insolvable Jo suis d'opinion que la plus grande partie des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s immobili\u00e8res d\u00e9laiss\u00e9es par le dit feu Charles Paphenus Anacl\u00e8t Boucher \u00e0 son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, n'appartenaient pas a ce dernier, mais \u00e9tait substitu\u00e9e \u00e0 sos enfants.\nQ. Le demandeur en cette cause no vous a-t-il pas dit ou donn\u00e9 \u00e0 entendre qu'il savait alors quo la dite succession \u00e9tait insolvable et quo le dit bien \u00e9tait substitu\u00e9 aux enfants?\nR. Dans le temps, je no me rappelle pas qu'il m'en ait parl\u00e9 mais il n'avait pas besoin do m'en parler, il savait dans le temps, que je connaissais ces chas\u00e9s. Il le savait comme moi i c'\u00e9tait chose connue.\nQ. Quand le demandeur vous a deman\u00e9\u00e9 do pr\u00e9parer le dit acte de cession de droit do r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9, d\u00e9sirait-il que 10 dit acte f\u00fbt fait et re\u00e7u par vous ou par un autre notaire?\nR. Il d\u00e9sirait qu'il f\u00fbt re\u00e7u par moi.\nQ. Pourquoi n'avez-vous pas vous-m\u00eame fait et re\u00e7u lo dit acte?\nR. J'ai pr\u00e9par\u00e9 l'acte, et quand il a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9, j'ai dit au demandeur quo je n'aimais pas \u00e0 recevoir cot\u00e9 acte-l\u00e0 parce quo je connaissais la responsabilit\u00e9 qu\u2019encourraient los vendeurs, en so portant h\u00e9ritiers do leur p\u00e8re, et Ia dite dame veuve Suzanne Salmon, en acceptant la communaut\u00e9, et quo j'\u00e9tais d'opinion qu'il y avait ignorance do droit do Ia part des vendeurs, v\u00fb que je consid\u00e9rais Ia dite succession comme parfaitement insolvable.\nQ. Avez-vous dit alors au demandeur la raison pour laquelle vous no ne vouliez pas recevoir le dit acte?\nR. Jo crois avoir dit alors au demandeur quo je n'aimais pas \u00e0 recevoir cet acte, parce que lea d\u00e9fendeurs no connaissaient pas la port\u00e9e ou la responsabilit\u00e9 qu'ils assumaient en signant cet acte\nQ. N\u2019est-il pas vrai quo l'intention du demandeur, en faisant faire cet acte, \u00e9tait do faire faire acte d'h\u00e9ritiers aux d\u00e9fendeurs? Le demandeur no vous l'a-t-il pas dit ou fait entendre?\nR. Jo sais quo le demandeur savait que lea d\u00e9fendeurs, en signant le dit acte de cession, se portaient h\u00e9ritiers de leur p\u00e8re et se randaient responsables des dettes de sa succession, et je suis d'opinion que cette connaissance a d\u00fb le d\u00e9terminer \u00e0 faire la transaction qu'on lui offrait; j'avais dit moi-m\u00eame au demandeur, qu'en signant cel acte, les d\u00e9fendeurs se portaient h\u00e9ritiers. et je l'avais dit \u00e0 d'autres aussi.\nQ. Le demandeur ne vous at-il pas dit ou donn\u00e9 \u00e0 entendre qu'il d\u00e9sir\u00e2t faire consentir cot\u00e9 acte par les d\u00e9fendeurs, af\u00edn qu'ils devinssent responsables des dettes do leur p\u00e8re?\nR. Le demandeur m'a demand\u00e9e silos d\u00e9fendeurs, en signant cet acte, se rendaient responsables des dettes de leur p\u00e8re : je lui ai dit quo oui i il m'a demand\u00e9e si c'\u00e9tait bien certain, je lui ai r\u00e9pondu quo c'\u00e9tait en loi i je ne sais pas si le demandeur a dit d'autres choses, mais je suis sous 1 impression que c'est en grande partie ce qui l'a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 a faire faire cet acte de cession; je l'ai compris ainsi\nQ. Quand vous recevez des actes d'une importance aussi grande que celle du dit acte de cession, n'avez-vous pas l'habitude et ne consid\u00e9rez-vous pas qu'il est de votre devoir de pr\u00e9venir les parties ou de leur expliquer la nature ou los cons\u00e9quences de tels actes?\nR .J'ai l'habitude d'expliquer la nature et les cons\u00e9quences do l'acte queje re\u00e7ois aux parties; et je regarde cette habitude comme une bonne pratique, mais je no crois pas que lo notaire soit oblig\u00e9 en loi de le faire, quand on ne lui demande pas d'explications.\nL'extrait suivant du t\u00e9moignage de l'appelant fait aussi voir qu'il savait que les Intim\u00e9s n'auraient pas sign\u00e9 l'acte en question s'ils eussent cru se rendre par cela responsables des dettes de la succession de leur pore :\nR. Le dit C, P. A. Boucher, lord do son d\u00e9cas, no passait pas pour solvable, vu les dettes contract\u00e9es par lui et sa famille : mais, suivant moi, lorsqu'il avait besoin do quelqne chose, ou d'un petit montant, on no lui refusait pas.\nQ. Lo dit L. E, Galipeault no vous a-t-il pas dit, apr\u00e8s avoir pr\u00e9pare le dit acte de cession, qu'il \u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 le recevoir, pourvu que, suivant son habitude, il en expliqu\u00e2t la nature et les cons\u00e9quences aux d\u00e9fendeurs?\nR. Il m'a dit qu'il ne voulait pas recevoir le dit acte parce qu'il croyait que. par lo consentement du dit acte, les d\u00e9fendeurs se por* taient h\u00e9ritiers, et qu'il croyait quo Si les d\u00e9fendeurs savaient qu'en signant cot\u00e9 acte, ils devenaient responsables des dettes do leur p\u00e8re, ils no signeraient pas cot acte. Le dit Le did L.E. Galipeault no voulant pas recevoir le dit acte, j'ai envoy\u00e9 chercher le notaire Fusey.\nQ. N'est-il pas vrai quo vous \u00e9tiez alors et que vous \u00eates encore sous l'impression quo los d\u00e9fendeurs n'auraient pas sign\u00e9 le dit acte, s'ils avaient cru en le signant, se rendre responsables des dettes de leur pr\u00e9?\nR. Je crois que les d\u00e9fendeurs n'auraient pas sign\u00e9 le dit acte, s'ils eussent pens\u00e9, en le signant, so rendre responsables des dettes de Ia succession de leur p\u00e8re, vu qu'ils contestent cette action aujourd'hui.\nLors de la passation du dit acte, j'\u00e9tais aussi sous cette impression.\nCes deux t\u00e9moignages font une preuve positive et compl\u00e8te quo ce n'est que par erreur quo les Intim\u00e9s ont donn\u00e9 leur consentement \u00e0 cet acte et par suite do ses men\u00e9es frauduleuses pour les emp\u00eacher d'\u00eatre inform\u00e9s sur la nature des cons\u00e9quences de cet acte. Apr\u00e8s ce que lui avait dit le notaire Galipeault, qu'il ne pouvait ex\u00e9cuter cet acte sans pr\u00e9venir les Intim\u00e9s de ses cons\u00e9quences, n\u2019\u00e9tait-ce pas un dol de sa part de taire cette circonstance et, pour l'emp\u00eacher d'arriver \u00e0 la connaissance des Intim\u00e9s, d'aller chercher un notaire \u00e9tranger pour ex\u00e9cuter cet acte tout pr\u00e9par\u00e9 d'avance. La bonne foi obligeait l'Appelant \u00e0 no dissimuler aucune des circonstances qu'il admettait lui-m\u00eame comme devant n\u00e9cessairement d\u00e9tourner los Intim\u00e9s do faire cet acte s'ils on \u00e9taient inform\u00e9s. Mais on dit quo los Intim\u00e9s devaient eux-m\u00eames conna\u00eetre les cons\u00e9quences d'un pareil acte, quillas sont tenus do savoir la loi, et que d'ailleurs ils \u00e9taient bien avis\u00e9s par un monsieur Schiller, ami do la famille. On pr\u00e9tend memo quo c'est lui qui a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 la cession do ces droits do r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 dans I\u2019 int\u00e9r\u00eat de la famille.\nIl n'est pas douteux que si les Intim\u00e9s eussent d'eux-m\u00eames et sans aucune d\u00e9marche frauduleuse do la part do l'Appelant fait cet acte d'acceptation, ii e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 suffisant pour les bier envers l'appelant. C'e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 alors un acte de leur propre volont\u00e9 dont ils auraient d\u00fb calculer la port\u00e9e. D'ailleurs laiss\u00e9s \u00e0 euxm\u00eames, ils auraient probablement employ\u00e9e pour le r\u00e8glement de la succ\u00e8ssion un notaire qui les aurait instruits de leurs droits et de leurs devoirs \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de cette succession. L'Appelant ne leur a pas m\u00eame donn\u00e9 le temps de la r\u00e9flexion, ils avaient trois mois pour proceder \u00e0 ce r\u00e8glement, et c'est quinze jours apr\u00e8s la mort de leur p\u00e8re qu'il leur pr\u00e9pare le pi\u00e8ge dans lequel ii les a fait tomber. Il \u00e9tait si press\u00e9 d'assurer sa cr\u00e9ance qu'il n'a pas plus respect\u00e9 les convenances que la bonne foi.\nIl n'y a absolument rien dans la preuve pour faire voir que les Intim\u00e9s connaissaient Ia port\u00e9e de l'acte d'acceptation. L'Appelant, pour repousser l'accusation de fraude pr\u00e9tend qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 sollicit\u00e9 par un nomm\u00e9 T\u00e9lesphore Shiller, de la part de la m\u00e8re des Intim\u00e9s pour faire l'acquisition de ce droit de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9. De cela, il n'y a point de preuve. Lui seul en parle dans son t\u00e9moignage, et d'\u00e2pres la loi de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, tout ce que la partie interrog\u00e9e comme t\u00e9moin dit en sa faveur ne fait aucune preuve pour elle. Ce fait ne pente \u00eatre pris comme prouv\u00e9. D'ailleurs, s'il \u00e9tait vrai que cette suggestion fut venue de Shiller cette circonstance don-nervait-elle plus de valeur au fait? Shiller \u00e9tait un respectable cultivateur illettr\u00e9, quoique paraissant avoir une certaine exp\u00e9rience des affaires. Mais ii n'est pas prouv\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait mieux inform\u00e9 que les Intim\u00e9s an sujet des cons\u00e9quences d'un acte de la nature de celui dont ii s'agit. Shiller \u00e9tant d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 avant l'enqu\u00eate les Intim\u00e9s n'ont Pu avoir sa version de ce fait pour l'opposer \u00e0 celle de l'Appelant. On y aurait peut-\u00eatre vu que la suggestion avait \u00e9t\u00e9 au contraire faite par celui qui avait int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 faire compromettre les Intim\u00e9s.\nLe fait d'avoir \u00e9vite d'employer M. Galipeault, le notaire de la paroisse, parce qu'il aurait pr\u00e9venu les Intim\u00e9s d\u00e9montrait bien l'intention de dol qui animait l'Appelant dans toutes ses d\u00e9marches. La r\u00e9quisition des services du notaire Fusey, \u00e9tranger \u00e0 la paroisse et qui vient pr\u00e9senter aux Intim\u00e9s un acte de cette importance, pr\u00e9par\u00e9 d'avance par un autre notaire, sans en donner un mot d'explication sont aussi des circonstances qui d\u00e9montrent le dol de l'Appelant\nLa conduite des notaires dans cette circonstance ne doit pas \u00eatre pass\u00e9e sous silence. La doctrine de l'un qui dit qu'il n'est pas oblige, quoiqu'il le fasse assez souvent, d'expliquer aux parties la nature et les cons\u00e9quences des actes qu'il re\u00e7oit, et le fait de l'autre qui re\u00e7oit cet acte d'acceptation d'h\u00e9ritiers, sans s'inqui\u00e9ter des pretentions des parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es, sans s'\u00eatre assure de la nature de l'acte qu'elles veulent faire m\u00e9ritent une \u00e9gale r\u00e9probation. Tous deux ont agi contre la loi; mais le plus coupable est sans doute celui qui, connaissant parfaitement les intentions de l'Appelant de commettre un acte de dol n'a rien dit ni rien fait pour l'emp\u00eacher. L'autre, en ex\u00e9cutant cet acte pr\u00e9pare d'avance, peut pr\u00e9tendee qu'il \u00e9tait sous l'impression que les parties s'\u00e9taient compl\u00e8tement expliqu\u00e9es avant son arriv\u00e9e. Cette explication qui para\u00eet assez bien prouv\u00e9e peut servir \u00e0 l'excuser de participation \u00e0 la fraude commise par l'Appelant; mais il n'en a pas moins manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 son devoir professionnel en ne s'assurant pas par lui-m\u00eame de la nature des conventions aux quelles il devait donner la sanction de l'authenticit\u00e9. Les devoirs du notaire ainsi compris et pratiqu\u00e9s en feraient une institution dangereuse au lieu de cette sorte de magistrature si utile \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Quel danger n'y aurait-il pas pour les gens illettr\u00e9s \u00e0 passer des actes devant des notaires qui se croiraient plus t\u00f4t les conseils d'une parties que les arbitres impartiaux des deux contractants? Quelques autorit\u00e9s \u00e0 ce sujet ne seront pas sans utilit\u00e9, en faisant voir que la loi r\u00e9prouve la conduite des deux notaires relativement \u00e0. la passation de l'acte d'acceptation.\nIl est peu de fonctions plus importantes, (disait le rapporteur \u00e0 la tribuno du Conseil des Cinq Cents, que celles des notaires D\u00e9positaires des plus grands int\u00e9r\u00eats, r\u00e9gulateurs des volont\u00e9s des contractants, quand ils semblent n'en \u00eatre que les r\u00e9dacteurs, interpr\u00e8tes des lois que l'artifice, la mauvaise foi et des combinaisons d'orgueil tendent toujours \u00e0 \u00e9luder, les notaires exercent une esp\u00e8ce de judicature d'autant plus douce qu'elle ne para\u00eet presque jamais, ou ne para\u00eet. qu'en nattant les int\u00e9r\u00eats des deux parties. Ce qu'ils \u00e9crivent, fait loi pour les contractants, et si les lois particuli\u00e8res sont en harmonie avec les lois g\u00e9n\u00e9rales, et ne blessent point les m\u0153urs et l'honn\u00eatet\u00e9 publique, ce grand bien est leur ouvrage.\nCes id\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 partag\u00e9es par le Conseil d'Etat. On peut en juger par la mani\u00e8re dont s'est expliqu\u00e9 l'Orateur du gouvernement M. Riel, dans l'expos\u00e9 des motifs de la loi. Apr\u00e8s avoir parl\u00e9 de l'institution des justices de paix, des tribunaux civils et des ministres du culte, il a ajout\u00e9 :\nUne quatri\u00e8me institution est n\u00e9cessaire, et \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 des fonctionnaires qui concilient et qui jugent les diff\u00e9rends, la tranquillit\u00e9 appelle d'autres fonctionnaires, qui, conseils d\u00e9sint\u00e9ress\u00e9s des parties, aussi bien que r\u00e9dacteurs impartiaux do leur volont\u00e9, leur faisant conna\u00eetre toute l'\u00e9tendue des obligations qu'elles contractent, r\u00e9digeant ces engagements avec clart\u00e9, leur donnant le caract\u00e8re d'un acte authentique et la forme d'engagement en dernier ressort, perp\u00e9tuant leur souvenir, et conservant leur d\u00e9p\u00f4t avec fid\u00e9lit\u00e9, emp\u00eachent les diff\u00e9rends de na\u00eetre entre les hommes de bonne foi, et enl\u00e8vent aux hommes cupides, avec l'espoir du succ\u00e8s, l'envie d'exercer une injuste contestation. Ces conseils d\u00e9sint\u00e9ress\u00e9s, ces r\u00e9dacteurs impartiaux, cette esp\u00e8ce de juges voluntaries qui obligent vo lointainement les parties contractantes, sont los notaires Cette institution est le notariat.\nEn ouvrant son parfait notaire ([9]), ii y aurait trouv\u00e9 les r\u00e8gles suivantes qui n'ont pas cess\u00e9 d'\u00eatre obligatoire pour la profession :\nIII. Apr\u00e8s s'\u00eatre assure de l\u2019identit\u00e9 et de la capacit\u00e9 des parties le notaire doit se faire instruire par chacune d'elles do toutes leurs intentions et examiner quelles sont los solennit\u00e9s requises par les lois pour la validit\u00e9 de Facte dont ii s'agit.\nComme il est cho si par los parties pour \u00e9tre l'interpr\u00e8te fid\u00e8le de leurs volont\u00e8s, son principal soin doit \u00eatre do les bien p\u00e9n\u00e9trer, afin de pouvoir mettre leurs int\u00e9r\u00eats et leurs intentions dans tout leur Jour ; car ce n'est que par ce moyen qu'il peut \u00e9viter dans ses actes les equivoques et les incertitudes qui sont ordinairement la source des contestations.\nEn effet, la plupart des proc\u00e8s tirent leur origine des ambigu\u00eft\u00e9s quo les notaires laissent \u00e9chapper dans leurs actes. Peut-\u00eatre n'en doit-on pas toujours accuser la mauvaise foi ou l'ignorance du notaire; mais au moins on ne peut le disculper d'avoir eu peu d'attention \u00e0 bien comprendre les intentions des parties, ou \u00e0 les r\u00e9diger exactement.\nToutes les circonstances qui entourent la passation de cet acte, prises ensemble, justifient l'all\u00e9gation de dol et fraude et suffisent pour en faire d\u00e9clarer la nullit\u00e9.\nInd\u00e9pendamment de cet acte d'acceptation, l'appelant pr\u00e9tend que les Intim\u00e9s ont fait divers actes dh\u00e9ritiers qui ont l'effet de les rendre responsables de toutes les dettes de la succession de leur p\u00e8re.\nA ne consid\u00e9rer que les parties de t\u00e9moignages cit\u00e9es par l'appelant, cette preuve serait sans doute suffisante pour faire d\u00e9clarer que les Intim\u00e9s out pris la qualit\u00e9 d'h\u00e9ritiers. Ainsi Charles Boucher dit que les Intim\u00e9s out vendu trois chevaux et trois ou quatre voitures appartenant \u00e0 leur p\u00e8re; qu'apr\u00e8s Ia mort de leur p\u00e8re ils out continu\u00e9 de vivre en commun avec leur m\u00e8re. Victoire Boucher dit quelle a collecte ala demande de sa m\u00e8re des rentes et des dettes pour services professionnelles dues \u00e0 la succession du Dr Boucher. sans doute que si ces actes n'\u00e9taient ou contredits on expliqu\u00e9s, ils constitueraient une acceptation de la succession.\nMais ii n'en peut \u00eatre ainsi lorsque l'on consid\u00e8re le t\u00e9moignage dans son ensemble. Le nomm\u00e9 Charles Boucher qui parle de la vente des chevaux ajoute dans ses transquestions, que c'est le notaire Chalut qui a fait cette vente; mais ii ne peut dire si c'est avant on apr\u00e8s 1 inventaire que cette vente a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite. Il se rappelle ensuite que c'est apr\u00e8s la mort de sa m\u00e8re que cette vente a eu lieu et qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par le notaire Chalut qui avait pr\u00e9side \u00e0 l'inventaire. C'est apr\u00e8s avoir .fait cet inventaire que le dit notaire Chalut a vendu les dits chevaux. Le dit notaire Chalut a tout vendu \u00e0 la fois, les animaux et le roulant, savoir : vaches, cochons, poules, voitures et autres effets mentionn\u00e9s dans mon examen en chef. Toss les dits effets ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vendus par le notaire Chalut.\nLe m\u00eame t\u00e9moin jure \" qu'il n'a eu aucun argent de cette vente; qu'il n'a jamais eu aucun des effets appartenant \u00e0 feu le Dr Boucher. ni retire aucun des argents de sa succession ni retire aucune des cr\u00e9ances qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 due.\"\nUn autre des Intim\u00e9s, Fran\u00e7ois Boucher, dit :\nJe n'ai jamais rien pris, ni profit\u00e9 du roulant ni des biens, savoir : des chevaux, vaches, voitures, m\u00e9nage et autres effets d\u00e9laiss\u00e9s par le dit feu Charles Paphenus A.

Boucher, \u00e0 son d\u00e9c\u00e9s' ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vendus par le dit notaire Chalut, comme susdit.\nQ. Avez-vous ou quelques-uns des D\u00e9fendeurs retir\u00e9 quelques-uns des argents provenant de la dite vente ainsi faite par le dit notaire Chalut?\nR. Non, on n'a jamais retire rien.\nQ. Avez-vous jamais re\u00e7u, pris ou eu quelques-uns des biens d\u00e9laiss\u00e9s par le dit feu Charles Paphenus A. Boucher, \u00e0 son d\u00e9c\u00e8s?\nR. Non, jamais.\nQ. Avez-vous fait quelqu'acte quelconque d'acceptation de la succession du dit feu Charles Paphenus A Boucher?\nR, Non, jamais.\nQuant aux collections de dettes on voit d'apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moignage de Victoire Boucher, qu'elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites par elle, \u00e0 la demande de sa m\u00e8re qui \u00e9tait en communaut\u00e9 de biens avec feu son mari. Elle aussi jure qu'elle ne s'est rien appropri\u00e9e de la succession, comme on peut s'en assurer par ses r\u00e9ponses aux questions suivantes *.\nQ. Jurez-vous positivement que tout ce que vous ayes re\u00e7u et retir\u00e9, soit pour rentes constitu\u00e9es ou seigneuriales, soit en comptes de m\u00e9decine ou autrement \u00e9tait re\u00e7u et retir\u00e9 pour votre m\u00e8re pour son b\u00e9n\u00e9fice et avantage et en son nom, \u00e0 sa r\u00e9quisition sp\u00e9ciale?\nObjecte \u00e0 cette question comme ill\u00e9gale.\nR. Oui.\nQ.

Oui, parce que mon p\u00e8re n'avait que des dettes , il n'avait rien, Les rentes per\u00e7ues durant l'ann\u00e9e suivant la mort de mon p\u00e8re ont \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9es pour payer les dettes de mon p\u00e8re et pour vivre.\"\nD'apr\u00e8s ces t\u00e9moignages, on voit que la preuve sur laquelle se reposait l'Appelant pour r\u00e9tablir des faits d'acceptation d'h\u00e9r\u00e9dit\u00e9 est positivement contredite.\nCe qui a pu \u00eatre touch\u00e9 des biens de Ta succession en question l'a \u00e9t\u00e9 par Madame Boucher qui \u00e9tait en com- munaut\u00e9 de biens avec son d\u00e9funt mari. Elle est sans doute devenue, par ces actes, responsable comme commune en biens; mais ses enfants ayant renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 sa succession, ne peuvent \u00eatre responsables de l'acceptation qu'elle a faite de la communaut\u00e9 de biens qui avait exist\u00e9 entre elle et son mari.\nApr\u00e9s un examen attentif des faits de cette cause, je suss d'opinion que Ta Jour Sup\u00e9rieure et Ta Jour du Banc de la Reine les ont correctement appr\u00e9cies La d\u00e9cision de cette Jour repose enti\u00e8rement sur les questions de faits. Ces derni\u00e8res \u00e9tant r\u00e9solues en faveur des Intim\u00e9s, l'application des principes de droit d\u00e9velopp\u00e9s par l'honorable juge Tessier, dans l'opinion duquel je concours, ne souffre aucune difficult\u00e9. Pour ces motifs, je suis d'avis que 1 appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nHENRY, J. :\nI am sorry to differ from my learned brethren with regard to the question under consideration. The circumstances are simply confined to a few points. These parties, who are in succession to the father, knowing that there was a mortgage on the property, and that they had a right of pre-emption, voluntarily went to Ayotte and offered to sell to him their right of pre- emption in the mortgaged premises for a certain sum, which he accepted. That is the transaction. What fraud then, was therein Ayotte? There is no evidence that he acted in the slightest degree in any way to influence them to make that proposition to him. But, it is said, \" Oh, he knew that if they did that it would subsequently make them bound for the debts of the succession.\"\nNow, I have seen no case, and I have read no law, which throws the responsibility on Ayotte of telling them that nor do I know of any rule of law that required the notary to tell them that. When a party goes to a notary asking him to write a certain document for which a certain consideration is to be paid, what right has the notary to inquire whether the parties understand it or not? It must be presumed they did. But we are told that Ayotte is a very cunning man, and the others are ignorant. If we lay down propositions founded on an assumption of that kind, where are we, as judges, to draw the line? It appears to me that it is our business to administer the law and I think that when there is no fraud proved we are not to try and make it out from something that is very obscure. I think fraud is a defense that is necessary not only to be pleaded, but fully proved. In this case the defence set up is fraud. I have read over the evidence, and although I have no doubt that Ayotte was well aware of the consequences to these people of their own act, the question comes: \"Was he, in the first place the party that suggested it? Did he by any fraudulent profession or inducement of any kind, bring these parties to make that voluntary offer?\" I can see no evidence of the kind. Then can they come in and complain afterwards that what they volunteered to do somebody did not come forward and tell them, I If you do that certain consequences will arise.\" I do not wish to carry out a doctrine of that kind. I am very sorry to differ from my Larned brethren, but if we open the door, because these people are alleged to be ignorant, and did not know any better, and decide that some person ought to have instructed them, we must apply that doctrine to other cases. We might say the merchant, who enters into a transaction, does not know the consequences of his act and that if he knew that the consequences of signing a document would be so and so, he would not sign it, and that the notary ought to en lighten him. I say it is totally impracticable to carry out such a doctrine in all its bearings, and, therefore, it can- not be applicable in any case. I can see no fraud on the part of Ayotte; if so, the legal consequences, as I take it, ought to follow the act, The legal consequences are that these parties bound themselves to the debts of the succession. If they did so, it is a misfortune. They were not over-reached or induced to do so they were the moving parties, and if the notary that was first employed in the place had any scruple about it, knowing the cir cumstances, and would not undertake to do it, and Ayotte went to another notary, was there any obligation on the part of the second notary that he should tell the parties, not the immediate nature of the transaction not whether they were selling the equity of the redemption for a certain sum that is not disputed but because he did not trace out the legal results of that into other matters connected with the estate, a thing which he was not bound to think of; nor is ii to be presumed without evidence that he knew the estate of Boucher was insolvent or that by signing this document these parties made themselves liable for the debts of their father.\nThere is further evidence that th\u00e8se p\u00f3pele acted under their mother but she was not entitled to he whole of the succession. If she sold property belonging to the succession of Boucher that would not I take it makes them answerable as well as their mother but here they were themselves actors and it will not do for one party, who does wrong, to say, \" I did it by the instruction of some other party\". Taking that view, I think these parties rendered themselves liable for the debts of the succession.\nI think therefore the appeal ought to be allowed.\nTASCHEREAU and GWYNNE J.J. concurred in dismissing the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Turcotte & Paquin.\nSolicitors for respondent: Hould & Grenier.\n[1] 3 Dorion's Q.

Ritchie, Knt., C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Gwynne, JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nMarine policy\u2014Voyage policy\u2014Mortgagee who assigns as collateral security has an insurable interest\u2014Total loss\u2014Right to recover\u2014Notice of abandonment by mortgagee\u2014Constructive total loss.\nWhile the barque \"Charley\" was at Cochin on or about the 12th April, 1879, the master entered into a charter party for a voyage to Colombo, and thence to New York by way of Alippee. The vessel sailed on the 22nd April, 1879, and arrived at Colombo, which place she left on 13th May, and while on her way to Alippee she struck hard on a reef and was damaged and put back to Colombo. The vessel was so damaged, that the master cabled to the ship's husband at New York on the 23rd May, and in reply received orders to exhaust all available means and do the best he could for all concerned. The repairs needed were extensive and it was impossible to get them done there, and Bombay, 1,000 miles distant, was the nearest port. After proper surveys and cargo discharged, on the 10th June the vessel was stripped and the master sold the materials in lots at auction.\nOn the 21st May, the respondent, a mortgagee of 46\/64 in the vessel, which he had assigned to the Bank of Nova Scotia by endorsement on the mortgage, as a collateral security for a pre-existing debt to the Bank of Nova Scotia, being aware of the charter from Cochin to New York, insured his interest with the appellant company. The nature of the risk being thus described in the policy: \"Upon the body, &c., of the good ship or vessel called the barque Charley beginning the adventure (the said vessel being warranted by the insured to be then in safety,) at and from Cochin vi\u00e2 Colombo and Alippee to New York.\" To an action on the policy for a total loss\u2014the defendants pleaded inter alia 1st\u2014that the plaintiff was not interested; 2nd, that the ship was not lost by the perils insured against; 3rd, concealment. A consent verdict for $3,206 for plaintiff was taken subject to the opinion of the court upon points reserved to be stated in a rule nisi, and upon the understanding and agreement that everything which could be settled by a jury, should upon the evidence given be presumed to be found for the plaintiff.\nHeld,\u20141st. That this was a voyage policy, and that the warranty of safety referred entirely to the commencement of the voyage and not to the time of the insurance.\n2nd. That the fact of the plaintiff having' assigned his interest as a collateral security to a creditor, did not divest him of all interest so as to dis-entitle him to recover.\n3rd. That the vessel in this case being so injured that she could not be taken to a port at which the necessary repairs could be executed, the mortgagee was entitled to recover for an actual total loss, and no notice of abandonment was necessary.\nPer Strong, J., that a mortgagee upon giving due notice of abandonment is not precluded from recovering for a constructive total loss.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia discharging a rule nisi for a new trial.\nThe facts of the case sufficiently appear in the head note and judgments hereafter given.\nTo a declaration as for a total loss upon a marine voyage policy upon the barque \"Charley,\" alleged to have been executed by the defendants, they pleaded among other pleas,\u2014 1st. That the plaintiff was not interested in the said ship, as alleged.\n2nd. That the said ship was not lost by the perils insured against or any of them, as alleged.\n3rd. That they were induced to make the policy by the fraud of the plaintiff.\n4th. That at the time of making the policy the plaintiff and his agents wrongfully concealed from the defendants a fact then known to the plaintiff and his agents, and unknown to the defendants, and material to the risk\u2014that is to say, that the said ship was then lost or had sustained serious damage.\n5th. That at the time of the making of the said policy the plaintiff and his agents wrongfully concealed from the defendants a fact then known to the plaintiff and material to the risk\u2014that is to say, that notice of the loss of the said ship or the damage she had sustained on said voyage had been published in one or more public newspapers in England two or three days previously, and,\n6th. That at the time of the making the said policy the plaintiff and his agents wrongfully concealed from the defendants a fact then known to the plaintiff and his agents and unknown to the defendants, and material to the risk\u2014that is to say, that the said ship had been previously reported as lost or seriously injured on said voyage\nIssue having been joined on these pleas the case went down for trial before Mr. Justice Weatherbe and a jury in November, 1881, and, upon the close of the evidence, a verdict at the suggestion of the counsel of the defendants was taken for the plaintiff for $3,206.80, subject to the opinion of the court upon points reserved, to be stated in a rule nisi to be taken out, and upon the understanding and agreement that everything which could be settled by a jury should, upon the evidence given, be presumed to be found for the plaintiff.\nIn pursuance of this agreement a rule nisi was obtained by the defendants in the following terms, namely, on hearing read the minutes of trial it is ordered that the verdict or judgment given herein for the plaintiff be set aside with costs and a new trial granted on the following grounds:\nBecause no sufficient interest is proved to entitle the plaintiff to recover the amount of the verdict.\nBecause the notice of abandonment was too late and insufficient.\nBecause no total loss was proved.\nBecause the vessel being only partially damaged could not under the terms of the policy be condemned at Colombo, a safe port, without notice to the underwriters, which was not given,\nBecause the declaration is not sufficient to enable the plaintiff to recover for a loss which happened before the application was made and insurance effected.\nBecause of the improper reception of evidence as to abandonment and of secondary evidence as to notice of abandonment and its contents.\nBecause the judge should not have allowed the declaration to be amended on the trial alleging interest in the Bank of Nova Scotia, unless cause to the contrary be shewn, &c., &c. Upon the argument of this rule nisi the court discharged the rule, thus maintaining the verdict, and it is from the rule and judgment discharging the rule nisi that this appeal was taken.\nMr. Maclennan, Q.C., for appellants.\nMr. Graham, Q.C., and Mr. Gormully, for respondent. The points of argument are fully noticed in the judgments. RITCHIE, C. J.:\nI had some doubts whether the evidence made it clear that there was a total loss, but all the facts have been submitted to a jury, and found in favour of the plaintiff, establishing that there was a total loss, and I am therefore not prepared to differ from the rest of the Court in the conclusion that there was an actual total loss, and this gets rid of any discussion as to the abandonment and notice.\nSTRONG, J.:\nThe nature of the risk is thus described in the policy:\nUpon the body, tackle, apparel and other furniture of the good ship or vessel called the barque \"Charley,\" beginning the adventure (the said vessel being warranted by the insured to be then in safety) at and from Cochin via Colombo and Allippee to New York.\nIt is first said that the words \"lost or not lost\" are not inserted in the policy, and that the warranty of safety has reference, not to the commencement of the voyage, but to the date of the policy, the 22nd May, 1879, when the loss had actually occurred. I think it very clear, as clear, indeed, as words can make it, that this was a voyage policy, and that the warranty of safety refers only to the commencement of the voyage, and not to the time of the insurance.\nConcealment is not proved, and any objection to the verdict on that ground is distinctly precluded by the very terms of the agreement between counsel, on which the consent verdict was taken This stipulation was noted by the learned judge as follows:\nA verdict is taken by plaintiff for the amount of $3206.80, interest from the first April, 1880, subject to the opinion of the court on questions reserved in the rule nisi. The verdict, by consent, is taken at the suggestion of the defendant's counsel, and I state before it is taken, that everything that a jury could settle on the evidence, must be presumed to be for the plaintiff.\nThe fact of concealment would be a question for the jury, and we must, therefore consider the case as though there had been an express finding in the plaintiff's favor on that ground, in which case it could not be pretended that the verdict was against the weight of evidence. Further, the verdict was to be subject only to the points reserved in the rule nisi which, according to the Nova Scotia practice, was, of course, moved for immediately after the trial, and this is not mentioned.\nThe question of the action not having been brought in due time is not raised by the pleadings, was not taken at the trial, and is also excluded by the terms of the agreement pursuant to which the consent verdict was given, as it is not comprised in the rule nisi.\nThen, it appears, that the plaintiff had an interest as mortgagee of shares to secure $8,000. The mortgage was made by Barteaux, and it must be presumed that the registrar would not have registered the mortgage unless Barteaux, the mortgagor, appeared on the registry to be the owner of all the shares comprised in the mortgage. And this would probably appear if the registry was fully set out. Again, it cannot be denied, that Barteaux was owner of 30 shares, which, in any event, the mortgage includes, so that the objection becomes one only to the amount of the verdict, and is excluded by the terms of the consent, no objection to the amount of the verdict being taken in the rule.\nThere is nothing in the objection, that secondary evidence of the notice of abandonment was not admissible because there was no notice to produce; secondary proof of a notice is a well known exception to the rule requiring secondary evidence[1], and there is no reason why it should not apply to notices of abandonment as well as to notices to quit and a variety of other similar documents. Then, I am of opinion, that notice of abandonment was given with sufficient promptitude. The plaintiff first heard of the disaster from seeing it in a newspaper, and within a week he gave the notice. Allowing for the lapse of a reasonable time for making enquiries, this was in sufficient time. Moreover, it would, under proper directions, have been a question for the jury if the point had been raised at the trial; and under the agreement that every thing which a jury could settle on the evidence must be presumed to be for the plaintiff the defendants are again concluded from raising this question. The point that the notice of abandonment was insufficient, because there was no transfer, must also share the fate of those which have already been disposed of. As shown in the case of Kaultenback v. McKenzie[2], by the present Master of the Rolls, the abandonment is a totally different thing from the notice of abandonment The cession of the property in consequence of the abandonment operates, it is said, without a word being spoken as necessary incident of the abandonment. This is so laid down in the text writers where numerous authorities are cited in support of it. It will be enough to refer to Arnold on Insurance[3], where I find the following statement of the law:\nIf notice of abandonment has been duly given, a deed of cession or formal cession or formal transfer is unnecessary to enable the assured to perfect his abandonment and recover as for a total loss.\nThe assignment to the bank, if absolute in form, was either absolutely void under the statute, in which case it could have no effect at all, or it was merely by way of mortgage as a collateral security for a pre-existing debt. It, however, very clearly appears upon its face to have been of the latter character, and this being so, I am at a loss to conceive what possible effect it could have on the plaintiff's right to recover. No direct authority is produced showing that such a sub-mortgage is to be considered as so divesting the mortgagee of all interest as to dis-entitle him to recover. Practically he still retains the same interest which he had before the transfer, as the security held by his creditor is still for his benefit, since, if it is realized, he must receive credit for the proceeds and in that way pay his debt. He, there fore, retains his original interest unimpaired. No English authority can be cited for such a position. In the case of fire insurance a mortgage by the insured after the policy will not, in the absence, of course, of a special condition, be considered such a transfer of interest as to prevent a recovery, and I see no reason why it should have that effect in marine insurance which would also apply to fire insurance.\nLastly, it is said that in no case can a mortgagee recover for a constructive total loss. The first answer to this is, that the loss here was not a constructive loss at all, but an actual total loss. The ship was taken to the harbour of Colombo where it was found that there was no dry dock, and where she could not, for very sufficient reasons given by the captain, be beached, for the purposes of repair, and she was in such a condition that she could not be taken to another port for repair. This is the substance of the evidence of the master, and the appellants are debarred by the terms of the consent verdict from disputing the facts. In Barker v. Janson[4], Willes, J., says:\nIf a ship is so injured that it cannot sail without repairs, and cannot be taken to a port at which the necessary repairs can be executed, there is an actual total loss, for that has ceased to be a ship which never can be used for the purposes of a ship; but if it can be taken to a port and repaired, though at an expense far exceeding its value, it has not ceased to be a ship, and unless there is notice of abandonment there is not even a constructive total loss. The case first put exactly describes the condition of this ship as she lay in the harbour of Colombo, no appliances for repair were within reach, and there it was impossible, even temporarily, to stop the leak so as to enable her to reach a port where repairs could be effected. It was, therefore, a case of actual total loss, and if there are authorities to show, which however I deny, that a mortgagee cannot recover for a constructive total loss, they do not apply to the facts of this case. I can find, however, no authority for holding that a mortgagee is precluded from recovering as for a constructive total loss upon giving due notice of abandonment; and upon principle I can see no reasonable reason for such rule. It is true that a bottomry bond holder cannot recover for a constructive total loss; but for this a reason is given which does not apply to the case of a mortgage[5]. If, however the case of Kaultenback v. MacKenzie[6], is to be considered as overruling the opinion of Willes, J in Barker v. Janson, and restoring Lord Campbell's doctrine in Knight v. Faith[7] (which I must be presumptuous enough to doubt, considering what has been said in some of the cases in the House of Lords) which was that whenever the subject-matter remained in specie notice of abondonment was necessary, not for the purpose of declaring the election of the assured, for in such a case there can be no room for a choice, but to enable the underwriters to look after their interests in the property, the plaintiff is, I consider, still entitled to recover as having given a sufficient notice of abandonment. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER, J., concurred. HENRY, J.:\u2014\nThere are five leading points to be considered in dealing with the issues in this case:\u2014 1st, as to the insurable interest in the respondent when the policy was issued; 2nd, the state of the ship when sold; 3rd, as to the notice of abandonment; 4th, as to the allegation of concealment; 5th, as to the warranty contained in the policy.\nAs to the first point, the respondent on the 31st of October, 1877, became a mortgagee of 46\/64 shares in the vessel insured, and the mortgage to him was duly registered on the 10th of the following month. On the 28th of October, 1878, the respondent assigned the mortgage to the bank of Nova Scotia by endorsement on the mortgage as follows:\nI, the within named John Keith, of Windsor, in consideration of the bank of Nova Scotia giving me time on a debt of $3,016.90 now owing to them by me on a draft drawn by me on C. W. Barteaux, New York, and due to-day, do hereby transfer to them the benefit of the within written security.\nWhat then was the effect of that assignment? Did it transfer absolutely the whole interest in the mortgage? I am of the opinion it did not, and that the latter retained a valid insurable interest in the vessel to the amount greater than the amount insured. In the first place the only transfer recognized and provided for by the Merchants' Shipping Act is where the whole interest is sold and transferred. Here it is patent on the face of the assignment that it was made only as collateral security for the payment by the respondent of the amount of the dishonoured draft. The consideration is not alleged to have been in the shape of a sum paid, or to be paid, by the bank, but solely on account of the bank giving time for the payment of the draft. The bank took, no doubt, an equitable interest in the mortgage capable of enforcement, but not such as to divest wholly the interest of the assignor, who, in my opinion, retained the legal title to the mortgaged shares. By law the bank was prohibited from taking or holding any mortgage of a ship, otherwise than as additional security for debts due them. Besides when we find the respondents' mortgage was $10,000, it would, indeed, be impossible, without evidence of the fact, to conclude, that for the time given him to pay the amount of the draft he agreed and intended to give a bonus to the bank of nearly $7,000. I have therefore no hesitatation in deciding that the respondent had a valid insurable interest to an amount beyond that covered by the policy when it was issued.\nThe claim and verdict being for a total loss, the state of the ship when sold is most important to be considered. If she was at the time capable of being repaired, and there were the means at hand where she was of having the necessary repairs made, or if she could have been removed to another available port or place for that purpose, an actual total loss had not taken place, but, under the circumstances, if she could have been repaired the owner was bound to have that done, unless the repairs would cost as much, or more, than she would be worth when repaired. In the latter case, however, it would be but a constructive total loss and a notice of abandonment duly given would be necessary to entitle the insured to recover as for a total loss. It has been satisfactorily made to appear, by the evidence in this case, that when the ship returned to Colombo after having sustained the injuries spoken of on her voyage to Allippee, she was unseaworthy. At Colombo she could not be repaired so as to go to sea. At that place there were neither ship carpenters or shipyards, nor any other of the necessary means for repairing. It appears that Bombay was the nearest available port for getting her repaired, but it is distant about 1,000 miles from Colombo, and in the state she was in it was impossible to take her there.\nThe master, after having the damages inspected by two boards of surveyors, and acting by their advice, sold the vessel and materials, the latter in lots, and the hull, after having been stripped, separately. The purchaser of it immediately broke her up and got what was available out of her. I have no doubt that the master (who owned two shares of the vessel uninsured) did the best he could, under the circumstances, for all concerned, and the fact that the purchaser of the hull made no attempt to repair it, is corroborative evidence of the contention that the repair of the vessel was impracticable. If, then, the ship could not be repaired where she was, and could not be removed for repairs to another port, the loss becomes, in my opinion, an actual total loss. The law, as I view it, is well expressed by Wines, J., in Barker v. Janson[8]. He says:\nIf a ship is so injured that it cannot sail without repairs and cannot be taken to a port at which the necessary repairs can be executed there is an actual total loss, for that has ceased to be a ship, which never can be used for the purposes of a ship.\nThe ship at Colombo had therefore ceased to be a ship at the time the respondent first heard of her having been injured.\nI consider that no notice of abandonment was therefore necessary and I need not discuss the question raised as to that given by the respondent.\nThere is not the slightest evidence of any concealment by the respondent personally of anything within his knowledge when he effected the insurance in question. But it is contended that the knowledge of the master affected him, and, as the master knew of the damage done to the vessel before that time, that knowledge must be imputed to the respondent as mortgagee of the shares in her.\nI know of no case wherein such has been decided, nor would I expect to find one. The master is no doubt the agent for many purposes of the owner, and in certain cases is expected and required in the ordinary course of business to communicate immediately with him, and, if he do not, and the owner is in ignorance of circumstances that he had a right to expect to be communicated to him by the master effects insurance, the policy becomes liable to forfeiture on the ground of concealment. The mere mortgagee of shares in a ship has nothing to do in ordinary cases with the employment or conduct of the master. He is in no wise his servant. Although the owner of a ship executes a mortgage of her he is no less the owner, and, subject to the rights of the mortgagee, can act the part of a full owner in every other respect. There exists a privity between him and the master, but none between the latter and a mortgagee of whom in many cases he never heard. If the law held one mortgagee affected by the knowledge of the master, the doctrine would apply to twenty mortgagees, if there were so many, and of whom the master knows nothing. After a vessel leaves her home port on a lengthened voyage, it may be for two or three years, how is the master to know of the mortgages and assignments that may be subsequently made? To require every mortgagee or assignee to find out and notify a master of his interest would, if not wholly impracticable, at least create difficulties that would hamper trade, by throwing embarrassing responsibilities on such mortgagees or assignees, and making them answerable for parties they may not know, and without the slightest privity of contract or knowledge otherwise having existed. It is the duty of the master to communicate with his owner, but he is under no obligation to communicate with a mortgagee. The latter pays him nothing for his services, and he has no claim upon him to furnish information as to the ship, her movements or condition. It would be unreasonable and inequitable to hold the mortgagee answerable for the knowledge of the master thousands of miles distant.\nThe next point is as to the warranty contained in the policy. The policy was issued on the 21st of May, 1879, and was \"for $4,000 on the ship, tackle, apparel, and other furniture, beginning the adventure (the said vessel being warranted by the insured to be then in safety) at and from Cochin via Colombo and Allippee to New York.\" The policy insured against all perils, losses or misfortunes that have or shall come to the hurt of the vessel. What then is the substance of the warranty. In answer to the printed questions submitted for answers to the respondent, before the policy was issued, he said the vessel was then on the Malabar coast and to sail on the 10th of April the previous month. The evidence shows that the vessel sailed from Rangoon for Cochin in February, 1879; although not specially shown, she was no doubt at Cochin on the 10th of April, for about the 12th of that month the master chartered her for the voyage mentioned in the policy. She was then safe, and sailed from there under the charter for Colombo on the 22nd of April. She arrived at the latter, took in some cargo and sailed on her voyage to Allippee on the 13th May, and on the 17th ran on a reef and received the damage which made it necessary for her to return to Colombo. When the policy was issued the risk reverted back to the date of sailing from Cochin, and if she was then safe the words in the policy \"all perils, losses or misfortunes that have or shall come to the hurt, &c., of the vessel cover a loss before the issue of the policy as well as a subsequent one. The appellants charged and got paid for the whole risk from Cochin via Colombo and Allippee to New York, and their insurance was coextensive. The policy expressly provides for insurance against any loss that had previously been sustained after the commencement of the voyage, and therefore must necessarily cover that sustained on the 17th of May and subsequently. The warranty of the safety of the vessel, as I read it and the application and answers to the printed questions, does not apply to the 21st of May, when the policy was issued, but to the safety of the vessel at Cochin, from whence to commence the voyage as expected on the tenth of April.\nA contention was raised at the argument that the respondent was not entitled to recover, because the suit was not commenced within twelve months from the time of the depositing of his claim.\nThat is a defence that must be pleaded, and there is no plea of that kind on the record. No such issue was raised, and none can be considered. Besides, no such objection is included in the rule nisi to set aside the verdict, and we cannot consider grounds of objection not contained in it.\nFor the reasons given, I am of opinion the appeal should be dismissed, and the judgment of the court below confirmed with costs.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nThe question before us upon this appeal is whether the verdict, which was taken by consent at the trial, subject to the opinion of the court as above stated, should be set aside and a verdict entered for the plaintiff, or a non-suit upon any of the objections stated in the rule, and first as to the interest of the plaintiff in the subject of the insurance and his right to recover under the policy, the injury which caused the subsequent loss of the vessel having been received before the policy was executed.\nThe plaintiff's interest is as mortgagee of 46\/64 parts or shares of the vessel insured, under a mortgage executed by one Barteaux, the then owner of those shares, dated the 31st October, 1877, and entered on the ship's registry on the 10th November, 1877. One Robinson, who was himself the owner of 2\/64 shares in the vessel, took charge of her in October, 1874, at Kingsport, Nova Scotia, where she was built, and continued in charge of her as master from thence continually until her loss in 1878, during all which time, so far as appears in the evidence, she may have been at sea and abroad. Barteaux, who mortgaged his 46\/64 shares to the plaintiff in 1877, always acted as managing owner and ship's husband. In December, 1878, she was at Rangoon, from whence she sailed for Cochin in February, 1879. While at Cochin, and on or about the 12th of April, 1879, the master entered into a charter party with her for a voyage to Colombo, in the island of Ceylon, and thence to New York via Allippee. She sailed from Cochin under this charter on the 22nd April, 1879, and arrived at Colombo, which place she left on the 13th May, and while on her way to Allipee she struck hard upon a reef on the 17th May. While thumping on the reef she unshipped her rudder and part of her keel came up. Having sounded the pumps and found four and a half feet of water in the well, the master, after consultation with his officers, decided, as the best course, to put back to Colombo, which was the nearest and safest port to get to. They arrived there (constantly pumping all the way) on the 19th May; the water was then gaining two feet, per hour. Evidence, which was not contradicted, establishes that the vessel's bottom could not be examined until the cargo should be discharged, and this could not be done in consequence of the south west monsoon having burst on the 19th May, and the heavy sea which was running.\nThe cargo was got out as fast as possible, but no part could be taken out until the 24th or 25th May, and in the mean time, on the 23rd May, the master cabled to the ship's husband at New York as to what was to be done, and in reply received orders from him that when the master should have exhausted all available means to take care of the vessel, he should do then the best he could for all concerned. As soon as the cargo was got out the master had the bottom surveyed, and found the end of the stern post exposed and other injuries of such a nature that it was physically impossible to put to sea again, unless the vessel should undergo very extensive repairs, which repairs it was impossible to get made at Colombo, there being neither ship yards nor ship carpenters there, nor any wharf to heave her down to, nor any blocks to put her on. Bombay was the nearest port at which the vessel could have been repaired, and it was 1,000 miles off; after the cargo had been completely discharged, and on or about the 10th June, the master had a second survey made by two ship masters and a carpenter of one of the ships there, and a third survey by two ship masters, and, after consultation with them, he, in concurrence with them under their advice, came to the conclusion that, as he could not take the vessel to a port where she could have been repaired, the best thing he could do was to strip her and make the best he could of her materials. This he accordingly did. He stripped the vessel and sold the materials in lots at auction, and the hull in like manner, separately, the purchaser of which proceeded to break it up as the only thing which could have been done with it. On the 20th May in Lloyd's List and Commercial Daily Chronicle, published in London, England, there appeared the following information as transmitted from Colombo on the 19th May:\u2014\nCharley British barque bound hence for Allippee struck the ground northwardly of Cormorin and has put back leaky, cargo damaged, but to what extent not yet ascertained.\nOn the 21st of May the plaintiff who resides at Windsor, Nova Scotia, being aware of the charter from Cochin to New York but having no reason whatever to think the vessel was in trouble, unless the knowledge of the master constituted notice to the plaintiff (a point hereafter to be referred to) made application to the agent of the defendant at Halifax for the policy now sued upon, wherein he informed the defendants that the voyage he wanted the insurance for was from Cochin via Colombo and Allippee to New York, and, in reply to questions therein as to where the vessel then was, and when ready to sail, replied to the former that she was on the Malabar coast, and to the latter, the 10th April; thereupon the policy now sued upon was issued\u2014being for $4,000:\nUpon the body, tackle, apparel and other furniture of the good ship or vessel called the barque Charley, beginning the adventure (the said vessel being warranted by the insured to be then in safety) at and from Cochin via Colombo and Allippee to New York.\nThe said vessel, tackle, &c., valued at $20,000, and the perils to which the defendants are made liable are stated in the policy to be among others:\nAll perils, losses or misfortunes that have or shall come to the hurt of the vessel subject to the conditions and, provisions contained in or referred to by clauses in this policy.\nNow, it is contended that this policy is for a voyage thereafter to be commenced from Cochin, where, as is contended, the plaintiff warranted the vessel to be then, on the 21st May, in safety, and that the words \"lost or not lost\" not being inserted the defendants are not liable, but upon reference to the application, which may be looked to as explanatory of the intention of the parties, it sufficiently appears that the defendants were informed that the voyage for which the plaintiff wanted to effect insurance was expected to have commenced on the 10th April, and the warranty must be read as applying to the beginning of the adventure upon her sailing from Cochin on such contemplated voyage. The statement in the policy that it is intended to cover \"all perils, &c., &c., that have, or shall come, to the hurt of the vessel, &c., supports this view. The plaintiff, therefore, in the absence of any knowledge then possessed by him of the injury which the vessel had sustained, is entitled to recover, notwithstanding the absence from the policy of the words \"lost or not lost.\"\nIt was contended further, that as it appeared that the plaintiff had assigned his mortgage to the Bank of Nova Scotia on the 21st of October, 1878, the absolute legal interest in the 46\/64 shares mortgaged to the plaintiff became, by force of sec. 73 of the Merchants' Shipping Act of 1854, vested in the bank, and that the plaintiff therefore had no interest on the 22nd May, 1879, when the policy was executed. This contention was well answered, as it appears to me, by the judgment appealed from. The transfer of the mortgage to the bank is in these words:\nI, the within named John Keith, of Windsor, in consideration of The Bank of Nova Scotia giving me time on a debt of $3,016.90, now owing to them by me on a draft drawn by me on C. W. Barteaux, New York, and due to-day, do hereby transfer to them the benefit of the within written security. In witness, &c.\"\nBy the Dominion statute 34 Vic., ch. 5, the bank could not take, or hold, any mortgage of any ship, or other vessel, otherwise than by way of additional security for debts contracted to the bank in the course of its business. When, then, the plaintiff, in consideration of the bank giving to him time for the payment of a draft for $3,016.90 then due, transferred to the bank \"the benefit\" of the mortgage held by the plaintiff on Barteaux's 46\/64th. shares in the vessel, which was a security for payment to the plaintiff of $10,000, together with an arrear of interest thereon at the rate of 7 per cent. from the 31st of October, 1877, all that can be held to have passed to the bank was in the nature of a mortgage, that is to say, an equitable interest in, or lien upon, the $10,000 secured by the mortgage as security that the plaintiff's debt to them of $3,016.90 should be paid, and the only way by which the bank could acquire the absolute legal title to the property mortgaged, namely, the 46\/64th shares in the vessel, would be under the provisions of the 41st and 43rd secs. of 34 Vic., ch. 5, taken together, \"by obtaining a release of the equity of redemption in the property mortgaged, or by foreclosure in a Court of Equity, or by any other means whereby an equity of redemption can by law be barred.\" Such transfer by the plaintiff, operating therefore merely in the nature of a derivative mortgage, was not such a transfer as is contemplated in the 73rd section of the Merchants' Shipping Act, which section contemplates such an absolute legal transfer of a mortgage of a vessel, or of shares therein, as would entitle the transferee to be entered upon the registry of the vessel as the mortgagee of the vessel, or of the shares therein, under the original mortgage, and as the legal owner of such vessel, or shares, to the limited extent defined in the 70th section, and the result is that, notwithstanding the execution by the plaintiff of the instrument endorsed upon the mortgage, he still retained, under the provisions of the 70th and 71st sections of the Merchant's Shipping Act, the legal interest in the shares mortgaged to him by Barteaux, and he must be held to have still retained such interest when the policy was executed, and entitled to effect the insurance contained therein, notwithstanding, that the bank had an equitable interest in the plaintiff's mortgage and a lien upon the monies to be realised thereunder.\nAs to the issues joined upon the pleas averring concealment by the plaintiff, at the time of his effecting the insurance, of facts alleged to have been known to him and unknown to the defendants and material to the risk\u2014namely, that the vessel was then lost, or had sustained serious injury, and that notice of the damage which she had sustained had previously been published in one or more public newspapers in England two or three days previously, and that the vessel had been reported as lost or seriously injured on her said voyage, the evidence shows that the plaintiff had no actual knowledge of any of those matters, and that he had no reason to believe she had been in any trouble whatever.\nAll that appears to have been published in any newspapers relating to the vessel was the information published in Lloyd's list on the 20th May\u2014namely, \"that she had struck the ground and had put back leaky, and that the cargo was damaged, but to what extent had not yet been ascertained;\" but the plaintiff had no knowledge of such publication, It was contended, however, by the learned counsel for the defendants, that the knowledge of the master was the knowledge of the plaintiff, and it was upon such constructive knowledge solely that the contention for the defendants in support of their pleas was rested.\nThat the master is the agent of the owners of a vessel there can be no doubt, and Gladstone v. King[9], cited and followed in Proudfoot v. Montefiore[10], decides that the knowledge of the master as to any injury sustained by the vessel when under his charge is impliedly the knowledge of the owners; the foundation of that doctrine, however, is that the master, being appointed by the owners, the relation of principal and agent has been established between them. The principle as laid down in Proudfoot v. Montefiore, is that\u2014\nIf an agent, whose duty it is in the ordinary course of business to communicate information to his principal as to the state of a ship or cargo, omits to discharge such duty, and the owner, in the absence of information as to any fact material to be communicated to the underwriter, effects an insurance, such insurance will be void on the ground of concealment or misrepresentation. The insurer is entitled to assume, as the basis of the contract between him and the assured, that the latter will communicate to him every material fact of which the assured has, or, in the ordinary course of business, ought to have, knowledge, and that the latter will take the necessary measures, by the employment of competent and honest agents to obtain, through the ordinary channels of intelligence in use in the mercantile world, all due information as to the subject-matter of the insurance.\nNo case has been cited which establishes that the registered owner of shares in a vessel who, as such owner, had taken part in the appointment of the master, and between whom and the master the relation therefore of principal and agent exists, by executing (in the absence, it may be, of the master with the vessel on a voyage) a mortgage of the whole, or of some part, of his shares, to a person of whose existence even the master may be ignorant, constitutes the relation of principal and agent to exist between the mortgagee and the master, so as to make the neglect of the master to communicate to the mortgagee (of whose status as mortgagee, and of whose existence even, he may be ignorant) such matter within his knowledge as it would be his duty to communicate to his principals such a. breach of his duty as to subject the mortgagee to the consequences of such neglect, and that it could in law and reason be said, on the principle upon which Gladstone v. King and Proudfoot v. Montefiore were decided, that the knowledge of the master was impliedly the knowledge of the (to him) unknown mortgagee. In the absence of any decision in support of such a contention, I must say that so to hold, would be, as it appears to me, to do violence to, to the extent of ignoring, the principle which is the foundation of the decisions in Gladstone v. King and Proudfoot v. Montefiore, and is not warranted by any thing in the Merchants' Shipping Act, upon the provisions of which act the contention is rested, for, although true it is that that act makes the mortgagee of shares in a vessel the owner of such shares for the purpose of realizing his mortgage debt by sale of the shares, or so much thereof as might be necessary, and of giving a good and absolute title to the purchaser, yet, for all other purposes, the mortgagor continues to be the owner of the shares mortgaged. By the 70th section of the Act it is specially provided that\nA mortgagee, shall not by reason of his mortgage, be deemed to be the owner of a ship or any share therein, nor shall the mortgagor have ceased to be the owner of such mortgaged ship or share, except in so far as may be necessary for making such ship or share available as a security for the mortgage debt.\nSo that the act gives no countenance, as it appears to me, to the contention that the plaintiff, by taking a mortgage upon Barteaux' shares became the owner of such shares so as to create between himself and the master appointed by Barteaux and his co-owners the relation of principal and agent. The issues joined, therefore, upon the pleas averring concealment by the plaintiff of material facts known to him and unknown to the defendants could be found in favor of the defendants solely in the event of actual previous knowledge of the matters alleged to have been concealed being brought home to the plaintiff, in which the evidence wholly fails.\nThe issue joined upon the plea denying the loss of the vessel by any of the perils insured against, raises the question whether the loss was an actual total loss, or only a constructive total loss, which latter could only be perfected by notice of abandonment in due. time after the receipt, by the plaintiff, of information that the vessel had suffered the damage which caused the loss. If the loss was an actual total loss the plaintiff would, so far as the issue raising that point is concerned, be entitled to recover without any notice of abandonment, and we shall be relieved from the necessity of determining the objection taken that the notice given was too late and insufficient.\nNow, upon the evidence we must take it to be established, that the first information which the plaintiff had of any injury having been sustained by the vessel was upon the 3rd or 5th of June, 1879, and that the extent of such information was that contained in Lloyd's List, as published in London, England, on the 25th May, 1879, as above extracted.\nThe proper conclusion to arrive at on the evidence, I think also, is, that, although it may not have been until upon or after the 10th June that the master became aware of the full extent of the injury which the vessel had sustained, and that it was of such a nature that it was utterly impossible to have repairs made at Colombo, so as to enable the vessel to proceed to a place where the repairs could have been made, and that it was a physical impossibility, under the circumstances, in her then condition to have taken her to a place where she could have been repaired, she had nevertheless, on the 3rd of June completely lost her character of a ship or vessel, and had became to all intents and purposes as complete a wreck as if she had been broken into pieces, and become, as it has been called, a congeries of planks, by the perils insured against. This, as it seems to me, is the dictate of sound sense, nor is authority wanting in support of it. Willes, J., in Barker v. Janson[11], lays it down distinctly. He there says:\nIf a ship is so injured that it cannot sail without repairs and cannot be taken to a port at which the necessary repairs can be executed there is an actual total loss, for that has ceased to be a ship which never can be used for the purposes of a ship.\nThe evidence would have justified a jury in finding that upon the 3rd of June. 1879, when first the plaintiff became aware of the vessel having met with any injury, it was a physical impossibility to take her again to sea without previously undergoing repairs, and that it was not possible that the necessary repairs to fit her to go to sea should be executed at Colombo, where there were no appliances whatever, or shipwrights, and that, therefore, she was not capable of being again used as a ship, and that she was not saleable as such, and that the master, in selling, as he did, the materials of which she was composed in parcels, did the best that under the circumstances could be done with her, and that he acted bon\u00e2 fide and honestly for the benefit of all concerned, and without any knowledge of the vessel being insured by the plaintiff. Under the agreement upon which the verdict for the plaintiff was taken, we must treat as found by the jury everything which upon the evidence could properly have been found by them. Under these circumstances and upon the authority of Milles v. Fletcher[12]; Idle v. Royal Exchange Assurance Co.[13]; Cambridge v. Anderton[14]; approved in Roux v. Salvador[15]; Robertson v. Clark[16]; and of Willes, J., in Barker v. Janson[17], the plaintiff is, in my opinion, entitled to recover as for an actual total loss without any notice of abandonment.\nA further point was taken before us\u2014namely, that by a clause in the policy it is provided that\u2014\nNo suit or action of any kind for the recovery of any claim upon, under, or by virtue of, this policy, shall be sustainable in any court of law or chancery, unless such suit or action shall be commenced within the term of twelve months next after claim for loss or damage shall be deposited at the office of the company, and in case any such suit or action shall be commenced against the company after the expiration of twelve months next after claim for loss or damage shall be deposited as aforesaid, the lapse of time shall be taken to be conclusive evidence against the validity of the claim thereby so attempted to be enforced.\nIn answer to this objection, it is sufficient to say that there is no plea upon the record under which the objection is open, nor was it suggested at the trial, nor in the rule nisi taken out in pursuance of the agreement upon which the verdict was taken, and therefore it is not open to the defendants to make the objection upon this appeal; but, independently of this, there does not appear in the case any real foundation for the objection. The claim for loss or damage referred to in the above clause must be taken to be the same as is comprehended in the terms of the 6th paragraph of the policy as printed in the appeal case, by which it is provided that\u2014\nAll losses and damages which shall happen to the aforesaid ship or vessel, &c., shall be paid within sixty days after proof made and exhibited of such at the office of the company.\nAnd the twelve months within which the action must be brought for non-payment of such loss, must begin to run only from the deposit of such proof of claim at the office of the company. Now, the office of the company appears to be at Toronto, and there is no evidence whatever to show when the plaintiff's \"claim for loss or damage was deposited at the office of the company;\" so that it is impossible to say when the twelve months began to run, if ever.\nFor the above reasons I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs, and that the plaintiff is entitled to retain his verdict.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: J.

Stat., ch. 32, sec. 52, N. S.\nA mandamus was applied for at the instance of the sessions for the county of Halifax, to compel the warden and council of the town of Dartmouth to assess, on the property of the town liable for assessment, the sum of $16,976 for its proportion of county school rates for the years 1873-78, under sec. 52 of the Educational Act, R.S.N.S., ch. 38.\nThe Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, without determining whether the required assessment was possible and was obligatory when the writ was issued, made the rule nisi for a mandamus absolute, leaving these questions to be determined on the return of the writ. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, it was\nHeld (Strong and Gwynne, JJ., dissenting) that the granting of the writ in this case was in the discretion of the court below, and the exercise of that discretion cannot at present be questioned.\nPer Ritchie, C. J.: That the town of Dartmouth is not, but that the city of Halifax is, exempted by ch. 32 R. S. N.

J.:\nThis matter came before the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia on a rule nisi for a mandamus to the town council of Dartmouth, at the instance of the sessions for the county of Halifax, to compel the town council to assess for school rates on the town $15,976, and to pay the same over to the treasurer for the county of Halifax. On 4th April, 1881, the Chief Justice delivered the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, making the rule absolute. The sessions claimed to base their proceedings on sections 52 and 54 of chap. 32 rev. stat. of N. S., \"Of Public Instruction.\"\nIn Nova Scotia, outside of the city of Halifax, the management of the public instruction of the country is by the instrumentality of commissioners of schools and trustees, and the mode of support is thus provided for by sections 41, 42, 44 and 45: There shall be paid annually from the provincial treasury for common schools throughout the province, the sum of one hundred and seventeen thousand dollars; out of which sum there shall be paid to the city of Halifax seven thousand five hundred dollars. After deducting such sum of seven thousand five hundred dollars, the balance shall be distributed between the several counties of the province, according to the grand total number of day's attendance made by all the pupils in the public common schools throughout the province. If in the distribution of the before named annual grants, the result shall exhibit, for any county, a sum less than the provincial grant for the corresponding term of 1872, less the special grant to poor sections, the council of public instruction is authorized to grant to such county such additional sum as may be requisite to make the sum total equal to the provincial grant for the corresponding term of 1872\u2014less the special grant to poor sections\u2014provided always, that when such extra or supplementary aid is given, the decrease in the attendance shall not be more than 10 per cent. of the grand total day's attendance for the county for the corresponding term of 1872. The distribution of the moneys payable under the authority of this chapter, to the respective counties, for common schools, shall be made semi-annually through the inspectors, to the respective teachers and assistants lawfully employed by trustees, according to the number of days the schools have been in session, and the grade of license held.\nThen we have section 52 which gives rise to the controversy in this case. It is as follows:\u2014\n52. The clerk of the peace in each county, except as hereinafter provided in relation to the city of Halifax, shall add to the sum annually voted for general county purposes at the general sessions, a sum sufficient, after deducting costs of collection and probable loss, to yield an amount equal to thirty cents for every inhabitant of the county, according to the last census preceding the issue of the county rate-roll; and the sum so added shall form and be a portion of the county rates. One-half the sum thus raised shall be paid semi-annually by the county treasurer, upon the order of the Board or boards of school commissioners for the county.\nAnd sec. 53 provides:\u2014\n53. One-half of the amount provided to be raised annually, as aforesaid, shall, at the close of each half year, be apportioned to the trustees of schools conducted in accordance with this chapter, to be applied to the payment of teachers' salaries; and each school shall be entitled to participate therein, according to the average number of pupils in attendance and not the length of time in operation, but shall receive no allowance for being in session more than the prescribed number of days in any one half year.\nAnd section 54 provides, when a majority of ratepayers of any section determine that an extra sum over and above the sum provided by the province and county is required, how same shall be raised. The regulations with respect to public instruction in the city of Halifax are quite distinct from and independent of the rest of the province. Section 81 provides:\u2014\nThe City of Halifax shall be one school section, and there shall continue to be thirteen commissioners of schools for such city, appointed (seven by the Governor in Council, and six by the City council) under the provisions of sec. 1 of chapter 9, of the Acts of 1868, as modified by chapter 27 of the Acts of 1869, and the thirteen commissioners thus appointed shall constitute a board of school commissioners for the city of Halifax, and such board shall be a body corporate, and may exercise all the powers and perform all the duties of trustees of public schools in and for the city.\nSection 85 provides how vacancies shall be filled.\nSection 86 prescribes the duties of the board of commissioners:\n86. The board of commissioners shall take all necessary steps to provide sufficient school accommodation, and shall furnish annually to the superintendent of education a report of their proceedings under this chapter; also, returns of all schools subject to their control, and a statement of the appropriation of all moneys received and expended by them under the provisions of this chapter.\nSection 87 provides that the board of commissioners may aid any city school, provided it be a freeschool:\n87. The board of commissioners are authorized to co-operate with the governing body of any city school, on such terms as the board shall seem right and proper, so that the benefit of such schools may be as general as circumstances will permit, and the board may make such allowance to any such school out of the funds under their control as shall be deemed just and equitable, but no public funds shall be granted by them in support of any school, unless the same be a free school. Section 88 provides for the assessment of the sum required by the commissioners for school purposes:\n88. On request of the board of commissioners specifying the amount required in addition to the sums provided from the provincial treasury, for the yearly support and maintenance of the schools under their charge, the city council shall be authorized and are hereby required to add a sum sufficient, after deducting costs of collection and probable loss, to yield the amount so specified by the board, to the general assessment of the city, to be levied and collected from the inhabitants thereof, and from property lying within the county, the owners whereof reside in the city; and, on the payment of the required fee, the city assessors shall furnish to the trustees of Dartmouth, or other school section, and the clerk of the peace for the county shall furnish to the city assessors, the information necessary in order to give effect to this provision. Any person who may have been assessed, both in the city and in Dartmouth, or any of the school sections in the county, in respect of such property, shall be entitled to receive back the amount paid by him either in the city or in Dartmouth, or other school sections, as the case may be, in accordance with the foregoing construction of the law. The sum so assessed shall be paid quarterly by the city treasurer to the board, upon the written order of the chairman or vice-chairman. Provided, however, that the commissioners shall not have power to assess the city for any greater sum than sixty thousand dollars in any one year, without the consent of the Governor in Council, given at the request of such commissioners.\nSection 89 defines the objects to be provided for out of assessment:\n89. The objects to be provided for by the board of commissioners out of the sum so assessed shall be the salaries of teachers and assistants, and of the secretary of the board, the leasing of lands and buildings for school purposes, the repairing and improving of grounds and buildings, the cleaning, fuel and insurance of school houses, the purchase of prescribed school books, the interest payable on debentures issued by the board, and all other expenses required in the due execution of the different powers and trusts vested in the board by this chapter.\nSections 90 and 91 give the board power to borrow money for sites and buildings, and to issue debentures.\nSection 98 provides for payment over by city treasurer of all moneys assessed to board, as follows; 98. All moneys assessed on the city of Halifax for educational purposes, and in the hands of the city treasurer, shall be paid over by him to the commissioners of schools for the city of Halifax at the time and in the manner hereinbefore provided.\nAnd section 100 provides as follows:\u2014\n100. The provisions of this chapter, except as hereinafter specified, shall apply to the city of Halifax, provided that the pupils of any ward shall be entitled to school privileges in any other ward.\nThe contention on behalf of the town of Dartmouth is, that that town is exempt from the tax of 30 cents a head, and that, if liable, Halifax is not exempt but equally liable, and if so, the amount Dartmouth would be entitled to receive would be more than she would have to contribute.\nWith the justice or injustice, policy or impolicy, of exempting or making Dartmouth liable, we have nothing to do. These are considerations with which the Legislature alone has to deal. All we have to do is to ascertain and determine the true construction and meaning of the Acts which have been passed by the Legislature of Nova Scotia in reference to this matter.\nOn the 22nd March, 1880, Chief Justice Young delivered the judgment of the Supreme Court, affirming the liability of Dartmouth to contribute a sum equal to 30 cents a head, and, after giving a decided opinion on this point, with a view to the Legislature dealing with the matter and reconciling what the court seemed to consider the apparent contradiction in the Act fixing this liability on the town of Dartmouth, and the Act providing that the sum to be voted for the estimates, including ordinary and extraordinary expenses, should not exceed in any year the sum of $15,000, the court suspended, in the meantime, its final determination on the rule.\nMr. Justice James, who dissented from this judgment and put forward very strongly the injustice and wrong that would be inflicted on Dartmouth, if the burthen of the 30 cents a head was imposed on that town and Halifax was exempt therefrom, after referring to matters unquestionably for legislative rather than judicial considerations, says:\nI shall now briefly consider the question whether the town of Dartmouth is liable in law for the amount claimed, or any part of it, which is, in fact, the main point in this case. This question has been so fully discussed by the learned Chief Justice in an opinion which, so far as it defines the natural construction of the statutes, I entirely concur, that not many words will be necessary from me on that point. There can be no doubt that the framers of the Dartmouth Act of incorporation intended and expected that their town would be exmpted, as the city was supposed to be. There are several features of the Act which indicate that that was their intention. But was that the intention of the Legislature, as expressed in the Act of incorporation? In considering the question, I think I am bound to require that any language that would exempt one locality from the payment of a tax imposed upon the whole of the rest of the Province, with at most but one exception, should be clear and explicit; but I find no clear and explicit words in the statute to this effect. On the contrary, I find, in sections 36 and 37, language which appears to me totally inconsistent with such contention, keeping in mind that the schools at each section are to be supported from these sources, viz:\u2014the provincial grant, the county assessment and the local assessment. I observe that section 36 is as follows:\u2014After the passing of this Act the town shall be set off as a separate school section and the town shall have the expenditure of all school rates raised within its limits for the schools of the town, as also of all Government and school grants for such a town, which grants shall be paid to the town.\nHe then proceeds:\nHere we find the three sources of educational income clearly, as I consider, specified in detail, viz:\u20141. Local assessment; 2. Government grants; 3. School grants. And the two latter grants are to be \"paid to the town.\" Now we know, of course, that the second of these\u2014 the Government grant\u2014means the grant out of the provincial treasury. But what is the third\u2014the school grant\u2014if not the share allotted to the town out of the county assessment? I can conceive of no other meaning for the words, and therefore the town is to receive and expend its proportion of the county assessment. It is not contended that the town is to receive a proportion of this fund without contributing to it. That would be taxing the poorer districts of the county to assist the richer. And I am sure the people of Dartmouth have no such desire, and would never ask such a thing, and their counsel have raised no such contention at the argument. All they ask and all their counsel have contended for is, that if the city of Halifax is exempt, Dartmouth should also be exempt, and this they are in all justice and equity bound to insist upon, not only in their own behalf, but in behalf of the rest of the county, who, like themselves, are unjustly taxed to subserve the interests of the city of Halifax. It is clearly the interest of Dartmouth that neither should be exempt.\nAgain, in section 37, I find that for the two adjoining districts, included in the town for school purposes by this section, the council shall be paid the proportion of Government school grants payable in such districts, and to impose and levy the county school assessment and all school assessments in such districts, and collect the same in the same manner as if such districts formed part of the town. I find nothing in the Act to counteract these explicit statements. I can only say that if the framers of the Act intended, as I have no doubt they did, to exempt the town from the county assessments, they have made a most unfortunate use of the English language. I hope the town will no longer persist in an expensive and hopeless contention in the courts of law to escape this assessment, which the city and Dartmouth ought both to be willing to bear, but look to the Legislature to remedy in another way the severe taxation inflicted on them by the law, and which they are quite unable to bear.\nHe then says:\nIt is indispensable, in my view of the law and facts, that I should decide, so far as I am able, upon the arguments presented to us, whether the city of Halifax is exempt or not.\nWhile I think he has very clearly established his first proposition as to the liability of Dartmouth, I think he has failed to show that Halifax is not exempt.\nIf the effect of a law exempting Halifax has all the obnoxious characteristics which Mr. Justice James attributes to such an enactment, viz., injustice and inconsistency, and being unfair, partial and oppressive, and violating the first principles of natural justice and perpetrating a moral wrong, these are considerations most proper to be brought to the notice of the Legislature, and would, we may readily assume, be duly dealt with by the Legislature; but it is just possible that that body might have discovered good reason for coming to the conclusion that, without being open to any of those grave imputations, it was quite compatible with sound policy and honest and just legislation that, while Dartmouth was not, Halifax should be exempt, as is to be inferred was the view of the rest of the court. The brother judges of Mr. Justice James agreed with the Chief Justice, that suspending their final decision on the rule nisi for a mandamus was, under the circumstances, the course which met the necessity of the case, and Mr. Justice James adds:\nThe matter will doubtless now be brought before the Legislature by one or other of the parties concerned, and it will then be judged on the principles of right and justice. Our duty is to expound the law. If the law is unjust we cannot alter it; but those who make the laws have not only the power, but it is their solemn duty to amend them, if they are unjust or inequitable, as I am satisfied the law on this question now is, if the construction which has heretofore been put upon it is correct.\nThe matter came again before the court on the 4th of April, 1881. The Chief Justice delivered the judgment of the court as follows:\nThe controversy in this case has been twice before us, and judgments pronounced as they are reported in 3 Russell & Chesley, 187, and 1 Russell & Geldert, 402.\nThe demand by the sessions, and now by the municipality of Halifax, is for the accumulated amounts of school rates for five years, being in all the sum of $15,976, as set out in the rule nisi for a mandamus granted 1st February, 1879.\nUpon full enquiry the court declared that, in their opinion, the law was entirely with the sessions, and that the town of Dartmouth was liable for this large sum. But in consideration of the delay and of an Act passed in 1877 at the instance of the defendants without reference to this liability, having given a decided opinion on the main question, and desiring that the Legislature should have an opportunity to deal with it, we suspended in the meantime our final determination on the rule.\nThe counsel for the plaintiffs have now informed us that no legislative action has been bad in the matter, and they apply for a final judgment. The objections to this form of proceeding were argued at large, and I need not repeat the cases and authorities cited in our last judgment.\nThere is here a light we have determined, and these are parties applying who have a real interest in the subject-matter and are acting bon\u00e2 fide.\nWhether the required assessment is possible and was obligatory when the writ issued, are questions which may arise on the return.\nAs the matter stands, we have no choice, and, in pursuance of our views, we make the rule absolute with costs.\nThis, as has been intimated, will be appealed from. If not, it is to be understood that the word \"forthwith\" in the mandatory clause is used in the qualified sense in the treatise by Tapping 328.\nMr. Justice James remained of the same opinion which is reported in 1 Russell & Geldert, 417, and thought the rule nisi for a writ of mandamus should be discharged. The rule nisi for a mandamus was made absolute, and from this the present appeal.\nIt seems to me abundantly clear that the city of Halifax is neither to contribute to nor participate in the fund to be raised under section 52; that no meaning whatsoever can be attached to the words in that section, \"except as hereinafter provided in relation to the city of Halifax,\" or to the words in section 100 \"the provisions of this chapter, except as hereinafter specified, shall apply to the city of Halifax,\" unless they mean that section 52 is not to apply to the city of Halifax; nor with section 98, which clearly indicates that all monies assessed in the city of Halifax for educational purposes are to be paid over by the city treasurer to the commissioners of schools for the city of Halifax, to be appropriated by them, not for the support of schools outside of the city of Halifax, but to the yearly support and maintenance of the schools under their charge.\nTo hold that the city of Halifax is not exempt would, in my opinion, be flying in the face of the express words of the statute and the necessary inference which arises therefrom, and from the scope and apparent policy in relation to the city of Halifax and the province generally, and still more so against the well known rule that when ever it is sought to impose a rate, the burthen lies on those seeking to enforce it, to show that the words used by the Legislature are clear and unambiguous in order to charge the subject; and that taxing acts must be construed strictly. Supposing we could look on the effect of the exemption of Halifax in the light so strongly represented by Mr. Justice James, the wording and whole frame of this statute too plainly show that the Legislature intended to exempt the city of Halifax. Where the words are perfectly clear, we ought not, as said by Brett, L. J., in Rabbits v. Cox[3], \"to construe a plain enactment so as to make it suit our views of what is just and right,\" and more especially so with a view to the imposition of a burthen. In Ingram v. Drinkwater[4], in the judgment of the court it is said:\nThe cases of Reg. v. Neville and Colebrooke v. Tickell show clearly that when it is sought to impose a rate the burden lies on those seeking to enforce it, to show that the words used by the Legislature are clear and unambiguous in order to charge the subject.\nIn the present case, instead of any such words being in the statute, there are, on the contrary, clear and unambiguous words exempting the city of Halifax.\nThen, as to the exemption of Dartmouth. After what has been said in the court below, it is scarcely necessary to add more. By the Act incorporating the town of Dartmouth, sec 36 provides:\nAfter the passing of this Act the town shall be set off into a separate school section, and the town shall have the expenditure of all school rates raised within its limits for the schools of the town, as also of all Government and school grants for such schools, which grants shall be paid to the town.\nSec. 37. For all school purposes the district lying between the northern boundary of the town and the lands of the British Government, and the district lying between the southern boundary of the town and Herbert's brook shall form part of the \"town of Dartmouth,\" and the town shall be entitled to receive and be paid the proportion of the Government school grants payable in respect of such districts, and to impose and levy the county school assessments and all school taxes on such districts, and collect the same, in the same manner as if such districts formed part of such town.\nIt would seem, from the express words of these sections, that though the jurisdiction in reference to the support and regulation of the public schools was transferred to the town council, the mode of supporting the schools has not changed. The funds were to come from the same sources, viz., the Government grant, the share of the county schools assessments which they are \"to impose and levy,\" and the school taxes in districts named. Had there been any intention that this should he changed the expenditure of school grants and imposition and levying of the county school assessments would not have been provided for, and if the exemption had been contemplated would the legislature not have provided for such exemption by express words, as was done in the case of Halifax? Dartmouth having been liable to this assessment before and up to the time of its incorporation, I can find nothing in the Act of incorporation relieving it from the burthen, but, on other hand, express words and necessary implication, to my mind, clearly establish the contrary, and, therefore, we must follow the general rule of construction, that so far as is possible effect must be given to every word of a statute. If we exempt Dartmouth we must not only depart from the plain words of the statute, but we must eliminate language from it as pointed out by Mr. Justice James, too clear to be misunderstood, and even then we can find no words from which any express intention to exempt is indicated, but are left simply to an inference to be drawn from the fact of the school limits of Dartmouth having been extended to take in certain portions outside of the limits of the town for school purposes, and on the strength of this repeal the law as it originally stood.\nA writ of mandamus is a prerogative writ and not a writ of right, and the granting of it is, in that sense, discretionary. The exercise of this discretion cannot be questioned, but the grant of a pre-emptory mandamus is a decision upon a right, declaring what is and what is not lawful to be done, and such decision is subject to review\nSee Reg. v. All Saints[5].\nThe general rule upon which the court acts in making the rule absolute and granting the writ is, that if the affidavits raise questions of disputed facts it will grant the writ in order that those questions may be tried, or if there be questions of law which ought to be put in a more solemn train for inquiry, a similar course will be pursued; but if the arguments on both sides disclose that there is no dispute as to the facts, and the court has no doubt in point of law, it will not make the rule absolute. Wherever there is a fair doubt, either upon matter of fact or of law, the court will make the rule absolute in order that it may be fairly discussed on the return.\nThis is not a mandamus peremptory. If the town of Dartmouth think they can show any good and sufficient cause why the whole of the amount now claimed should not be levied, it will be quite open to them to return any such matter of law or fact, or both, as they may be advised will sustain such a contention, and have the same discussed and settled on the return.\nI am of opinion that the present appeal should be dismissed.\nSTRONG, J.:\nI am of opinion that a mandamus should not have been granted before the recovery of a judgment by the county, and that on this ground the writ should have been refused; and consequently this appeal ought to be allowed.\nFOURNIER, J.:\nI concur in the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed on the ground that the parties will be able to urge their objections on the merits, I express no opinion as to whether Dartmouth is exempt from the operation of the School Act.\nHENRY, J.:\nI have arrived at the conclusion that the mandamus is not peremptory, but merely in the nature of a rule nisi, calling upon the parties to show cause why a peremptory mandamus should not issue. I am inclined to the opinion that Dartmouth was not exempt from the operation of the School Act in the same way as the city of Halifax was, but that matter has not yet been fully decided by the court below, and I therefore give no positive opinion upon the point. I think, under the circumstances, the appeal should be dismissed.\nGWYNNE, J.:\nThe appeal in this case must, in my opinion, be allowed with costs. Assuming the contention upon the part of the authorities of the county of Halifax, upon whose behalf the rule to show cause why a writ of mandamus should not issue was applied for, to be correct\u2014namely, that, the Act incorporating the town of Dartmouth does not relieve the ratepayers of that municipality from payment of the county rate for school purposes imposed by sec. 52 of ch. 82 of 4th series of revised statutes, then the liability remains imposed and is enforceable under the provisions of the latter Act, unless the Act incorporating the town makes some other provision for imposing and levying the rate. If the above chapter 32 is the only Act governing the imposition and levying the rate, then it is apparent that the town of Dartmouth, in its corporate capacity, has nothing to do with the matter. The Act itself determines the amount of the rate by a mode of calculation which the clerk of the peace is required to make, and to enter the amount so determined on the county roll, which is every year placed in the hands of collectors authorized and required to collect the rate as part of the county rate payable by the respective ratepayers of each year; but the contention is, that although the chapter 32, since the incorporation of the town, still remains in force and affects the ratepayers therein, casting upon them still the obligation to pay county school rate, as imposed by section 52, which rate the clerk of the peace is still authorized and required to calculate and determine, instead of his adding it to the county roll to be collected as part of the county rate, as it was before the Act of incorporation, he must now communicate the amount of the rate, (as required to be paid by the ratepayers of Dartmouth), to the Warden and council of the town, who, as is further contended, are bound under ss. 28 and 42 of their Act, to vote, assess and collect the rate from the ratepayers of the town and to pay it over to the treasurer of the county of Halifax.\nThe Act itself makes no express declaration that such was the intent of the legislature, but it is argued that this intention is the fair and proper inference to be implied from what the Act does say. There is, in my judgment, much force in the contention, that on the contrary, the effect of the Act incorporating the town is to exempt the ratepayers therein from all liability under sec. 52 of ch. 32, above referred to. Sec. 27 of the Act places the public schools under the jurisdiction of the corporation. Sec. 28 imposes upon the council the burthen, among others, of voting, assessing, collecting, receiving, appropriating and paying whatever monies are required for school rates. This section would seem to impose upon the corporation the whole burthen of themselves assessing and raising all monies required for school purposes, and to invest the council with the discretionary power of themselves determining what sums should be necessary and required to be levied from the ratepayers for school purposes, and of appropriating such sums in such manner as to them in their discretion should seem fit. It certainly seems questionable whether the 28th section is open to the construction that the legislature, by the language there used, intended to impose upon the council the duty of assessing and collecting a sum conclusively determined by the clerk of the peace of the county of Halifax, under sec. 52 of ch. 32, which the council could have no power of altering, and whether it contemplated the council going through the form of voting and assessing that sum under the provisions of the 28th and 42nd secs. of their Act of incorportion, in order to collect the rate and to hand it over to the county treasurer. The Act says nothing as to the clerk of the peace of the county communicating to the warden and council of Dartmouth the amount required by the county authorities from the ratepayers of Dartmouth for county school purposes; nor is there any provision in the Act requiring the town council to pay over any sum for such purpose to the county treasurer. The omission to insert provision for that purpose does certainly seem strange, if, as is contended, the intention of the legislature, in so far as this particular rate is concerned, was merely to make an alteration in the manner in which the amount, when determined by the clerk of the peace of the county, should be levied within the limits of the town. Then, again, by the 37th section, it is enacted specially that the town shall impose upon and levy from an outlying district specified in the Act outside the limits of the town, and for school purposes, placed under the jurisdiction of the town, the amount of county school assessment on such district which, before the Act of incorporation, was imposed and levied under sec. 52 of ch. 32, and paid to the county treasurer; and it is asked, with much apparent force, what would be the meaning of this section if a county school rate be still payable to the county treasurer under ch. 32, sec. 52, by the ratepayers of the town, who have imposed upon them the whole burthen of maintaining the schools in that outlying district, and who, in consideration of such burthen, are empowered to impose upon and levy from the ratepayers of such district the county school assessment, by section 52, formerly payable by such ratepayers to the county treasurer?\nThen again, section 86 makes the town a separate school section, and to it is given the expenditure for the schools of the town of all school rates raised within its limits.\nI must say that there is, as it appears to me, much force in the argument that the true effect of the Act of incorporation, according to a sound construction, is to exempt the ratepayers of the town from all liability to pay the amount formerly imposed by sec. 52 of ch. 32; but in the view which I take, it is unnecessary to determine that point for the purpose of the present appeal, for whatever may be the correct construction of the Act upon this point, the Act makes no difference as to the persons liable, if any be, to pay the rate, namely, the ratepayers of the town, in each year. They are the proper persons to pay the expense of providing public instruction in each year for the children of the inhabitants, and sec. 42 clearly shows the intention of the Legislature to have been that all rates required for each year shall be imposed and levied within the year. Nothing can be clearer than the 42nd section upon this point. The propriety and justice of making the ratepayers of each year the sole persons liable to contribute to the expenses attending public instruction in that year, except in so far as such expense is provided for by public grant, is apparent; while, on the contrary, nothing could be more unjust than to compel the ratepayers of 1882, who may be totally different persons from those, for example, of 1874, to pay the school rates of 1874, the benefit of which was wholly enjoyed by the children of the ratepayers of that year. It would be contrary to the principle which governs courts of justice in ordering the issue of writs of mandamus, if this court should sustain the order made, in the circumstances of the present case, whether the ratepayers of the town of Dartmouth are or are not, by the Act of incorporation, relieved from the liability which had been imposed by sec. 52 of ch. 32. That point will arise if the liability should be sought to be enforced within the year in which it is claimed to have accrued. At present I, express no decided opinion upon the point, but for the reasons stated, this appeal must, I think, be allowed. The Supreme Court Act, sec. 23, gives an appeal in this case, at its present stage, and no object can be served in calling upon the appellants to raise, by a return to the writ of mandamus, a point which it is competent for the court to decide now and which, in my judgment, it ought in the exercise of a sound discretion to decide by refusing to sanction the issuing of the writ for the single reason above stated.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Foster & Foster.\nSolicitors for respondent: J.

C.\nG., in 1878. being unable on account of the depression of business to meet his liabilities, applied to his creditors for an extension of time for the payment of their claims, showing a surplus of $6000, after deduction of his bad debts. The creditors consented to grant his request and agreed to accept G's 1 notes at 4, 8, 12 and 16 months, on condition that the last of them should be endorsed to their satisfaction. N (the respondent) agreed to endorse the last notes on condition that G. should deposit in a bank in his (N's) name $75 per week to secure him for such endorsation, and G. signed an agreement to that effect. Thereupon N. endorsed G's notes to an amount of over $4000, and they were given to G's creditors. On 31st July, 1879, G., after having deposited $2,007.87 in N's name, in the Ville Marie Bank, failed, and N. paid the notes he had endorsed, partly with the $2,007.87.\nB., as assignee of G., brought an action against N., claiming that the payments made to N. by G. were fraudulent, and praying that the money so deposited might be reimbursed by N, to B. for the benefit of all G's creditors.\nHeld,\u2014Affirming the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench (Ritchie, C.J., and Fournier, J., dissenting), that the arrangement between G. & N. by which the moneys deposited in the bank by G became pledged to N. was not void either under the Insolvent Act or the Civil Code: there was no fraud on the creditors nor such an abstraction of assess from creditors as the law forbids, but a proper and legitimate appropriation of a portion of G'.s assets in furtherance and not in contravention of the rights of the creditors, giving at the most to the surety a preferential security which could not be said to have been in contemplation of insolvency or an unjust preference.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) rendered on 28th April, 1882, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court and dismissing the present appellant's action.\nThis action was instituted by the appellant in his capacity of assignee to the estate of J. P. Godin, a trader of Three Rivers.\nIn November, 1818, Godin became embarrassed and exhibited to his creditors a statement of his affairs shewing that he had a surplus of assets over his liabilities to the extent of $6,000. They signed a written agreement giving him an extension of time to meet his then liabilities accepting his promissory notes for instalments at four eight twelve and sixteen months those falling due at the last date being endorsed by the respondent Normand. To induce Normand to become his security Godin agreed to deposit weekly in the Banque Ville-Marie $75 to the credit of Normand in trust, which, he Normand, was authorized at any time to draw and apply in pay-ment of the paper he had so endorsed for Godin. This agreement was reduced to writing and was made known to Godin's principal creditor who took a leading part in getting the extension of time sanctioned by the other creditors ([1]).\nThe extension was obtained.\nGodin continued to make his payments until July 1879 by which time he had deposited to the trust fund in Normand's name $2,007.77, but, having to succumb to the then prevailing depression, he was, in July, 1879, put into insolvency, whereupon Normand withdrew the monies so placed to his credit. in trust in the Banque Ville-Marie and employed them to liquidate the notes he had so endorsed for Godin, but the sum being insufficient for that purpose, he was obliged to contribute about $2000 of his own means to take up the endorsed notes in question.\nMr. Geoffrion, Q.C., for appellant, contended that at the time of the agreement Godin was insolvent within the meaning of art. 17, sec. 23 of the C. C (L.C.), and that the pledge of monies to respondent by Godin was contrary to the contract of surety ship entered into by the respondent with the creditors, and could not be valid without their consent and was made in fraud of their rights ; secs. 130 132 133 Insolvent Act.\nMr. Lacoste, Q.C., for respondent contended that the evidence clearly established that the agreement between Godin and respondent was not in contravention of any of the sections of the Insolvent Act, that all the conditions to perfect a contract of pledge having been fulfilled, the moneys deposited by Godin in the bank-Ville- Marie in the name and to the credit of the appellant had been legitimately pledged.\nRITCHIE C. J.:\nI think the agreement between Normand and Godin, not communicated to the creditors was a fraud on the arrangement by which the creditors gave an extension of time on their claims of 4, 8, 12 and 16 months without interest the last payment secured by Normand * that any agreement by which Normand was to be secured out of the assets of Godin for his so being surety for such last payment in preference to the creditors, without the same being communicated to them was a fraud on the creditors. They had a right to assume that Normand was a security in addition to the assets of Godin and if he was to be secured out of these assets, whereby the creditors' security for the payment of the first three notes was to such an extent diminished, they had a right to know it. When Godin applied for an extension of time the creditors were entitled to the strictest good faith on his part, and on the part of those securing the fulfillment of the undertakings on the strength of which the extension was to be granted, and if any preferences were to be given, to know the nature and extent thereof, whether to the individual creditors or the sureties of the creditors The agreement between Godin and Normand appears on -he face of the writing to be dated December, 1878, but it was evidently entered into before the agreement of the 29th November 1878 for extension of time between Godin and his creditors, for that agreement is based on Normand's securing the last payment and on Normand's consent to do so, which is made apparent by the defendant's factum, so that in point of fact this agreement between Normand and Godin we actually entered into while Godin was unquestionably insolvent and unable to meet his liabilities. The respondent's factum thus puts it:\u2014\nDuring the month of November, 1878, Godin, not being able to collect sufficiently to meet his liabilities on account of the depression of business prevailing at the time, applied to his creditors for an extension of time for the payment of their claims. The creditors consented to grant the demand and agreed to accept Godin's notes at four, eight, twelve and sixteen months, on condition that the last of them be endorsed to their satisfaction. Godin then applied to the respondent for his endorsation. The respondent first asked for a statement of Godin's affairs, and after finding out about the aforesaid surplus, he consented to endorse the last notes of Godin's composition, on condition that Godin would deposit in the Ville-Marie bank, at Three Rivers in the name of the respondent, and to secure him for such endorsation, seventy-five dollars every week.\nGodin being at the time insolvent, and the creditors being willing to give their debtor time on receiving security for the last instalment, Godin had no right to bargain behind the backs of the creditors with a person to become such surety, who must also have known of his inability to meet his engagements and therefore in that sense insolvent to the detriment of the creditors who were about to grant him the extension of time, by giving the surety such a control over the debtor's assess for his protection, as must necessarily depreciate the security of the creditors in respect of the notes given them for the three first instalments: in other words, entering into such an agreement with the debtor the creditors were entitled to be informed of everything connected with the arrangement, so that they might be enabled to form an intelligent judgment as to the propriety of acceding or not to it; that no one creditor should obtain an unequal advantage over the other still less that he who professed to be securing the arrangement in whole or in part should be permitted to do so.\nIn agreeing to give time without security for the first, second and third instalments, it is not reasonable to suppose creditors could have contemplated that the funds out of which the unsecured notes should be paid would be weekly set apart, not to pay these notes -as they became due but to remain in the bank to meet the secured instalment due four months after the time when the last of the three would fall due and therefore the withholding of the information of this important fact from the creditors was calculated to mislead the creditors ignorant of it into agreeing to that to which they might not otherwise have assented.\nThere is no room for the contention of defendants that if the security to defendants is not good his endorsation is not The one has no dependence on the other at all endorsement as between the creditors and Normand is all right as carrying out Godin's and Normand's agreement with them but the security between Godin and Normand, of which they knew nothing, is all wrong, as a fraud on the creditors.\nThe communication to Mr. Linton, who appears to have been a friendly creditor and acting in the interest of the debtor rather than the creditors, by no means relieves, in my opinion, the burthen alike on Godin and Normand of acting in the utmost good faith with all the creditors, and does not relieve a preference to an individual creditor or a surety, a knowledge of which is withheld from the creditors, from being an unjust preference.\nThe very withdrawal of this amount from his business may have led to or accelerated his final insolvency.\nUnder these circumstances I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nI am of opinion that the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench ought to be affirmed.\nIt is impossible to say that the arrangement between Godin and the respondent was void tinder any of the provisions of the Insolvent Act, and it is equally impossible to point out any express provision of the com-mon law as contained in the Civil Code of (Quebec, against which it offends.\nThen can it be said to have been in fraud of the creditors of Godin ? It seems to me very clear that it cannot. By the arrangement with his creditors Godin was left free to deal with his assets as he thought fit; subject only to this, that, like every other debtor, he was bound not to make any fraudulent disposition of them so as to defeat the just claims of his creditors. The question therefore is reduced to this, was the agreement to make the deposit of $75 a week, upon the faith of which the respondent became a surety for the last payment, such an, abstraction of assets from creditors as is forbidden by law ? And that this question must be answered in the negative seems to be plain; since the very object of these weekly deposits was to create a fund for the payment of the creditors. The money raised by it was always intended to be paid to the creditors, and was in the result actually so applied. it is, therefore, a contradiction in terms to say that it was a contrivance in fraud of creditors,\nThe fallacy of the argument on behalf of the appellant consists in this, it assumes that the surety whom Godin was to find to guarantee the last payments was himself to bear the burden of the payments without any recourse to Godin or his assets. This is altogether an erroneous assumption, for it is manifest from the very terms of the agreement with the creditors that Godin himself was. as is the case in every contract of suretyship, to be the party principally liable, and the surety was only to be liable in the event of Godin's default such an order of liability being necessarily implied in the very words used in the agreement of the 29th November, 1878, \u201cthe last payment secured by T. E. Normand of Three Rivers.\"\nThe agreement between Godin and the respondent therefore merely provided for a proper and legitimate application of a portion of Godin's assets, and has resulted in such an application accordingly.\nHad an arrangement of a similar nature been made with one of the prior creditors of Godin, providing, for instance, that Godin should make a deposit for the purpose of creating a fund for the payment of the extension notes of that particular creditor, and had that arrangement not been communicated to the whole body of creditors, such an arrangement would have been clearly in fraud of creditors generally, and the assignee would have been entitled to the money deposited in pursuance of its terms, and to recover from the favored creditor any sum which might have been paid over to him. But the respondent does not stand in the same position as one of the old creditors who entered into an agreement to give time to the debtor on the implied understanding and agreement between each of them and all the others that all were to be treated on terms of perfect equality. The respondent, on the other hand, comes in .subsequently under an agreement made with Godin alone, and which the latter was perfectly free, to make, provided it did not unlawfully prejudice his creditors, and that it did not prejudice them is apparent from two considerations, for,-first, it tended to carry out the arrangement that they were to have security for the last payment; and, secondly, it provided for the formation of a fund out of Godin's assets for the purpose of being handed over directly to the creditors in satisfaction of the last deferred payment, to which purpose the moneys accumulated under it have in fact been applied. It was therefore in all respects an agreement in furtheronce and not in contravention of the rights of the creditors tinder the arrangement made by them with their debtor. Again, when the creditors stipulated for a surety for the last payment, they must have contemplated that Godin would, under the general law, be bound to indemnify him, and how, then, can they say that a provision for securing this indemnity to the surety is in fraud of their rights ? At the most, it was but to give the surety a preferential security; but there is nothing in the law to forbid such a preference, for it could not be said to have been made in contemplation of insolvency, or an unjust preference.\nAltogether, I fail to see any shadow of illegality in the agreement between Godin and the respondent.\nI am also of opinion, for the reasons given in the judgment of I Mr. Justice Tessie, in the Court of Queen's Bench, that at the time of the insolvency the respondent had, pursuant to art. 1970 of the civil code of Quebec, acquired, through the delivery of these moneys to a third party (the bank) a right of \" gage \" which, not being, for the reasons before given, tainted with any illegality, gave him a valid preference over the assignee as representing the general body of creditors. The case of exported Brunel ([2]), resembles the present case in every particular, and is an authority for the present decision\nIn my judgment, this appeal must be dismissed with costs\nFOURNIER, J.:\nEn 1878 J.P. Godin, marchand de la ville de Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, force de suspendre ses paiements, fit avec ses cr\u00e9anciers un concordat par lequel ceux-ci consentirent \u00e0 accepter le paiement de leurs cr\u00e9ances respectives par versements \u00e0 4, 8, 12 et 16 mois de date mais sans int\u00e9r\u00eat. Suivant les termes d\u00e9 l'arrangement, (the last payment secured by T. E. Normand of Three Rivers,) le payment du dernier versement devait \u00eatre garanti par l'Intim\u00e9. Ainsi pour compl\u00e9ter ce contrat if fallait le concours de. trois diff\u00e9rentes parties contractantes, savoir: parties de premi\u00e8re part, les cr\u00e9anciers de Godin; partie de la seconde part, Godin lui-m\u00eame; enfin, de la troisi\u00e8me part, l'Intim\u00e9, comme caution. Toutes ces parties y donn\u00e8rent leurs concours, d'abord les cr\u00e9anciers en accordant les d\u00e9lais et la remise demain des Godin en les acceptant et l'Intim\u00e9 en fournissant la s\u00fbret\u00e9 requise. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 cet arrangement, Godin remit \u00e0 ses cr\u00e9anciers, les billets provisoires, payables aux \u00e9ch\u00e9ances convenues. Les derniers portaient suivant la convention l'endossement de l'Intim\u00e9. L'obligation par lui contract\u00e9e comme caution et endosseur est g\u00e9n\u00e9rale; il n'y a \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9 aucune restriction quelconque, si ce n'est la limite du montant du cautionnement fix\u00e9e \u00e0 un quart du passif de Godin repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par les billets portant l'endossement de l'Intim\u00e9.

Le jour m\u00eame et pendant les quelques jours qui pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e8rent cette seconde faillite, Normand retira le montant des d\u00e9p\u00f4ts et l'employa \u00e0 acquitter pour partie la dette qu'il avait cautionn\u00e9e. L'appelant ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 syndic \u00e0 cette faillite intenta une action contre l'Intim\u00e9 pour le faire contraindre \u00e0 rapporter \u00e0 la masse en faillite de Godin les deniers ainsi d\u00e9pos\u00e9s et retires par lui. En outre de ces faits l'appelant all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que lorsqu'il donna ses endossements l'Intim\u00e9 connaissait l'\u00e9tat de faillite de Godin que c'\u00e9tait en con-sid\u00e9ration du d\u00e9lai accord\u00e9 que cet endossement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 exig\u00e9 pour les derniers paiements;\u2014que l'arrangement particulier au sujet des d\u00e9p\u00f4ts avait Ct\u00e9 fait \u00e0 l'insu et en fraude des cr\u00e9anciers que l'Intim\u00ea n'\u00e9tait cr\u00e9ancier de Godin ni \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de l'arrangement ni lorsqu'il a retire l\u00e9 montant de ces d\u00e9p\u00f4ts frauduleusement d\u00e9tourn\u00e9s de la masse des biens du failli:\u2014que leur convention ace sujet \u00e9tait contraire aux termes de l'arrangement fait avec les cr\u00e9anciers, et que les paiements faits \u00e0 l'Intim\u00e9 par ces d\u00e9p\u00f4ts avaient l'effet d'an\u00e9antir la garantie qu'il avait lui-m\u00eame donn\u00e9e aux cr\u00e9anciers. L'Intim\u00e9 a plaid\u00e9 quo la convention attaqu\u00e9e \u00e9tait une des conditions auxquelles il avait consenti \u00e0 se porter caution pour Godin; qu'elle n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 tenue secr\u00e8te et que certains cr\u00e9anciers de Godin en avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 informes, qu'avec les argents ainsi d\u00e9pos\u00e9s et par lui retires de la banque ii avait pav\u00e9 des billets do Godin endoss\u00e9s par lui se montant \u00e0 une somme exc\u00e9dant celle re\u00e7ue de cette mani\u00e8re. 11 niait aussi la fraude imput\u00e9e.\nPar sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 ce plaidoyer, l'appelant a ni\u00e9 que les cr\u00e9anciers eussent \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9s de la convention en question; que l'information re\u00e7ue par quelques-uns d'entre eux ne pouvaient lier les autres; que cette convention particuli\u00e8re entre Godin et l'Intim\u00e9 aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre port\u00e9e \u00e0 la connaissance de toutes les parties \u00e0 l'acte do Godin avec ses cr\u00e9anciers.\nLa preuve \u00e9tablit los faits all\u00e9guas par l'appelant. Celle faite par l'Intim\u00e9 a prouv\u00e9 qu'un seul des cr\u00e9anciers M. Linton avait eu connaissance de cette convention, mais apr\u00e8s la signature du contrat comme le fait voir l'extrait suivant du t\u00e9moignage:\u2014\nQuestion:\u2014Did he (Godin) mention to what condition Normand consented to become security for him ? Answer:\u2014He did subsequently, after his agreement had been pretty generally signed.\u2014Question:\u2014Was it completed when he mentioned this ? Answer:\nI think so, as far as my memory goes, it was practically completed....Question:\u2014Did Godin tell you that he was to make a deposit of $75.00 every week to the credit of Normand for the security of the payment of the last note indorsed by Normand? Answer:\u2014I cannot tell you exactly the sum. but I understood from him that he toas to deposit at stated intervals.\u2014Question:\u2014Did you agree to this ? Answer: I consented. There was no agreement required. [At page 19 of the case the same witness answers as follows in cross-examination:] Question:\u2014Did you inform any of the other creditors of Godin of his intent of depositing money as you have above stated ? Answer: No.\nGodin, dans sa d\u00e9position, r\u00e9pond affirmativement \u00e0 la question suivante: \u2014 Si je vous comprends bien, M. Linton est le soul de vos cr\u00e9anciers. \u00e0 qui vous avez donn\u00e9 l'information des conditions de M. Norman'd ? R. Oui, monsieur.\nPar cette preuve ii est \u00e9vident que Linton a \u00e9t\u00e9 le seul informe qu'il devait \u00eatre fait un d\u00e9p\u00f4t * mais ii n'a pu dire si ce d\u00e9p\u00f4t devait \u00eatre fait au nom de Godin ou de Normand. Encore n'a-t-il su cela qu'apr\u00e8s l'ex\u00e9cution du concordat. Il y a consenti, ajoute-t-il. Mais ii n'y a rien dans son t\u00e9moignage qui fasse voir qu'il consentait \u00e0 ce que ces d\u00e9p\u00f4ts fussent faits en d\u00e9duction du cautionnement de Normand, Dans tous les cas c'est un fait positif que le consentement, quelle qu'en soit la port\u00e9e, n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 que par lui seul et par aucun autre cr\u00e9ancier; et ii n'\u00e9tait non pas le plus fort, mais un des plus forts cr\u00e9anciers. Aucun des autres n'a Cu connaissance de cette convention. L'assertion contraire, faite \u00e0 ce sujet par l'hon. juge Cross, est en contradiction \u00e9vidente avec la preuve. Au surplus la connaissance que Linton avait de cette convention particuli\u00e8re ne pouvait lier que lui seul. Il n'\u00e9tait pas l'agent des cr\u00e9anciers, car ceux-ci out agi personnellement dans cette transaction.\nLa cour de premi\u00e8re instance pr\u00e9side par l'hon. juge Sciotte a donn\u00e9 gain de cause \u00e0 l'appelant. La Cour du Bane de ha Reine a \u00e9t\u00e9 divis\u00e9e, deux juges \u00e9tant pour la confirmation, et trois pour l'infirmation, le jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 en cons\u00e9quence infirm\u00e9.\nL'hon. juge Gross est d'opinion que la convention entre Godin et l'Intim\u00e9 n'est ni une fraude ni m\u00eame une pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence. Cela pourrait \u00eatre vrai si les faith de la cause permettaient d'adopter le point de d\u00e9part de son argumentation: la solvabilit\u00e9 de Godin. L'hon. juge fait \u00e0 ce sujet les remarques suivantes:\nOn the statement on which Godin made terms with his creditors he had at the time a surplus, a fact which has not been disputed. The creditors by their agreement with him in effect consented to his being considered solvent, consequently with the power to deal with, and to dispose fairly of his own estate.\nAs being solvent, it was quite competent for him to bargain with a person to become his surety, and even to give that person a consideration for becoming such surety. The obligation of that surety, was not that in any event he should himself pay without reference to Godin's estate: but that Godin would himself pay out his own estate, and that if he failed to do so ho the surety would make good the deficiency which Godin had failed to pay by his own exertions, with his own means, and oat of his own estate.\nC'est sur l'exc\u00e9dant apparent de l'actif sur le passif dans l'\u00e9tat soumis \u00e0 ses cr\u00e9anciers que deux des hon. juges s'appuient pour dire que Godin, lors du concord\u00e2t avec ses cr\u00e9anciers n\u00e9tait pas insolvable. Cependant il \u00e9tait forc\u00e9 de suspendre paiement, et au lieu do rencontrer ses dettes \u00e0 lear \u00e9ch\u00e9ance ii demandait un d\u00e9lai de seize mois avec r\u00e9duction de Pint\u00e9r\u00eat. Le commer\u00e7ant qui so trouve dans cette condition est en faillite * c'est indubitable. Pardessus ([3]), en parlant do la diff\u00e9rence qu'il v a entre la d\u00e9confiture et la faillite, dit tr\u00e8s positivement que le commer\u00e7ant qui a suspendu. ses paiements, quel que soit l'exc\u00e9dant de son actif sur le passif est en faillite.\nInd\u00e9pendamment de cette diff\u00e9rence tir\u00e9e de celle des personnes qui peuvent devenir insolvables, la faillite diff\u00e8re essentiellement de J\u00e0 d\u00e9confiture. La premi\u00e8re est un \u00e9tat do cessation do paiement, sans distinction s'il provient d'une insolvabilit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle et absolue. ou seulement d'un embarras momentan\u00e9. Quelque soit l'actif d'un commer\u00e7ant fut-il dix fois au-dessus de son passif, s'il cesee de payer, il est en faillite. Au contraire, s'il est exact dans sos paiements; si, par un cr\u00e9dit toujours soutenu, il fait constamment honneur \u00e0 ses engagements, dut-il dix fois plus qu'il no poss\u00e8de, il n'est pas en \u00e9tat de faillite.\nAinsi le commer\u00e7ant est failli lorsqu'il no poss\u00e8de plus do cr\u00e9dit, quand m\u00eame il aurait plus do biens quo do dettes, ce qui n'est pas impossible. On a vu des commer\u00e7ants avoir pour un million d'immeubles, et au plus 300.000 francs de dettes, \u00eatre cependant constitu\u00e9s en faillite, parce qu'ils no payaient pas aux \u00e9ch\u00e9ances.\nLa faillite, d'apr\u00e8s le code civil, art. 17, sec. 23, est l'\u00e9tat d'un commer\u00e7ant qui a cess\u00e9 ses paiements. C'est le cas aussi d'aprss la loi de faillite de 1875, sec. 4, qui autorise les cr\u00e9anciers \u00e0 proc\u00e9der en liquidation forc\u00e9e contre un d\u00e9biteur qui a cess\u00e9 de rencontrer sos engagements \u00e0 leurs \u00e9ch\u00e9ances. Si au lieu d'adopter les proc\u00e9d\u00e9s do la sec. 4 que la position de Godin aurait justifi\u00e9s les cr\u00e9anciers ont pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 s'entendre \u00e0 l'amiable et accepter la garantie de Normand cela no change pas sa position do commer\u00e7ant qui a cess\u00e9 ses paiements. Sans cette garantie ii e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en liquidation forc\u00e9 comme le fait voir le t\u00e9l\u00e9gramme du 21 d\u00e9cembre:\u2014\nIf extension notes are not forwarded at once we shall send an assignee.\nD'ailleurs le fait d'avoir r\u00e9uni ses cr\u00e9anciers pour faire un compromis avec eux enl\u00e8ve tout douce sur la question do son insolvabilit\u00e9, puisque d'apr\u00e8s la sec. 3 de la loi do 1875, c'est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment l'un des cas o\u00f9 un commer\u00e7ant doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 en faillite. \" Un d\u00e9biteur dit-elle sera (shall) consider\u00e9 insolvable s'il a convoqu\u00e9 une assembl\u00e9e do ses cr\u00e9anciers dans le but de composer avec eux.\" Godin en convoquant comme ii l'a fait ses cr\u00e9anciers pour prendre des arrangements avec eux s'est constitu\u00e9 en faillite Cela n'est pas discutable.\nQuant \u00e0 l'argument en faveur do la solvabilit\u00e9 de Godin, tire du fait quo son actif exc\u00e9dait le passif, la citation ci-dessus do Pardessus lo r\u00e9duit \u00e0 n\u00e9ant.\nMais disent encore les hon. juges les cr\u00e9anciers par leur arrangement l'ont consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme solvable. L'hon. juge Cross dit:\nThe creditors by their agreement with him in effect consented to his being considered solvent, consequently with the power to deal with, to dispose fairly of his own estate.\nL'hon. juge Tessier dit:\nA l'\u00e9poque do Ce cautionnement le debater n'\u00e9tait pas en faillite, J'\u00eatat de,faillite est cr\u00e9\u00e9 par le statut, c'est une condition statutaire; les cr\u00e9anciers n'ont pas voulu Jo d\u00e9clarer on faillite,\u2014ils ne l'ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 quo seize mois apr\u00e8s.\nLa conduite des cr\u00e9anciers fait voir au contraire qu'ils ne consid\u00e9raient pas Godin comme solvable lors du concordat. Avec l'exp\u00e9rience qu'ils ont do ces sortes d'affaires ils out cru no devoir estimer son actif q\u00fb'\u00e0 75 p. c. du passif, en exigeant pour les autres 25 p. c. le cautionnement de l'Intim\u00e9. Si Godin eat alors redevenu solvable et capable do contracter de nouveau pour lea fins do son commerce, c'est gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 cet arrangement. Pouvait-il en d\u00e9truire les conditions et rester solvable. Du moment, qu\u2019il d\u00e9truisait la garantie des 25 p. c. qui avait en l'effet de le rendre solvable ii cessait de l'\u00eatre et retombait dans la position o\u00f9 il se trouvait avant la signature du concordat. C'est clairement ce qu'il a fait par sa convention particuli\u00e8re avec l'Intim\u00e9. Il n'\u00e9tait au pouvoir ni, de Godin ni do Normand, sa caution, de faire aucune transaction quelconque tendant \u00e0 diminuer l'effet cautionnement donn\u00e9 aux cr\u00e9anciers.\nLe principe sum lequel est bas\u00e9 le jugement do la Cour du Banc de la Reine, est qu'un commer\u00e7ant sorti de l'\u00e9tat de faillite par un concordat eat habile \u00e0 faire toutes sortes do contrats pour son commerce. L'appelant n'entend pas contester cette proposition\u2014bien que formul\u00e9e d'une mani\u00e8re aussi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale elle ne soit pas sans exception\u2014mais il en conteste l'application \u00e0 cette cause. Godin pouvait sans doute faire des contrats,smais avait-Il le droit do lea annuler modifier on rendre illusoire seul et sans le consent\u00e9ment des autres parties avec lesquelles ii avait contract\u00e9 ? Lui et l'Intim\u00e9 pouvaient-ils souls d\u00e9truire l'effet du cautionnement donn\u00e9 suivant la convention faite avec les cr\u00e9anciers. C'est un principe \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire en mati\u00e8re de convention que pour les annuler on modifier ii faut le consentement de toutes lea parties qui y ont pris part Cette convention ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 faite \u00e0 l'insu de tous les, cr\u00e9anciers, ex\u00e7ept\u00e9 un seul, Peut-elle modifier d'une mani\u00e8re quelconque les engagements r\u00e9sultant du concordat ? Evidemment non. Il faut aussi ne pas oublier que les lois concernant le cautionnement, no permettent pas \u00e0 la caution de faire aucun acte qui puisse avoir l'effet de diminuer les s\u00fbret\u00e9s stipul\u00e9es par les cr\u00e9anciers. Ce serait le r\u00e9sultat in\u00e9vitable de cette convention particuli\u00e8re si elle doit recevoir son ex\u00e9cution.\nEn effet du moment que Normand prenait \u00e0 leur insu. sur l'actif les sommes qu'il avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9es, les cr\u00e9anciers cessaient d'\u00eatre assures du paiement do leurs cr\u00e9ances. Los s\u00fbret\u00e9s donn\u00e9es et convenues se trouvaient diminu\u00e9es d'autant, en violation des conditions stipul\u00e9es.\nL'hon. juge Cross, dans la partie ci-dessus cit\u00e9e de son jugement a fait encore l'observation suivante au sujet du cautionnement de Normand:\u2014\nThe obligation of this surety, was not that in any event he should himself pay without reference to Godin's estate but that Godin would himself pay out of his own estate, and that if he failed to do so he the surety would make good the deficiency which Godin had failed to pay by his own exertions, with his own means, and out of his own estate.\nO\u00f9 I'hon. juge a-t-il trouv\u00e9 la pr\u00e9uve de la restriction qu'il met aux obligations r\u00e9sultant du cautionnement de Godin ? Je n'ai Pu la trouver nulle part. Bien au contraire ii n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait \u00e0 ce cautionnement et aux obligations qui devaient en r\u00e9sulter aucune autre restriction que celle du montant, comme le d\u00e9montrent los termes dans lesquels il a \u00e9t\u00e9 stipul\u00e9:\u2014\u2014\nThe last payment to be secured by T. E. Normand.\nL'obligation de Normand est donc g\u00e9n\u00e9rale d'apr\u00e9s la: convention. La restriction indiqu\u00e9e par l'hon. juge existe-t-elle dans la loi en faveur de la caution ? Jo ne crois pas que l'hon. juge alt voulu exprimer cette opinion, car on verra par les autorit\u00e9s cit\u00e9es ci-apr\u00e8s qu'elle n'est pas fond\u00e9e en loi. L'obligation r\u00e9sultant du cautionnement peut bien \u00eatre limit\u00e9e, mais il faut s'en expliquer. Si dans le cas actuel, les cr\u00e9anciers eussent \u00e9t\u00e9, avant do contracter, inform\u00e9s quo Normand ne consents it \u00e0 \u00eatre la caution de Godin qu'aux conditions stipul\u00e9es entre eux et qu'ils eussent accept\u00e9 en connaissance do cause, ils ne pourraient certainement pas attaquer cette convention. Ils auraient alors fait une convention diff\u00e9rente de celle qu'ils pr\u00e9tendent avoir faite. Au lieu do la garantie additionnelle do Normand, qu'ils ont exig\u00e9e, ils seraient en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 rest\u00e9s seulement avec leur recours personnel contre Godin et la garantie de son fonds de commerce. Mais est-ce bien ce qu'ils ont voulu faire ? Certainement non.\nIls ont au contraire voulu s'assurer 25 p. c. en sus des 75 p. c. garantis par le fonds de commerce et ils ont fait une convention en tout semblable \u00e0 celle au sujet do laquelle Ponsot ([4]) fuit los remarques suivantes, en parlant de cautionnement do partie de la dette:\u2014\nQuelle \u00e9tait d'ailleurs l'intention du cr\u00e9ancier en se faisant donner par le d\u00e9biteur une caution qui r\u00e9pondit do partie do la dette ? Evidemment son intention \u00e9tait do faire garantir jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence de Ia somme cautionn\u00e9e, do la porte que lui ferait \u00e9prouver l'insolvabilit\u00e9 partielle du d\u00e9biteur. Ainsi par exemple supposons quo Primus, en pr\u00eatant \u00e0 Secundus une somme de 100,000 frs. eat exig\u00e9 l'intervention d'un tiers qui s'oblige, comme caution, au paiement do la dite somme jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence do 25,000 francs. Qu'a voulu Primus en exigeant un pareil cautionnement? Pr\u00e9voyant le cas o\u00f9 Secundus ne pourrait payer plus de 75,000 francs, ii a voulu pouvoir demander \u00e0 la caution leo 25000 francs qui lui resteraient dus. Mass ii n'est pas presumable qu'il ait \u00e9ntendu quo la caution serait lib\u00e9r\u00e9e pourvu quo le d\u00e9biteur lui pay\u00e2t 25,000 francs.\nC'est une convention absolument semblable \u00e0 celle-ci que lea cr\u00e9anciers ont fait en exigeant do l'intim\u00e9 son cautionnement pour 25 pour cent du passif de Godin. C'est \u00e0 cette condition qu'ils se sont d\u00e9ssaisis du fonds de commerce et do tous les autres biens de Godin. Mais l'auraient\u2019 ils faits si Normand leur e\u00fbt dit \"Je suis la caution de Godin pour 25 pour cent du montant de vos cr\u00e9ances, mais \u00e0 la condition queue prenne de suite sur les biens de Godin m\u00eame, le montant que je vous garantis. Jo n'entends pas vous payer sur ce cautionnement un seul denier de ma bourse. Ce que je paierai sera tire de la masse en faillite qui vous appartient.\" La r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une telle d\u00e9claration eut \u00e9t\u00e9 sans doute\u2014\" Nous ne vouions pas de cela\u2014la garantie que vous nous offrez nous appartient d\u00e9j\u00e0. C'est notre bien. Ce que nous vouions, c'est une garantie additionnelle.\" Si Normand l'e\u00fbt refus\u00e9e, tout arrangement e\u00fbt sans doute \u00e9t\u00e9 fini. Car ii n'est pas possible de supposer que los cr\u00e9anciers eussent accept\u00e9e une semblable condition qui aurait eu l'effet de rendre illusoire la garantie demand\u00e9e. Ils eussent sans doute pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la liquidation. C'est pour cette raison que Normand s'est bien g'ard\u00e9 de n'en rien dire; Godin seul en a parl\u00e9 \u00e0 Linton. En se portant caution, sans faire de conditions sp\u00e9ciales avec les cr\u00e9anciers pour restreindre l'effet de son cautionnement, Normand, qui est notaire do profession connaissait toute l'\u00e9tendue de l'obligation qu'il contractait. Il en a limit\u00e9 le montant seulement, mais quant \u00e0 Ce montant son obligation l\u00e9gale \u00e9tait de payer pour Godin si celui-ci ne payait pas lui-m\u00eame.\nIl n'est gu\u00e8re utile d'ajouter d'autres autorit\u00e9s \u00e0 ce sujet. Il comprenait l'\u00e9tendue des obligations r\u00e9sultaut do son cautionnement. Il devait savoir comme le dit Laurent ([5]) \" que le cautionnement est un acte do disposition; en effet la caution s'oblige \u00e0 payer sans rien obtenir, en compensation des risques qu'elle court, ni du cr\u00e9ancier, ni du d\u00e9biteur. Elle dispose de ce qu'elle s'oblige do donner au cr\u00e9ancier, car payer, c'est disposer.\" Il est clair quo la convention particuli\u00e8re est contraire \u00e0 la nature du cautionnement ainsi expliqu\u00e9, L'obligation do la caution \u00e9tant do donner an cr\u00e9an\u00e7ier\n(2) Vol. 28, p. 169. ce \u00e0 quoi elle s'est oblig\u00e9e. Ce serait an\u00e9antir pour partie, cette obligation si elle prenait sur les biens du d\u00e9biteur au d\u00e9triment du cr\u00e9ancier non compl\u00e8tement d\u00e9sint\u00e9ress\u00e9, une partie de ce qui est n\u00e9cessaire pour s'acquitter. Ce serait diminuer l'effet de son obligation, Ce serait aussi, en m temps, donner et retenir,__ce qui ne se peut.\nLe principe que la caution ne peut faire aucun acte qui puisse avoir l'effet de diminuer les obligations r\u00e9sultant de son cautionnement, a \u00e9t\u00e9 plusieurs fois sanctionn\u00e9 par les tribunaux. La doctrine a ce sujet est si bien r\u00e9sum\u00e9e dans un article cite au Journal du Palais, 1842 ([6]), qu'il n'est gu\u00e8re possible d'entretenir de doute sur ce point apr\u00e8s en avoir lu l'extrait suivant:\n......qu'aux tenues de l'art. 2011 C.C. celui qui serrent caution d'une obligation se soumet envers le cr\u00e9ancier a satisfaire \u00e0 cette obligation si le d\u00e9biteur n'y satisfait pas lui-m\u00eame; que de la nature et de l'objet du cautionnement, des termes de cette article, des principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux du droit et des r\u00e8gles de l'\u00e9quit\u00e9, il r\u00e9sulte quo le cr\u00e9ancier est fond\u00e9 \u00e0 s'opposer \u00e0 tout acte, \u00e0 r\u00e9sister \u00e0 toute pr\u00eat ntion do la caution qui pourrait avoir pour r\u00e9sultat de porter atteinte \u00e0 l'int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 de sos droits contre le d\u00e9biteur principal, et de l'emp\u00eacher de tirer de l'actif du d\u00e9biteur toutes les ressources qu'il peut presenter: que c'est par une application do ce principe que l'art. 1292, d\u00fb m\u00eame code dispose que la subrogation \u00e9tablie par l'art. 1251 contre le d\u00e9biteur principal en faveur de la caution qui a pay\u00e9 le cr\u00e9ancier ne peut nuire \u00e0 celui-ci lorsqu'il na \u00e9t\u00e9 pa\u00e9\u00e9 qu'en partie.\nLa m\u00eame doctrine a \u00e9t\u00e9 suivie dans un autre arr\u00eat rapport\u00e9 par Devilleneuve et Carrette ([7]), on on lit ce qui suit:\u2014.\n......un falli qui a obtenu un concordat avec des termes pour le paiement des dividendes, vend \u00e0 r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 son fonds de commerce a l'un des cr\u00e9anciers concordataires et n\u00e9anmoins continue \u00e0 exploiter ce fonds de mani\u00e8re a tromper ses cr\u00e9anciers anciens et nouveaux sur sa solvabilit\u00e9. Un tel acte de vente doit \u00eatre annul\u00e9 comme fait en fraude des cr\u00e9anciers, (C.C. 1167.)\nLe commer\u00e7ant dans ce cas \u00e9tait aussi habile \u00e0 faire toutes sortes de transactions que Godin pouvait l'\u00eatre dans le cas actuel. Cependant cet acte est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un dol \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des cr\u00e9anciers auxquels ii n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9. N'en doit-il pas \u00eatre de-m\u00eame de la convention particuli\u00e8re entre Normand et Godin ? La diff\u00e9rence c'est que dans le cas actuel les cr\u00e9anciers sont tromp\u00e9s avant le concordat et que dans l'autre ils l\u00e9sant apr\u00e8s. Quant \u00e0 l'effet sur la transaction, ii est le m\u00eame.\nPour confirmer le principe que la caution ne peut rien faire qui puisse rendre son obligation illusoire on pent encore r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 la cause de Whitney v. Craig et Craig opposant ([8]). Dans cette cause, le d\u00e9fendeur Craig avait fait une composition par laquelle ii d\u00e9vi\u00e2t payer ses cr\u00e9anciers en 7 versements, dont les trois derniers seuls \u00e9taient garantis par le cautionnement de L. D. Craig l'opposant. Ce dernier avait stipul\u00e9 avec les cr\u00e9anciers eux-m\u00eames qu'il aurait, pour ce qu'il serait tenu de payer, pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence sur les effets que le d\u00e9fendeur poss\u00e9derait alors. La caution, l'opposant, paya d'avance les trois derniers versements qu'elle avait garantis, afin de r\u00e9clamer le privil\u00e8ge stipul\u00e9 contre les cr\u00e9anciers qui n'avaient pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s des premiers versements. Il fut colloqu\u00e9,\u2014mais sur contestation, sa collocation fut rejet\u00e9e par le jugement de la cour Sup\u00e9rieure pour les motifs suivants:\nThe creditors had a manifest interest in getting security for the three last instalments, having only the personal undertaking of the defendant, and the security on the goods for the other instalments. If the pretentions of the opposant were maintained, he would take the proceeds of their very goods, and the security intended to be given would be merely illusory. We cannot put such a construction on the clause as to sustain this\nCe principe doit recevoir son application dans cette cause. La convention particuli\u00e8re de Normand et de Grodin a clairement pour effet de rendre le cautionnement illusoire, en violant en m\u00eame temps le principe que la caution ne peut jamais venir \u00e0 contribution avec le cr\u00e9ancier qu'elle a cautionn\u00e9. Prendre d'avance, m\u00eame sous forme de gage, comme l'a fait Normand, partie des biens du failli qui \u00e9taient la s\u00fbret\u00e9 des cr\u00e9anciers c'\u00e9tait plus que venir \u00e0 contribution, c'\u00e9tait an\u00e9antir son cautionnement,\u2014ce qu'il ne pouvait faire sans le consentement des cr\u00e9anciers. C'\u00e9tait, dans tous les casse payer de son cautionnement au detriment des cr\u00e9anciers cautionn\u00e9s, en diminuant leurs garanties, \u2014ce que d'apr\u00e8s les autorit\u00e9s ci-dessus cit\u00e9es, ii ne pouvait faire.\nLa loi reconna\u00eet sans doute \u00e0 la caution un recours en indemnit\u00e9 contre le d\u00e9biteur * mais dans l'exercice de ce recours, celle-ci ne peut jamais venir en concurrence avec le cr\u00e9ancier cautionn\u00e9, ni faire aucun acte qui puisse porter atteinte \u00e0 l'int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 de ses droits contre le d\u00e9biteur, Mais il faut remarquer que ce recours n'est accord\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 la caution qui a pay\u00e9 le montant de son cautionnement, et pas avant, except\u00e9e en quelques cas. Normand n'avait rien pay\u00e9 et n'\u00e9tait pas cr\u00e9ancier de Godin lorsqu'il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 tirer du fonds de commerce les deniers avec lesquels ii pr\u00e9tend acquitter son cautionnement.\nQuelle est la condition sous laquelle la caution a droit \u00e0 un recours contre le d\u00e9biteur ? L'article 2028 ([9]) r\u00e9pond qu'elle a un recours quand elle a pay\u00e9. C'est done le paiement qui est le principe de son action r\u00e9cursoire ([10])..\nL'article 1953 d\u00e9 notre code donne aussi en quelques cas une action \u00e0 la caution contre le d\u00e9biteur avant qu'elle ait pay\u00e9. Le cas de faillite est un de ceux-l\u00e0; mais m\u00eame dans ce cas, elle ne peut jamais venir en concurrence avec le cr\u00e9ancier cautionn\u00e9. Laurent ([11]): En. second lieu la caution peut agir en indemnit\u00e9 contre le d\u00e9biteur. lorsque Celui-ci a fait failltte ou est en d\u00e9confiture.\nOn suppose que lo cr\u00e9ancier, trouvant une pleine garantie dans lo cautionnement, ne se pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e pas \u00e0 la faillite pour \u00eatre pay\u00e9, ou ne poursuit pas le d\u00e9biteur en d\u00e9confiture pour \u00eatre colloqu\u00e9 avec los autres cr\u00e9anciers. Si lo cr\u00e9ancier se pr\u00e9sente, il va sans dire que la caution no peut pas so pr\u00e9senter; car la faillite no peut pas admettre deux fois la memo cr\u00e9ance ce serait vouloir quo le d\u00e9biteur paie deux fois, ce qui est absurdo. La Cour de Montpellier s la ainsi jug\u00e9. La question est discut\u00e9e par Ponsot ([12]) et il conclut aussi qu'admettre la caution \u00e0 contribution en concurrence avec lo cr\u00e9ancier cautionn\u00e9e on admettrait deux fois la memo cr\u00e9ance au passif do Ia m\u00eame faillite\nDuranton ([13]) d\u00e9veloppe au long les raisons pour lesquelles Ia caution ne peut \u00eatre admise \u00e0 concourir avec le cr\u00e9ancier. Il dit comme Ponsot que ce serait faire figurer deux fois la m\u00eame cr\u00e9ance dans les distributions faites sur le d\u00e9biteur, \" et cela, contre tous les principes et le simple bon sens.\" Cette opinion est soutenue par celle de Pardessus ([14]).\nL'autorit\u00e9 de Troplong, ([15]), est au m\u00eame effet.\nIi ne peut donc y avoir conflit entre le cr\u00e9ancier et la caution. Celle-ci n'a de droit contre son d\u00e9biteur qu'apr\u00e8s avoir pay\u00e9 ou d\u00e9sint\u00e9ress\u00e9 le cr\u00e9ancier Dans le cas actuel il est evident que les $2360 que l'Intim\u00e9 a tir\u00e9es du fonds de commerce de Godin \u00e9taient la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de celui-ci. Normand dit qu'il les a employ\u00e9s \u00e0 payer son cautionnement. C'est done en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 Godin et non lui qui a fait ce paiement. Il doit done \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 fait en d\u00e9duction non du cautionnement mais \u00e0 l'acquit de la dette non cautionn\u00e9e, pour le paiement de laquelle le fonds de commerce \u00e9tait la seule garantie. C'est en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 un paiement fait par Godin lui-m\u00eame auquel appartenait cet argent, bien que les deniers soient parvenus aux cr\u00e9anciers par les mains do Normand c'est un \u00e0-compte donn\u00e9 par God\u00een.\nLes \u00e0-comptes pay\u00e9s par le d\u00e9biteur sont plut\u00f4t cens\u00e9s \u00e9teindre la partie non cautionn\u00e9e que la partie cautionn\u00e9e. Le cr\u00e9ancier n'a exige le cautionnement quo pour so pr\u00e9munir contre le cas do non paiement. Le fid\u00e9jusseur ne saurait trouver dans ces \u00e0-comptes une exception dont ii puisse profiter ([16]),\nSur le tout j'en suis venu \u00e0 la conclusion qu'il faut consid\u00e9rer Godin comme \u00e9tant en faillite le 29 novembre 1878, date du concordat; que la convention particuli\u00e8re entre lui et l'Intim\u00e9 ne peut \u00eatre justement appr\u00e9ci\u00e9e sans prendre en consid\u00e9ration l'\u00e9tat de faillite de Godin et qu'en cons\u00e9quence, elle constitue une injuste pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence sur les biens du failli et qu'admettre la validit\u00e9 d'une pareille convention, ce serait effectivement reconnaitre \u00e0 l'une des parties \u00e0 un contrat le droit de se d\u00e9lier de ses engagements, sans le consentement do l'autre;\u2014que cette convention est encore contraire aux principes du droit civil qui ne reconnaissent pas \u00e0 la caution le pouvoir de faire aucun acte diminuant les droits du cr\u00e9ancier cautionn\u00e9 ni de venir en concurrence avec lui \u00e0 moins qu'il n'ait \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e8tement desint\u00e9ress\u00e9. Qu'en cons\u00e9quence les $2,360, prises sur les biens de Godin et d\u00e9pos\u00e9es dans une banque d'o\u00f9 elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9es par l'intim\u00e9 doivent \u00eatre rapport\u00e9es \u00e0 la masse en faillite.\nHENRY, J.:\nTo ascertain the true merits of this case it is necessary to look at the position of Godin in the month of November, 1878, when these arrangements were completed. At that time it is shown that the assets amounted to $23000 after making deductions for all doubtful and bad debts It is also shown that he owed about $16,000, and therefore he had good assets, not available at the time, but subsequently available, to the extent of $6,000 over and above all his liabilities. He felt like the inhabitants from one end of the Dominion to the other, the depression of the time, and he felt the difficulty of collecting in what was due. Under the circumstances, he said to his creditors \" I have plenty of means to pay but I cannot realize. I want time from you\u2014if you think proper to give it realize my assets.\" The creditors consented on the terms which have been mentioned. Now, it is said that man was bankrupt. I cannot think so. It is true, the Insolvent Act says that a man who is not able to meet his engagements may, by his creditors, be made a bankrupt, but if a man comes to his creditors and says li the times are bad, I want you to give me time to pay, I have plenty to pay you, but I cannot convert it,\" that does not make a man a bankrupt; on the contrary, if they had attempted to put him in bankruptcy he could have resisted it. He could have said \" I have plenty to pay my debts \" and I doubt if a court would decree bankruptcy in such a case. He stood then as I take it, a free agent. He goes to his creditors and agrees with them to make his payments in four equal instalments\u2014 four, eight, twelve and sixteen months. They agree to this and to withdraw any claim whatever they had over his property, and they took his own personal security, and they could have had no claims against his property for twelve months, at all events until the third note fell due. That man was not in the position of a bankrupt; he was in the position of one who had felt the bad times, like possibly a good many of his own creditors, and wanted a little further time, but the creditors said \" we would like to have the last payment good.\" They felt perfect security for the first three, but they said sixteen months is a long time, and we want security. He goes to Normand and says: \" I have plenty to pay every man I owe; will you go security for $4,000 for the last instalment, which falls due in 16 months ?\" Normand says: \" I will do so, provided you will make provision to meet that payment by paying $75 a week into the bank.\" Was there fraud in that ? I think not. There was a man who asked no deduction from any of his creditors. He only wanted a little time to collect in his assets. Where is the frauds It does not come within any denomination of fraud under the Insolvent Act. But we are told there are a number of French authorities which show that a party who goes security for another, as Normand did in this case, must pay, and he has no right to make an arrangement of this kind to secure himself. I have looked at a number of the authorities which have been shown to see if that principle is recognized, and I have read and considered the authorities cited, but I fail to see the applicability of the doctrines there found, or any of them, to the case now under consideration. I need not take up time by reading them but I have made an estimate of the decisions in all these cases referred to and I find there is not one of them which touches this case. Nearly the whole of them go to show that a party who is a surety shall not rank on the estate\u2014Normand cannot recover on the estate. In one case the bankrupt made a sale of his stock in trade to one of these parties but retained the possession and dominion over the goods and stock in trade himself, and was the means of deceiving all his other creditors and those who gave him advances and the court decided that was fraud and it was fraud. There the transaction was with one of the creditors who agreed with all the others that they should come in and take a common position with him. Therefore it was fraud on his part. The different circumstances of this case are then apart from all of those to which I have referred. But it is said that this man made this arrangement privately\u2014without communication it to the creditors. In the first place I consider there was no fraud in it and I do not consider there was any obligation in him to do so. If the creditors ascertained that Normand was willing to give security, it was for them to ascertain what terms Normand was entering into. If they chose to take Normand as security without enquiring into the transaction between him and Godin, then I take it they cannot accuse Normand of fraud.\nBut there is evidence that Linton who is a partner of one of the firms who are the creditors, and the largest of the firms, knew all about it and approved of it and it is not unreasonable to suppose that he communicated his knowledge to the other creditors. If therefore, they knew of it and did not object to it the subsequent assignee of the estate could not come in and say that these parties claim that that is a fraud.\nBut, as I said before the Insolvent Act of the Dominion supersedes all other laws on the subject. As I take it, there are certain provisions in the statute, and unless there is legal and actual fraud proved (which of course vitiates all contracts,) we must look to that statute. There is a provision made there against preferential assignments to creditors, and there are other provisions made by which a party cannot convey away his estate without value for it ; and again, there are other provisions for protecting creditors, and the legislature therefore provided all that was necessary to guard creditors. Now, under all these circumstances, I must say, I can see no fraud, moral or legal on the part of Normand or on the part of Godin. Suppose a man owes another $5,000, and he goes to his neighbor and says to him \"I owe such a party so much, and if I find security he will give me time to pay it.\" The other says: \" I will give you the money if you will give me security.\" He says: \"I will do so; I will give you a chattel mortgage on all my estate.\" I cannot see fraud in that. The party has the security he wants, and if he wants any stipulation from his creditor not to go outside and pledge his property, it is his duty not to receive that security until he makes the necessary enquiries. I can see no fraud here and \u00cf do not think the appellant has made any case for our consideration I think the appeal should be dismissed, and the decision of the court should be sustained\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\nThis action has been instituted by the appellant in his capacity of assignee to the estate of one Godin a trader at Three Rivers, During the month of November, 1878, Godin, not being able to collect sufficiently to meet his liabilities, on account of the depression of business prevailing at the time, applied to his creditors for an extension of time. He fyled with that application an exact statement of his affairs which showed a surplus of $6000 after deduction of his bad debts and of $13,000, including these bad debts.\nHis creditors consented to grant him the extension demanded, and agreed to accept his notes at four, eight, twelve and sixteen months on condition that the last of them should be endorsed to their satisfaction.\nGodin then applied to the respondent for his endorsation.\nThe respondent first asked for a statement of Godin's affairs, and subsequently consented to endorse the last notes of Godin's composition on condition that he (Godin) would deposit in the Ville Marie Bank, at Three Rivers in the name of him (the respondent) and to secure him for such endorsation seventy-five dollars every week.\nThe agreement reads in the following terms: Nous, soussign\u00e9s, convenons de ce qui suit: u Moi, Joseph Philippe Godin, m'oblige envers Telephore Eus\u00e8be Normand \u00e0 verser tous les samedis, durant une ann\u00e9e, \u00e0 dater du premier d\u00e9cembre courant, une somme de soixante-quinze piastres, dans le fonds d'\u00e9conomie de Ta banque Ville'Marie, portant int\u00e9r\u00eat, pour garantir d\u2019autant le dit, T. E. Normand, de divers endorsements faits en ma faveur pour mon. b\u00e9n\u00e9fice au profit de mes cr\u00e9aneierset de moi, les dits endossements se montant \u00e0 la somme de quatre mille sept cents piastres, payables par billets \u00e0. seize mois de la date du vingt-neuf novembre, mil huit cent soixante et dix-huit. Le dit d\u00e9p\u00f4t sera fait au nom de T. E. Normand in trust* le dit T. E. Normand aura le droit de retirer le dit argent et le payer \u00e0 compte do ses endossements de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 le lib\u00e9rer ainsi quo moi, do ses dits endossements; les inter\u00eats per\u00e7us sur le dit argent soit de la banque Ville-Marie ou par le rachat des dits billets sera pour le benefice du dit Godin ce \u00e0 quoi lo dit T. E. Normand s'oblige.\nSign\u00e9 en double \u00e0 Trois Rivi\u00e8res, D\u00e9cembre 1678.\nJos. Ph. Godin,\nT. E. Normand.\nThe respondent in conformity with, this agreement endorsed Godin's notes to an amount of over $4000 and these notes were delivered to Godin's creditors through Mr. Linton a merchant of Montreal. Godin continued to carry on business and obtained new advances from the same creditors, but on the 3.1st July, 1879, he was put into insolvency, the first only of his composition notes having been paid. Some time after the assignment, the respondent withdrew from the Ville-Marie bank the amount which had been deposited in his name weekly by Godin amounting to $2,007.87 and paid the notes which had been endorsed by him Besides the amount of this deposit so made to his credit and which he had withdrawn as aforesaid, he had to furnish out of his own funds an amount exceeding two thousand dollars to meet these endorsed notes. This suit was instituted by the assignee to compel Norm and, the respondent to return to the mass of the estate the amount of these deposits so received by him from the bank. It is alleged in the declaration that the arrangement between the respondent and Godin was made secretly and with intent to defraud Go-din's creditors.\nBy the judgment of the Superior Court, the respondent was condemned to reimburse to the assignee the amounts so deposited in the banks by Go-din, but this judgment was reversed in the Court of Queen's Bench, and the assignee's action dismissed. The assignee now appeals from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench. I am of opinion to dismiss his appeal.\nThe consid\u00e9rants of the judgment appealed from so completely, in my mind, resume the whole case, that I cannot do better than to quote them:\u2014\nConsidering that in November, 1878, Jos. P. Go-din obtained an extension of time from his creditors his estate then showing a surplus over and above what was necessary to pay all his creditors, and by virtue of said extension and by law he became and was entitled to manage his own estate and affairs, and to enter into and make all legitimate contracts permissible to a merchant doing business on his own account;\nConsidering that the contract by him at the time entered into with the now appellant, by which the latter became security for and endorsed his promissory notes for the last instalment which he was to pay to his then creditors, and by which Go-din undertook to deposit weekly in the banque Ville-Marie, at Three Rivers, in the name and to the credit of the appellant in trust seventy-five ($75.00) per week, as a pledge and security against his endorsement, was a legitimate contract which the said Go-din had a right to make with the appellant:\nConsidering that the monies deposited by Go-din under and in virtue of said contract became pledged to the appellant to secure him against his said endorsement, and did not fall into the estate of the said Go-din on his subsequent insolvency which occurred on the 31st day of July, 1879, and that the same were subsequently withdrawn by the appellant and by him applied in payments so as to liberate him pro tanto from his said endorsement;\nAnd for these reasons the .Appeal Court dismissed the assignee's action.\nThis reasoning is, in my opinion, unanswerable.\nThe allegations of fraud and concealment of the transaction are I may at once remark, entirely disproved. Go-din and Normand acted in perfect good faith.\nThe appellant seems to take it for granted that if the respondent had not got this amount from Godin, the creditors would have got it. But quid constant that it would have been so? Godin, as the Court of Queen's Bench well remarks, after the extension of time given to him in 1878 remained the sole master and manager of his stock in trade and property of any nature. These $2,000, if he had not deposited them in Normand's name, he might have lost in speculation, or in any other manner whatever. Normand had guaranteed that this sum would be with another, paid by Go-din to the creditors. Go-din paid it to Normand, who, in turn, handed it back to the creditors What else can the creditors ask ? They got the sum of $2000 in its entirety, but now, they ask Normand to pay them from his own pocket another sum of $2000. How can they ask this? Normand never promised that if Go-din paid these $2000, he Normand would pay over to their creditors another $2000 of his own moneys besides the $2,000 he had to pay for the balance of the notes. That would be equivalent to saying that he was surety for $6,000, whilst he was surety for $4,000 only. He got Go-din to pay $2000 and he paid the other himself out of his own pocket. He thus fulfilled his obligation in its entirety. The judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench is right, and the appeal must be dismissed.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nI agree that this appeal must be dismissed. When the creditors entered into the conditional agreement with him in November 1878 to the effect that if he would get Normand to endorse the last of the series of notes which they agreed to accept from Go-din in settlement of their demands upon him, so as to enable him, not with standing his previous default, to continue carrying on his business as a solvent trader, they gave him, as it were, carte blanche, as such to go and treat with Normand in order to procure his consent to become endorser for him upon the last of such series of notes\nIt was not to have been expected that Normand should consent to endorse Godin's notes without any consideration for his so doing so as to protect himself against loss. That he should have insisted upon the terms contained in the agreement which is now assailed as fraudulent within the meaning of the Insolvent Act was very natural, and the agreement so made was good and valid: such a transaction has in it no ingredient of fraud which would render it void within any of the provisions of the Insolvent Act and Normand cannot be deprived of the benefit of the conditions which constituted the sole consideration upon and for which he consented to incur, and did incur, the responsibility incident to his endorsing Godin's notes.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Geoffrion, Rinfret & Dorion.\nSolicitors for respondend: Lacoste, Globensky & Bisaillon.\n[1] See p. 720.\n[2] 1 Ch.D. 537.\n[3] 4 Vol. p. 579 No. 1321.\n[4] Du Cautionnement No, 345.\n[5] Voir C.

Ritchie, C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne, JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nLife Assurance\u2014Policy, delivery of\u2014Policy not countersigned, effect of\u2014Premium, proof of payment of\u2014Delivery of policy insufficient\u2014Escrow.\nOn an action on a policy, the appellant company claimed that the policy was never delivered, and that the premium had never been paid, and that it was not a perfected contract between the parties. The policy was sent from Toronto to the agent at Halifax, to receive the premium and countersign the policy and deliver it to the party entitled. The agent never countersigned the policy, and on one side of the policy the following memo. was printed: \"This policy is not valid unless countersigned by \u2014\u2014 agent at \u2014\u2014, countersigned this \u2014\u2014 day of \u2014\u2014. Agent.\"\nThe agent, in his evidence, said he delivered the policy to W. O'D. (the party assuring) not countersigned in order that he might read the conditions, and swore the premium had not been paid. The policy was found among W. O'D's papers after his death, not countersigned. The policy was dated 1st October, 1872, and the first premium would have covered up the year up to the 1st October, 1873. W. O'D. died the 10th July, 1873. The case was tried before McDonald, J., without a jury, and he gave judgment in favor of respondent for the $3,000, and this judgment was confirmed by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia.\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, it was\nHeld (Fournier and Henry, JJ. dissenting) that the evidence established the fact that the policy had not been delivered to the assured as a completed instrument, and therefore Company was not liable. Per Gwynne, J., that the instrument was delivered as an escrow to the agent, not to be delivered as a binding policy to W. O'D. until the premium should be paid and until the agent should in testimony thereof countersign the policy, and that there was no sufficient evidence to divest the instrument of its original character of an escrow, and to hold the defendants bound by the instrument as one completely executed and delivered as their deed.\nMr. Beatty, Q.C., and Mr. Lees, Q.C., for appellants:\nBefore arguing the case, Mr. Lees, on behalf of the appellants, applied to have an affidavit added to the case.\n[THE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The case has been settled and you cannot now amend it by adding what would be equivalent to new evidence.]\nMr. Beatty, Q.C.:\nThe real point in this case is, was the premium ever paid? The fact of the respondent of having the policy in his possession is the chief point on which he relies But as the policy has, on its face, a fatal defect, it not being countersigned by the agent, it was for the plaintiff to prove why it was not countersigned. The printed memorandum is evidence for the appellants that they have not received the premium, and corroborates the evidence and books of the agent. Then, again, we have the fact that the premium was tendered after the death of the assured. The acknowledgment of the receipt of the premium which appears in the policy is only provisional, and is only valid after the agent has countersigned the policy. See Bliss on Life Insurance[1]; Wood v. Poughkeepsie[2]; Bigelow[3]. If this instrument was a completed contract we would be liable unless we proved fraud. The memorandum is notice to the applicant that the agent has no right to deliver the policy until the premium has been paid. This instrument we have proved was not delivered as a completed contract.\n[The learned counsel then reviewed the evidence, contending there was no evidence of payment of the premium, and that, under the circumstances, the onus was on the plaintiff to prove payment.]\nMr. Thompson, Q.C., for respondent:\nThe evidence given by the company's agent is contradicted on material facts, and therefore it ought to have no weight. There is evidence that the policy was in the assured's possession several months prior to his death, and the fact of its not being countersigned does not invalidate the policy. This was not a condition of the policy. The statute incorporating the company declares in what way the policy should issue.\nRITCHIE, C. J.:\nI think this instrument was on its face an incomplete instrument for want of the signature of the agent, and therefore, though produced by the other side, does not authorize an inference of delivery. To give any force or effect to the receipt in the policy it must first be established that the policy was duly delivered, for, if not duly delivered, nothing is established. The policy on its face shows that, though signed by the president and manager, it was not, and was not intended to be, either a complete or a binding instrument; and the fact is unequivocally made apparent to all parties dealing with agents of the company to whom the policy may be transmitted, that the instrument is not to be delivered or received as a valid, binding policy, unless countersigned by the agent to whom it may have been transmitted to be dealt with, that is to say, to be delivered as a valid, binding policy only on payment of the premium, and on being countersigned. Until these conditions were complied with, there was no contract binding on the company, and by the deed and other provisions of the policy before there had been a compliance with these precedent requirements of the company, the deceased only obtained possession of an incomplete instrument which the agent had no right to deliver, or the deceased to accept, as a binding contract. The words, \"This policy is not valid unless countersigned by agent,\" are words, I think, that must be read as part of the policy.\nIn Reg. v. Aldborough[4], Lord Denman, C. J., says:\nIt is almost superfluous to cite authorities to shew all that is written on the instrument, according to the intention of the parties, before execution, constitutes the deed, and that matters subscribed or endorsed may be incorporated; Broke v. Smith[5] is in point; and the doctrine has been uniformly acted on since.\nFor these reasons, I am in favor of allowing the appeal.\nSTRONG, J.:\nAfter some fluctuation of opinion, I have come to the conclusion that we ought to allow this appeal. The question appears to me to be entirely one of fact, for I do not regard the memorandum in the margin to the effect that the policy was not to be valid until countersigned by some agent, as forming part of the policy, or as being a condition to which it was subject. The policy, in my opinion, was prim\u00e2 facia a completed instrument in the hands of the plaintiff, a valid deed under the seal of the defendants, and signed as their act of incorporation required, and as such it estopped them from denying the payment of the premium for which a receipt and discharge was contained in the body of the policy. It was, however, competent for the defendants to shew that the policy had never been delivered, and that it had come into the possession of the assured in such a way that it never was the deed of the defendants, and, in fact, never was a completed instrument,\nThe question is, do they sufficiently shew this? The evidence relied on to establish the non-delivery is that of the defendants' late agent at Halifax, Mr. Allison. He swears that the premium never was paid. This, however, is not the vital question, for, although the premium never was paid, the defendants might be bound by the policy, and the question of payment or non-payment is only important as bearing on the fact of delivery. But then Mr. Allison adds, that for the reason that the premium never was paid he had not countersigned the policy, but had retained it in his hands until the month of May, 1873, when he had handed it to the assured that he might read the conditions; and he says he did not \"deliver it as a binding contract, and did not on that account countersign it.\" Now, this is clear and positive evidence from a party who must have known all the facts, and who is not directly interested, and, moreover, evidence confirmed by the state of the instrument itself, which, however technically complete as a deed, as I think it was, still appears upon its face never to have received the additional sanction of the countersigning, which, it is apparent, was intended should be given to it, and which the witness tells us he withheld for the express purpose of not making it a binding instrument, a very natural reason for finding the policy in the state in which it is now produced. In short the witness swears that the policy never was delivered because it was never paid for; that it was lent to the assured to read the conditions, and he points to the unsigned memorandum, which it was his duty to countersign, as proof confirmatory of his testimony.\nThen I cannot agree with the learned judge below that this explicit statement is to be overthrown because the plaintiff and two witnesses, to whom the learned judge gives credit, impeached Mr. Allison on a collateral point by proving that they saw the policy in the hands of the deceased in the preceding November, 1872, whilst Mr. Allison says he retained it in his possession until May, 1873. There may be a mistake on one side or the other as to the dates, but, assuming that the mistake is Mr. Allison's, this does not show that he is in error when he says \"the premium on this policy \"was never paid. I never delivered it to take effect as \"an executed instrument, and I know that this is so \"because I did not countersign it as I should have done \"if I had delivered it as a completed policy.\" I think the learned judge attributed too little weight to the fact that this policy had not been countersigned, not as a matter of law, but as a fact confirming the testimony of Allison and giving it a great preponderance over that of the plaintiff's witnesses.\nI think this appeal should be allowed, but I am not inclined to give costs, and I think it should, therefore, be without costs, and a new trial should be granted without costs in the court below.\nFOURNIER, J.:\u2014\nL'intim\u00e9, en sa qualit\u00e9 d'administrateur de la succession de W. A. O'Donnell, son fils, d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 ab instestat, r\u00e9clame la somme de $3,000, montant d'une police d'assurance \u00e9mise par l'appelante sur la vie du dit W. A. O'Donnell. Pour rendre cette police obligatoire du 1er octobre 1872 au 1er octobre 1873, la prime \u00e0 payer \u00e9tait de $48.06. Cette police fut envoy\u00e9e de Toronto \u00e0 un M. Allison, agent de la compagnie \u00e0 Halifax, qui devait, apr\u00e8s avoir touch\u00e9 le paiement de la prime, contresigner la police et la d\u00e9livrer \u00e0 qui de droit. Le contreseing de l'agent n'y a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 appos\u00e9.\nA cette demande, la compagnie a oppos\u00e9 comme moyens de d\u00e9fense le d\u00e9faut de paiement de la prime et l'omission du contreseing de l'agent.\nQuant au paiement de la prime, il n'y en a pas d'autre preuve que la d\u00e9claration contenue dans la police elle-m\u00eame, qui est sign\u00e9e, scell\u00e9e et rev\u00eatue de toutes les formes exig\u00e9es par l'acte d'incorporation de l'appelante (34 Vict., ch. 54) pour en former un contrat parfait. Quelques jours apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de l'assur\u00e9, cette police a \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9e dans ses papiers. L'intim\u00e9 s'\u00e9tant adress\u00e9 \u00e0 l'agent pour obtenir le paiement de l'assurance, celui-ci lui r\u00e9pondit qu'il aurait \u00e0 t\u00e9l\u00e9graphier \u00e0 la compagnie et lui demanda de revenir dans une semaine\u2014ce que fit l'Intim\u00e9; mais l'agent n'ayant pas eu de r\u00e9ponse de la compagnie, lui demanda encore de revenir dans une autre semaine. Ce n'est qu'\u00e0 la troisi\u00e8me visite \u00e0 l'agent que l'intim\u00e9 re\u00e7ut pour la premi\u00e8re fois avis que le paiement de la prime \u00e9tait mis en question. N'est-il pas \u00e9trange que cette pr\u00e9tention n'ait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mise \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re entrevue. Quelle n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 y avait-il d'en r\u00e9f\u00e9rer au bureau principal pour constater ce fait. La seule explication que l'on puisse en donner, c'est que l'agent n'avait pas foi dans la r\u00e9gularit\u00e9 de ses livres; que n'y trouvant pas l'entr\u00e9e de la prime qu'il avait re\u00e7ue, il a pens\u00e9 alors qu'il l'avait transmise au bureau et qu'il en trouverait l\u00e0 la preuve. Cette preuve faisant d\u00e9faut, il a cru devoir s'en rapporter \u00e0 ses livres pour d\u00e9clarer que la prime n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9e et que la police n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 remise que pour examen. Mais que vaut cette preuve contre la d\u00e9claration contenue dans la police? En admettant m\u00eame quelle fut admissible et l\u00e9gale, il est clair que reposant uniquement sur la d\u00e9claration d'un t\u00e9moin formellement contredit dans une des parties principales de sa d\u00e9position, cette preuve est insuffisante. Si l'agent Allison se trompe ou manque a la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 lorsqu'il dit qu'il n'a remis la police que pour examen; dit-il plus la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 ou ne se trompe-t-il pas aussi lorsqu'il dit qu'il n'a pas touch\u00e9 la prime. Lorsqu'il dit qu'il \u00e9tait en possession de la police dans le mois de mai 1873, son erreur est incontestable. Il est contredit par le p\u00e8re de l'assur\u00e9 qui a vu cette police entre les mains de son fils le 29 novembre 1872. Il l'est \u00e9galement par John MacDonald qui dit aussi l'avoir vue entre les mains du d\u00e9funt dans l'automne de 1872; il l'est encore par E. C. Mumford qui se trouvait avec MacDonald lorsque le d\u00e9funt leur montra sa police. On peut conclure avec certitude de ces t\u00e9moignages que la police \u00e9tait entre les mains de l'assur\u00e9 dans l'automne de 1872. Elle ne pouvait donc pas \u00eatre entre les mains d'Allison dans le mois de mai 1873, \u00e0 moins de lui avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue par O'Donnell, qui l'aurait ensuite, apr\u00e8s l'accomplissement de toutes les conditions, re\u00e7ue une seconde fois des mains d'Allison. Je ne vois d'autre conclusion \u00e0 tirer de ces faits que celle que la police a \u00e9t\u00e9 remise comme un contrat obligatoire de part et d'autre, et comme elle fait preuve du paiement de la prime, je crois que l'Intim\u00e9 a \u00e9tabli son droit de r\u00e9clamer le montant de l'assurance. On a voulu tirer argument contre lui du fait qu'il s'est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 pr\u00eat \u00e0 payer la prime, mais cela ne peut tirer \u00e0 cons\u00e9quence. On con\u00e7oit qu'il ne pouvait gu\u00e8re avoir de doute sur le fait du paiement. C'est lui-m\u00eame qui en avait compt\u00e9 le montant exact \u00e0 son fils qui part\u00eet avec cette somme et rev\u00eent avec la police. Il devait naturellement croire que le paiement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait. S'il offrait de payer une seconde fois, ce n'est donc pas parce qu'il voulait rem\u00e9dier au d\u00e9faut de paiement, mais plus t\u00f4t pour \u00e9viter les cons\u00e9quences de l'erreur de l'agent. Le sacrifice qu'il aurait fait \u00e9tait insignifiant compar\u00e9 au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice qu'il lui aurait assur\u00e9. Concluant de toutes les circonstances de cette cause au paiement r\u00e9el de la prime, je crois inutile de m'occuper de la question de savoir si les autorit\u00e9s justifient la proposition que m\u00eame dans le cas o\u00f9 la prime n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9e, la remise d'une police en r\u00e8gle contenant la d\u00e9claration de paiement, la compagnie n'aurait pu prendre avantage de ce d\u00e9faut.\nL'autre moyen oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 est l'omission du contreseing de l'agent, qui devait \u00eatre mis au bas de la note suivante qui se trouve au dos de la police:\nThis policy is not valid unless countersigned by agent at countersigned this day of Agent.\nLa condition de nullit\u00e9 comprise dans cette note n'est ni sign\u00e9e par le president et le g\u00e9rant g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la compagnie, ni rev\u00eatue du sceau de la compagnie, qui, en vertu de la 16e sec. de l'acte d'incorporation, sont les conditions requises pour la validit\u00e9 d'une police d'assurance. Une condition de cette importance ne peut \u00eatre rendue obligatoire sans l'accomplissement de ces formalit\u00e9s, \u00e0 moins d'\u00eatre ins\u00e9r\u00e9e avec les autres conditions dans le corps de la police. Dans ce cas, comme la police est rev\u00eatue de toutes les formalit\u00e9s voulues par la 16e sec, cette condition serait devenue obligatoire comme les autres. Les pouvoirs donn\u00e9s au bureau de direction par la ss. 7 de la sec. 13 de l'acte d'incorporation sont assez \u00e9tendus et g\u00e9n\u00e9raux pour conf\u00e9rer \u00e0 la compagnie le droit de faire de cette formalit\u00e9 du contreseing une condition de la validit\u00e9 de la police, bien que cette condition ne puisse avoir d'autre effet que d'assurer \u00e0 la compagnie un contr\u00f4le plus complet sur ses agents. Mais il n'est pas \u00e9tabli en preuve que cette formalit\u00e9 ait \u00e9t\u00e9 exig\u00e9e par aucun r\u00e8glement du bureau de direction, ni qu'elle ait \u00e9t\u00e9 mise au dos de la police par son ordre comme une condition de sa validit\u00e9. Pour ces motifs, je suis d'avis que l'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens. HENRY, J.:\u2014\nThe main question raised by the counsel of the appellants was upon the point of evidence given on the trial on their part that the premium had not been paid. That evidence, supplied only by the local agent of the company, was substantially contradicted by three witnesses, and the learned judge who tried the case decided in favor of the respondent. The policy acknowledges the receipt of the premium and to negative such receipt clear and satisfactory evidence is required; such, in my opinion, has not been given, and I could not under such circumstances feel justified in reversing the finding of the learned judge. It is, however, also denied that the policy was delivered and the contradictory evidence on that point was resolved by the learned judge also in favor of the respondent, and I think properly so for the reasons given by my learned brother Fournier in his judgment read to-day. I agree with my learned brother Strong that the failure of the agent to countersign the policy cannot be raised to invalidate it. The point as an objection was only incidentally referred to in support of the contention that the premium had not been paid and that the policy had not been delivered.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed and the judgment below affirmed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU, J., concurred.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nI think a new trial should be granted in this case. The defendants plead among other pleas: 1st. That the policy declared upon is not their deed; and 2nd. That the premium payable on the policy was never paid by Wm. A. O'Donnelly deceased, in his life time nor any one on his behalf.\nThe defendants have, therefore, put the plaintiff to legal proof of the execution and delivery of the policy, and the question is was the policy which was declared upon executed in the manner required by law to be binding upon the company, defendants, and so executed was it ever delivered to Wm. A. O'Donnell, in his life time, or to any one on his behalf with the intention of its being finally binding upon the company as a policy completely executed? If not issued by the company with the intention of being finally binding upon them, there is not, as is said by Mr. Justice Blackburn in Xenos v. Wickham[6], any magic in the law to make it binding contrary to their intention.\nThe defendants are a company incorporated by the Dominion Statute 34 Vic., ch. 54, by which Act it is provided that the head office of the association shall be in the city of Toronto, and that the company should have a common seal. They were empowered also through a board of directors to make by-laws, rules and regulations for (among other things) the issuing of policies and in what form and with what conditions, restrictions and limitations; and it was enacted that all policies of insurance should be sealed with the common seal of the association, and should be signed by the president or a vice-president and the general manager or such officer as the general board may appoint for that purpose. The policy which was declared upon when produced purported to have the signature of a person signing it in the character of president, and of another purporting to be signed in the character of general manager. It also had a seal attached to it, but the plaintiff offered no evidence of the fact of the execution of the policy either under the common seal of the company or by the persons competent to sign policies on behalf of the company.\nThe document produced had no attestation clause purporting that it was \"signed, sealed and delivered,\" in the presence of any one, but in lieu thereof there was printed near the place where such clause is usually inserted, and opposite the names of the persons signing as president and general manager; and on one side also of the seal attached to the instrument the following clause: \"This policy is not valid unless countersigned \"by \u2014\u2014\u2014, agent at \u2014\u2014\u2014;\" and underneath, the place for countersigning, is indicated thus: \"Countersigned \"this\u2014\u2014\u2014day of\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\"\u2014\u2014\u2014, agent.\"\nNow, this printed matter appears to me to be as much authenticated by the seal and signatures attached to the instrument as is any other matter in the instrument, and although the blanks are not filled up so as to define precisely the person and place by whom and where the countersigning was to be done, it amounts to a declaration made by the parties, whose names are to the instrument, that before the policy could become a valid instrument, binding upon the defendants, it should be countersigned by some person filling the character of agent of the defendants at some place; and as the head office of the company was situate at Toronto, where the seal of the company is kept, and as the application of O'Donnell for the insurance was made to an agent of the company at Halifax, whose business would be to receive the premium, O'Donnell could have had no difficulty in understanding that the person to countersign the instrument, in order to give it validity, was that agent through whom he had applied for the insurance.\nThe only evidence which the plaintiff offered to disprove the defendant's plea, that it was not their deed, was the mere production of the policy with the above declaration printed alongside the signatures and seal which appeared attached, and evidence that the instrument in this condition was found among the papers of the deceased, M. A. O'Donnell, in whose possession it had been seen during his life.\nThe defendants, however, produced as a witness a Mr. Allison, their agent at Halifax, who had applied for the policy for O'Donnell, and he proved that the policy had been sent to him from the head office at Toronto, and that he held it in his hands as an escrow, not to be issued or delivered to O'Donnell until the premium should be paid, and he, Allison, should countersign the policy; and he swore that the premium never was paid, and that for this reason he never did countersign the policy; that he never issued it as a policy binding upon the defendants, but had let the deceased have it to read the conditions, and that as a fact the policy was never delivered to him as a contract. The only evidence relied upon to defeat this positive evidence, is the inference relied upon as proper to be drawn from the fact of O'Donnell having had the policy in his possession in his lifetime and until his death. This evidence is, in my opinion, quite insufficient for the purpose. I think it is sufficiently clear, upon the evidence, that the instrument was delivered as an escrow to Allison not to be delivered as a binding policy to O'Donnell until the premium should be paid, and until Allison should, in testimony thereof, countersign the policy; and that as these conditions have not been proved to have been fulfilled, there is no sufficient evidence to divest the instrument of its original character as an escrow, and to hold the defendants bound by the instrument as one completely executed and delivered as their deed.\nI think, therefore, the appeal should be allowed, and a new trial ordered, with costs. The exigencies of the defendant's business as a company, whose head office is at Toronto, make it not only reasonable, but necessary, that they should protect themselves in this manner when they send policies to be issued at a remote agency; and the necessity for pursuing this course, and the object of the notice printed, as this is, alongside the signature, must be well understood by all persons effecting policies through agents.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: C. H. Tupper.\nSolicitor for respondent: John L. D. Thompson.\n[1] 2 ed. pp. 252 & 637.\n[2] 32 N. Y. R. 619.\n[3] 2 vol. 35.\n[4] 13 Q. B. 196.\n[5] Moore 679.\n[6] L. R. 2 H. L. 314.\n",
