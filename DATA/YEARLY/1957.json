L. Dubin, Q.C., for the appellant, applicant.\nW. M. Martin, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nFauteux J.:\u2014The appellant applied for leave to appeal from two judgments of the Court of Appeal for Ontario. The first, pronounced on October 17, 1956 2, affirmed his conviction on an indictment charging him with possession and sale of a drug, contrary to the provisions of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act. The second, delivered on the 24th of the same month, affirmed his conviction as being an habitual criminal. The grounds, upon which leave to appeal is applied for, admittedly raise important questions of law involving conflicting judgments of other Courts of Appeal.\nThe application, however, is made under s. 597(1) (b) of the Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, as re-enacted in 1956 by 4-5 Eliz. II, c. 48, s. 19. The section provides for a right of appeal on any question of law, if leave is granted by the Supreme Court of Canada within 21 days after the judgment appealed from is pronounced or within such extended time as the Supreme Court of Canada or a judge thereof may, for special reasons, allow. Counsel for the applicant was therefore invited to indicate what special reasons, if any, could afford a justification for this Court to extend, for a period of nearly three months, the period of time within which the application for leave was made in this case. It was intimated to us that immediately subsequent to the pronouncement of these judgments, counsel for the appellant informed counsel for the respondent of an intention to appeal and suggested that the application for leave should be made at a time convenient to both. To this suggestion, counsel for the Crown assented in view of the importance of the questions and of the sentence of preventive detention.\nIt must be noted that the exercise of the discretionary power given to this Court or to a member thereof to extend the period of time within which an application for leave may be made under s. 597(1)(b), is conditional upon the existence of special reasons. Mere agreements which, for their own convenience, counsel may care to make, do not come within the meaning of special reasons and are foreign to the diligence required in the administration of justice and which the expression \u201cspecial reasons\u201d is particularly meant to foster. It may be, as. it was intimated by both counsel, that there was a misapprehension as to the practice before this Court. However, with the concurrence of the Chief Justice, it is now emphasized that this should\u201d no longer be the case in the future. Under all the circumstances, we feel that to do justice to this case, leave should not be refused on this point which was raised by the Court.\nLeave to appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming, on October 17, 1956, the conviction of the appellant, is granted on the grounds numbered 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the application.\nWith respect to the judgment of October 24, 1956, affirming the conviction of being an habitual criminal, leave to appeal is granted conditionally upon the appeal from the judgment of October 17, 1956, being successful.\nLeave to appeal granted.\nSolicitors for the appellant, applicant: Kimber & Dubin, Toronto.\n1 [1956] O.W.N. 798, 116 C.C.C. 231, 25 \u00c7.R. 53.\n2 [1956] O.W.N. 798, 116 C.C.C. 231, 25 \u00c7.R. 53.\n",

Appeal dismissed.\nT. G. Norris, Q.C., for the municipalities, appellants.\nHon. J. W. deB. Farris, Q.C., A. Bruce Robertson, Q.C., and R. Dodd, for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014This is an appeal by leave of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia from its decision [2], dismissing an appeal from a certificate of public convenience and necessity, dated December 13, 1955, granted by the Public Utilities Commission of that Province to the respondent, British Columbia Electric Company Limited. Although the application by the respondent to the Commission states that it was made under s. 12 of the Public Utilities Act, which is R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 277, it is quite apparent from what will be stated shortly and from a perusal of the two clauses of that section that that part of the application with which we are concerned is really under s. 12 (b).\nThe respondent, among other things, carries on the business of manufacturing gas and has entered into a contract for the purchase of natural gas, with a view to its distribution. The territory in respect of which the respondent applied was divided into the Greater Vancouver area and the Fraser Valley area. A certificate of public convenience and necessity was granted as to the former on July 29, 1955; but decision was reserved with respect to the Fraser Valley area. Ultimately a certificate was also granted as to that area, subject to certain conditions, and the real dispute is as to the power of the Commission to grant this certificate without the consent of the appellant municipalities.\nThe only provisions of the Public Utilities Act requiring consideration are s. 12 and the first sentence in s. 14, which read as follows:\n12. Except as hereinafter provided: \u2014\n(a) No privilege, concession, or franchise hereafter granted to any public utility by any municipality or other public authority shall be valid unless approved by the Commission. The Commission shall not give its approval unless, after a hearing, it determines that the privilege, concession, or franchise proposed to be granted is necessary for the public convenience and properly conserves the public interest. The Commission, in giving its approval, shall grant a certificate of public convenience and necessity, and may impose such conditions as to the duration and termination of the privilege, concession, or franchise, or as to construction, equipment, maintenance, rates, or service, as the public convenience and interest reasonably require:\n(b) No public utility shall hereafter begin the construction or operation of any public utility plant or system, or of any extension thereof, without first obtaining from the Commission a certificate that public convenience and necessity require or will require such construction or operation (in this Act referred to as a \"certificate of public convenience and necessity\").\n14. Every applicant for a certificate of public convenience and necessity under either of the clauses of section 12 shall, in case the applicant is a corporate body, file with the Commission a certified copy of its memorandum and articles of association, charter, or other document of incorporation, and in all cases shall file with the Commission such evidence as shall be required by the Commission to show that the applicant has received the consent, franchise, licence, permit, vote, or other authority of the proper municipality or other public authority, if required\u2026.\nIt is clear that the relevant part of respondent's application was not made under clause (a) of s. 12, because it had no \"privilege, concession, or franchise\" from the appellant municipalities. That part of the application being under s. 12 (b), and the opening words of s. 14 referring to an application for a certificate under either of the clauses of s. 12, it is too clear for argument that the latter part of s. 14 refers only to a \"consent, franchise, licence, permit, vote, or other authority\" when one of them is required on an application under s. 12 (a). The matter does not lend itself to extended discussion and it is unnecessary to deal with the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia in The Veterans' Sightseeing and Transportation Company Limited v. Public Utilities Commission and British Columbia Electric Railway Company, Limited [3]. Notwithstanding the various provisions of the Municipal Act to which counsel for the appellants drew our attention, the matter is left to the Commission to take into account the interests of all parties concerned, public and private, and this is corroborated by the provisions of the Gas Utilities Act, 1954 (B.C.), c. 13.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Rand, Locke and Nolan JJ. was delivered by\nLOCKE J.:\u2014The respondent company is a public utility within the meaning of that term, as defined in s. 2 of the Public Utilities Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 277, and by a letter dated May 15, 1955, applied to the Public Utilities Commission, constituted under that statute, for a certificate of public convenience and necessity for a project for the supply of natural gas for a portion of the lower mainland area of British Columbia, which included the District of Surrey and the Township of Chilliwhack and the City of Chilliwack.\nThe application to the Commission was opposed by the present appellants. Lengthy public hearings were held, at which a similar application by a competing gas distributing company was also considered. The respondent has for many years sold manufactured gas through various subsidiary companies in a number of municipalities in the greater Vancouver area. The project proposed was for the supply in additional areas in the lower mainland of the Province of natural gas brought by a pipeline company from the Peace River areas of Alberta and British Columbia.\nBy s. 2 of the Gas Utilities Act, 1954 (B.C.), c. 13, a \"gas utility\" is defined as a corporation which owns or operates in the Province facilities for, inter alia, the production, transmission or delivery of gas, a word defined to include natural gas, and the respondent company falls within this definition. By s. 3 of that Act, every such company to which a certificate of public convenience and necessity is thereafter granted under the Public Utilities Act shall in the municipality or area mentioned in such certificate be empowered to carry on, subject to the provisions of that Act, its business as a gas utility, including power to transmit, distribute and sell gas and to place its pipes and other equipment and appliances under any public street or lane in a municipality upon such conditions as the gas utility and the municipality may agree upon. If the parties fail to agree upon these terms, the Public Utilities Commission is empowered by s. 40 of the Public Utilities Act to settle them.\nSection 12 of the Public Utilities Act provides for applications to the Commission for a certificate of public convenience and necessity in cases where a franchise has been granted to a public utility by any municipality or other public authority after the coming into force of the Act, and also in cases where no such franchise has been granted, these being dealt with in clauses (a) and (b) respectively. The respondent had not applied to any of the appellant municipalities for any concession or franchise to supply gas within their boundaries and, while the written application to the Commission merely states that it was being made under the provisions of s. 12 of the Act, it is clear that the application was made under clause (b) of that section.\nAccording to s. 14 of the statute, upon an application for such a certificate under either of the clauses of s. 12, the applicant, if a corporate body, shall file a certified copy of its memorandum and articles of association or other docu- ment of incorporation, and such evidence as shall be required by the Commission to show that the applicant has received the consent or permission of the municipality or other public authority if required.\nIt was the contention of the appellants that their prior consent or permission was a condition precedent to the right of the Commission to grant the certificate applied for and they contend that this construction of the statute is supported by the language of the section. For the company, it is said that the words \"if required\" should properly be construed as meaning \"if required by law\" and that, by virtue of the provisions of the Public Utilities Act and the Gas Utilities Act, no such consent is required.\nThe contention that the utility cannot carry on its activities in a municipality without its consent is based upon certain provisions of the Municipal Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 232, which, standing alone, would indicate that such consent was required. By s. 58 of that statute a municipality is authorized to pass by-laws regulating the operations of a wide variety of businesses and other activities and prohibiting the carrying on of certain of them, other than by leave and licence of the municipality. Thus, by cl. 55 of that section, by-laws may be passed\nFor regulating the construction, installation, repair and maintenance of pipes, valves, fittings, appliances, equipment, and works for the supply and use of gas:\nand by cl. 109 for licensing and regulating any gas company and authorizing the use of the public highways by such company. Section 328 of the Act, by cl. 29, fixes the payment to be made by gas companies semi-annually for the licences held by them, failure to pay which renders the licence liable to cancellation. The provisions for the licensing and regulation of gas companies by municipalities in British Columbia have been for many years part of the municipal law of the Province: see Municipal Clauses Act, R.S.B.C. 1897, c. 144, s. 50(36); Municipal Act, R.S.B.C. 1911, c. 170, s. 53(92); Municipal Act, R.S.B.C. 1936, c. 199, s. 59(99).\nThe Public Utilities Act was first enacted in 1938 and was designed to place the operations of persons engaged in the production, generation, transmission or sale of gas and electricity and a wide range of other undertakings designed to render service to the public, under the control of a commission constituted by the Act. The statute imposes upon every public utility the obligation, inter alia, to supply to all persons who apply therefor and are reasonably entitled thereto suitable service without discrimination or delay, to maintain its property and equipment in proper condition to enable it to furnish adequate, safe and reasonable service, to obey all orders of the Commission made pursuant to the Act in respect of its business or service and to refrain from demanding unjust or discriminatory rates for its service. By Part V of the Act the Commission is given general supervision of all public utilities falling within the definition in the Act and is empowered, inter alia, to make such regulations or orders regarding equipment, appliances, safety devices and extensions of works as are necessary for the safety, convenience or service of the public. Further wide powers of supervision and control are given over the rates which may be imposed, the manner in which money can be raised by the sale to the public of shares or bonds and over the mortgage, sale or licensing of the utilities' property. No utility to which a certificate of public convenience and necessity has been issued and which has commenced operations may cease operating without the Commission's consent.\nThe whole tenor of the Act shows clearly that the safeguarding of the interests of the public, both as to the identity of those who should be permitted to operate public utilities and as to the manner in which they should operate, was a duty vested in the Commission. It is quite impossible, in my opinion, to hold that these powers and those which might be asserted by a municipality to regulate the operations of such companies under s. 58, cls. 55 and 109, were intended to co-exist.\nIt is unnecessary for the determination of this matter to decide whether, apart from the provisions of the Gas Utilities Act, the appellant municipalities might insist that a licence under the licensing provisions of the Municipal Act was a condition precedent to the granting of a certificate under s. 12 (b) of the Public Utilities Act. The language of s. 3 of the Gas Utilities Act is clear and free from ambiguity. The words \"if required\" at the conclusion of the first sentence of s. 14 must be construed, in my opinion, as meaning \"if required by law\". The municipality, of necessity, being a statutory body could only require its licence or consent if authorized by statute to do so and, from the date the Gas Utilities Act became the law, no such licence or consent was necessary. The effect of s. 3 of that statute was, in my opinion, to impliedly repeal the licensing provisions of the Municipal Act relating to such utilities.\nIn discharging its important duties under the Public Utilities Act the Commission is required to consider the interests not merely of single municipalities but of districts as a whole and areas including many municipalities. The duty of safeguarding the interests of the municipalities and their inhabitants, to the extent that they may be affected by the operations of public utilities, has by these statutes been transferred from municipal councils to the Public Utilities Commission, subject, inter alia, to the right of municipalities of insuring a supply of gas by municipal enterprise of the nature referred to in the reasons delivered by the Chairman of the Public Utilities Commission. This right the Commission was careful to preserve.\nReliance was placed by the appellants on certain passages from the judgments delivered by the Court of Appeal in The Veterans' Sightseeing and Transportation Company Limited v. Public Utilities Commission and British Columbia Electric Railway Company, Limited [4], but I think what was there said does not affect the present matter. The provisions of the Gas Utilities Act of 1954 are decisive, in my opinion.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014At the conclusion of the argument I had doubts as to whether the provisions of the Gas Utilities Act and the Public Utilities Act manifest a clear intention on the part of the Legislature to confer power on the Public Utilities Commission to authorize the respondent to carry on operations in the appellant municipalities without their consents, which consents would otherwise have been necessary under sections of the Municipal Act which have not been expressly amended or repealed. I cannot say that these doubts have been entirely dispelled but as the other members of this Court and the unanimous Court of Appeal are satisfied that the relevant statutory provisions should be so construed, I concur in the dismissal of the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the Corporation of the District of Surrey, appellant: Norris & Cumming, Vancouver.\nSolicitor for the Corporation of the Township of Chilliwhack and the Corporation of the City of Chilliwack, appellants: F.

In 1952, the board appointed G and I to the offices of president and secretary, respectively, without specifying their terms of office. In 1953 the same directors were re-elected, but, by reason of a deadlock, failed to appoint new officers, whereupon G and I claimed that so long as no new officers were appointed, they continued to hold their offices by virtue of the doctrine of \"holding over\". The plaintiffs successfully petitioned the Superior Court for a writ of quo warranto on the ground that G and I were illegally occupying and exercising their offices. This judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld (Rand J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed; G and I had ceased to be the choice of the majority of the directors and quo warranto was the appropriate procedure to remove them from their offices.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau and Fauteux JJ.: By virtue of the Quebec Companies Act, the directors, in the absence of other provisions in the letters patent or by-laws, are elected for a year, and, once elected, they become immediately and exclusively vested with the duty and right to elect among themselves a president. The period for which such an officer is thus elected cannot extend beyond the expiration of the maximum lawful term of the directors, for then the right to elect new officers will become vested in the directors freshly elected or re-elected. Thus the tenure of the office of president will expire contemporaneously with that of the directors, at which time it may be extended or renewed, if this be the manifest will of the new board of directors. In the present case, not only was the will of the majority not indicated either expressly or tacitly, but the deadlock left no possible doubt that G and I had ceased to be the choice of the majority.\nThe \"holding over\" doctrine had no application and, in any event, would appear to be inconsistent with the spirit of the Act, particularly as it would sanction the perpetuation in office of officers who had failed to obtain the confidence of the majority. Furthermore, a lawful title to the offices could not be derived from the provisions of the Act contemplating the necessity of such offices being held continuously by someone, nor could the Courts, on the basis of practical consideration, sanction the assertion of an unfounded legal position.\nPer Abbott J.: The board of directors and the officers of a company incorporated under the Quebec Companies Act are respectively the agents or mandataries of the company, and as such their mandate expires when a new board of directors is elected. But it is not accurate to say that the officers are substituted mandataries within the meaning of art 1711 of the Civil Code. Where newly-elected directors fail to meet immediately and appoint new officers, there is no doubt, in most cases, of the implied authority from the new board to the existing officers, to continue to act as such, pending the first meeting of the directors. When, however, as in the present case, the directors did meet, and by reason of a deadlock failed to appoint officers, it became obvious that the previous incumbents no longer possessed the confidence of the newly-elected board. In that case, equal shareholding does not justify one group taking advantage of the status quo in order to maintain its representatives in office indefinitely\nPer Rand J., dissenting: The statute implies a continuity in the offices of president, vice-president and secretary, subject only to a change of personnel elected or appointed to succeed existing incumbents. The practical necessities of maintaining the activities of the company require that continuity, and from the beginning of limited liability companies in analogy to public and semi-public offices that principle has been recognized. The holding over rule is contemplated by the companies legislation in its latest form, is based on the convenience of business and is supported also by the formal structure of the company, of which the board and the offices are part.\nAssuming that the offices of president and secretary are held at the will of the directors, they obviously require a. continuance in office of an incumbent until his incumbency is terminated by action of the board. There was no such action here. The statute does not require an annual election of officers; their tenure is a question of fact arising from their appointment, which being impliedly from time to time, requires simply that a continuing presidency be provided. Furthermore the president and secretary are independent and direct officers of the company and cannot be taken to be substitutes of the board.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec 1, affirming a judgment maintaining a petition for a writ of quo warranto against two officers of a company. Appeal dismissed.\nP. F. Vineberg, for the defendants, appellants.\nA. J. Campbell, Q.C., for the plaintiffs, respondents.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by\nFauteux J.:\u2014This is an appeal, by leave, from a unanimous decision of the Court of Queen's Bench for the Province of Quebec (1) affirming a judgment of the Superior Court declaring that the appellants, Ghimpelman and Idelson, illegally occupy and exercise the offices of president and secretary respectively of Rockhill Apartments Limited and dispossessing them of the same.\nThe dispute bears on the tenure of such offices and there is no controversy as to the facts which may be outlined as follows:\nRockhill Apartments Limited is a company incorporated in 1949 by letters patent issued under the Quebec Companies Act, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 276. The assets of the corporation consist mostly in an apartment house situated in Montreal and its shares are held equally by two groups, i.e., the Ghimpelman and Halpern families, which are related and here respectively represented by appellants and respondents.\nUp to July 1949, the board managing the affairs of the company was composed of five directors, then increased to six, of whom four constituted a quorum. There is no casting vote in the event of a tie, a contingency which materialized when the six directors, elected at the annual general meeting held on June 23, 1953, then and at a subsequent meeting called and held for that purpose on the 30th of the same month, divided equally on any attempt aiming at the appointment of the president and secretary of the company. These attempts were exclusively those of the Halpern group; the Ghimpelman faction, which up to that year had held these offices, persistently refused to put any motion in this respect, on the then alleged ground that it would meet with a similar fate, a fact which would have supplied further evidence that they no longer were the choice of the majority. Since that time and because of a strict adherence to this division, the deadlock resulting therefrom has been perpetuated.\nIt is common ground that, under the provisions governing this company, (i) \"the election of directors shall take place yearly, and all the directors then in office shall retire, but, if otherwise qualified, they shall be eligible for re-election\": s. 86 (1); and (ii) \"the directors shall elect among themselves a president and if they see fit a chairman of meetings and one or more vice-presidents of the company, and may also appoint all other officers thereof\": s. 86 (4).\nThe provisions of s. 86 (1) were complied with, but those of s. 86 (4) were not and, as intimated at the hearing, by counsel for all parties, they will not be if the legal position asserted by the appellants receives the sanction of the Court.\nI do not find it necessary to deal with the jural nature of the function of directors nor of their relationship with the corporation, its shareholders or officers, for the question here arising is not related to directors but is whether the appellants, in view of all the circumstances of this case and under the law applicable thereto, are entitled to retain their respective offices, as they claim.\nWith respect to the office of president. In providing that, in the absence of other provisions in such behalf in the letters patent or by-laws,\u2014which is the case here\u2014the directors are elected for a year and must elect among themselves a president, the Quebec Legislature made clear that once the directors are elected, at the annual general meeting of the shareholders, they become immediately and exclusively vested with the duty and right to elect among themselves the president. And it is also manifest that the maximum period of time for which the president is thus elected cannot extend beyond the expiration of the maximum lawful term of the directors, for then the right to elect the president will become vested in the directors freshly elected or re-elected by the shareholders then qualified to do so. Evidently the law does not contemplate that the former and the latter group of directors be, at any one time, both in office and possessed with a duty and right of a nature designed for one group. The circumstance that all the former directors are re-elected is foreign to and cannot affect the interpretation of these sections which must operate whether such circumstance is or is not present. There cannot be two interpretations. Thus the maximum term of the tenure of the office of president expires contemporaneously with that of the directors, at which time it may be extended or renewed, if this be the manifested will of the majority of the directors freshly elected or re-elected. In the present instance this will of the majority was neither expressly nor tacitly indicated; on the contrary the cleavage appearing immediately after the election of the directors and persisting ever since leaves no possible doubt that Ghimpelman has ceased to be the choice of the majority.\nThe \"holding-over\" doctrine, allowing the continuance in possession of an office and of the exercise of its functions after the end of its lawful term, was invoked. To the extent that this doctrine has a recognition under the law it is dealt with exhaustively in s. 82 reading:\nIf, at any time, an election of directors is not made or does not take effect at the proper time, the company shall not be held to be thereby dissolved, but such election may take place at any subsequent general meeting of the company called for that purpose, and the retiring directors shall continue in office until their successors are elected.\nThe circumstance conditioning the operation of the section, i.e., the failure to hold the election of directors at the proper time, is not present here; and furthermore the office covered by the provision is that of director and not that of president. The letters patent or by-laws of the company make no reference to the doctrine. Finally it would appear to be highly inconsistent with the spirit of the Act and particularly with the paramount majority rule principle attending the appointment of persons entrusted, in any capacity, with the management of the affairs of a company and attending also such management, to sanction the perpetuation in office of officers who have failed to obtain the confidence of the majority.\nWith respect to the office of the secretary. Ever since the existence of this company, the secretary was elected each year. The terms of the resolution adopted for that purpose always indicated that such officer was elected \"for the ensuing year\", except for the election held in 1952, when these words do not appear. Whether or not this was the result of an oversight, counsel for the parties could not say. But the failure to mention a term is not indicative of an intention to depart from the practice invariably followed, in previous years, of electing the secretary for the ensuing year only. Indeed it is clear\u2014and significant\u2014from the minutes of the meeting of June 30, 1953 that the attitude of the Ghimpelman group to the election of a secretary was identical to that they had taken to the election of the president. This and what was said at the hearing before us evidences that Idelson, as secretary, like Ghimpelman, as president, was not the choice of the majority.\nThere remain to be considered two points advanced in support of appellants' position. Their removal from office, it is said, would be inconsistent with these provisions of the Act, which, for the proper operation of the business of the company, contemplate the necessity of such offices being held continuously by someone. In this argument, I find no assistance; for from such necessity a lawful title to these offices, which is here lacking, cannot be derived. The other point is that the relief sought for and obtained by respondents will not solve the deadlock and the situation resulting therefrom. This remains to be seen; and in any event the function of the Court is not to suggest or to bring solutions in like matters but to determine the con- troversy raised by the pleadings. It cannot, on the basis of practical considerations, sanction the assertion of an unfounded legal position.\nIt may finally be noted that no precedent in point has been quoted in the matter and that there are no provisions, either in the Quebec Companies Act or in the Winding up Act, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 278, dealing with a like situation. This, however, does not imply the absence of any useful remedy.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nRand J. (dissenting):\u2014This is a proceeding by way of quo warranto to the appellants who claim to be the president and secretary respectively of Rockhill Apartments Limited, a company incorporated under the Quebec Companies Act, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 276.\nThe facts giving rise to the controversy are these. The shares are held equally by two groups represented by the appellants and the respondents. In 1952 the board of directors, being all such six persons, elected Ghimpelman president and Idelson secretary without reference to duration. On June 23, 1953 the annual meeting was held at which all six were re-elected. Later on the same day the board met, a motion to place the affairs of the company under two managers was defeated, and the meeting ended. At a further meeting on June 30 a motion to elect the respondent Baruch Halpern president was on an equal division defeated. No election was proposed for any other office. The meeting apparently adjourned to July 15, but nothing further is shown to have taken place and on October 7, 1953 the action was instituted.\nOn May 31, 1954 the Superior Court held that the term of office of the president and the secretary elected in 1952 had expired on June 30, 1953, and that both offices thereupon became vacant. On appeal the judgment was affirmed 2.\nIt does not appear what, if any, are the duties and authority of the president in respect of the management of the affairs of the company or what powers, if any, Ghimpelman and Idelson were in fact exercising. No suggestion is made of a likely change of attitude on the part of any member of either group, and the protagonists of the two groups, president Ghimpelman and vice-president Baruch Halpern receive the same remuneration; nor was any made of any unauthorized acts on the part of either officer. The application of art. 987 of the Code of Civil Procedure to a private corporation was not challenged; nor was it disputed that the discretion attaching to the issue of a prerogative writ extends to such a case. There is no claim by any respondent to either office nor is the company itself complaining. The judgment seems to assume that in the state in which the company finds itself its interests and those of the shareholders will best be served by the declaration that it is also destitute of officers.\nThat in such circumstances of frustration the Courts are powerless to afford a remedy is not put forward nor could it be sustained. In view of the substance of the dispute a question might have been raised on the appropriateness of the remedy sought in view of its futility, but it was not, and the issue is that of the technical title to the offices regardless of all other considerations.\nThe Companies Act has followed the practice of legislation in the United States in creating the office of president; in England it seems scarcely to be known. This is pointed out in Mitchell, Canadian Commercial Corporations, at p. 1114. By s. 86, subs. (4) of the Act, the directors\nshall elect from among themselves a president and, if they see fit, a chairman of meetings and one or more vice-presidents of the company, and may also appoint all other officers thereof.\nPrior to 1925 this was in the words of one of the earliest enactments providing joint stock companies with general clauses, c. 31 (Can.), 1860, \"The directors shall from time to time elect\", etc. When the phrase \"from time to time\" was dropped in the revision of 1925 it was omitted also from s. 164, subs. (3) dealing with by-laws. These omissions were obviously intended as mere improvements in text and the present language is to be construed in the same sense as before.\nThe offices of president, vice-president and secretary are offices of the company recognized and required by the statute. That they are contemplated to be filled continuously is evidenced by the following considerations: that by s. 49 which provides that every shareholder is entitled to a certificate under the common seal of the company and by a by-law which requires the president to sign all certificates, an act which he may be called upon to do at any time; by s. 68 providing for the entry in the register of transfers to be made by the secretary, transfers that are not valid except as between the parties until that entry is made; that transmissions effected by law will call for similar action by both officers; that the books of the company by s. 101 are in the custody and under the control of the secretary; that s. 94 requires that at least 10 days' notice of meetings shall be given by registered letter to each shareholder, to be done primarily by the secretary, a duty placed upon him specifically by s. 96 in the case of the requisitioning of a meeting; by s. 97, that in the absence of a chairman of meetings\u2014and there was none here\u2014the president presides de jure; that a register of mortgages is required by s. 102 and this, together with the other books mentioned in s. 101, are, by s. 103, required to be kept open during the reasonable business hours of every day except Sundays and holidays; by s. 105 declaring that \"every company which neglects to keep such book or books as aforesaid\" shall be liable to a penalty; that s. 107 provides for an inspection of the affairs of the company by the Provincial Secretary and at that time it is the duty of \"all officers and agents of the company to produce\" all books and documents called for; that s. 120 provides a general penalty against any officer of a company who commits any act contrary to the provisions of Part I of the Act \"or fails or neglects to comply with such provisions\".\nHere is the implication of a continuity in incumbency subject only to a change of personnel elected or appointed to succeed existing incumbents. The practical necessities of maintaining the activities of the company require that continuity and from the beginning of limited liability companies in analogy to public and semi-public offices that principle has been recognized.\nLegislation in Canada dealing with such companies found its origin in England and the United States. The earliest mode was by way of incorporation by special Act. Then in 1844 in England, the Companies Clauses Act was passed which provided general clauses for every corporation thereafter so incorporated. A similar enactment in the province of Canada in 1860 has already been mentioned. The enactment in England of the Companies Act of 1862 followed. Since then our legislation, including that of Quebec, has kept the same general pattern. We are, therefore, dealing with corporate conceptions as they are embodied in modern legislation, and no special principle or feature of the civil law is involved.\nIt is of some interest that the original enactment of the Railway Act, 14-15 Victoria (Can.), c. 51, s. 16(6), provided that:\nThe Directors shall, at their first or at some other meeting, after the day \"appointed for the annual general meeting, elect one of their number to be the President of the Company, who shall always, when present, be the Chairman of and preside at all meetings of the Directors, and shall hold his office until he shall cease to be a Director, or until another President shall be elected in his stead; and they may in like manner elect a Vice-President, who shall act as Chairman in the absence of the President.\nThis appears in almost identical language in R.S.Q. 1941, c. 291, s. 21(3). A review of a number of statutes passed between 1850 and 1860 discloses similar provisions though not containing the whole of the specific reference to the presidency: for example, 13-14 Victoria, c. 28, providing for the incorporation of companies for manufacturing, mining, mechanical or chemical purposes, by s. 7 enacted that each company should have a chairman or president to be elected by the trustees (which the directors were there called) from among themselves and also such subordinate officers as the company by its by-laws might require; the same appears in c. 65, s, 18, of the Consolidated Statutes (1859) dealing with companies for supplying gas and water to municipalities; c. 67 of the same consolidation, respecting electric telegraph companies, by s. 7 provided a more general clause authorizing the company to appoint such directors, officers and agents \"and make such prudential rules, regulations and by-laws\" as might be necessary to the transaction of its business; and s. 25 of c. 68 respecting companies engaged in the transmission of timber down rivers:\nThe directors may elect one of their number to be the president and may nominate and appoint such officers and servants as they may deem necessary \u2026. The language of c. 31 (Can.), 1860, has already been mentioned. These provisions show obviously that although dealing with the same matter they were drafted independently and without precise consistency of form, though of substance, with one another, but that of the Railway Act, preserved to this day, evidences beyond any doubt the convenience and practicability of the rule of continuity.\nSimilar provisions in identical language with that with which we are concerned, except in the first two the added phrase \"from time to time\", are contained in the company legislation of the Dominion and at least two of the Provinces: R.S.C. 1952, c. 53, s. 90(d); R.S.O. 1950, c. 59, s. 89(c); R.S.N.B. 1952, c. 33, s. 93(d).\nThe embarrassment of the company in the absence of a president is indicated here by the fact that in a deadlock it could be of the utmost importance that the company be represented by counsel at such a meeting as that held on June 30; but it does not seem that an engagement of counsel could have been made except by the president de jure: Standard Trust Company v. South Shore Railway Company 3.\nIn the American work of Thompson on Corporations, 3rd ed. 1927, vol. 2, p. 463, para. 1059, the holding over by a duly elected officer is dealt with and the authorities there cited make it clear that when the appointment of an officer is not expressly limited to a date or period of time or event, and even where the time is in general terms, the tenure of an incumbent continues until his successor is appointed. As representative instances of this the following cases are cited: McCall v. Byram Manufacturing Company 4, holding that the secretary of a company continues in office until his successor is appointed when the appointment is \"for the year ensuing, commencing on the first instant\", in which it is said, on the authority of Foot v. Prowse 5:\nNow it is settled, even with respect to officers who are required by law to be elected annually, that they may hold over after the year until others are chosen and sworn.\nThe Congregational Society of Bethany v. Sperry 6, where the language of the previous decision is approved and declared to be equally applicable to society officers; Sparks et al. v. Farmers' Bank 7, an action against a surety for a cashier, an office to which election was to be made annually at the meeting of the general board of directors in the month of January in each year, the appointee to qualify by furnishing a bond, holding that, assuming it to be an \"annual\" office, its tenure did not ipso facto expire at the end of the year or at the annual meeting of the board or even upon an election, but only by election plus qualification, and at p. 296 stating the principle to be\n\u2026 that if the term of an officer, civil or corporate, created by statute or charter, is not limited to expire at a fixed time, or upon a specified event, but there is simply a direction for the annual election of the officer, his original term continues, though after the year, until a successor is duly elected and qualified.\nThe same and many other authorities are cited in support of the same rule in the article on Corporations in 14a Corpus Juris at pp. 72-73.\nThese decisions indicate the background and origin of the rule which so far from being nullified is seen to be contemplated by the legislation in its latest form. Based upon the convenience of business, the rule is supported also by the formal structure of the company. The managing agency of a corporation, the board of directors, a body subject to such control by the shareholders as the law of the company prescribes, and the offices, apart from the incumbents of either, are part of that structure; and being such the enactments presuppose them at all times, except in unavoidable contingencies, to be occupied.\nIn the Court of Queen's Bench 8, Hyde J. seems to take the view that the office of president is held at the will of the directors. Assuming that to be the case, it obviously requires a continuance in office of an incumbent until his incumbency is terminated by action of the board. Nothing of that sort took place here; no board action has affected the last legal appointment to the presidency and the incumbent has not suffered any disqualification. McDougall J. does not come to a definite conclusion on the date when the tenure ceased; it was either upon the election of the new board on June 23, 1953 or at least on June 30 when the meeting of the board proved abortive. That it did not take place on the election of the new board follows from the fact that the president presides de jure over the annual meeting. How far, then, does the office continue beyond that? What is there in the statute that necessarily fixes any point of time before the election of a new president or remove the existing incumbent? I see nothing. Section 86, subs. (4) does not require an annual election of officers; the word \"directors\" does not describe each newly elected personnel of the board; the express reference in subs. (1) to the annual election of directors excludes that expression from subs. (4). This is implied also in the language of the latter to \"all other officers\"; their tenure admittedly is a question of fact arising from the circumstances of their appointment. The appointment, impliedly from time to time, of a president requires simply that a continuing presidency be provided; it bears no implication of an annual election.\nMcDougall J. refers to art. 1711 of the Civil Code which deals with a substitute of a mandatary. I am quite unable to see how the president can be taken to be a substitute of the board. When appointed pursuant to the statute, he becomes an independent and direct officer of the company. The board is not answerable for his actions nor does he execute the mandate of the board: he carries out such authority and duty as are his by virtue of the statute, the by-laws and the executive action of the company, acting by the board: he is in office as much by the statute as the board itself.\nWhat is said of the president applies a fortiori to the secretary: it would be with astonishment that dominion companies should learn that their secretary, appointed for an indefinite tenure, ceases to hold his office upon every periodic election of a board of directors.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal, set aside the judgments and dismiss the action with costs throughout.\nAbbott J.:\u2014I am in substantial agreement with the reasons of McDougall and Hyde JJ. in the Court of Queen's Bench 9 and there is little that I can usefully add to them.\nI share the view which they have expressed that the board of directors and the officers of a company incorporated under the Quebec Companies Act, are respectively the agents or mandataries of the company. As such they are subject to the provisions of the Title \"Of Mandate\" in the Civil Code, except in so far as these are rendered inapplicable by any general or special law relating to corporations as such: see Mignault, \"Droit Civil Canadien\", vol. 2 at p. 348. In my opinion, however, it is not accurate to say that persons elected or appointed as officers of such a company, are substituted mandataries within the meaning of art. 1711 of the Civil Code. Such officers are, of course, the agents or mandataries of the company, but under the terms of the governing statute, the directors, and the directors alone, are empowered to appoint them. The directors themselves are also agents or mandataries of the company, but in their case the statute prescribes that (except to fill a vacancy for an unexpired term) they shall be named by the shareholders. In the present case, however, this distinction as to the method of election or appointment would appear to have no practical significance.\nWhere newly-elected directors of a limited liability stock company fail to meet immediately and appoint new officers, there is no doubt, in most cases, implied authority from the new board of directors to the existing officers, to continue to act as such, pending the first meeting of directors. When, however, as in the present case, the directors did meet, and by reason of a deadlock failed to appoint officers, it became obvious that the previous incumbents no longer possessed the confidence of the newly-elected board.\nEqual shareholding in a limited liability company invites difficulty, of course, under certain circumstances. It does not, however, justify one group taking advantage of the status quo in order to maintain its representatives in office indefinitely.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, Rand J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the defendants, appellants: Phillips, Bloomfield, Vineberg & Goodman, Montreal.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, respondents: Brais, Campbell, Mercier & Leduc, Montreal.\n1 [1956] Que.

This right of way ran from the west boundary of the plan to a private road leading from the river north to highway no. 2. Lots 1 to 6 were to the west of this private road and lot 7 was to the east. The plan bore the notation \u201clands registered outlined Red\u201d and there was a red outline surrounding lots 1 to 6 and lot 7, but not the private road or the 20-foot strip. T conveyed lots 1 and 2 and a parcel to the north of these lots to the defendants and lots 3 and 6 to the plaintiffs or their predecessors in title. All the deeds of lots 1 to 6 included the use of the right of way and private road \u201cshown on said plan\u201d. The defendants built a garage and fence immediately to the north of lot 2 which had the effect of blocking the 20-foot right of way to the west of lot 3. The plaintiffs sued for the removal of this obstruction.\nHeld: The action must fail.\nSection 84(14) of The Registry Act did not assist the plaintiffs. Section 84 dealt with the preparation of plans, their contents and the formalities attending their registration, and it was only \u201cfor the purposes of\u201d that section that \u201ca public or private\u00bc way being the only access to a lot or lots laid down on a plan shall be deemed to be a street or highway\u201d. The subsection did not create rights in individuals or the public generally. This wording was to be contrasted with that of s. 11(2) of The Surveys Act which expressly provided that the roads, streets, etc., there referred to \u201cshall be public highways\u201d, etc. The 20-foot strip here in question did not fall within s. 11(2) of The Surveys Act since it was described merely as \u201ca right of way\u201d and it was clear from the conveyances that the right intended to be given to the plaintiffs was in the nature of an easement.\nNor could the plaintiffs rely on the general principle that where lots were sold according to a particular plan the purchasers acquired an interest in the streets or lanes shown on that plan. These conveyances had not simply described the lots with reference to the plan but had expressly given rights of way over the 20-foot strip and on a proper construction of the deeds that right of way did not extend to the part of the 20-foot strip lying to the west of lot 3.\nPer Kellock J.: It followed by implication from the wording of s. 89(1) of The Registry Act (which must be read with s. 84(14)) that when a sale had been made according to a plan the plan became binding, but the plaintiffs obtained no assistance from the statute in this case since the word \u201caccess\u201d in s. 84(14) contemplated a means of approach connecting the lot or lots to some street or way over which the public were entitled to travel. The 20-foot strip here in question did not connect with any such public street or way but merely with a private road. It was also to be observed that s. 84(5) required that a plan should show all roads and streets \u201cwithin the limits\u201d of the land subdivided. This plan was expressly confined to the numbered lots and excluded both the 20-foot strip and the private road to highway no. 2. It could therefore not be contended that either of these areas was \u201con\u201d the plan.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], reversing a judgment of Reynolds Co.Ct.J., of the County Court of the County of Frontenac. Appeal allowed.\nJ.J. Robinette, Q.C., for the defendants, appellants.\nW.B. Williston, Q.C., and C.M. Smith, for the plaintiffs, respondents.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Cartwright and Nolan JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This appeal is brought, pursuant to special leave granted by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, from a judgment of that Court1 reversing, by a majority, a judgment of His Honour Judge Reynolds and restraining the appellants from maintaining a fence and building on certain lands over which the respondents claimed to be entitled to a right of way and ordering the appellants to remove the fence and building.\nIn order to make the issues clear it is necessary to state the facts in some detail.\nIn and prior to the year 1943 one William Turcotte was the owner of the west half of lot 32 in concession 2 of the township of Pittsburgh in the county of Frontenac. In 1943 Turcotte had a plan of part of his land prepared by an Ontario Land Surveyor. This plan is dated October 12, 1943 and was registered in the Registry Office for the County of Frontenac on October 28, 1944 as plan 338. The plan shows seven lots numbered consecutively from 1 at the west to 7 at the east. The southerly boundary of all the lots is the northerly bank of the River St. Lawrence and the northerly boundary of lots 1 to 6 is a straight line drawn on a bearing south 88 degrees, 43 minutes east from a point in the westerly boundary of lot 32 concession 2 to a point in the westerly limit of a road marked with the words \u201cRoad to Highway No. 2\u201d. The plan shows only the southerly portion of this road. There is a note on the plan reading:\nPrivate Road from Highway No. 2 South along West limit Lot 32 Concession 3 for 1,100\u2019 and along West limit Lot 32 Concession 2 to the valley which it follows to the level a total of 2,600\u2019.\nIt is common ground that this is a private road. To the east of this road is lot 7. There is a broken line shown on the plan running parallel to the line which marks the northerly boundary of lots 1 to 6 and distant 20 feet northerly therefrom; between these lines there is a notation \u201cRight of Way 20\u2019 wide\u201d. Lots 1 to 6 inclusive and lot 7 are outlined in red and on the face of the plan there is a note as follows: \u201cNote\u2014lands registered outlined Red.\u201d At all material times there was a fence erected on the line between lots 32 and 31 in concession 2, lot 31 being to the west of lot 32. The lands to the west of this fence were owned by one Paddle and occupied by him as a farm. This fence formed the west boundary of Jot 1 plan 338 and continued northerly therefrom for a considerable distance. At its westerly end the strip of land marked \u201cRight of Way 20\u2019 wide\u201d was blocked by this fence and at its easterly end it opened into the private road above referred to.\nBy deed dated August 24, 1944 Turcotte conveyed to the respondent Lindsey Ruck and his wife as joint tenants:\nALL AND SINGULAR that certain parcel or tract of land and premises situate, lying and being part of the west half of lot 32, in the second concession of the Township of Pittsburgh, in the County of Frontenac, and more particularly being lot six, according to a plan on fyle in the Registry Office for Kingston and Frontenac as No. 338, together with a right-of-way as shown on said plan over said lot to the King\u2019s Highway No. 2.\nBy deed dated September 17, 1945 Turcotte conveyed to the appellant Doris Van Alstyne:\nALL AND SINGULAR these certain parcels or tracts of land and premises situate, lying and being in the township of Pittsburgh in the County of Frontenac and being composed of Lots # 1 and # 2, according to a plan of part of the front of the West half of Lot # 32 in the second concession of said township on file in the Registry Office for Kingston and Frontenac as # 338. Together with the use of the right of way shown on said plan and together with [another right of way with which we are not concerned].\nBy deed dated August 10,1946 Turcotte conveyed lot 3 to one Isabelle Connor, and by deed dated July 11, 1949 she conveyed this lot to the respondents Gowett, Scott and Compeau; the descriptions of the lands conveyed in these two deeds are identical and read as follows:\nALL AND SINGULAR that certain parcel or tract of land and premises situate, lying and being in the Township of Pittsburgh, in the County of Frontenac and being composed of Lot number Three (3) according to a plan of the front of the west half of Lot number 32, in the Second Concession of said township on file in the Registry Office for Kingston and Frontenac as No. 338. Together with the use of a right-of-way and private road to and from Highway No. 2, shown on said plan.\nBy deed dated May 17, 1949 Turcotte conveyed to the appellant Samuel Van Alstyne a parcel of land containing 1.58 acres bounded on the south by the northerly limits of lots 1 and 2 plan 338, on the west by the west limit of lot 32, concession 2, on the north by a line 149\u00bd feet in length drawn on a bearing south 88 degrees 51 minutes east from a point in the west limit of lot 32 distant 520 feet northerly from the north-west angle of lot 1 plan 338 to a post and on the east by a line drawn from this post to the north-east angle of lot 2. The description in this deed concludes as follows:\nTogether with and subject to a right-of-way in common with those others entitled thereto over, on and across said Lot # 32, Concession Two and Lot # 31 in the Third Concession of said Township from Highway No. 2 to and from the land hereby conveyed.\nIn the spring of 1953 the appellants erected a garage and a fence which extend across the strip of land marked \u201cRight of Way 20\u2019 wide\u201d on plan 338. These were still there at the date of the trial and prevent any of the respondents making use of that part of the said strip which lies to the west of the production northerly of the line between lots 2 and 3 on plan 338. The action was brought to compel the removal of these obstructions.\nParagraphs 3, 4 and 5 of the statement of claim read as follows:\n3. In or about the months of April or May, 1953, the defendants or either of them, erected a building on the right-of-way running along the rear of Lots 1 to 6 inclusive as laid out on a -plan of subdivision of part of Lot 32 in the Second Concession of the Township of Pittsburgh and registered in the Registry Office for the Registry Division of Kingston and Frontenac as Plan Number 338.\n4. The Defendants have also erected, and maintain a fence, across the said right\u2011of\u2011way, at the easterly end of their lands.\n5. The said building erected by the defendants, or either of them, and the fence built by the defendants, or either of them, obstruct the right-of-way of the Plaintiffs and deprives them of their use and enjoyment of the said right-of-way to which they are entitled by their deeds of ownership.\nIn their statement of defence the appellants refer to the conveyances mentioned above and plead that the right of way granted to the respondents is to and from highway no. 2 and not over the lands of the appellants. It was on the issue so defined that the action went to trial. At the trial there was no serious dispute as to the facts. The respondents gave evidence to show that prior to the erection of the fence and garage they had used that part of the 20-foot strip lying to the west of the boundary between lots 2 and 3 for the purpose of going to the Paddle farm to make purchases and sometimes to go through the Paddle farm to highway no. 2 but there was no suggestion that they had any right to travel over any part of the Paddle farm for this purpose or any right to climb the fence which formed the easterly boundary of the Paddle farm.\nThe learned trial judge construed the conveyances to the respondents as granting to them a right of way over the 20-foot strip from their lots to the private road, the southerly end of which is shown on plan 338, and over this private road to highway No. 2, but not as giving them any right of way over that part of the 20-foot strip lying to the west of the production of the boundary between lots 2 and 3. For the reasons given by Laidlaw J.A. in the Court of Appeal I agree with this construction.\nRoach J.A., who delivered the reasons of the majority in the Court of Appeal, was of opinion that the plaintiffs were entitled to succeed on one or other of two grounds.\nThe first of these is that s. 84 (14) of The Registry Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 336, is decisive of the rights of the parties. That subsection reads as follows:\n(14) Any public or private street, way, lane or alley or block, tract or lot, being the only access to a lot or lots laid down on a plan of survey and subdivision, shall, for the purposes of this section, be deemed to be a street or highway. The learned trial judge had rejected this argument on the grounds (i) that the strip marked \u201cRight of Way 20\u2019 wide\u201d was excluded from the plan because it was not outlined in red, and (ii) that the plan was improperly registered because its registration had not been consented to by the proper municipal council or the Ontario Municipal Board. Assuming, without deciding, that Roach J.A. was right in refusing to give effect to either of these grounds, I find myself unable to agree with his view as to the operation of the subsection.\nSection 84 appears to me to deal with the method of the preparation of plans, their contents, and the formalities which attend their registration. It is only \u201cfor the purposes of this section\u201d that \u201ca public or private\u00bcway\u00bcbeing the only access to a lot or lots laid down on a plan\u00bcshall be deemed to be a street or highway\u201d. To construe the subsection as having the effect of creating rights in individuals or the public generally or imposing liabilities as to maintenance and repair upon municipalities seems to me to fail to give effect to the words \u201cfor the purposes of this section\u201d.\nThe wording of s. 84 (14) may usefully be contrasted with that of s. 11 (2) of The Surveys Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 381, which reads as follows:\n(2) Subject to the provisions of The Registry Act and The Land Titles Act as to the amendment or alteration of plans, all allowances for roads, streets, lanes or commons, surveyed in any such city, town, village, lot, mining claim, mining location or any parcel or tract of land or any part thereof, which has been or may be surveyed and laid out by companies or individuals and laid down on the plans thereof shall be public highways, streets, lanes and commons.\nFrom this it appears that where the intention of the Legislature is to create public highways or streets that intention is plainly expressed.\nThe reason that I think that s. 11 (2) of The Surveys Act does not assist the respondents is that the 20-foot strip shown on plan 338 seems to me not to fall within the words \u201callowances for roads, streets, lanes\u201d. All of these words are appropriate to describe highways but the words \u201cright of way\u201d are more apt to describe an easement. When the conveyances above referred to are looked at it is clear that the right intended to be given to the respondents was in the nature of an easement. I did not understand any of the parties to contend that the 20-foot strip had become a public highway and it would be surprising to find a public highway running from a private road to a dead-end. If it had been contended that the 20-foot strip had become a public highway it might have been necessary to consider whether an action to so declare would be properly constituted without the Attorney-General for the Province and the municipality in which the lands are situate being made parties. I do not pursue this question as what is claimed by the respondents is not that the 20-foot strip has become a public highway but that they are entitled to a right of way over all of it \u201cby their deeds of ownership\u201d.\nThe second ground on which Roach J.A. proceeded is summarized in the following paragraph in his reasons[2]:\nThe lots were sold by Turcotte to the several purchasers according to a plan which showed a right of way extending all the way across in front of those lots. The law is well settled that if a person sells lots according to a particular map or plan, even though it is not registered, the purchasers acquire an interest in the streets or lanes shown upon it adjoining the lots sold, which places them beyond the vendor\u2019s future control to their injury.\nAs a general proposition this is not disputed; but in the case at bar the conveyances on which the respondents rely define their rights to the use of the strip of land in question. We do not have to decide what the rights of the parties would have been if their deeds had simply described their lots with reference to plan 338 and had made no mention of the 20-foot strip. The applicable rule of construction is that set out in the reasons of Strong J. in Grasett v. Carter[3] as follows:\nWhen lands are described, as in the present instance, by a reference, either expressly or by implication, to a plan, the plan is considered as incorporated with the deed, and the contents and boundaries of the land conveyed, as defined by the plan, are to be taken as part of the description, just as though an extended description to that effect was in words contained in the body of the deed itself. Then, the interpretation of the description in the deed is a matter of legal construction and to be determined accordingly as a question of law by the judge, and not as a question of fact by the jury.\nI have already indicated my agreement with Laidlaw J.A. in holding that on the construction of their deeds, read with the plan therein referred to, the respondents are not entitled to a right of way over that part of the 20-foot strip lying west of the production of the line between lots 2 and 3.\nI would allow the appeal and direct that the judgment of the learned trial judge be restored. The appellants are entitled to their costs of the action and of the appeal to the Court of Appeal but, in view of the terms of the order of the Court of Appeal granting leave to appeal, the only order as to costs in this Court should be that the appellants pay to the respondents the reasonable cost of preparing and printing their factum, a reasonable counsel fee and the reasonable expenses of their counsel in attending at Ottawa during the argument of the appeal.[4]\nKELLOCK J.:\u2014I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of my brother Cartwright and agree with his view, which was also that of Laidlaw J.A., as to the construction to be placed upon the conveyances here in question. I also agree that these conveyances define the rights of the parties as to the use of the strip in question.\nI desire, however, to express my own view with regard to the effect of s. 84 (14) of The Registry Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 336, which reads as follows:\n(14) Any public or private street, way, lane or alley or block, tract or lot, being the only access to a lot or lots laid down on a plan of survey and subdivision, shall, for the purposes of this section, be deemed to be a street or highway.\nThe respondents contend, and I think rightly, that regard must be had to s. 89 (1) of the statute, which provides that a plan, although registered, shall not be binding on the person registering it, or upon other persons unless a sale has been made according to the plan. This clearly indicates, I think, that where such a sale has been made the plan is binding.\nI think, however, that the respondents obtain no assistance from the statute in the circumstances of the present case, as, in my view, the word \u201caccess\u201d, which is defined by the Oxford Dictionary as \u201ca way or means of approach\u201d, contemplates that the means is one which connects the lot or lots to some street or way over which the public are entitled to travel. As pointed out by my brother Cartwright, the strip here in question does not connect with any such public street or way but, so far as the evidence shows, merely with a private right of way. I think the word \u201caccess\u201d in the statute is used in the same sense as in the statute which was under discussion in Oakley v. Merthyr Tydfil Corporation[5].\nI think it could hardly be contended, and it has not been contended in the case at bar, that that part of the \u201cRoad to Highway No. 2\u201d, which is the private right of way to which I have referred and which is sketched in outside the red lines which depict the limits of the subdivided lands, is to be regarded as a public highway by virtue of s. 84 (14). So far as the plan is concerned, this particular road or way ends \u201cin the air\u201d. In my view, the status of this road or way differs in no way from that of the strip here in question.\nIt is to be observed that subs. (5) of the section, which is mandatory, requires that the plan shall show all roads and streets \u201cwithin the limits\u201d of the land subdivided. Plan 338 is expressly confined to the numbered lots and excludes both the strip and the \u201cRoad to Highway No. 2\u201d. I therefore think it cannot be contended that either of these areas may be considered as being \u201con\u201d the plan and that in any event the strip to the north of lots 1 to 6 does not come within the word \u201caccess\u201d within the meaning of s. 84(14).\nBy s. 453 of The Municipal Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 243, the burden of repairing all highways within its jurisdiction is placed upon a municipality. In my opinion, it would be impossible to contend that the local municipality here in question has any such responsibility with respect to a strip of land to which the municipality itself has no right of access. That strip, therefore, cannot \u201cbe deemed to be a street or highway\u201d. The appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the learned trial judge restored. I agree with the order as to costs proposed by my brother Cartwright.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitors for the defendants, appellants: Gibson, Sands & Flanigan, Kingston.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, respondents: Smith & Smith, Kingston.\n[1] [1955] O.R. 738, [1955] 4 D.L.R. 41.\n[2] [1955] O.R. at p. 751.\n[3] (1884), 10 S.C.R. 105 at 114.\n[4] The order granting leave to the defendants to appeal provided that the leave should \u201cbe conditional upon the defendants undertaking to pay to the plaintiffs in any event of the disposition of the appeal by the Supreme Court of Canada, the reasonable cost of preparation and printing of a factum, a reasonable counsel fee for counsel for the plaintiffs, plus the reasonable expenses of counsel for the plaintiffs in attendance in Ottawa during the argument of the appeal\u201d.\n[5] [1922] 1 K.B. 409.\n",

According to the articles of association of the company, any shareholder who wished to sell or transfer his shares was required to give written notice to the directors who would thereupon give the other shareholders a first opportunity to purchase. T died in 1936, leaving a will whereby he appointed his wife, D and C as his executors and trustees and devised and bequeathed to them the residue of his estate on trust for conversion and investment in trustee investments. The trustees were given a power to postpone conversion and a specific power to hold the shares in the private company. Three months later D died and his widow became entitled to his shares. She did not wish to retain the shares and they were bought by C in 1945. In this action, the trustees of T's estate (C having retired and been replaced in 1948) alleged that as to one-half of the shares bought by him C had been guilty of a breach of trust, although they disclaimed any charge of fraud.\nHeld, there had been no breach of trust and the action must be dismissed.\nIt was clear that under T's will the estate would not have been entitled, without an order of the Court, to buy the shares, which were purely speculative and not a trustee investment. The Court would have had no jurisdiction to authorize such a purchase under the \"salvage\" rule, since it could not have been contended that the offer of D's shares presented a situation which might \"reasonably be supposed to be one not foreseen or anticipated\" by T or one where his trustees were \"embarrassed by the emergency\". In re New, [1901] 2 Ch. 534 at 544, quoted and applied.\nT's estate had nothing either to sell or to assign and C in buying the shares as he did was doing no more than exercise a contractual right vested in him under the articles of association of the company. The fact that the estate could not be a buyer was not due to anything for which C, by reason of any act or default on his part as trustee, was responsible.\nAPPEAL by the defendants from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia [1], reversing a judgment of Whittaker J. Appeal allowed.\nAlfred Bull, Q.C., and C. C. I. Merritt, for the defendant Crocker, appellant.\nJacob S. Ziegel, for the defendant Croquip Ltd., appellant.\nHon. J. W. deB. Farris, Q.C., A. D. Poole and Kenneth Farris, for the plaintiffs, respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nKELLOCK J.:\u2014This litigation relates to certain shares in the British Columbia Equipment Company Ltd., incorporated in January 1931 under the laws of British Columbia, in which the deceased Gunnar Tornroos, one Dietrich and the appellant Crocker held an equal number of shares. All three were active in the business of the company.\nThe articles of association which, by virtue of s. 37 of the Companies Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 58, have the force of a contract binding both the members and the company, require any shareholder desiring to sell or transfer his shares to give written notice to the directors, specifying the fair value of the shares, and constituting the board his agent for sale to any member or members of the company who might desire to purchase at the price so fixed or at a price to be agreed upon or settled by arbitration.\nThe board is thereupon required to notify the other shareholders of the notice and invite them to state within 10 days whether they desire to purchase any and, if so, how many of such shares. The board is required to apportion the shares so offered among the shareholders desiring to purchase pro rata according to the number of shares already held by them respectively. If only one shareholder desires to purchase, he is entitled to purchase the whole. It is only shares not taken up by the other shareholders which may be sold to non-shareholders, but at a price not less than that at which they have already been offered to the shareholders.\nBy his will, dated January 9, 1936, the testator, who died on April 29, 1940, appointed his wife, the respondent Libbie Tornroos, the said Dietrich and the appellant Crocker his executors and trustees, and devised and bequeathed to them the residue of his estate upon trust for conversion and investment in trustee investments. The widow is entitled to the income during her life or until remarriage, with remainder to the testator's children. In the event of the widow remarrying, however, she shares equally in the corpus with the children. The will contains a power of postponement of conversion of any part or parts of the estate and a specific power to hold the shares in British Columbia Equipment Company Ltd. for such period as the trustees should deem in the best interests of the estate, even should this involve their remaining unconverted at the period of distribution.\nThe death of Tornroos was followed three months later by that of Dietrich, whose widow became entitled to the shares previously belonging to her husband. These shares she ultimately sold to the appellant Crocker in April 1945, and it is the latter's purchase which is the subject-matter of these proceedings, which were instituted in September 1953 by the respondents, the then trustees, the appellant Crocker having retired from the trust in 1948, been discharged and succeeded as trustee by the respondent Alfred Hall Tornroos.\nIn the statement of claim the respondents allege that the appellant Crocker \"failed to exercise the right of preemption which enured to the benefit of the [Tornroos] Estate, and, in breach of trust, bought all of the shares so offered for sale for himself and retained them or alternatively transferred them or caused them to be transferred to\" the appellant Croquip Ltd. The respondents' claim for relief is confined to one-half of the Dietrich shares so acquired by Crocker, as well as the proceeds of any shares redeemed, and dividends. The respondents do not charge fraud on the part of either appellant and, in fact, disclaim any such charge. Before entering into the purchase, the appellant Crocker and the respondent Libbie Tornroos had each been advised by their respective solicitors that under the terms of the Tornroos will, it was not open to the estate to acquire any part of the Dietrich shares. In my opinion this advice was sound.\nIn these circumstances, the learned trial judge absolved the appellant Crocker from any breach of trust as well as from any abuse of his fiduciary position. Consequently he dismissed the action. This judgment was, however, reversed on appeal, Bird J.A. dissenting [2], but it was directed that the respondent Libbie Tornroos should receive no beneficial interest in such shares. The majority were of opinion, in the first place, that as the estate was entitled under the company's articles to buy from Dietrich, a duty rested upon the appellant Crocker as trustee to apply to the Court for leave to purchase one-half of the Dietrich shares and that there was jurisdiction in the Court to have authorized such a purchase on the principle of salvage. Davey J.A., who delivered the judgment of himself and O'Halloran J.A., entertained \"no doubt that it [the application] could have been supported plausibly as a salvage operation designed to avert depreciation in the value of the estate's principal asset from the unforeseen sale of the Dietrich shares\" [3]. This depreciation he considered would flow from the fact of control of the company being acquired by one shareholder.\nThe learned judge was also of opinion that it was the duty of Crocker to endeavour to persuade Mrs. Dietrich not to sell her shares, or, failing this, to have endeavoured to have the trustees make an \"agreement with Crocker for him to pay the estate to surrender its rights or allow them to lapse, so that he could get control\" or to bring about some agreement with him \"to protect the estate against an oppressive exercise of control, such as guaranteeing representation on the board of directors, limitation of executives' salaries and like matters\" [4]. Davey J.A. also considered that in any event before purchasing himself, Crocker ought to have applied to the Court for directions, and for \"leave to allow the estate's rights of pre\u2014emption to lapse if no other course was open, and for leave to exercise the rights which would accrue to him personally by that lapse\" [5].\nIt is, of course, well settled that a trustee may not place himself in a situation where his interest and his duty conflict. The question which arises at the threshold of this litigation is, therefore, whether the appellant Crocker, as trustee of the Tornroos estate, had any duty toward the estate in connection with the purchase of any part of the Dietrich shares.\nIt is common ground, as already pointed out, that the trustees were debarred by the direction of the testator himself from investing any of the funds of the estate in these shares. To have done so would have been a breach of trust on the part of the trustees, and Davey J.A. agrees that this is so. Leaving aside any question as to whether or not the estate could have financed the purchase or whether such an investment would have been considered suitable at the time owing to its undoubted speculative character, in my opinion the authorities are clear that in the circumstances of this case, there is no foundation for a contention that the Court, if it had been applied to, had jurisdiction to authorize the purchase on the basis of \"salvage\".\nBefore referring to the salvage rule itself, it will be useful to refer to one or two instances held to be outside its scope. In In re Montagu; Derbishire v. Montagu [6], the Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal by the trustees of a settlement from a decision of Kekewich J. refusing an application for an order authorizing them to raise money out of the settled estate for the purpose of pulling down and rebuilding houses on the property. The following from the judgment of Lopes L.J., at p. 11, contains the gist of the judgment:\nI have no doubt that what is proposed is beneficial, and would increase both the income and the capital value of the property. The question is whether the Court has jurisdiction to sanction it. There is no provision in the settlement which would authorize the works in question, nor do they fall within any of the improvements sanctioned by the Settled Land Acts. It is urged that the Court, having control over trust property, can sanction them, as it would be vastly for the benefit of the persons interested that it should do so. That is not enough. If the buildings were falling down it would be a case of actual salvage and would stand differently. Even in cases of repairs the Court has been very careful in the exercise of its jurisdiction. In the case of In re Jackson (1882), 21 Ch.D., 786, 789, Kay J., in dealing with a case of repairs, said: \"I think that this jurisdiction should be jealously exercised, and only in cases which amount to actual salvage.\" The present cannot be said to be a case of actual salvage, and the learned judge was right in refusing to exercise a jurisdiction which he in fact did not possess.\n(The italics are mine.)\nIn In re Morrison; Morrison v. Morrison [7], it was held that the Court had no jurisdiction to sanction an agreement under which executors or trustees proposed to concur in converting into a limited company a business in which their testator had been a partner, and under which the testator's share would be exchanged for shares and debentures which the executors and trustees were not authorized by the will to hold. Buckley J. referred to the previous decision of North J. in Re Crawshay; Dennis v. Crawshay [8], on somewhat similar facts and expressed himself as follows at p. 707:\nIn my opinion there does not reside in this Court any power to authorize trustees to take, on the ground that it is beneficial, an investment which the testator has not authorized.\nThe rule was authoritatively expressed by Romer L.J. in In re New; In re Leavers; In re Morley [9], as follows:\nAs a rule, the Court has no jurisdiction to give, and will not give, its sanction to the performance by trustees of acts with reference to the trust estate which are not, on the face of the instrument creating the trust, authorized by its terms. The cases of In re Crawshay, decided by North J., and In re Morrison, decided by Buckley J., are instances where the Court was asked to sanction steps to be taken by trustees which it thought unjustifiable, and which it declared it had no jurisdiction to authorize. But in the management of a trust estate, and especially where that estate consists of a business or shares in a mercantile company, it not infrequently happens that some peculiar state of circumstances arises for which provision is not expressly made by the trust instrument, and which renders it most desirable, and it may be even essential, for the benefit of the estate and in the interest of all the cestuis que trust, that certain acts should be done by the trustees which in ordinary circumstances they would have no power to do. In a case of this kind, which may reasonably be supposed to be one not foreseen or anticipated by the author of the trust, where the trustees are embarrassed by the emergency that has arisen and the duty cast upon them to do what is best for the estate, and the consent of all the beneficiaries cannot be obtained by reason of some of them not being sui juris or in existence, then it may be right for the Court, and the Court in a proper case would have jurisdiction, to sanction on behalf of all concerned such acts on behalf of the trustees as we have above referred to.\n(The italics are mine.) The facts existing in the above case afford a useful contrast to situations of the character existing in the other cases to which I have referred. In the New case the Court gave its sanction to the concurrence of trustees in a scheme for the reconstruction of a prosperous limited company, shares in which had become vested in the trustees, it being proposed that all the shareholders in the existing company should exchange their shares for more realizable shares and debentures in the proposed new or reconstructed company, but the Court required that the evidence before it should be supplemented with respect to the importance of further capital being provided by the proposed reconstruction and the difficulties that would arise if the trustees should be obliged to stand aloof and take no part in it. The proposed plan of reconstruction had been put forward because of \"the constantly increasing dividends earned by the company and the large outlays which it had been necessary to make from time to time out of profits in developing the [company's] collieries\". Counsel for the trustees pointed out that if they did not assent to the scheme, they would \"be at the mercy of the other shareholders, who could still wind up the company, and under s. 161 of the Companies Act, 1862, could buy the trustees out\".\nThere were three separate trust estates involved and it was directed that where the trustees were not by the terms of the trust authorized to invest in the shares or debentures of such a company as the proposed new company, they must undertake to apply to the Court for leave to retain them. The shares and debentures of the new company when received by the trustees in pursuance of the authorization of the Court, would, of course, be considered on the same footing as if they had been original assets. If their retention was not authorized by the terms of the trust instruments the trustees would be under obligation to dispose of them.\nThe rule as laid down in New's Case was followed in In re Tollemache [10], where that decision was described as \"the high-water mark of the exercise by the Court of its extraordinary jurisdiction in relation to trusts\". The rule so laid down received the approval of the House of Lords in Chapman et al. v. Chapman et al. [11]. The jurisdiction of the Court on the ground of salvage being as above defined, it is impossible to contend in the case at bar that the offer of the Dietrich shares presented a situation which, in the language of Romer L.J., might \"reasonably be supposed to be one not foreseen or anticipated\" by the testator, or one where his trustees were \"embarrassed by the emergency\".\nIn drawing his will, the testator clearly had present to his mind his shareholding in the company in question, as he specifically mentions these shares. He must equally be taken to have been well aware of the provisions of the articles of the company, of which he was one of the founders, and that in the event of the death of either Dietrich or Crocker occurring while his own estate was undergoing administration, the shares of either might be offered for sale, in which event his trustees would be entitled to buy. In settling the terms of his will and giving directions to his trustees, it is plain he did not desire that his estate should exercise the right to purchase but was content that his own shares should continue as a minority holding in a company controlled by the one or other of his former business associates, in whom he had such confidence that he desired they should be his trustees. This being so, the case is entirely outside the rule in New's Case. Accordingly, there was no duty resting upon the appellant Crocker as suggested by the majority in the Court of Appeal.\nIt may be pointed out, also, that had any duty as trustee rested upon Crocker with respect to the Dietrich shares on the footing that the estate had something to sell or assign, it would have involved him in a purchase from an estate of which he was trustee, if he had brought about an agreement \"to pay the estate to surrender its rights or to allow them to lapse so that he could get control\", as the majority in the Court below considered he ought to have endeavoured to do.\nIn truth, however, the estate had nothing either to sell or to assign, and Crocker, in purchasing the shares as he did, was exercising nothing but a contractual right vested in himself personally under the articles of association to buy all the shares offered where there was no other competing shareholder. The respondents admit that the appellant was entitled to buy one-half of the Dietrich shares but it is plain that he was entitled to buy all of those shares when no other shareholder appeared in the market. The fact that the Tornroos estate could not be a buyer was not due to anything for which the appellant Crocker, by reason of any act or default of his, as trustee, was responsible. Crocker, accordingly, had a right to buy upon the footing of the articles or if, as was contended, the time for acceptance of the Dietrich offer had gone by, then just as any other member of the public.\nWhile certain further grounds of defence were put forward on behalf of the appellant company, some of which, at least, would appear to present objections of a somewhat formidable nature to the judgment of the majority in the Court below, it is not now necessary, in view of the conclusion to which I have come as above, to consider them.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge with costs in this Court and in the Court of Appeal.\nAppeal allowed and trial judgment restored, with costs throughout.\nSolicitors for the defendant Crocker, appellant: Bull, Housser, Tupper, Ray, Guy & Merritt, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the defendant Croquip Ltd., appellant: Guild, Yule, Lane & Collier, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, respondents: Farris, Stultz, Bull & Farris, Vancouver.\n[1] 3 D.L.R.

(Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nPennboro Coal Company (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1956: November 15; 1957: January 22.\nPresent: Taschereau, Locke, Fauteux, Abbott and Nolan JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nAgency\u2014Whether contract made with agent or principal\u2014Reasonable cause given for belief in mandate\u2014To what extent estoppel recognized in Quebec law\u2014Evidence of telephone conversation\u2014Civil Code, arts. 1235(3),1727,1730.\nThe defendant company instructed P to buy coal in the United States and have it shipped to a customer for the defendant's account. The plaintiff company was asked by P to supply and ship the coal, and it shipped 552.05 tons. The defendant received payment from the customer for this coal, but refused to pay the plaintiff, on the ground that the defendant had contracted to buy the coal from P as principal and that there was no privity of contract between the two companies. In its action to obtain payment from the defendant, the plaintiff contended that P had represented himself as the defendant's agent and was buying the coal on its behalf. Evidence of the contract between the defendant and P was rejected by the trial judge, but he found as a fact that the defendant, in a telephone conversation with the plaintiff, had authorized the shipment and undertaken to pay for it, and gave judgment for the plaintiff. This judgment was affirmed by a majority in the Court of Appeal. The defendant appealed.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Taschereau and Abbott JJ.: The liability of the defendant was clearly established. It arose under art. 1727 of the Civil Code if P was in fact the defendant's mandatary. It also arose under art. 1730, which is the only case in the Code of the application of the English theory of \"estoppel\", when P clearly represented himself as a mandatary and the telephone conversation between the officers of the defendant and the plaintiff (the latter being in good faith) gave the latter reasonable cause for believing that representation.\nThe contract between P and the defendant was clearly res inter alios acta, and was rightly rejected by the trial judge.\nThe evidence of the telephone conversation was not inadmissible under art. 1235(3) of the Civil Code, since it was not tendered to show that the defendant had made representations to enable P to obtain goods or personal credit, but rather to establish that the defendant had given reasonable cause to believe that P was its mandatary and that it would pay its own debt.\nPer Locke, Fauteux and Nolan JJ.: The question whether the defendant had dealt with P qua principal was directly in issue and the written contract between them tendered in evidence was improperly rejected. The ground of the objection made to its admission that it was res inter alios acta was irrelevant. The concurrent findings that the defendant had contracted directly with the plaintiff should not, however, be disturbed, the improper rejection of the evidence not affecting the determination of that issue.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec 1, affirming, Rinfret J. dissenting, the judgment at trial. Appeal dismissed.\nA. Laurendeau, Q.C., and J. Dupr\u00e9, Q.C., for the defendant, appellant.\nS. Fenster, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau and Abbott JJ. was delivered by\nTaschereau J.:\u2014In its statement of claim the plaintiff company, respondent in the present case, alleged that acting upon the appellant's instructions, it agreed to ship to the Canadian National Railways, for the account of the defendant, 552.05 tons of coal for which defendant agreed to pay plaintiff respondent the sum of $3.85 per ton, making a total of $2,125.39.\nThe plaintiff respondent further alleged that it shipped to the Canadian National Railways as aforesaid, a total of 552.05 tons of coal for which it was enttiled to claim from the defendant appellant the sum of $2,125.39. It is not contested that the Canadian National Railways received delivery of this shipment and paid to the appellant the sum of $2,125.39 plus profits, making a grand total of . $2,558.78.\nThe Superior Court, Chief Justice Scott presiding, maintained the action and this judgment was affirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench 2, Mr. Justice Rinfret dissenting.\nThe respondent is a coal producer operating in the State of Pennsylvania and the appellant has its place of business in the city of Montreal. After having his name placed on the list of prospective sellers of coal to the Canadian National Railways, Mr. Alexis Nihon of Montreal incorporated the appellant in 1948, and in the year 1949, his company received a large order for the sale of coal to the Canadian National Railways. The appellant then got in touch with H. C. Parse, a coal dealer of Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, for the purpose of obtaining the necessary coal, and it appears that the latter approached the respondent company asking it to supply the coal in order to fulfil the contract. It is as a result of that interview between Parse and the respondent in Pennsylvania, and of telephone conversations between the appellant and the respondent, that the first shipment above mentioned was made to the Canadian National Railways.\nThe respondent instituted legal proceedings against the appellant to obtain payment for this first shipment, which had remained unpaid and which constituted the only expedition of coal.\nIt is the contention of the appellant that there is no privity of contract, no legal relationship existing between the litigants; that the appellant entered into an agreement with Parse to purchase coal from him personally, and that it was the latter's own concern and responsibility to purchase the coal wherever he desired. It is against Parse who ordered and bought the coal, that the respondent should exercise its legal rights, if it has any.\nMr. Alexis Nihon, president of the appellant company, testified; 'but, he was not allowed to produce as evidence the contract entered into between his company and Parse as to the legal relationship that existed between both parties. That contract was obviously res inter alios acta, and was therefore irrelevant to the issue.\nI have reached the conclusion that the appellant's liability to pay the amount claimed in the action is clearly established. If Parse was. in fact the appellant's mandatary to purchase the coal for the former, the respondent's claim cannot be contested: Civil Code, art. 1727. If he was not the mandatary, the appellant is also liable because the former represented that he was, and the respondent was given reasonable cause for such belief: Civil Code, art. 1730.\nWhen Parse was instructed by the appellant company to buy coal in the United States, to be shipped to the Canadian National Railways, he went to Barsboro, Pennsylvania, and met the officers of the Pennboro Coal Company. He represented to them that he was buying coal for the Industrial Fuel Refrigeration Co. Ltd. of Montreal, the appellant in the present case. At that meeting were present Mr. Hazard, fuel inspector for the Canadian National Railways, Mr. Watters, Mr. Tibbott and Mr. Weakland, all three officers of the respondent company. Mr. Hazard was not available as a witness on account of absence nor was Mr. Watters. But, Mr. Weakland and Mr. Tibbott are very positive that such representation was made. This has not been denied. Parse, having disappeared, could not be called.\nParse was well known to the officers of the respondents company. His credit was bad, and it was found necessary to contact the appellant in Montreal. Mr. Weakland, president of the respondent company, telephoned Mr. McMaster, vice-president of the appellant company, who confirmed the order that had been given by Parse. Weak-land testifies that McMaster said further that the company would naturally pay the bill, and it is therefore to the appellant only that credit was given. That is also the understanding of Mr. Tibbott, the vice-president of the respondent company. When the case had been heard, the enqu\u00eate was reopened to allow McMaster to give evidence, as he had not previously testified. He admitted having had telephone conversations with the plaintiff company, but denied ever promising to pay for the shipment of 552.05 tons, but his evidence was not believed by the trial judge, and this finding was confirmed by the Court of Appeal. On this point, Chief Justice Scott said:\nThe manner in which McMaster gave his evidence and his demeanour in the witness box created a bad impression as to his recollection of what he did say.\nOn the other hand, the manner in which Weakland gave his evidence and his demeanour throughout created a most favourable impression. I am satisfied that Weakland told the truth in saying that McMaster instructed this shipment to be made for the price above mentioned and promised that the defendant company would pay for it. I find as a fact Weakland's story is the true story.\nThis naturally brings into play art. 1730 of the Civil Code which reads as follows:\n1730. The mandator is liable to third parties who in good faith contract with a person not his mandatary, under the belief that he is so, when the mandator has given reasonable cause for such belief.\nThis is the only case where we find in the Quebec Civil Code the application of the English theory of \"estoppel\". Parse clearly, according to the evidence, represented himself to the respondent who was in good faith, as the mandatary of the appellant. The conversation with McMaster surely gave to the respondent reasonable cause for such belief. The responsibility of the appellant therefore arises.\nIt has been argued that Weakland's evidence as to his conversation with McMaster was inadmissible, as being a violation of art. 1235(3) of the Civil Code which is as follows:\n1235. In commercial matters in which the sum of money or value in question exceeds fifty dollars, no action or exception can be maintained against any party or his representatives unless there is a writing signed by the former, in the following cases:\n* * *\n3. Upon any representation, or assurance in favor of a person to enable him to obtain credit, money or goods thereupon;\nI do not think that this objection can prevail. The evidence given by Weakland is not to show that McMaster, on behalf of the appellant, made representations to enable Parse to obtain goods or personal credit. It was merely to establish that the appellant company, through McMaster, had given reasonable cause to believe that Parse was acting as mandatary for the appellant, and that the letter would pay its own debt. This evidence, therefore, does not fall within the ban of art. 1235(3).\nI am, for the above reasons, of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Locke, Fauteux and Nolan JJ. was delivered by\nLocke J.:\u2014In support of its contention that it had shipped the coal in question to the Canadian National Railway on the appellant's instructions, the respondent tendered evidence that the coal had been purchased by one Parse, who represented himself as the representative of the appellant company and that he was buying the coal on its behalf to be shipped to the railway company.\nThere was no evidence that Parse was authorized in any way to contract on behalf of the appellant or that the appellant either authorized or knowingly permitted him to hold himself out as its representative or agent. The fact apparently was that the appellant company had entered into a contract with Parse qua principal to supply the coal required to fill a contract which it had entered into with the railway company. The written contract which, according to statements made at the time it was tendered in evidence would have proven this fact, was rejected. This, in my opinion, was error since on this aspect of the matter the question as to whether the relations existing between the appellant and Parse were those of principal and agent, or whether they were principals contracting with each other for the purchase of the coal, was directly in issue.\nThe question as to whether Parse was in fact the appellant's agent or whether he was held out or permitted by the appellant to hold himself out to the respondent as such were distinct questions. In considering the first, the contract was clearly relevant. The ground alleged for its rejection appears to have been that it was res inter olios acta. This was, of course, quite true, but in deciding the first of the above-mentioned questions the ground of the objection was irrelevant: indeed if that were not so, any person sued on an obligation which a dishonest third person had assumed to contract on his behalf would be precluded from proving by way of defence what was the true relationship existing between him and such person.\nThe respondent had not in its declaration given the date upon which it received the instructions for the shipment of the coal and, apparently, the appellant did not ask for particulars. In these circumstances, the respondent was permited to give evidence of a conversation which took place after Parse had ordered the coal between its president Ralph Weakland and J. A. McMaster who, at the time in question, was vice-president of the appellant company. According to Weakland, he was instructed by McMaster to make the shipment of coal in question to the Canadian National Railway Company, McMaster agreeing on the appellant's behalf to pay for the shipment. According to Weakland, Parse was of no finacial worth and his company would not have shipped any coal, relying on his credit. McMaster denied that he had made any such agreement on the appellant's behalf.\nThe learned trial judge who had the advantage of seeing the witnesses accepted Weakland's evidence, finding as a fact that McMaster had instructed the respondent to make the shipment at the price of $3.85 a ton, and agreed that the defendant would pay for it and that, relying on this promise, the coal had been shipped, the respondent giving credit to the appellant alone and not to Parse. The coal was shipped to the railway company and the purchase-price paid by it to the appellant.\nThe present appellant appealed and the majority of the Court, Rinfret J. dissenting, dismissed the appeal 3. Marchand J. did not give reasons for his opinion that the appeal should be dismissed. Casey J. agreed with the conclusion of the learned trial judge that McMaster had instructed the respondent to make the shipment and had undertaken to pay the respondent for the coal.\nAs will be seen, nothing turned upon what took place between Parse and the respondent company in Pennsylvania, liability having been found upon the footing that the appellant had contracted directly with the respondent. The question to be determined is one of fact and there are concurrent findings. While I do not think that I would have reached the same conclusion on the evidence which, in my opinion, indicates that what McMaster gave was an oral guarantee of Parse's liability to the respondent which would be unenforceable, I am not prepared to reverse these findings.\nI would accordingly dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Duranleau, Dupr\u00e9 & Duranleau, Montreal.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Gameroff & Fenster, Montreal.\n1 [1955] Que.

In doing so it deducted some $114,000 representing a loss in value on shares owned by it in another company which was still in business. This deduction was disallowed by the Minister but restored by the Income Tax Appeal Board. The Minister appealed to the Exchequer Court and after service of his notice of appeal obtained, with the respondent's consent, an order permitting him to raise a new ground of appeal to the effect that if the respondent had sustained a capital loss in respect of these shares that loss was more than offset by a capital gain on other assets during the same period. The Exchequer Court held that it was too late to raise this new ground and affirmed the decision of the Income Tax Appeal Board.\nHeld (Taschereau and Cartwright JJ. dissenting): The judgment of the Exchequer Court should be set aside and the original assessment should be restored.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Locke J.: It was clear that the shares in question had depreciated to the extent claimed by the respondent and it was not necessary that they should actually have been sold before it could be said that a capital loss had been sustained. The capital gain alleged by the Minister, however, more than offset this capital loss and since capital losses and gains must be treated on the same basis the original notice of assessment was correct. In the circumstances it was not too late for the Minister to raise this ground on the appeal to the Exchequer Court.\nPer Rand, Kellock, Fauteux and Nolan JJ.: While it was not necessary that an asset should have been sold or disappeared in order to constitute a capital loss, it was necessary that the loss be absolute and irrevocable. Such a loss was realized upon a sale or in the case of stock in a company which was hopelessly insolvent and had ceased business. If, however, the business was maintained and all that could be said was that the shares would probably never exceed a maximum value, this was still a mere estimate and not the actual determination of the loss. Partial but indeterminate loss in the value of stock could not be treated as absolute and irrecoverable under the language of section 73a(1) (a) (iii). Per Abbott J.: So long as a capital asset remained in existence with the possibility of fluctuation in value up or down the owner of that asset could not be said to have sustained a capital loss or made a capital profit or gain within the meaning of the subsection. Such a loss or gain must be established by (i) a sale of the asset, (ii) proof that the asset was valueless, or (iii) proof that it was no longer susceptible of any fluctuation in value. Even, however, if this depreciation was to be interpreted as a capital loss within the meaning of the subsection, the original assessment was still right on the ground that the respondent had failed to discharge the onus of establishing that the capital losses sustained by it in the relevant period exceeded capital profits or gains made during that period.\nPer Taschereau and Cartwright JJ., dissenting: While it was correct to say that a loss, to come within the meaning of the subsection, must be final in the sense of being irrecoverable, it was not necessary that it be total. On the evidence, the respondent had established not only that the shares in question had decreased in value to the extent claimed by it but also that there was no possibility of any increase in their value beyond that figure. By a parity of reasoning, it followed that for a capital gain in respect of an asset still held in specie by the taxpayer to come within the meaning of the subsection it must appear not only that there had been an increase in the value of that asset but that there was no possibility of a corresponding decrease while it continued to be so held. This was not established in the case at bar and there was therefore no proved capital gain to offset the capital loss.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada 1, affirming a decision of the Income Tax Appeal Board, which set aside a notice of assessment by the appellant. (The appeal was originally heard by a Court of five judges, and reasons for judgment were delivered 2, but subsequently an order was made for a reargument before the full Court.) Appeal allowed.\nPeter Wright, Q.C., and T. Z. Boles, for the appellant.\nJ. J. Robinette, Q.C., J. G. Edison, Q.C., and D. A. Berlis, for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014This is an appeal by the Minister of National Revenue from a judgment of the Exchequer Court (1) affirming a decision of the Income Tax Appeal Board. Section 95a (1) of the Income Tax Act, 1948 (Can.), c. 52, enacted by s. 32 of c. 40 of the statutes of 1950, provides:\n95a: (1) A private company may elect, in prescribed manner and in prescribed form, to be assessed and to pay a tax of 15% on an amount equal to its undistributed income on hand at the end of the 1949 taxation year minus its tax-paid undistributed income as of that time. The respondent prepared a form, P.C. 2-1949, which together with the schedules thereto has been accepted by the appellant as an election by the respondent \"in prescribed form\" under this provision. This document was prepared in accordance with a resolution of the directors of the respondent at a meeting held on June 6, 1950 (before the amendment to the statute was assented to on June 30, 1950), and was received by the appellant on July 31, 1950. In schedule 2 under the heading \"Capital Losses Sustained\", appeared the following item\u2014\"1948 loss on Canadian Libbey-Owens Sheet Glass Co. Ltd. shares, $114,510.25\" and the net undistributed income was stated to be $79,439.07 on which the respondent paid 15 per cent, or $11,915.86.\nSubsection (8) of s. 95a provides:\n(8) The Minister shall, with all due dispatch, examine each election made under this section, assess the tax payable and send a notice of assessment to the company.\nIn accordance therewith the appellant examined the election, disallowed the deduction of $114,510.25 and added that amount to the total of the respondent's undistributed income on hand at the end of the 1949 taxation year and sent a notice of assessment accordingly. The disallowance of the sum of $114,510.25 was made on the appellant's construction of the definition of \"undistributed income on hand\" as it appears in s. 73a, enacted by s. 28 of the statutes of 1950, c. 40, reading, so far as applicable, as follows:\n73a. (1) In this Act\n(a) \"undistributed income on hand\" of a corporation at the end of, or at any time in, a specified taxation year means the aggregate of the incomes of the corporation for the taxation years beginning with the taxation year that ended in 1917 and ending with the specified taxation year minus the aggregate of the following amounts for each of those years:\n(i) each loss sustained by the corporation for a taxation year,\n(ii) each expense incurred or disbursement made by the corporation during one of those years that was not allowed as a deduction in computing income for the year under this Part other than an expense incurred or disbursement made in respect of the acquisition of property (including goodwill) or the repayment of loans or capital,\n(iii) the amount by which all capital losses sustained by the corporation in those years before the 1950 taxation year exceeds all capital profits or gains made by the corporation in those years before the 1950 taxation year, (iv) the amount by which all capital losses sustained by the corporation in those taxation years after the 1949 taxation year exceeds all capital profits or gains made by the corporation in those years after the 1949 taxation year.\nThe argument has proceeded mainly upon the meaning to be attached to the words \"all capital losses sustained\" in clause (iii).\nThe history of the investments by the respondent in Canadian Libbey-Owens Sheet Glass Company Limited shares has been detailed in the reasons for judgment in the Exchequer Court. It is unnecessary to repeat it because undoubtedly the shares were not disposed of before the election was made and it is for that reason that the appellant argues that no capital losses with respect thereto were sustained. Reliance is placed upon the decisions in the United States where a tax is imposed on the net balance of capital gains and losses and particularly upon the judgment in DeLoss v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue 3, where Learned Hand J., at p. 804, states the established rule:\nHowever, while the security remains in esse and its value may fluctuate, it is well settled that only by a sale can gain or loss be established. Eisner v. Macomber, 252 U.S. 189, 40 S. Ct. 189, 64 L. Ed. 521, 9 A.L.R. 1570; Miles v. Safe Deposit Co., 259 U.S. 247, 253, 42 S. Ct. 483, 66 L. Ed. 923; N.Y. Life Ins. Co. v. Edwards, 271 U.S. 109, 116, 46 S. Ct. 436, 70 L. Ed. 859; U.S. v. White Dental Mfg. Co., [274 U.S. 398 at 401, 47 S. Ct. 598].\nMoreover, we understand this to be not merely a rule of convenience, but to inhere in the essence of income arising from capital gains or losses. Nevertheless, we think it inapplicable when the security can no longer fluctuate in value because its value has become finally extinct. In such cases a sale is necessarily fictitious; it establishes nothing, and cannot be intended to do so, for there is no variable to determine.\nIt will be noticed that even in the United States an exception is made where the value of a security has entirely disappeared, but, in any event, we are concerned with the proper construction of an entirely different enactment.\nIn my opinion the Exchequer Court and the Income Tax Appeal Board came to the right conclusion that an actual sale of assets was not necessary in order that it might be said that a capital loss was sustained. The evidence is clear that the value of the shares had depreciated to a sum less than the $40,000 at which the respondent valued them. I am unable to gain any assistance in coming to this conclusion from the decisions relied upon by the late Mr. Justice Potter in connection with applications under various Companies Acts where the enquiries were as to \"capital which is lost\", but I am of opinion that, upon a fair reading of all the relevant provisions, the capital losses to the extent mentioned were sustained by the respondent in the years before the 1950 taxation year.\nThe appellant has an alternative claim as to which nothing was said until he filed an amended notice of appeal to the Exchequer Court from the decision of the Income Tax Appeal Board. This is based upon the circumstance that within the meaning of s. 73A(1) (a) (iii) capital profits or gains had been made by the respondent in the years before the 1950 taxation year in the value of its share-ownership in Bennett Glass Company Limited and in the value of certain fixed assets. The latter appears in the respondent's books after a reappraisal of certain real estate and buildings. The Exchequer Court decided that it was too late for the appellant to take this position but with deference I am unable to agree. There is no suggestion that any available evidence was not produced and therefore this Court is in a position to dispose of the matter finally. Capital losses and gains must, I think, be treated on the same basis and the former being more than offset by the latter the notice of assessment by the appellant stands although for a different reason from that advanced by him at the time of assessment or before the Income Tax Appeal Board.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the assessment restored. The appellant is entitled to his costs in this Court but under the circumstances there should be no costs in the Exchequer Court,\nThe judgment of Taschereau and Cartwright JJ. was delivered by\nCartwright J. (dissenting):\u2014Two questions arise in this appeal. The first is whether the decrease in value of certain shares of Canadian Libbey-Owens Sheet Glass Company Limited acquired by the respondent in the years 1920, 1921 and 1922 at a cost of $154,510.25 and written down in its books to $40,000 in 1948 was a capital loss sustained by the respondent within the meaning of s. 73a (1) (a) (iii) of the Income Tax Act. The second is whether the appreciation in value of certain shares of Bennett Glass Company Limited and certain fixed assets owned by the respondent and written up in its books during the same period was a capital profit or gain made by the respondent within the meaning of the same subsection.\nThe relevant facts and statutory provisions are set out in the reasons of other members of the Court.\nThe main submissions of the appellant are (i) that a decrease or an increase in the value of a capital asset still retained in specie by a taxpayer does not constitute a capital loss sustained or a capital gain made until the amount of such loss or gain is established by the sale of the asset and (ii) alternatively, that if a decrease in value of one unrealized capital asset is to be treated as a loss then an increase in value of another unrealized capital asset must be treated as a gain; that is to say, the taxpayer cannot blow hot and cold.\nI agree with the conclusion of my brother Rand that a loss to come within the meaning of the subsection must be final in the sense of being beyond doubt irrecoverable; but in my opinion a loss in value of a retained asset may be shown to be final although it is not total. On the evidence, it appears to me that the respondent established not only that the shares of Canadian Libbey-Owens Sheet Glass Company Limited had decreased in value to $40,000 but also that there was no possibility of any increase in their value beyond that figure. To make such proof in regard to the shares of a company still carrying on business will usually be difficult and may often be impossible but in the case at bar it is shown that the company had parted with all its fixed assets, that its liabilities substantially exceeded its assets and that its only source of income was a commission contract expiring in 1961 yielding a revenue such that an increase in value of the stock above the figure mentioned was beyond the bounds of practical possibility. Proof that, at the critical date, the shares had decreased in value to $40,000 would not have been sufficient to establish a loss within the meaning of the subsection; but, in my opinion, the respondent has satisfied the further onus of negativing the possibility of an increase beyond that figure. I conclude that the first question should be answered in favour of the respondent.\nAs to the second question, I think that, by parity of reasoning, it follows that for a capital gain in regard to an asset still held in specie by the taxpayer to come within the meaning of the subsection it must appear not only that C there has been an increase in the value of such asset but that there is no possibility of a corresponding decrease while it continues to be so held. Whether this could in any case be made to appear I do not stop to inquire, as, in the case at bar, the evidence as to the nature of the assets in respect of which it is alleged by the appellant that a capital gain has been made shows that it is possible, and indeed probable, that their value will fluctuate so long as they are retained. I conclude therefore that the second question should also be answered in favour of the respondent.\nFor the above reasons I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Rand, Kellock and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by\nRand J.:\u2014The narrow issue in this appeal is whether in the determination of \"undistributed income\" as defined by s. 73a of the Income Tax Act, as enacted in 1950, the amount by which the value of a capital investment has depreciated can be deducted under subs. (1) (a) (iii) which reads:\nthe amount by which all capital losses sustained by the corporation in those years before the 1950 taxation year exceeds [sic] all capital profits or gains made by the corporation in those years before the 1950 taxation year.\nThe deduction is one of a number to be made from the aggregate of incomes for the tax years from 1917 to 1949, including, among others, under cl. (i) income losses and cl. (vi) all dividends paid. The phrase \"capital losses sustained\" or its equivalent appears in several provisions of the statute in a context from which it is apparent that, within the conceptions of accountancy underlying the Act, it means actually realized. For example, in s. 26 (d) \"business losses sustained\"; s. 39(1) (a) \"loss sustained\"; s. 75, subss. (6) and (7) \"losses sustained\". These instances, however, afford only a limited assistance to the question raised. What is much more significant, if not decisive, is that the capital losses sustained under cl. (iii) are the net capital losses, those that exceed the \"capital profits or gains made\" during the same period. \"Losses sustained\" and \"profits and gains made\" are clearly correlatives and of the same character; but how can profits and gains be considered to have been made in any proper sense of the words otherwise than by actual realization? This is no inventory valuation feature in relation to capital assets. That the words do not include mere appreciation in capital values is, in my opinion, beyond controversy. It is difficult if not impossible to say that where only value is being considered in which a variable inheres you can have any other than a fluctuating estimate. The word \"loss\" in the context means absolute and irrevocable, finality. That state of things is realized upon a sale; it can also be said to be realized in the case of stock in a company which is hopelessly insolvent and has ceased business. When, on the other hand, the business is maintained and all that can be said is that in the most likely prospect the value of the shares cannot exceed a maximum, there is still no more than an estimate: the actual loss cannot in fact be so determined and unless there is that determination the statute is not satisfied. The element of appreciation illustrates the quality of fluctuation more clearly perhaps than that of depreciation, but they are essentially of the same nature. If, then, appreciation must be ruled out, as I think it must be, similarly mere loss of some value while a company remains in business must be treated in the same manner.\nA number of authorities were cited from the Courts of the United States where capital losses are deductible from taxable capital gains. So far as these decisions are helpful, they seem to support the contention of the Crown. For example, The People of the State of New York ex rel. Conway Company v. Lynch et al. 4, a case of insolvency and worthlessness of the stock. In the course of his reasons Lehman J., speaking for the Court which included Cardozo C.J., used this language 5:\nTrue, even with that variable factor [the price obtainable on a sale] taken into consideration, the taxing authority may be able to determine that some loss is inevitable, yet when the variable factor affects the amount of the inevitable loss, it may be difficult or even impossible to devise a practical test to determine that any definite part of that loss has been sustained till by complete liquidation or sale the loss is definitely established \u2026 No variable factor enters into the determination of loss which is inevitable.\nDeLoss v. Commissioner of Inland Revenue 6 likewise was an instance of worthless stock. Learned Hand J., giving the reasons of the Circuit Court of Appeals, says:\nIt might have been possible to regard fluctuations in the value of securities as present losses or gains, regardless of any sale. The power immediately to realize their value in money might have been considered as equivalent to possession of the money itself, though this would, it is true, have resulted in much difficulty in administration. However, while the security remains in esse and its value may fluctuate, it is well settled that only by a sale can gain or loss be established.\u2026\nMoreover, we understand this to be not merely a rule of convenience, but to inhere in the essence of income arising from capital gains or losses. Nevertheless, we think it inapplicable when the security can no longer fluctuate in value, because its value has become finally extinct. In such cases a sale is necessarily fictitious; it establishes nothing, and cannot be intended to do so, for there is no variable to determine.\nSeveral other cases from similar Courts were cited but they also involved insolvency and worthlessness.\nThese decisions, of course, are on different statutory language directed to a different purpose, i.e., the ascertainment of capital income. As is frequently the case, the language of the provisions has, in the course of the years, been modified in the light of experience, and as if appears in Montgomery's Federal Taxes on Corporations, 1945-46, vol. 1, at pp. 361 and 383, federal corporate income taxation law in the United States by 1945 had reached the point of crystallizing the rulings of the Courts in a precise specification of losses resulting from sale or exchange of capital assets and from shares of stock having become worthless, as being deductible items.\nThe statute clearly indicates that the time of sustaining a loss or making a profit is of primary importance and in my opinion that means the time when an entry embodying the loss sustained or the gain made must, in proper accounting, be made in the accounts. Until then, entries in the accounts appear to be irrelevant. Here, if the commencement date under s. 73a had been 1924 instead of 1917, the loss, on the view of the respondent, would have been excluded although the same entries would have been continued until 1949 when the changes were made. In the case of the gain, it happens that an appraised value made in 1920 was continued in the accounts until the reappraisal in 1949: but if the cost-prices paid before 1917 had been maintained, as in ordinary accounting they generally are, the increased value up to 1917 would have been deductible from the total increase to 1949, a computation which seems to me to be beyond any contemplation of the statute. What an allowance of both loss and gain in this case means is that the capital assets are dealt with on an inventory basis which makes the actual time of the happening of either irrelevant and makes optional or voluntary accounting entries controlling. If, for example, in 1960 a loss or both a loss and an appreciation in value are entered for capital assets, will it be necessary to inquire whether that loss or increase did or did not accrue prior to 1950? And if in 1970 an appraisal takes place, what of an asset that was maintained throughout the years at its original cost? If one asset only is sold or appraised at a loss over cost and over subsequent appraisal and they are different, which is to be taken as the measure? And must all assets at that time be dealt with to ascertain whether there have been gains? Is cost superseded by appraisal as a basis of determining loss or gain? If mere appraisal is sufficient, the selection of the time for claiming a loss could nullify the purpose of the statute. All of these difficulties point clearly to the conclusion that only an actual or virtual extinction of the asset, including disposal, necessitating an appropriate alteration of the accounts, is what the section provides for.\nPartial but indeterminate loss in the value of stock cannot, then, under the language of cl. (iii) be treated as absolute and irrecoverable. Any other view would, apart from all other considerations, introduce substantial administrative anomalies that cannot have been contemplated. The amount of undistributed income must be determined not only for the purpose of election for distribution but also in cases of liquidation, reorganization, stock dividends and redemptions as provided in the present ss. 81 and 82 of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148: and the conceptions underlying losses and gains in their application to these cases are incompatible with any other interpretation.\nBut whatever may be said of the loss here, on any basis other than that of inventory it is quite impossible, in my opinion, to treat the appreciated value of the fixed assets as \"profits or gains made\" by the company. Beyond any doubt, the value written up by the company is a fluctuating value, in its essence it is variable, and being so, no part of it comes within the area of \"profit or gain made\".\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal, set aside the judgments below, and restore the assessment of the Minister with costs in this and the Exchequer Court.\nLocke J.:\u2014The sole question to be decided by Mr. Fordham, Q.C., by whom the appeal to the Income Tax Appeal Board was heard, was as to whether the present respondent, in computing the amount of its \"undistributed income\" at the end of the taxation year 1949 (within the meaning of that expression in s. 73a (l) (a) of the Income Tax Act of 1948), was entitled to deduct the amount by which its investment in the preference and common shares of Canadian Libbey-Owens Sheet Glass Company Limited had decreased in value by that date.\nThe respondent, a private company, claimed to deduct the sum of $114,510.25 from the total amount paid by it for these shares as a capital loss. By the notice of assessment dated May 22, 1951, the respondent was informed that this deduction had been disallowed. Some other changes were made in the figures submitted by the company in computing the amount of its undistributed income but no question arose as to these in the proceedings before the Income Tax Appeal Board. The respondent filed its notice of objection on July 12, 1951, complaining only of the disallowance of the amount of the loss claimed in respect of these shares and, in the notice of appeal to the Board dated February 1, 1952, the objection to the assessment was limited to this ground alone. It was the contention of the Minister that there could be no allowance for capital losses under the provisions of para. (a) (iii) of s. 73a(1), unless the loss had theretofore been ascertained by the sale or realization upon the assets. In my opinion, this position is untenable and the matter was rightly decided by Mr. Fordham, Q.C., when the appeal of the taxpayer was allowed.\nThe amendment to the Income War Tax Act, which first permitted private companies to pay a tax on their \"undistributed income\", as defined, and to distribute it in the form of dividends free of tax to the shareholders, was enacted as ss. 94 and 96 by c. 23, s. 8, of the statutes of 1945. If there were ambiguity in the language of para. (a) (iii) of s. 73a(1) of the Income Tax Act or doubt as to the meaning to be assigned to the expressions \"all capital losses sustained\" or \"capital profits or gains made\", and I think that, read in the context, there is none, the history of the external circumstances which led to the enactment of the legislation might be considered to assist in ascertaining the evil or defect which the amendment was intended to remedy as an aid to interpretation: The Eastman Photographic Materials Company, Limited v.. The Comptroller-General of Patents, Designs and Trade-Marks 7; The River Wear Commissioners v. Adamson et al. 8.\nThe 1945 legislation was enacted following the report of the Royal Commission on the Taxation of Earned Surpluses of Private or Closely Held Corporations, presided over by Mr. Justice Ives and commonly known as the Ives Report. The nature of the problem which the Commissioner was directed to consider was described in the report in the following terms:\nThe problem with which we have to deal relates to the combined effect of income taxes and succession duties arising on the death of any of the principal shareholders of closely-held corporations with accumulated surpluses. In many instances the principal asset of the deceased is represented by his equity in the company and, in order to pay succession duties, it is found necessary to distribute a substantial part, if not all, of the accumulated surplus as a dividend. The impact of the income taxes at the prevailing rates on such a distribution is extremely serious and when combined with Federal and Provincial Succession Duties may result in the confiscation of almost the entire estate. The \"undistributed income\" of the 1945 amendment might have been more appropriately called \"undistributed gains\" since it included not only accumulations of income, as that expression was defined by s. 3 of the Income War Tax Act, but capital profits which did not fall within the definition and, in making the computation, capital losses, not otherwise deductible in computing income, might be deducted. Clearly, a loss has been sustained when a capital asset has permanently lost all or part of its value. In my opinion, what was contemplated by the section as enacted in 1945 and as re-enacted in substantially the same language as para. (a) (iii) of s. 73a (1) of the Income Tax Act of 1948, was that the capital losses or gains, the amount of which had not already been ascertained by realization upon the asset, should be determined by making a valuation. Indeed, if this were not so, I think one of the main purposes of the legislation would be defeated since, in order to take advantage of the privilege afforded by the section, it might well be necessary to sell capital assets actively used in carrying on the company's business which might have either lost their value in part or appreciated in value. This would, no doubt, mean that, in the case of many private companies where the estate of a deceased majority shareholder wished to obtain the moneys necessary to pay succession duties from the undistributed income, this could be done only by having the company realize upon a material part of its capital assets and cease operations. In the case of the present respondent, where it is contended for the Crown that its capital assets consisting of real estate and buildings had increased very largely in value and that this increase must be taken into account in computing its \"undistributed income\", it would be necessary to sell them to determine the amount of the appreciation. This, presumably, would mean a cessation of operations. I cannot think that any such construction of the legislation was intended by Parliament. The fact that the shareholder here concerned is a corporation is, of course, an irrelevant circumstance in determining the meaning to be assigned to the language of the Act.\nIt was proven on the appeal before the Income Tax Appeal Board that the value of the Canadian Libbey-Owens shares was not more than $40,000 at the end of the fiscal year of the company in 1949. That the investment in the shares of this company was a capital investment on the part of the taxpayer was not questioned. I respectfully agree with Mr. Fordham, Q.C., that, since this capital investment had depreciated in value to at least the amount claimed by the taxpayer and there being clearly no hope of any appreciation in value thereafter, the loss had been sustained within the meaning of the section.\nThis, however, does not dispose of the present appeal. Had the appeal before Potter J. been limited to the question considered before the Income Tax Appeal Board, it should properly have failed. However, other matters were put in issue on the appeal from that decision. Following the judgment of the Board, the Minister gave a notice of appeal to the Exchequer Court on July 27,1953. The ground of appeal, as stated by that notice, was that no loss had been sustained on the investment in the Canadian Libbey-Owens shares prior to December 31, 1949. Thereafter, however, the respondent consented to an order being made under subs. 3 of s. 91 of the Income Tax Act\ndirecting that the appellant be permitted to plead further facts and refer to a further statutory provision in the terms of the document attached hereto and entitled \"Further Facts and Statutory Provisions upon which the Appellant Relies\" and permitting the appellant to amend its Notice of Appeal accordingly and on condition that the respondent be permitted to make a reply to the amended Notice of Appeal.\nIn the attached document further grounds of appeal were set put which raised, in the alternative, the ground that, if the respondent had suffered the capital loss referred to, it had made capital profits in those years exceeding the amount claimed:\nand particularly made capital profits or gains in the value of its share ownership of Bennett Glass Company Limited and in the value of its fixed assets as shown by an appraisal in 1948 and in its books and accounts for that year.\nA further ground raised was that, in consequence of the foregoing, there was no amount which could be deducted from the undistributed income on hand under s. 73a(1) (a) (iii) of the Income Tax Act.\nWhile the respondent had consented to this amendment being made, by its reply it contended that the matters referred to were irrelevant. The case for the Minister was put in first at the hearing before Potter J. As part of that case, the income tax return of the respondent for the year 1948 was put in, together with the report of the company's auditors. That report dated April 30, 1949, said in part:\nThe real estate and buildings were appraised during the year by the Dominion Appraisal Company Limited, at depreciated replacement value of $414,199.75. The book value of these assets has been increased by $217,309.22 to give effect to this appraisal. Of this sum $114,510.25 has been applied to the book value of the investment in Canadian Libbey-Owens Sheet Glass Co. Limited reducing this account to $40,000.\nThe investment in Bennett Glass Company Limited is shown at cost $32,177.39 plus $84,688.14 for profits earned since acquisition of the capital stock and $26,286.38 surplus resulting from appraisal of Real Estate and Buildings in 1948.\nThe balance-sheet of the company for that year showed the Canadian Libbey-Owens shares at the reduced valuation and the real estate and buildings at the appreciated value assigned to them by the Dominion Appraisal Company.\nThe respondent called as a witness Mr. A. G. Hayes and, during the course of his examination-in-chief, produced a copy of the minutes of a directors' meeting of the respondent held on October 5, 1948, approving what was called the \"writing up\" of the book value of its Montreal property by an amount in excess of $119,000, the increase to be carried to the depreciation and property reserve account, and the charging against that account of the amount of the loss in value of the Canadian Libbey-Owens shares. This resolution was passed subject to the approval of the auditors, who later approved the entry in the company's books as the value of its real estate and buildings of the figure fixed by the appraisal company, which represented an increase of $217,309.22 in the book value of these assets. The financial statements giving effect to these changes were thereafter approved at a shareholders' meeting held on June 16, 1949.\nWhile I think the reference to the investment in Bennett Glass Company Limited is not clear, there can be no doubt that the directors, the auditors and the shareholders were all of the opinion that the value of the real estate and buildings of the company had by the end of 1948 increased by an amount considerably in excess of the loss claimed upon the Canadian Libbey-Owens shares. Just as, in my view, the investment in the shares of Canadian Libbey-Owens was capital investment, I think the investment in the real estate and buildings acquired, it may properly be assumed, for the purpose of carrying on the company's business activities, was a capital investment and, its appreciation in value thus recognized, a capital profit or gain within the meaning of the subsection.\nMr. Justice Potter, pointing out that the question as to whether there had been capital profits or gains in the value of the shares of the Bennett Glass Company Limited and of its fixed assets had not been considered in making the assessment and, consequently, not dealt with by the Income Tax Appeal Board, considered that he should not deal with the matter, saying that, while he expressed no opinion on the merits of the claim, he did not think that the assessment could be varied or a new assessment made by such procedure.\nHad it been proposed on behalf of the Minister that a new assessment be made, or one varying that of which notice had been given on May 22, 1951, I would be in agreement with this, but that is not what was proposed. It was with the consent of the respondent that the order was made permitting the Minister to raise the issue on the appeal as to the appreciation in value of the real estate and buildings and, as shown, evidence was tendered both by the Minister and the respondent on the point. The issues were tried by the learned judge, not on the facts disclosed on the appeal to the Income Tax Appeal Board but on the evidence adduced before him, which appears to me to demonstrate that the loss in value of the Canadian Libbey-Owens shares had been more than made up by the appreciation in value of the other capital assets. The objection that the evidence was irrelevant cannot be supported, in view of the course of the proceedings.\nIn the result, I would allow the appeal and restore the assessment of May 22, 1951. I would allow the appellant his costs in this Court and, in my opinion, there should be no costs allowed of the appeal to the Exchequer Court. Abbott J.:\u2014Pursuant to s. 95a of the Income Tax Act, 1948, as enacted by 1950, c. 40, s. 32, appellant elected ] to pay a tax of 15 per cent, on its undistributed income on hand at the end of the 1949 year as prescribed in the Act. In its election it claimed as a deduction from total income the sum of $114,510.25, as being a capital loss alleged to have been sustained with respect to shares still owned by it in another company which was still in existence and still operating.\nIn making his assessment the Minister disallowed this deduction and the sole issue in this appeal is whether he was right in so doing. This turns upon the interpretation to be given to s. 73a(1) (a) (iii) of the said Act, which reads as follows:\n(iii) the amount by which all capital losses sustained by the corporation in those years before the 1950 taxation year exceeds all capital profits or gains made by the corporation in those years before the 1950 taxation year.\nThis subsection authorizes one of a number of deductions which are permitted from the aggregate of the incomes of a corporation for a period, beginning with the taxation year that commenced in 1917, and ending with the year in which election is made to pay the 15 per cent, tax under s. 95a of the Act.\nI have had the advantage of considering the reasons given by my brother Rand and I agree with the view which he has expressed that so long as a capital asset remains in existence, with the possibility of fluctuation in value up or down, the owner of such asset cannot be said to have sustained a capital loss or made a capital profit or gain within the meaning of the subsection. Such loss or gain, as the case may be, must be established by (i) a sale of the asset, (ii) the asset being proved valueless, or (iii) the asset being proved to be no longer susceptible of any fluctuation in value.\nIf I am mistaken in this view and the subsection in question is to be interpreted as providing that for the purpose of claiming the deduction in question, a capital loss or gain with respect to a particular asset still owned by a taxpayer can be established by a revaluation and the making of an appropriate bookkeeping entry to record such loss or gain, the appeal should still be allowed. The evidence in the present case showed that on the \"write up write down\" basis of establishing capital gains or losses used by the respondent, the respondent's \"gains\" exceeded its \"losses\" in the relevant period prior to 1950. In my opinion the respondent failed to discharge the onus imposed upon it by the subsection, of establishing that the capital losses sustained by it prior to the 1950 taxation year exceeded capital profits or gains made during that period.\nI would allow the appeal with costs here and in the Exchequer Court; declare that the deduction of $114,510.25 claimed by respondent was properly disallowed by appellant; and restore the assessment.\nNolan J.:\u2014My first view was (l).that a capital loss had been sustained, even though the investment was not completely written off, but (2) that this was more than offset by capital gains. However, in order that there may be a majority in favour of one view of the relevant statutory provisions, I have finally decided to agree with my brother Rand that, for the reasons given by him, the appeal should be allowed, the judgments below set aside and the assessment of the Minister restored with costs here and in the Exchequer Court.\nAppeal allowed with costs, Taschereau and Cartwright JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the appellant: T.

This application was opposed by the appellant company, which held a franchise from the same municipality to bring in gas and distribute it in the town. The Board refused to approve the by\u2011law, holding that the respondent had not established that public convenience and necessity required the approval. The respondent then appealed to the Court of Appeal under s. 8(4) of the Act, as enacted in 1954. The Court of Appeal reversed the finding of the Board and ordered that a certificate issue.\nHeld (Locke J. dissenting): The order of the Court of Appeal must be set aside and the order of the Board must be restored.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Abbott J.: The Court of Appeal had no power to substitute its opinion for that of the Board, treating the question of public convenience and necessity as a question of fact subject to review on the appeal. The right of appeal was limited to \u201cany question of law or fact\u201d and the Court was therefore confined to such particular questions as might be set out in the order granting leave to appeal. The jurisdiction of the Court did not include the substitution of its views as to public convenience and necessity for those of the Board.\nPer Rand and Kellock JJ.: What the Court did was to exercise an administrative jurisdiction, substituting its judgment on the application for that of the Board. The determination of public convenience and necessity was not a \u201cquestion of fact\u201d but the formulation of an opinion, and the opinion moist be that of the Board alone.\nPer Locke J. (dissenting): The approval of the Board was required under subs. 2(a) of s. 9 of the Act, enacted in 1954, and not under subs. 2(b). The reasons delivered by the Board indicated that they did not appreciate this distinction but considered the matter as if the application had been made under subs. 2(b). The question whether public convenience and necessity required the approval of the application was one of fact in respect of which the Court of Appeal had jurisdiction and in this case it had rightly exercised that jurisdiction. APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], allowing an appeal from an order of the Ontario Fuel Board. Appeal allowed.\nJ.J. Robinette, Q.C., and L.S. O\u2019Connor, Q.C., for the appellant.\nJ. Sedgwick, Q.C., and H.M. Carscallen, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and Abbott J. was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014This is an appeal by leave of this Court by Union Gas Company of Canada Limited, from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 reversing a decision of the Ontario Fuel Board, dated October 19, 1954. The respondent, Sydenham Gas and Petroleum Company Limited, had applied to the Board, as required by s. 9 of The Municipal Franchises Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 249, as enacted by s. 3 of c. 60 of the statutes of 1954, for approval of By-law 1907 of the Town of Wallaceburg. The council of that municipality had given first and second reading to the by-law, which gives the respondent a franchise under The Municipal Franchises Act to enter on highways and construct works for the transmission of natural gas to the premises of Dominion Glass Company Limited. By By-law 1602 of the Town of Wallaceburg, which was read a third time and finally passed on April 1, 1947, after it had been assented to by the ratepayers of the municipality, the appellant secured the right and authority to enter upon the highways within the municipality to bring in gas to its distributing-system of mains and pipes and to distribute and sell it in the town, and for such purposes to lay, maintain, operate, renew and repair mains and pipes under the Town\u2019s highways. These rights were granted for the term of 25 years from April 1, 1947, or such less time as it should continue to provide an adequate supply of gas to the citizens of the municipality.\nThe respondent is a subsidiary of Dominion Glass Company Limited, and the latter desired to obtain a supply of gas for its works, if possible at cheaper rates than those charged by the appellant, although all rates are subject to approval of a provincial authority. The appellant\u2019s rates had been fixed by Mr. R.S. Colter, Q.C., who had been natural gas referee, by an order of November 26, 1948, pursuant to The Natural Gas Conservation Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 49, s. 7. That Act was repealed by The Ontario Fuel Board Act, c. 63 of the statutes of 1954, but by s. 37 thereof every regulation and order made under The Natural Gas Conservation Act is to remain in force until rescinded or amended by the Board which was created pursuant thereto.\nThe respondent\u2019s application to the Board was refused on the ground that the proposal would be a fundamental departure from the principles that had governed the gas industry in Ontario for at least the last 40 years, and that the respondent had not established that public convenience and necessity appeared to require that such approval be given. This was in pursuance of s. 8 of The Municipal Franchises Act, subss. (1) to (6) of which, as amended by s. 2 of c. 60 of the statutes of 1954, are as follows:\n8. (1) Notwithstanding anything in this or in any other general or special Act, no person shall construct any works to supply or supply,\n(a) natural gas in any municipality in which such person was not on the 1st day of April, 1933, supplying gas; or\n(b) gas in any municipality in which such person was not on the 1st day of April, 1933, supplying gas and in which gas was then being supplied,\nwithout the approval of the Ontario Fuel Board and such approval shall not be given unless public convenience and necessity appear to require that such approval be given.\n(2) The approval of the Ontario Fuel Board shall be in the form of a certificate.\n(3) The Ontario Fuel Board shall have and may exercise jurisdiction and power necessary for the purposes of this section and to grant or refuse to grant any certificate of public convenience and necessity, but no such certificate shall be granted or refused until after the Board has held a public hearing to deal with the matter upon application made to it therefor, and of which hearing such notice shall be given to such persons and municipalities as the Board may deem to be interested or affected and otherwise as the Board may direct.\n(4) With leave of a judge thereof, an appeal shall lie upon any question of law or fact to the Court of Appeal from any decision of the Ontario Fuel Board granting or refusing to grant a certificate under this section; provided application for leave to appeal is made within 15 days from the time when such decision is given. (5) The Ontario Fuel Board shall not issue any certificate under this section until after the expiration of 15 days from the time its decision to grant the same is given or in the event of an appeal from such decision until after the time when such appeal is determined or leave to appeal is refused.\n(6) Upon an appeal to the Court of Appeal its judgment thereon shall be final and not subject to further appeal therefrom, and the Ontario Fuel Board shall, if and as may be necessary, amend or vary its decision to conform to such judgment and grant or refuse to grant a certificate under this section accordingly.\nAn order was made by a judge of the Court of Appeal giving the respondent \u201cleave to appeal to the Court of Appeal from the decision of the Ontario Fuel Board dated the 19th day of October, 1954 on the grounds set out in the motion for leave to appeal and on such further or other grounds as may be set out in the notice of appeal herein\u201d. Pursuant thereto a notice of appeal was given, asking for a reversal of the Board\u2019s order on the following grounds:\n(1) The decision is wrong in law, and is against the evidence and the weight of evidence.\n(2) The Board erred in holding on the evidence that there was any scarcity or potential scarcity of natural gas in this Province.\n(3) The Board erred in taking into consideration, as affecting public convenience and necessity, the potential loss of revenue to the respondent, and in any event there was no evidence on which the Board could hold that the revenue derived from the appellant or its parent Company would, or could, affect the general rate structure of the respondent.\n(4) The findings of the Board as to natural gas scarcity and as to the effect of the application on the rate structure of the respondent are inconsistent.\n(5) The Board should have found on the evidence that \u201cpublic convenience and necessity\u201d required the approval by the Board of the application.\n(6) Upon such further and other grounds as may appear from the evidence and the reasons of the Board and as counsel may advise and this Court may permit.\nThe Court of Appeal apparently considered that it had power to substitute its opinion for that of the Board, treating the question of public convenience and necessity as a question of fact. I am unable to agree with that view. While the Board had been newly formed and we were told that the respondent\u2019s application to it was the first to be heard since its creation, the Board was the successor, in many respects, to the jurisdiction formerly exercised by the referee. Its members would be in a position to exercise their judgment, in view of their general knowledge, and, while provision is made for an appeal from its decision, it is, in the wording of the relevant statutory enactment, \u201cupon any question of law or fact\u201d. The provision that the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment should be final and not subject to further appeal could not, of course, affect the jurisdiction of this Court to grant leave to appeal from its decision. The Court of Appeal was confined to such particular questions of law or fact as might be set out in the order of the judge of the Court of Appeal, as required by subs. (4) of s. 8 of The Municipal Franchises Act. It is not merely a matter of procedure; it goes to the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal, and that jurisdiction does not include the substitution of that Court\u2019s views as to public convenience and necessity for those of the Board, but is restricted to the determination of those questions of law or fact which have been particularized by the order of the judge of that Court.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the Court of Appeal set aside. Since the order of the Board was made over two years ago, it is preferable that that order be restored, leaving it to the respondent, if so advised, to make a new application. The appellant is entitled to its costs of the appeals to the Court of Appeal and to this Court.\nThe judgment of Rand and Kellock JJ. was delivered by\nRAND J.:\u2014The Ontario Fuel Board, acting under the authority of The Municipal Franchises Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 249, as amended by 3 Elizabeth II (1954), c. 60, s. 3, refused an application by the Town of Wallaceburg for the approval of a by-law authorizing construction by the respondent of a pipeline to convey gas through the streets of the town on the ground that public convenience and necessity for the work were not shown.\nAn appeal from that refusal was taken to the Court of Appeal under s. 8(4) of The Municipal Franchises Act, which allows an appeal, with leave of a judge of the Court, on any question of law or fact. The Court in dealing with the matter entered upon a re-examination of the facts and considerations before the Board, and a reassessment of their weight and value, and came to the opinion that a case of public convenience and necessity had been made out. The judgment accordingly directed the Board to issue the certificate.\nWhat the Court did was to exercise an administrative jurisdiction and to substitute its judgment on the application for that of the Board. In this I think it exceeded its powers. We were referred to no precise or material issue in the appeal on any question of fact or law on which the Court was asked to or did make a finding or a ruling. It was argued, and it seems to have been the view of the Court, that the determination of public convenience and necessity was itself a question of fact, but with that I am unable to agree: it is not an objective existence to be ascertained; the determination is the formulation of an opinion, in this case, the opinion of the Board and of the Board only. In the notice of appeal references to certain findings were made, but what the present respondent sought and obtained was a judgment on the entire controversy. That remedy was, in my opinion, misconceived and the judgment likewise.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and restore the order of the Board with costs in this Court and in the Court of Appeal.\nLOCKE J. (dissenting):\u2014Sydenham Gas and Petroleum Company Limited was incorporated in Ontario by letters patent issued under the provisions of The Companies Act of that Province in the year 1952. Among its declared objects was the transportation of natural gas. The company is a wholly\u2011owned subsidiary of Dominion Glass Company Limited which owns and operates very extensive works for the manufacture of glass and glass products in the town of Wallaceburg, Ontario. It is the principal industry in that place, furnishing employment to a substantial proportion of the inhabitants, and its continued and successful operation is a matter of moment to the community.\nNatural gas is the most desirable fuel for glass manufacture in Ontario and for several years the Dominion Glass company carried on an extensive search in an endeavour to locate natural gas in the portion of Ontario adjacent to its factories. This proved unsuccessful. The natural gas required for its operations meanwhile was purchased by it from the appellant, a company having available supplies and a franchise from the Town entitling it to supply this commodity to the inhabitants of Wallaceburg. This franchise had been granted by a by-law of the Town approved by the ratepayers. It is to be noted that the franchise or right granted was not exclusive and thus did not preclude the granting of similar rights to others.\nOn May 14, 1954, the Sydenham company entered into a contract with Imperial Oil Limited, which held oil and gas leases in the township of Sombra, for the supply from the Bickford Pool of a minimum of 237,250 thousand cubic feet of natural gas yearly until December 31, 1966, or until 12,800,000 m.c.f. of gas had been delivered. The purpose of the company in entering into the contract was to supply the needed natural gas for the operations of the Dominion Glass company, and for that purpose alone. The Sydenham company did not propose to enter into the business of either selling to or transporting natural gas for persons or corporations other than what may be described as its parent company.\nThe Bickford Pool is situate some 10 miles from Wallaceburg and, in order to transport the gas to the Dominion Glass company plant, it was necessary to lay pipelines through two intervening municipalities and through part of the town of Wallaceburg. The necessary by\u2011laws permitting the construction of the pipeline through the townships of Sombra and Chatham were duly passed by the councils of these municipal bodies and on July 6, 1954, the council of the town of Wallaceburg passed a by-law granting to the Sydenham company:\na franchise within the meaning of The Municipal Franchises Act, to enter upon the highways within the corporate limits of the Town of Wallaceburg, for the purpose of laying down, maintaining and using pipes and other necessary works for the transmission of natural gas on, in, under, along and across any such highway, for the purpose of conveying natural gas to the lands of Dominion Glass Company Limited situate within the said Town of Wallaceburg, upon and subject to the conditions, hereinafter mentioned or contained.\nBy s. 3 of The Municipal Franchises Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 249, it is provided, inter alia, that a municipal corporation shall not grant to any person the right to construct or operate any public utility in the municipality or to supply to the corporation or to the inhabitants of the municipality or any of them, gas, steam or electric light, heat or power, unless a by-law setting forth the terms and conditions upon which and the period for which such right is to be granted has been assented to by the municipal electors.\nSection 8 provided that no person should, without the approval of the Lieutenant-Governor in council, construct any works to supply or supply\n(a) natural gas in any municipality in which such person was not on the 1st day of April, 1933, supplying gas\nand that no approval should be given under the section unless the Ontario Municipal Board should certify in writing to the Lieutenant-Governor that public convenience and necessity appeared to require that such approval be given.\nThe Municipal Franchises Act was amended by c. 60 of the statutes of 1954. Subsections 1 and 2 of s. 8 which contained the provisions last above referred to were repealed and the following was substituted:\n(1) Notwithstanding anything in this or in any other general or special Act, no person shall construct any works to supply or supply,\n(a) natural gas in any municipality in which such person was not onthe 1st day of April, 1933, supplying gas; or\n(b) gas in any municipality in which such person was not on the 1st day of April, 1933, supplying gas and in which gas was then being supplied,\nwithout the approval of the Ontario Fuel Board and such approval shall not be given unless public convenience and necessity appear to require that such approval be given.\n(2) The approval of the Ontario Fuel Board shall be in the form of a certificate.\nBy the amendment, s. 9 was added which, so far as relevant to the issue, reads as follows:\n(2) No by-law granting,\n(a) the right to construct or operate works for the distribution of natural gas;\n(b) the right to supply natural gas to a municipal corporation or to the inhabitants of a municipality;\n(c) the right to extend or add to the works mentioned in clause a or the services mentioned in clause b;\n(d) a renewal of or an extension of the term of any right mentioned in clause a or b, shall be submitted to the municipal electors for their assent unless the terms and conditions upon which and the period for which such right is to be granted, renewed or extended have first been approved by the Ontario Fuel Board.\nThe Ontario Fuel Board referred to in these amendments was constituted by c. 63 of the statutes of 1954 which repealed, inter alia, The Natural Gas Conservation Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 251, and the Acts which amended that statute. The Board thus constituted under the new statute was given broad powers which included those given to the natural gas referee under the repealed statute.\nThe application made by the Sydenham company to the Ontario Fuel Board if made in writing does not appear in the printed record but, according to the order of J.K. Mackay J.A. granting leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal, it was for approval of the by-law above referred to, \u201cbeing a by-law authorizing the transportation and distribution of natural gas to the lands of Dominion Glass Company Limited\u201d. While approval was apparently also asked for the by-laws of the townships of Sombra and Chatham, that was decided to be unnecessary since there was to be no distribution of gas within their boundaries and it is unnecessary to further refer to these matters.\nWhile the Sydenham company did not, in the terms of s. 3 of The Municipal Franchises Act as amended, propose to supply natural gas to \u201ca municipal corporation or to the inhabitants of a municipality\u201d, but merely to transport gas to the parent company the Dominion Glass company, the application was dealt with not merely as involving permission to the Sydenham company to lay its gas\u2011mains under the streets of Wallaceburg in order to obtain access to the glass company\u2019s premises, but also involving the question as to whether, in view of the fact that the Union Gas company was then supplying the Dominion Glass company with natural gas at a price theretofore approved as reasonable by the natural gas referee under the provisions of The Natural Gas Conservation Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 49, public convenience and necessity appeared to require that the by-law be approved.\nThe word \u201cgas\u201d as defined in s. 1(b) of The Municipal Franchises Act includes natural gas and, as s. 3 requires the approval of the electors to a by-law granting permission to any person to supply gas to \u201cthe inhabitants of a municipality or any of them\u201d, it was necessary that the by-law should be submitted to them. By virtue of subs. 2(a) of s. 9 the approval of the Ontario Fuel Board was required. This procedure, it may be noted, would have been necessary if the Dominion Glass company had proposed to lay the pipeline itself from the Bickford Pool rather than to have that done by its wholly-owned subsidiary.\nSubsection 2(b) of s. 9 deals with a quite different right, being the right to supply natural gas to a municipal corporation \u201cor to the inhabitants of a municipality\u201d. The words \u201cor any of them\u201d which appear after the word \u201cinhabitants\u201d in s. 3 were omitted in s. 9(2) (b). I have no doubt that this was by design and not by accident. Where a corporation proposes to exercise a franchise to operate a public utility selling gas to a municipal corporation or to a community generally, many matters would require consideration by the Fuel Board which would be quite irrelevant in deciding upon an application under subs. 2(a). The reasons delivered by the Fuel Board in refusing its approval indicate, in my opinion, that the members of that body did not appreciate this distinction. The application was for the approval of the by-law and all that was proposed by it was that the Sydenham company might lay its pipelines under certain of the streets of the town to connect with the premises of the glass company. A passage in the reasons delivered reads:\nIn effect, the granting of this application would be to create the situation of two distributing companies in the same area\u2026\nBut this, in the sense that the term \u201cdistributing company\u201d was used, was, with respect, inaccurate. The term would have been apt had the Sydenham company\u2019s application been made under subs. 2(b) of s. 9 to approve a by-law authorizing the supply of gas to the municipal corporation or to its inhabitants generally. The by-law in question granted no such rights.\nThe Board is an administrative body and wide powers are vested in it by the statute of 1954 by which it was established. These include power to control and regulate drilling for, distributing and using natural gas for industrial purposes and to make regulations subject to the approval of the Lieutenant-Governor in council, inter alia, as to the manner in which pipelines for the transmission of gas may be laid, for the conservation of natural gas and oil and for the issue of permits for the use of natural gas for industrial purposes. The regulations made by the Board pursuant to these powers include a provision that natural gas shall be supplied to consumers in a defined order of precedence and, in the order thus prescribed, gas required for residential purposes and the heating of dwellings and commercial buildings takes precedence over that required for industrial purposes.\nThere is nothing in the record to suggest that any order of the Board or of the Minister made under The Natural Gas Conservation Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 251, restricted in any way the purchase by the Sydenham company of gas from the Bickford Pool and its transmission to Wallaceburg for industrial use by the plant of the Dominion Glass company, or that there was any shortage of natural gas in Ontario, or that the gas from this pool was required for any preferred purpose of the nature referred to in the regulations.\nNo considerations of this nature affected the determination by the Board of the application in question. There was on the other hand, as pointed out in the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal, ample evidence that obtaining a supply of natural gas for its operations at approximately half the rate the Dominion Glass company now pays to the appellant company was a matter of great importance in ensuring the continued operation of all the manufacturing activities of that company and that these operations provide employment to a substantial proportion of the inhabitants of the town of Wallaceburg.\nSubsection 4 of s. 8 of The Municipal Franchises Act, as amended, provides that an appeal shall lie to the Court of Appeal from any decision of the Ontario Fuel Board granting or refusing to grant a certificate under the section upon any question of law or fact. These provisions are made applicable to applications for approval under s. 9 by subs. 4 of that section. The order of Mr. Justice Mackay granted leave to the Sydenham company to appeal upon inter alia the grounds that the decision was wrong in law, that it was contrary to the evidence and that public convenience and necessity required the approval of the application. I respectfully agree with the learned Chief Justice who delivered the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal allowing the appeal and directing that the required certificate should issue, that the latter question is one of fact. If there were doubt as to the meaning to be assigned to a the expression \u201cpublic convenience and necessity\u2019\u2019 in the statute, and I think there is none, the question as to its interpretation would be one of law which the legislation would also require the Court to determine.\nThe fact that the main functions of the Ontario Fuel Board are administrative cannot limit the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal to determine a question such as this. Like other boards constituted by various statutes, both Dominion and Provincial, in discharging its functions the Fuel Board must come to its conclusions upon its view of the facts and of the law affecting the matters before it. The Legislature has seen fit to impose upon the Court of Appeal the duty of deciding questions brought before it of either nature.\nIn this matter the Board, apparently considering that the by-law was of the nature referred to in subs. 2(b) of s. 9, decided that public convenience and necessity did not require it to give its approval. The principal ground assigned for doing so was the Board\u2019s opinion that the appellant was one of the public utility distributing companies in Ontario which had built up their systems under a fixed rate structure \u201con the basis that they had and would continue to have a monopoly in their respective franchise areas\u201d. This was followed by the statement that the result of granting the application would be that there would be two distributing companies in the same area. As to the argument that the Dominion Glass company must effect economies in its operations to enable it to continue the manufacture of certain of its lines of glassware in Wallaceburg, the Board expressed the opinion that it ought to pursue some other course in order to obtain relief.\nTo give effect to this reasoning, as pointed out by the learned Chief Justice of Ontario, would be to give the franchise of the appellant the effect of being exclusive in the area, whereas in fact and in law the respondent had no such exclusive right and a further effect would be to deprive the municipality of the power to permit another public utility to supply industrial natural gas in the area, notwithstanding the local necessity for it. As I have pointed out, the Dominion Glass company had made extensive efforts to locate natural gas by drilling and, had those efforts proven successful, to apply the principle acted upon by the Board would have prevented the use of the gas so found if it was in a location which would require the laying of pipes under the streets of Wallaceburg in order to utilize it.\nThe distinction between by-laws granting rights of the nature referred to under subss. 2(a) and 2(b) of s. 9 is not referred to in the reasons for judgment, but all of the reasons advanced for the unanimous conclusion of the Court that public convenience and necessity required the approval of the Board to be given to the by-law apply with even greater force to an application under subs. 2(a).\nI respectfully agree with the conclusion reached by the Court of Appeal and with the reasons assigned for those conclusions by the learned Chief Justice of Ontario and I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs, LOCKE J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: McNevin, Gee & O\u2019Connor, Chatham.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Joseph Sedgwick, Toronto.\n[1] [1955] O.W.N. 781, [1955] 4 D.L.R. 41.\n",

By an amendment passed after the order of reference the Legislature declared that the purpose and intent of the Act were \"to provide for the con\u00adtrol and regulation in any or all respects of the marketing within the Province of farm products including the prohibition of such marketing in whole or in part\". The principal attack on the legislation was based upon the contention that it was an infringement of the power of the Parliament of Canada in relation to the regulation of trade and com\u00admerce. It was also argued that the licensing provisions involved indirect taxation and that the legislation conflicted with parts of the Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 31, the Criminal Code, 1953-54 ('Can.), c. 51, the Agricultural Products Marketing Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 6, and the Live Stock and Live Stock Products Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 167.\nThe questions were answered by the Court as follows:\nSection 3(1) (l), as re-enacted in 1955, empowers the Farm Products Marketing Board to authorize a marketing agency \"to conduct a pool or pools for the distribution of all moneys received from the sale of the regulated product and [require] any such marketing agency, after deducting all necessary and proper disbursements and expenses, to distribute the proceeds of sale in such manner that each person receives a share of the total proceeds in relation to the amount, variety, size, grade and class of the regulated product delivered by him\".\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Rand J.: On the assumption that the Act applies only to intraprovincial transactions as defined in the reasons, this clause is not ultra vires.\nPer Taschereau, Fauteux and Abbott JJ.: The clause is intra vires.\nPer Locke and Nolan JJ.: If the pool is limited to products marketed for use within the Province and excludes products marketed or purchased for export either in their natural state or after treatment the clause is intra vires.\nPer Cartwright J.: The clause is ultra vires, since it empowers the Board to authorize a marketing agency to make an equalization of returns to producers, taking from some a part of the price they have received and paying it to others who have obtained a less favourable price.\nRegulation 104 of C.R.O. 1950, as amended, purports to set up a \"scheme\" for the marketing of hogs for processing and providing for a local board and a committee in each of seven districts of the Province. Per Kerwin C.J., Taschereau, Rand, Locke, Fauteux, Abbott and Nolan JJ.: This regulation is intra vires.\nPer Cartwright J.: The regulation is invalid because it does not constitute a \"scheme\" within the meaning of the Act.\nRegulation 102\/1955 provides for compulsory licensing of all processors (i.e., persons who slaughter hogs or have hogs slaughtered for them) and shippers, and for the creation o4 a marketing agency through which all hogs must be marketed.\nPer Kerwin C.J.: Assuming that this regulation deals only with control of the sale of hogs for consumption within the Province, or to packing plants or other processors whose products will be consumed therein, the regulation is intra vires.\nPer Taschereau, Fauteux and Abbott JJ.: The regulation is intra vires.\nPer Rand J.: The licences provided for by this regulation are trade regulating licences and not for revenue purposes only, and since there is nothing in the regulation to restrict the ordinary meaning of its language it is in excess of the powers given to the Board by the statute and is therefore ultra vires.\nPer Locke and Nolan JJ.: The regulation is ultra vires except to the extent that it authorizes the control of the marketing of hogs sold for consumption within the Province or to =packing plants or other processors purchasing them for the manufacture of pork products within the Province. The provision for licensing is intra vires so long as the power is not used to prevent those desiring to purchase hogs or pork products for export.\nPer Cartwright J.: The regulation is invalid for the reason given under question 2.\nAn order of the marketing agency prescribes a \"service charge\" for each hog marketed under the scheme.\nPer Kerwin C.J., Taschereau, Rand, Locke, Fauteux, Abbott and Nolan JJ.: This order is intra vires.\nPer Cartwright J.: The order is invalid for the reason given under ques\u00adtion 2.\n5 and 6. Regulation 145\/54, dealing with the marketing of peaches, requires every grower to pay licence fees at a stated rate for each ton or fraction thereof of peaches delivered to a processor and requires the processor to deduct these licence fees and forward them to the local board. Regulation 126\/52 contains similar provisions in respect of the marketing of vegetables for processing.\nPer Kerwin C.J., Taschereau, Rand, Locke, Fauteux, Abbott and Nolan JJ.: These orders are intro vires.\nPer Cartwright J.: On the material before the Court it is impossible to determine the validity of these orders.\n7. A proposed amendment to the Act would empower the Board to author\u00adize a local board \"(i) to inquire into and determine the amount of surplus of a regulated product, (ii) to purchase or otherwise acquire the whole or such part of such surplus of a regulated product as the marketing agency may determine, (iii) to market any surplus of a regulated product so purchased or acquired, (iv) to require processors who receive the regulated product from producers to deduct from the moneys payable to the producer any licence fees payable by the producer 'to the local board and to remit such licence fees to the local board, (v) to use such licence fees to pay the expenses of the local board and the losses, if any, incurred in the marketing of the surplus of the regulated product and to set aside reserves against possible losses in marketing the surplus of the regulated product, and (vi) to use such licence fees to equalize or adjust returns received by pro\u00adducers of the regulated product\".\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Rand J.: This amendment as interpreted in the reasons is not ultra vires.\nPer Taschereau, Fauteux and Abbott JJ.: Clauses (i) to (iv) are intra vires but clause (v), except to the extent that it authorizes the use of licence fees to pay the expenses of the local board, and the whole of clause (vi), are ultra vires.\nPer Locke and Nolan JJ.: The amendment is intra vires except that that part of clause (v) which authorizes the imposition of licence fees to provide moneys to pay for the losses referred to and to set up reserves and for the purposes referred to in clause (vi), is ultra vires.\nPer Cartwright J.: Clauses (v) and (vi) are ultra vires but the other clauses are intra vires.\n8. Per curiam: The Board would not have power under the proposed amendment to authorize a local board to impose licence fees and to use those licence fees to equalize or adjust returns to the producers.\nREFERENCE under s. 55 of the Supreme Court Act.

After the argument the Court called for further argument and directed that notice be given by the Attorney-General for Ontario to all other parties represented on the original hearing and to the Attorneys-General of Quebec, Manitoba, British Columbia and Newfoundland. The direction of the Court was as follows:\nOn the assumption that the Act and the three schemes with the regula\u00adtions applicable to them extend to the marketing of all hogs, peaches and designated vegetables delivered to a processor in the province to be processed, the Court directs the following question to be argued on Monday, November 19, 1956:\nIs the regulation of trade so prescribed, controlling production, transporta\u00adtion and sale, including the designation of an exclusive selling agency and fixing the price, to the processor, of these products, within the authority of the Province in respect of such of them as are, in the usual course of production and trade, intended or destined to be or will be exported from the Province in interprovincial or foreign trade? Would the power of the Province extend to the control of the manufacture or processing? For example: liquor may be distilled in a Province solely for export; is the purchase, including the price to be paid therefor, of locally grown grain or other ingredients, within such Provincial regulation? Similarly in the case of wheat grown locally and sold to a miller within the Province whose market is both within and without the Province; of hogs sold to a packer for curing and intended in whole or in part for shipment without the Province; of pulpwood sold to pulp or paper manufacturers for similar disposal; of fish processed by canners for similar disposal; and many other products in the same category of processing and distribution. Can the holding of a licence or the payment of a licence fee by a processor of products for export be made a condition of the processing in the case of (a) a Dominion company, or (b) a Provincial company? Is there a jurisdictional difference between the manufacture of liquor from grain and the processing of hogs into pork, ham or bacon and the similar contrasting treatment of other products, in relation, for example, to the control of marketing and price to the manufacturer or processor? If a distinction is to be made, what is the test or principle to be applied?\nF. P. Varcoe, Q.C., and E. R. Olson, for the Attorney General of Canada.\nC. R. Magone, Q.C., and H. E.

Pepper, counsel appointed by the Court.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014This is a reference by His Excel\u00adlency the Governor General in Council as to the validity of one clause of one section of The Farm Products Marketing Act of the Province of Ontario, R.S.O. 1950, c. 131, of cer\u00adtain regulations made thereunder, of an order of The Ontario Hog Producers' Marketing Board, of a proposed amendment to the Act, and of a suggested authorization by the Farm Products Marketing Board if that amendment be held to be intra vires. On such a reference one cannot envisage all possible circumstances which might arise and it must also be taken that it is established that it is not to be presumed that a Provincial Legislature intended to exceed its legislative jurisdiction under the British North America Act, although the Court may, on what it considers the proper construction of a given enactment, determine that the Legislature has gone beyond its authority.\nSubsequent to the date of the order of reference, the Act was amended by c. 20 of the statutes of 1956, which came into force the day it received Royal Assent, s. 1 of which reads as follows:\n1. The Farm Products Marketing Act is amended by adding thereto the following section:\n1a. The purpose and intent of this Act is to provide for the control and regulation in any or all respects of the marketing within the Province of farm products including the prohibition of such mar\u00adketing in whole or in part.\nWithout entering into a discussion as to what is a declara\u00adtory law, since the term may have different connotations depending upon the matter under review, it is arguable that, for present purposes, this amendment should be read as part of The Farm Products Marketing Act, but, in any event, the first question submitted to us directs us to assume that that Act as amended down to the date of the reference applies only in the case of \"intra-provincial transactions\". This term means \"existing or occurring within a province\"; see Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, includ\u00ading \"intraparochial\" as an example under the word \"intra\". As will appear later, the word \"marketing\" is defined in the Act, but, in accordance with what has already been stated, I take it as being confined to marketing within the Province.\nQuestion 1 is as follows :\n1. Assuming that the said Act applies only in the case of intraprovincial transactions, is clause (l) of subsection 1 of section 3 of The Farm Products Marketing Act, R.S.O. 1950 chapter 131 as amended by Ontario Statutes 1951, chapter 25, 1953, chapter 36, 1954, chapter 29, 1955, chapter 21, ultra vires the Ontario Legislature?\nClause (l) of subs. (1) of s. 3 referred to, as re-enacted by 1955, c. 21, s. 2, provides :\n3. (1) The Board may, \u2026\n(l) authorize any marketing agency appointed under a scheme to conduct a pool or pools for the distribution of all moneys received from the sale of the regulated product and requiring any such marketing agency, after deducting all necessary and proper dis\u00adbursements and expenses, to distribute the proceeds of sale in such manner that each person receives a share of the total proceeds in relation to the amount, variety, size, grade and class of the regulated product delivered by him and to make an initial payment on delivery of the product and subsequent payments until the total net proceeds are distributed.\nFor a proper understanding of the terms used in this clause and of the provisions of the Act it is necessary to refer to what is proposed by the latter.\nThe Board is the Farm Products Marketing Board and \" 'farm products' includes animals, meats, eggs, poultry, wool, dairy products, grains, seeds, fruit, fruit products, vegetables, vegetable products, maple products, honey, tobacco and such articles of food or drink manufactured or derived in whole or in part from any such product and such other natural products of agriculture as may be designated by the regulations\" (s. 1(b) ). \" 'Regulated product' means a farm product in respect of which a scheme is in force\" (s. 1(g)). Provision is made for the formulation of a scheme for the marketing or regulating of any farm product upon the petition of at least 10 per cent. of all producers engaged in the production of the farm product in Ontario, or in that part thereof to which the proposed scheme is to apply. \" \"'Marketing' means buying, selling and offering for sale and includes advertising, assembling, financing, packing and shipping for sale or storage and transporting in any manner by any person, and 'market' and 'marketed' have corre\u00adsponding meanings\" (s. 1(e), as re-enacted by 1955, c. 21, s. 1). The scheme may provide for a \"marketing agency\" designated by the Board in its regulations. Once the scheme is approved by the Board the latter's regulations will apply according to the farm products dealt with thereby.\nIt seems plain that the Province may regulate a transaction of sale and purchase in Ontario between a resident of the Province and one who resides outside its limits; that is, if an individual in Quebec comes to Ontario and there buys a hog, or vegetables, or peaches, the mere fact that he has the intention to take them from Ontario to Quebec does not deprive the Legislature of its power to regulate the transaction, as is evidenced by such enactments as The Sale of Goods Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 345. That is a matter of the regulation of contracts and not of trade as trade and in that respect the intention of the purchaser is immaterial. However, if the hog be sold to a packing plant or the vegetables or peaches to a cannery, the products of those establish\u00adments in the course of trade may be dealt with by the Legis\u00adlature or by Parliament depending, on the one hand, upon whether all the products are sold or intended for sale within the Province or, on the other, whether some of them are sold or intended for sale beyond Provincial limits. It is, I think, impossible to fix any minimum proportion of such last-mentioned sales or intended sales as determining the jurisdiction of Parliament. This applies to the sale by the original owner. Once a statute aims at \"regulation of trade in matters of inter-provincial concern\" (The Citizens Insur\u00adance Company of Canada v. Parsons; The Queen Insurance Company v. Parsons[1]), it is beyond the competence of a Provincial Legislature. The ambit of head 2 of s. 91 of the British North America Act, \"The Regulation of Trade and Commerce\" has been considerably enlarged by decisions of the Judicial 'Committee and expressions used in some of its earlier judgments must be read in the light of its later pronouncements, as is pointed out by Sir Lyman Duff in Re Alberta Statutes[2]. In fact, his judgment in Re The Natural Products Marketing Act, 1934[3], which is justly considered as the locus classicus, must be read in conjunc\u00adtion with and subject to his remarks in the later case. The concept of trade and commerce, the regulation of which is confided to Parliament, is entirely separate and distinct from the regulation of mere sale and purchase agreements. Once an article enters into the flow of interprovincial or external trade, the subject-matter and all its attendant cir\u00adcumstances cease to be a mere matter of local concern. No change has taken place in the theory underlying the con\u00adstruction of the British North America Act that what is not within the legislative jurisdiction of Parliament must be within that of the Provincial Legislatures. This, of course, still leaves the question as to how far either may proceed, and, as Lord Atkin pointed out in the Natural Products Marketing Act case, supra, at p. 389, neither party may leave its own sphere and encroach upon that of another.\nMr. Robinette suggested that there was an inconsistency between the judgment of Mr. Justice Duff in Lawson v. Interior Tree Fruit and Vegetable Committee of Direction[4], and his judgment in The King v. Eastern Terminal Elevator Company[5]. However, all that was decided in the latter case was that Parliament had exceeded its jurisdiction while in the former it was held that the British Columbia statute under review was ultra vires.\nIt was contended by Mr. Pepper that the Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 314, and ss. 411 and 412 of the Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, and the Agri\u00adcultural Prices Support Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 3, are relevant and prevent the Ontario Legislature from enacting clause (l) of subs. (1) of s. 3 of The Farm Products Market\u00ading Act and therefore the administrative agencies provided for by that Act, from operating. The point is determined against that contention as to the Combines Investigation Act by the decision of this Court in Ontario Boys' Wear Limited et al. v. The Advisory Committee et al.[6]. With respect to that Act and also to the sections of the Criminal Code referred to, it cannot be said that any scheme otherwise within the authority of the Legislature is against the public interest when the Legislature is seized of the power and, indeed, the obligation to take care of that interest in the Province. The Agricultural Prices Support Act and in fact all Acts of Canada of a similar nature contain merely provisions for the assistance of agriculture. A final argu\u00adment was advanced to the effect that the legislation con\u00adflicted with s. 25 of the Live Stock and Live Stock Products Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 167, which reads:\n25. Notwithstanding anything in this Part, any farmer or drover may sell his own live stock at a stockyard on his own account.\nThis is merely a provision in ease of the other sections of that particular Act.\nIn view of the wording of question 1, I take clause (l) of subs. (1) of s. 3 of The Farm Products Marketing Act as being a successful endeavour on the part of the Ontario Legislature to fulfil its part while still keeping within the ambit of its powers. On the assumption directed to be made and reading the clause so as not to apply to trans-actions which I have indicated would be of a class beyond the powers of the Legislature, my answer to the first ques\u00adtion is \"No\".\nQuestion 2 asks whether a certain regulation as amended respecting the marketing of hogs is ultra vires the Lieutenant-Governor in Council. The order in council was made in pursuance of the statute and, as the wording may be construed as contemplating only local trade, the objec\u00adtion, in view of what has already been stated, is without foundation. Nor can I agree (a) that the scheme does not contain substantive terms and therefore is really not a scheme at all; (b) that it is necessary that there should be prior approval by the producers.\nI assume that the regulation of the Farm Products Mar\u00adketing Board referred to in question 3 deals only with the control of the sale of hogs for consumption within the Province, or to packing plants or other processors whose prod\u00aducts will be consumed therein. The provision for licensing is not ultra vires and a company incorporated by letters patent under the Companies Act of Canada, with power to carry on the business of a packing plant throughout the nation, is bound to comply with a general licensing law.\nMy answer to question 4 is that the order of The Ontario Hog Producers' Marketing Board fixing the service charges to be imposed by the marketing agency is not ultra vires the Board, as the matter is covered by the decision of the Privy Council in Shannon et al. v. Lower Mainland Dairy Prod\u00aducts Board[7]). For the same reason, I think similar answers must be given to questions 5 and 6, the first relating to the marketing of peaches for processing and the latter to the marketing of vegetables for processing.\nAs to questions 7 and 8, I agree with the reasons of my brother Rand.\nMy answers to the questions are as follows:\nQuestion 1: On the assumption that the Act is restricted to intraprovincial transactions as defined in these reasons, the answer is No.\nQuestion 2: No.\nQuestion 3: Assuming that the Regulation deals only with the control of the sale of hogs for consumption within the Province, or to packing plants or other processors whose products will be consumed therein, the answer is No.\nQuestion 4: No.\nQuestion 5: No.\nQuestion 6: No.\nQuestion 7: On the interpretation given to the proposed amendment the answer is No.\nQuestion 8: No.\nTASCHEREAU J. agrees in the answers of Fauteux and Abbott JJ.\nRAND J.:\u2014This reference raises questions going to the scope of Provincial authority over trade. They arise out of The Farm Products Marketing Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 131, as amended, which deals comprehensively with the matter connoted by its name and out of certain schemes formed under it. Its object is to accord primary producers of farm products the advantages of various degrees of controlled marketing, for which it provides provincial and local machinery.\nGeneral jurisdiction over its administration is exercised by the Farm Products Marketing Board; regulation is by way of schemes for the marketing of any product; under a scheme, a local board, district committees and county groups are organized; and the marketing may be carried out exclusively by an agency designated by the Board upon the recommendation of the local board.\nThe questions put, which assume the Act to be limited in application to local trade, call for answers which make it necessary to examine and define the scope of local trade to the extent of the regulation provided. The enquiry must take into account regulatory power over acts and transactions which while objectively appearing to be consum\u00admated within the Province may involve or possess an interest of interprovincial or foreign trade, which for con\u00advenience I shall refer to as external trade.\nThe products embraced include\nanimals, meats, eggs, poultry, wool, dairy products, grains, seeds, fruit, fruit products, vegetables, vegetable products ... and ... articles of food or drink manufactured or derived in whole or in part from any such product.\n\"Marketing\" means buying, selling, assembling, packing, shipping for sale or storage and transporting in any manner by any person. The marketing board may establish negotiating agencies which may adopt or determine by agreement minimum prices and other features of marketing, and prohibit the marketing of any class, variety, grade or size of a product. It may require a licence to be taken out by every person for producing, marketing or processing a product with fees payable at various times and in different amounts. The Board may authorize an agency to control the times and places for marketing, the quantity, grade, class and price of products to be marketed, and to exercise other powers conferred by the statute on the Board.\nAlthough not specifically mentioned in s. 92 of the British North America Act, there is admittedly a field of trade within provincial power, and the head or heads of s. 92 from which it is to be deduced will be considered later. The power is a subtraction from the scope of the language con\u00adferring on the Dominion by head 2 of s. 91 exclusive author\u00adity to make laws in relation to the regulation of trade and commerce, and was derived under an interpretation of the Act which was found necessary\nin order to preserve from serious curtailment, if not from virtual extinc\u00adtion, the degree of autonomy which, as appears from the scheme of the Act as a whole, the provinces were intended to possess\n(per Duff J. in Lawson v. Interior Tree, Fruit and Vege\u00adtable Committee of Direction[8]. In examining the legislation for the purpose mentioned we should bear in mind Lord Atkin's admonition in Attorney-General for British Columbia v. Attorney-General for Canada et al.[9], that\nthe legislation will have to be carefully framed, and will not be achieved by either party leaving its own sphere and encroaching upon that of the other.\nThe definitive statement of the scope of Dominion and Provincial jurisdiction was made by Duff C.J. in Re The Natural Products Marketing Act, 1934[10]. The regulation of particular trades confined to the Province lies exclusively with the Legislature subject, it may be, to Dominion general regulation affecting all trade, and to such incidental intrusion by the Dominion as may be necessary to prevent the defeat of Dominion regulation; interprovincial and foreign trade are correspondingly the exclusive concern of Parliament. That statement is to be read with the judg\u00adment of this Court in The King v. Eastern Terminal Eleva\u00adtor Company[11], approved by the Judicial Committee in Attorney-General for British Columbia v. Attorney-General for Canada, supra, at p. 387, to the effect that Dominion regulation cannot embrace local trade merely because in undifferentiated subject-matter the external interest is dominant. But neither the original statement nor its approval furnishes a clear guide to the demarcation of the two classes when we approach as here the origination, the first stages of trade, including certain aspects of manufac\u00adture and production.\nThat demarcation must observe this rule, that if in a trade activity, including manufacture or production, there is involved a matter of extraprovincial interest or concern its regulation thereafter in the aspect of trade is by that fact put beyond Provincial power. This is exemplified in Lawson v. Interior Tree Fruit and Vegetable Committee of Direction, supra, where the Province purported to regulate the time and quantity of shipment, the shippers, the price and the transportation of fruit and vegetables in both unsegregated and segregated local and interprovincial trade movements.\nA producer is entitled to dispose of his products beyond the Province without reference to a provincial marketing agency or price, shipping or other trade regulation ; and an outside purchaser is entitled with equal freedom to purchase and export. Processing is one of a number of trade services that may be given products in the course of reach\u00ading the consumer: milling (as of grain or lumber), sorting, packing, slaughtering, dressing, storing, transporting, etc. The producer or purchaser may desire to process the prod\u00aduct either within or beyond the Province and if he engages for that with a local undertaking (using that expression in a non-technical sense), such as a packing plant\u2014and it would apply to any sort of servicing\u2014he takes that service as he finds it but free from such Provincial impositions as are strictly trade regulations such as prices or the specifica\u00adtion of standards, which could no more be imposed than Provincial trade marks. Regulation of that nature could directly nullify external trade vital to the economy of the country. Trade arrangements reaching the dimensions of world agreements are now a commonplace; interprovincial trade, in which the Dominion is a single market, is of similar importance, and equally vital to the economic func\u00adtioning of the country as a whole. The Dominion power implies responsibility for promoting and maintaining the vigour and growth of trade beyond Provincial confines, and the discharge of this duty must remain unembarrassed by local trade impediments. If the processing is restricted to external trade, it becomes an instrumentality of that trade and its single control as to prices, movements, standards, etc., by the Dominion follows: Re The Industrial Relations and Disputes Investigation Act[12]. The licensing of processing plants by the Province as a trade regulation is thus limited to their operations in local trade. Likewise the licensing of shippers, whether producers or purchasers, and the fixing of the terms and conditions of shipment, including prices, as trade regulation, where the goods are destined beyond the Province, would be beyond Provincial power.\nLocal trade has in some cases been classed as a matter of property and civil rights and related to head 13 of s. 92, and the propriety of that allocation was questioned. The pro\u00adduction and exchange of goods as an economic activity does not take place by virtue of positive law or civil right; it is assumed as part of the residual free activity of men upon or around which law is imposed. It has an identity of its own recognized by head 2 of s. 91. I cannot agree that its regulation under that head was intended as a species of matter under head 13 from which by the language of s. 91 it has been withdrawn. It happened that in The Citizens Insurance Company of Canada v. Parsons; The Queen Insurance Company v. Parsons[13], assuming insurance to be a trade, the commodity being dealt in was the making of contracts, and their relation to head 13 seemed obvious. But the true conception of trade (in contradistinction to the static nature of rights, civil or property) is that of a dynamic, the creation and flow of goods from production to consumption or utilization, as an individualized activity.\nThe conclusive answer to the question is furnished by a consideration of s. 94 which provides for the uniformity in Ontario, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia of \"all or any of the laws relative to property and civil rights\". It is, I think, quite impossible to include within this provision regulation of local trades; that appears to be one feature of the internal economy of each Province in which no such uniformity could ever be expected. What the language is directed to are laws relating to civil status and capacity, contracts, torts and real and personal property in the com\u00admon law Provinces, jural constructs springing from the same roots, already more or less uniform, and lending themselves to more or less permanence. In some degree uni\u00adformity has been achieved by individual Provincial action in such legislation, for instance, as that of contributory negligence.\nHead 16 contains what may be called the residuary power of the Province: Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for the Dominion et al.[14], and it is within that residue that the autonomy of the Province in local matters, so far as it might be affected by trade regulation, is to be preserved. As was recognized in the Parsons case, supra, this points up the underlying division of the matters of legislation into those which are primarily of national and those of local import. But this is not intended to derogate from regulation as well as taxation of local trade through licence under head 9 of s. 92, nor from its support under head 13.\nIt is important to keep in mind, as already observed, that the broad language of head 2 of s. 91 has been curtailed not by any express language of the statute but as a necessary implication of the fundamental division of powers effected by it. The interpretation of this head has undergone a transformation. When it was first considered by this Court in Severn v. The Queen[15] and The City of Fredericton v. The Queen[16], the majority views did not envisage the limitation now established; that was introduced by the judgment in the Parsons case, supra. The nadir of its scope was reached in what seemed its restriction to a function ancillary to other Dominion powers; but that view has been irretrievably scotched.\nThe powers of this Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction are no less in scope than those formerly exercised in rela\u00adtion to Canada by the Judicial Committee. From time to time the Committee has modified the language used by it in the attribution of legislation to the various heads of ss. 91 and 92, and in its general interpretative formulations, and that incident of judicial power must, now, in the same manner and with the same authority, wherever deemed necessary, be exercised in revising or restating those formu\u00adlations that have come down to us. This is a function inseparable from constitutional decision. It involves no departure from the basic principles of jurisdictional dis\u00adtribution; it is rather a refinement of interpretation in application to the particularized and evolving features and aspects of matters which the intensive and extensive expan\u00adsion of the life of the country inevitably presents.\nThe reaches of trade may extend to aspects of manufac\u00adture. In Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for the Dominion et al., supra, the Judicial Committee dealt with the question whether the Province could prohibit the manufacture within the Province of intoxicating liquor, to which the answer was given that, in the absence of conflict\u00ading legislation of Parliament, there would be jurisdiction to that effect if it were shown that the manufacture was carried on under such circumstances and conditions as to make its prohibition a merely local matter in the Province. This involves a limitation of the power of the Province to interdict, as a trade matter, the manufacture or production of articles destined for external trade. Admittedly, however, local regulation may affect that trade: wages, workmen's compensation, insurance, taxes and other items that furnish what may be called the local conditions underlying economic activity leading to trade.\nThe federal character of our constitution places limits on legislative acts in relation to matters which as an entirety span, so to speak, the boundary between the two jurisdic\u00adtions. In The King v. Eastern Terminal Elevator Com\u00adpany, supra, for example, there was a common storage of grain destined both to local and external trade. The situa\u00adtion in City of Montreal v. Montreal Street Railway[17] was equally striking: there Parliament was held incapable of imposing through rates over a local railway on traffic passing between points on that line and points on a con\u00adnecting Dominion railway; the only regulation open was declared to be parallel action by Legislature and Parlia\u00adment, each operating only on its own instrumentality. Although by that means the substantial equivalent of a single administration may be attained, there is a constitu\u00adtional difference between that co-operating action and action by an overriding jurisdiction. It follows that trade regulation by a Province or the Dominion, acting alone, related to local or external trade respectively, before the segregation of products or manufactures of each class is reached, is impracticable, with the only effective means open, apart from conditional regula\u00adtion, being that of co-operative action; this, as in some situations already in effect, may take the form of a single board to administer regulations of both on agreed measures.\nOn the foregoing interpretation of the scope of Provincial regulation of trade, the questions put to us may now be considered.\nThree of them go to the validity of two provisions of the Act, s. 3(1) (l), authorizing the marketing of a product by means of a pool, and a proposed amendment, para. (ss), to s. 7(1) authorizing the purchase of the surplus of a regu\u00adlated product and its marketing and the use of licence fees to recoup any loss suffered. The remaining five questions go to regulations made in one case by the Lieutenant-Governor in council, in three cases by the Farm Products Marketing Board, and in one by The Ontario Hog Pro\u00adducers' Marketing Board.\nClause (l) of subs. (1) of s. 3 of the statute reads:\nThe Board may, \u2026\nauthorize any marketing agency appointed under a scheme to conduct a pool or pools for the distribution of all moneys received from the sale of the regulated product and requiring any such marketing agency, after deducting all necessary and proper disbursements and expenses, to distribute the proceeds of sale in such manner that each person receives a share of the total proceeds in relation to the amount, variety, size, grade and class of the regulated product delivered by him and to make an initial payment on delivery of the product and subsequent payments until the total net proceeds are distributed.\nCo-operative disposal may take different forms: it may be that of an exclusive local marketing by an agency, either as owner or agent, by which the products are disposed of and the returns equalized, a form, I should say, within the authority of the Province; or, in the interest of convenience and economy, the producers, as contemplated by the Act here, would make their own sales with all moneys made returnable to the agency, for the recovery of which it may bring suit, and by it equalized and distributed. Since prices can be fixed by the agency, at the point of collecting them the result in both forms becomes the same, and I cannot see any jurisdictional difference between the equalization in the two cases. The exclusion of such an ordinary device of co-operative marketing from Provincial power would be a curtailment which I cannot think warranted. As it appears elsewhere in these reasons, indirect taxation is not, under a licensing scheme, a disqualifying factor and in co-operative marketing the essential condition of indirect taxation, the general tendency to pass the tax on to another, is excluded.\nQuestion 7 deals with marketing the surplus of a regu\u00adlated product. I take \"surplus\", as determined, to be what remains in the hands of producers after the local market is satisfied. Subclauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (v) of the proposed s. 7(1) (ss) deal exclusively with a \"surplus\"; (iv) and (vi) do not expressly mention it, but in the context I am unable to interpret the language as applying to any other subject. Subclause (ii) authorizes purchase by the local board from a voluntary seller; there is no compulsion on either. The clause as a whole sets up a separate feature of regulation which would extend to disposal in external trade. But the producer remains free to enter that trade as he pleases; if he elects to sell to the marketing agency, he does so under the terms of the statute as a matter of agreement; and the provision for a licence fee and its application to the purposes mentioned are valid as con\u00adtractual compensation for services. Any dealing with the product by the local board or others in external trade would obviously be subject to Dominion regulation.\nQuestion 8 I take to ask this : Could the Farm Products Marketing Board, under the proposed amendment, impose fees on all producers of the regulated product destined to the local market to equalize the returns received for the surplus with those received for the product generally, that is, can the surplus be gathered in with that marketed locally and the whole equalized in returns? It would be adding the returns from the surplus to the equalization under clause (l) dealt with in question 1. That could not be done because the amendment is confined to dealings with the surplus; nor could it be done by an independent provision because, under the machinery of regulation provided, it would be within the decision in Lower Mainland Dairy Products Sales Adjustment Committee v. Crystal Dairy, Limited[18].\nOn question 2 it is contended that the hog scheme is defective because only a skeleton of machinery is provided, that it does not contain substantive terms without which it is not a scheme at all. What the vote taken under s. 4 of the statute is intended to decide is whether or not the product shall be brought under a scheme; and the initial creation of its formal structure appears to be the intendment of the statute. Its approval by the Lieutenant-Governor in council and the regulations made by the Farm Products Marketing Board furnish its content, similarly envisaged by the statute. The schedule, by its heading, relates the scheme to the Act; and as the language is capable of being confined to local trade it should, in the context, be so construed.\nQuestion 3 deals with an order of the Farm Products Marketing Board providing by s. 2 that no processor shall commence or continue in the business of processing except under the authority of a licence which the Board may, for any reason deemed by it sufficient, refuse; and by s. 4 pro\u00adhibiting any person from engaging as a shipper without a licence which a local board may revoke or refuse to renew for failure to observe any order or regulation. This extends to processors or shippers engaged partly or exclusively in external trade. These are trade-regulating licences and not for revenue purposes only; and since there is nothing in the regulation to restrict the ordinary meaning of its language, reaching as it does beyond the limits of the statute itself, it is likewise beyond the power of the Farm Products Marketing Board to make.\nSection 6 provides for the appointment of a marketing agency through which \"all hogs\" shall be marketed. This exceeds the authority given the Board. Paragraphs (c) and (d) of s. 8 authorize the imposition of \"such service charges as may from time to time be fixed by the local board\" and their payment to the local board by the marketing agency. The fees are to be applied to the expenses of administration. This was challenged as involving indirect taxation, a point taken on questions 4, 5 and 6 as well, and these objections will now be examined together.\nUnder the hog producers' scheme, the charges are fixed \"at the sum of 24\u00a2 per hog and a pro rating charge in the sum of 20\u00a2 per producer settlement statement\". The scheme for marketing peaches fixes a licence fee at 50\u00a2 for each ton or fraction of a ton of peaches delivered to a processor by a grower; and by the vegetable processing scheme at the rate of \u00bd of 1 per cent of the total sale-price due a grower for each ton or fraction of a ton of vegetables delivered to a processor.\nOn these questions two judgments of the Judicial Com\u00admittee must be noticed: Lower Mainland Dairy Products Sales Adjustment Committee v. Crystal Dairy, Limited, supra, and Shannon et al. v. Lower Mainland Dairy Prod\u00aducts Board[19]. In the former the Judicial Committee passed upon legislation of British Columbia which purported to authorize a special exaction from all milk pro\u00adducers in a district proportioned to the quantity of fluid milk sold by them for the purpose of raising a fund to be distributed among the producers whose production was con\u00adverted into milk products, with a view to equalizing the returns from milk production generally and of bringing about the advantageous distribution of these two classes of commodities. The Committee viewed the issue to be whether the Province, by the means provided, could take money from one group in order to enrich the other, and held the impost invalid as indirect taxation. A similar view was taken of the recovery on the same basis of the expenses of the committee in administering the Act.\nThe reasons of Lord Thankerton contain no reference to trade regulation : the statute is dealt with as one providing taxation to enable an equalization of price return. The impingement of the tax, related as it was to the volume of products marketed, undoubtedly bore the badge ordinarily held to mark indirect taxation. In contrast to this was the formulation of the issue in Shannon. At p. 721 Lord Atkin sums it up :\nIf regulation of trade within the Province has to be held valid, the ordinary method of regulating trade, i.e., by a system of licences, must also be admissible.\nThere the administering board was empowered, as here, to control generally the marketing of the regulated product, including the time for marketing, the quantities to be offered by any producer, prohibition of the marketing of any grade, quality or class, the fixing of prices, and market\u00ading through a licensed shipper. Finally there was the authority to collect fees:\n4A(d) to fix and collect yearly, half-yearly, quarterly, or monthly licence fees from any or all persons producing, packing, transporting, storing, or marketing the regulated product; and for this purpose to classify such persons into groups, and fix the licence fees payable by the members of the different groups in different amounts; and to recover any such licence fees by suit in any court of competent jurisdiction...\n(j) To use in carrying out the purposes of the scheme and pay\u00ading the expenses of the board any moneys received by the board.\nOn the contention that this was indirect taxation within s. 92(2), Lord Atkin said at p. 721:\nWithout deciding the matter either way, they [their Lordships] can see difficulties in holding this to be direct taxation within the Province. But on the other grounds the legislation can be supported.\nThe other grounds were heads 9, 13 and 16 of s. 92.\nPassing to the licence fees he remarked:\nA licence itself merely involves a permission to trade subject to com\u00adpliance with specified conditions. A licence fee, though usual, does not appear to be essential. But, if licences are granted, it appears to be no objection that fees should be charged in order either to defray the costs of administering the local regulation or to increase the general funds of the Province, or for both purposes. The object would appear to be in. such a case to raise a revenue for either local or Provincial purposes.\nDuff J. in Lawson v. Interior Tree Fruit and Vegetable Committee of Direction, supra, had dealt with such licences and at p. 364 had said:\nOn the other hand, the last mentioned head authorizes licences for the purpose of raising a revenue, and does not, I think, contemplate licences which, in their primary function, are instrumentalities for the control of trade\u2014even local or provincial trade.\nOn this Lord Atkin commented:\nIt cannot, as their Lordships think, be an objection to a licence plus a fee that it is directed both to the regulation of trade and to the provision of revenue It would be difficult in the case of saloon and tavern licences to say that the regulation of the trade was not at least as impor\u00adtant as the provision of revenue. And, if licences for the specified trades are valid, their Lordships see no reason why the words \"other licences\" in s. 92(9) should not be sufficient to support the enactment in question.\nIt is pertinent to recall that in Russell v. The Queen[20], Sir Montague E. Smith answers the argument there made that the legislation challenged came under s. 92(9) :\nWith regard to the first of these clauses, No. 9, it is to be observed that the power of granting licenses is not assigned to the Provincial Legislatures for the purpose of regulating trade, but \"in order to the rais\u00ading of a. revenue for provincial, local, or municipal purposes\".\nThe language of Lord Atkin seems to involve the con\u00adclusion that fees incidental to Provincial regulation of trade by licence are to be considered without reference to the restriction of s. 92(2) ; and this appears to have been the opinion of Duff J. in Lawson where he says, at p. 364:\nand that accordingly imposts which would be classed under the general description \"indirect taxation\" are not for that reason alone excluded from those which may be exacted under head 9.\nThe power to regulate embraces incidental powers neces\u00adsary to its effective exercise; and the exaction of fees to meet the expenses of such an administration as that of the schemes; regardless of their incidence, is within that necessity.\nThe fees in Shannon were justified on a second ground which supports and supplements the preceding considera\u00adtions; that they were charges made for services rendered. That is the case here. What the producers receive are the benefits of a control that aims at an orderly marketing. The benefit of the organized apparatus is a service rendered by the scheme; and the fees related to either the quantity or the total return are directly proportioned to it.\nMr. Pepper argued that the regulation was in conflict with the provisions of the Combines Investigation Act and s.,411 of the Criminal Code, but with that I am unable to agree. The Provincial statute contemplates coercive regu\u00adlation in which both private and public interests are taken into account. The provisions of the Combines Investiga\u00adtion Act and the Criminal Code envisage voluntary com\u00adbinations or agreements by individuals against the public interest that violate their prohibitions. The public interest in trade regulation is not within the purview of Parliament as an object against which its enactments are directed.\nAnother conflict was suggested with s. 25 of the Live Stock and Live Stock Products Act, R.S.C. 1952, e. 167, which provides:\n25. Notwithstanding anything in this Part, any farmer or drover may sell his own live stock at a stockyard on his own account.\nThis simply enables a farmer or drover to sell at the stock-yard notwithstanding the provisions of that Act; it does not purport to give an absolute right as against other enact\u00adments, which if it did it might, as an attempt to control local trade, be so far invalid.\nOn the assumption that the Act is restricted to intraprovincial transactions as defined in these reasons, I therefore answer the questions put as follows:\nQuestion 1: No.\nQuestion 2: No,\nQuestion 3: Yes, as indicated.\nQuestion 4: No.\nQuestion 5: No.\nQuestion 6: No.\nQuestion 7: On the interpretation given to the proposed amendment, no.\nQuestion 8: No.\nLOCKE J.:\u2014The order of reference made in this matter by His Excellency the Governor General in council, after recit\u00ading that questions have arisen respecting the constitutional validity of certain sections of The Farm Products Market\u00ading Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 131, as amended, and the schemes, regulations and orders passed pursuant thereto, and that the Government of the Province of Ontario has requested that certain legislation, schemes, regulations and orders be referred to this Court for hearing and consideration, reads:\nAND WHEREAS the Minister of Agriculture for Ontario advises: that under The Farm Products Marketing Act of Ontario there are at present in operation 14 marketing schemes covering 21 farm products; that the various schemes are financed by the methods indicated in the questions set out hereunder; that the marketing agency referred to in question number 4 is a co-operative corporation incorporated under Part V of The Corporations Act of Ontario 1953, c. 19, and that the by-Jaws of the mar\u00adketing agency provide that any surplus of service charges after providing for reserves shall be allocated, credited or paid to those marketing hogs through the agency computed at a rate in relation to the value of the hogs marketed for such person; that in connection with question number 5 one ton of peaches makes 144 dozen 20 ounce cans of peaches or 1728 cans;\nTHEREFORE His Excellency the Governor General in Council, under and by virtue of the authority conferred by section 55 of the Supreme Court Act, is pleased to refer and doth hereby refer to the Supreme Court of Canada for hearing and consideration, the following questions:\n1. Assuming that the said Act applies only in the case of intraprovincial transactions, is clause (1) of subsection 1 of section 3 of The Farm Products Marketing Act, R.S.O. 1950 chapter 131 as amended by Ontario Statutes 1951, chapter 25, 1953, chapter 36, 1954, chapter 29, 1955, chapter 21 ultra vires the Ontario Legislature?\n2. Is Regulation 104 of Consolidated Regulations of Ontario' 1950 as amended by O.Reg.100\/55 and O.Reg.104\/55 respecting the marketing of hogs, ultra vires the Lieutenant Governor in Council either in whole or in part and if so in what particular or particulars and to what extent?\n3. Is Ontario Regulation 102\/55 respecting the marketing of hogs, ultra vires the Farm Products Marketing Board either in whole or in part and if so in what particular or particulars and to what extent?\n4. Is the Order dated the 8th day of June, 1955, made by The Ontario Hog Producers Marketing Board fixing the service charges to be imposed by the marketing agency, ultra vires the said Board?\n5. Is regulation 7 of Ontario Reg.145\/54 respecting the marketing of peaches for processing, ultra vires the Farm Products Marketing Board?\n6. Is regulation 5 of Ontario Reg.126\/52 respecting the marketing of vegetables for processing, ultra vires the Farm Products Marketing Board?\n7. Is the following draft amendment to subsection (1) of Section 7 of The Farm Products Marketing Act, ultra vires the Ontario Legislature either in whole or in part and if so in what particular or particulars and to what extent?\n\"Subsection (1) of Section 7 of The Farm Products Marketing Act as amended by Section 4 of The Farm Products Marketing Amendment Act, 1951, Section 6 of The. Farm Products Marketing Amendment Act, 1954 and Section 7 of The Farm Products Marketing Act, 1955 is amended by adding thereto the following paragraph:\n(ss) authorizing a local board.\n(i) to inquire into and determine the amount of surplus of a regulated product,\n(ii) to purchase or otherwise acquire the whole or such part of such surplus of a regulated product as the marketing agency may determine,\n(iii) to market any surplus of a regulated product so purchased or acquired,\n(iv) to require processors who receive the regulated product from producers to deduct from the moneys payable to the producers any licence fees payable by the producer to the local board and to remit such licence fees to the local board,\n(v) to use such licence fees to pay the expenses of the local board and the losses, if any, incurred in the marketing of the surplus of the regulated product and to set aside reserves against possible losses in marketing the surplus of the regulated product, (vi) to use such licence fees to equalize or adjust returns received by producers of the regulated product.\"\n8. If the answer to question No. 7 is in the negative, could the Farm Products Marketing Board under the proposed amendment, authorize the local board to impose licence fees on all producers in the Province of the regulated product based upon the volume of the product marketed and to use such licence fees to equalize or adjust returns to the producers?\nAfter the order in council was made, the Legislature of Ontario, by c. 20 of the statutes of 1956, assented to on March 28, 1956, amended the Act in question by the addi\u00adtion of the following:\n1a. The purpose and intent of this Act is to provide for the control and regulation in. any or all respects of the marketing within the Province of farm products, including the prohibition of such marketing in whole or in part.\nThe case in this matter contains a copy of an order in council made on November 16, 1955, under the provisions of the Agricultural Products Marketing Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 6, whereby certain powers were vested in the Ontario Farm Products Marketing, Board, The Ontario Hog Pro\u00adducers' Marketing Board and the Ontario Hog Producers Co-operative, in relation to the marketing of hogs and other products. Since, however, this order is not retrospective in its operation and all of the orders and regulations referred to in questions 2 to 6 inclusive were made prior to its date, they can derive no support from it and must depend for their validity entirely upon the provisions of The Farm Products Marketing Act as amended.\nIt should be said at the outset that no useful answer can be made to questions 1, 3 and 4 in the absence of some further explanation of what is meant by \"intraprovincial transactions\" other than that which is to be found in the amendment to the statute made in 1956. This merely says that the purpose and intent of the Act is to provide for the control and regulation of the marketing within the Province of farm products, including the prohibition of such market\u00ading in whole or in part.\n\"Intra\" means within but none of the learned counsel supporting the legislation and the regulations contend that the Legislature is competent to prohibit the marketing of live hogs or. other farm products for export. An agreement made in Carleton County between a farmer residing there and a buyer for a packing company operating in Hull, Quebec, is an intraprovincial transaction since it is initiated and completed when the sale 'is agreed upon and the hog delivered. The farmer is not exporting the hog and it is presumably a matter of indifference to him whether the buyer exports the hog, whether alive or dead, to the Prov\u00adince of Quebec. Yet this transaction would be prohibited if the language of the statute and of the regulation is to be construed literally.\nHowever ineffective the language of the 1956 amendment may be to exclude from the operation of the Act trans\u2014actions of very great importance and with very wide rami\u00adfications which the Province is powerless to regulate (and I think it is quite insufficient), the questions should, in my opinion, be dealt with on the footing that, regardless of the language employed, it was the intention of the Legislature to confine its operation to matters within its own com\u00adpetence. However this procedure may depart from the rules of law applicable to the construction of statutes, this is a reference and, in view of the language of the first ques\u00adtion, it is the duty of this Court to endeavour to answer the questions on that basis.\nWhile it is my conclusion that what The Farm Products Marketing Act authorizes and what the various boards con\u00adstituted under its provisions have attempted to do include matters wholly within the jurisdiction of Parliament, all of the necessary powers may be vested in these boards by separate action taken in unison under Dominion and Pro\u00advincial powers and, in answering the questions, I propose to express my opinion as to the respective limits of the jurisdiction of these legislative bodies in matters of this kind, so far as they may be relevant to the matters for consideration.\nThe main question that has arisen for determination in these matters has been as to the jurisdiction of Parliament under head 2 of s. 91 and that of the Provinces under heads 13 and 16 of s. 92 of the British North America Act. A succession of attempts has been made by various Pro\u00advincial Legislatures and one by Parliament to regulate and control the sale of natural products and, before attempting to answer the questions, it is of some assistance to consider the principal cases in which the respective powers of the legislative bodies under these heads have been considered. In Lawson v. Interior Tree Fruit and Vegetable Com\u00admittee of Direction[21], the Produce Marketing Act of British Columbia, being c. 54 of the statutes of 1926-27, was considered by this Court. The proceedings were initiated by an action and evidence was given as to the activities of the committee of direction constituted under the statute, which showed that the committee interpreted its powers as enabling it, inter alia, to control the marketing and sale of fruit and vegetable products sold by growers and purchased by others for export from the Province or exported by the growers direct. The principal judgment delivered in this Court was written by Duff J. (as he then was).\nSection 10 of the British Columbia Act purported to vest in the Committee power, \"so far as the legislative authority of the Province extends\", of controlling and regulating the marketing and shipment of natural products and the fixing of prices, very similar to, though not identical with, those authorized to be exercised by a marketing agency by s. 7 of the Ontario Act. The following passage from the reasons for judgment is to be considered (pp. 364-5) :\nAs I have said, the respondent Committee has attempted (in professed exercise of this authority) and in this litigation asserts its right o do so\u2014to regulate the marketing of products into parts of Canada outside British Columbia. It claims the right under the statute o control (as in fact it does), the sale of such products for shipment into the prairie provinces as well as the shipment of them into those provinces for sale or storage. The moment his product reaches a state in which it becomes a possible article of commerce, the shipper is (under the Committee's interpretation of its powers), subject to the Committee's dictation as to the quantity of it which he may dispose of, as to the places from which, and the places to which he may ship, as to the route of transport, as to the price, as to all the terms of sale. I ought o refer also to the provision of the statute which prohibits anybody becoming a licensed shipper who has not, for six months immediately preceding his application for a licence, been a resident of the province, unless he is the registered owner of the land on which he carries on business as shipper. In a statute which deals with trade that is largely interprovincial, this is a significant feature. It is an attempt to control the manner in which traders in other provinces, who send their agents into British Columbia to make arrangements for the shipment of goods to their principals, shall carry out their interprovincial transactions. I am unable to convince myself that these matters are all, or chiefly, matters of merely British Columbia concern, in the sense that they are not also directly and substantially the concern of the other prov\u00adinces, which constitute in fact the most extensive market for these products. In dictating the routes of shipment, the places to which shipment is to be made, the quantities allotted to each terminus ad quern, the Com\u00admittee does, altogether apart from dictating the terms of contracts, exer\u00adcise a large measure of direct and immediate control over the movement of trade in these commodities between British Columbia and the other provinces.\nIt may be noted further that the Act thus found to be invalid assumed to control products in their natural state, as shown by the definition in s. 2 of the Act. The Ontario legislation under consideration goes further in that it assumes to control not only a great variety of farm products but also \"such articles of food or drink manufactured or derived in whole or in part from any such product\".\nThe reasons delivered by Duff J. were concurred in by Rinfret and Lamont JJ. Newcombe J. agreed that the legislation was in reference to the regulation of trade and commerce, while reserving his opinion on other matters discussed. Cannon' J., who concurred in the result, assigned other reasons for his conclusion that the legislation was invalid.\nThe remarks of Lord Atkin in Shannon et al. v. Lower Mainland Dairy Products Board[22], as to what had been said upon the subject of the licences authorized by the statute considered in Lawson's Case, do not affect this consideration.\nIn Attorney-General for British Columbia v. Attorney-General for Canada et al.[23], the Natural Products Mar\u00adketing Act, 1934, of the Parliament of Canada, was held beyond the powers of Parliament by the Judicial Com\u00admittee. The Dominion legislation was designed to regulate the sales of similar products to those referred to in the British Columbia Act. Lord Atkin by whom the judgment was delivered said (p. 386) that there could be no doubt that the provisions of the Act covered \"transactions in any natural product which are completed within the Province, and have no connection with inter-provincial or export trade\". The matter had been considered in this Court and a p as sage from the judgment of the Court delivered by Duff C.J.[24] was approved which read:\nThe enactments in question, therefore, in so far as they relate to matters which are in substance local and provincial are beyond the jurisdiction of Parliament. Parliament cannot acquire jurisdiction to deal in the sweeping way in which these enactments operate with such local and provincial matters by legislating at the same time respecting external and interprovincial trade and committing the regulation of external and inter-provincial trade and the regulation of trade which is exclusively local and of traders and producers engaged in trade which is exclusively local to the same authority.\nThis appears to assist in explaining what Lord Atkin intended by the expression \"transactions which are com\u00adpleted within the Province\" in the earlier passage.\nAs in the case of the British Columbia legislation con\u00adsidered in Lawson's Case, s. 26 of the Act provided that if it should be found that any part of the Act was ultra vires, effect should be given to such parts as should be held to be within the powers of Parliament. It was held, however, that the whole texture of the Act was inextricably inter-woven and that, as the main portion of the legislation was invalid as being in pith and in substance an encroachment upon provincial rights, the sections which were within the Dominion powers must fall as being in part merely ancillary to it.\nIn Shannon v. Lower Mainland Dairy Products Board, supra, the Natural Products Marketing (British Columbia) Act, 1936, as amended by c. 41 of the statutes of British Columbia in 1937, was held to be within Provincial powers.\nThe judgment of the Judicial Committee was again delivered by Lord Atkin. The definition of \"marketing\" did not differ materially from that in the statute considered in Lawson's Case, and the statute contained in subs. (1) of s. 4 a declaration to the same effect as that contained in the 1956 amendment to the Ontario Act. By the amendment of 1937 it was declared that the purpose and intent of the Legislature was to confine the provisions of the Act within the competence of the Legislature and that all the provisions thereof should be construed so as to give effect to this purpose and intent. The amendment further provided in some detail that should any part of the Act be held ultra vires this should not affect those portions which were within the powers of the Legislature, the intention being to give separate and independent effect to the extent of its powers to every provision of the Act.\nThe matter came before the Courts by way of reference by the Lieutenant-Governor in council. The trial judge had found the Act ultra vires but this was reversed in the Court of Appeal and the appeal was taken direct to the Judicial Committee. The report of the argument shows that it had been admitted on the part of the appellant that the purpose of the Act was to regulate the marketing of natural products only to the extent the jurisdiction of the Province extended. Dealing with the argument that the legislation encroached upon the power of Parliament under s. 91(2), Lord Atkin said that it was sufficient to say that:\n... it is apparent that the legislation in question is confined to regulating transactions that take place wholly\u2014 within the Province.\nLater, he said that it was plain that the transportation which was controlled was \"confined to the passage of goods whose transport begins within the Province to a destination also within the Province\" and that the appellant did not dispute that it was the intention of the Legislature to confine itself to its own sphere and had not established that there had been any encroachment. Concluding his con\u00adsideration of this aspect of the matter, he said:\nThe pith and substance of this Act is that it is an Act to regulate particular businesses entirely within the Province and is, therefore, intra vires of the Province.\n(The italics are mine.)\nIn my view, the Judicial Committee did not intend by the language above quoted to depart from what Lord Atkin had said in the Dominion Marketing Act case and its approval of the language of Duff C.J. in that case above quoted.\nSome assistance may be found in the earlier cases upon the point. In Hodge v. The Queen[25], where the Liquor License Act of 1877 of Ontario was upheld, the power to make regulations in the nature of police or municipal regu\u00adlations of a merely local character for the good government of taverns was held not to interfere with the general regulation of trade and commerce vested in the Dominion. The Act was held to be \"entirely local\" in its character and operation.\nIn Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for the Dominion et al.[26], where the validity of the Canada Temperance Act, 1886, was considered, Lord Watson said (p. 365), referring to the powers of the Provincial Legis\u00adlature, that it was practically conceded that it must have power to deal with the restriction of the liquor traffic from a local and provincial point of view. As to the argument that s. 18 of the existing Ontario Act conflicted with the provisions of the Dominion Act, he said (p. 368) :\n... the prohibitions which s. 18 authorizes municipalities to impose within their respective limits do not appear to their Lordships to affect any transactions in liquor which have not their beginning and their end within the province of Ontario.\nI do not find any other material assistance in the decided cases as to the extent of the powers of the Legislature to regulate trade other than that which is to be obtained from the' cases in which the extent of the powers of Parliament under s. 91(2) has been declared.\nIn The Citizens Insurance Company of Canada v. Parsons; The Queen Insurance Company v. Parsons[27], Sir Montague E. Smith, delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee, after pointing out (p. 112) that the words \"regulation of trade and commerce\" in their unlimited sense were sufficiently wide to include every regulation of trade ranging from political arrangements in regard to trade with foreign governments, clown to minute rules for regulating particular trades, and that a consideration of the Act showed that the word was not used in this unlimited sense, said that their Lordships did not attempt to define the limits of the authority. He said that the words would include political arrangements in regard to trade requiring the sanction of Parliament, regulation of trade in matters of interprovincial concern, and perhaps general regulation of trade affecting the whole Dominion.\nWhile in Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[28], reference was macle to the passage above referred to from Parsons' Case, Lord Hobhouse merely said that it had been there suggested that the power of regulation given to the Parliament meant some general or interprovincial regulations, but no further attempt to define the subject need be made.\nWhile the extent of the power was considered in two early cases in this Court: Severn v. The Queen[29] and The City of Fredericton v. The Queen[30], no attempt was there made to define the limits of the power.\nWhat has been at times considered as a limitation of the power appears to have resulted from a passage in the judg\u00adment in Parsons' Case (p. 113) which says that the authority to legislate for the regulation of trade and com\u00admerce does not comprehend the power to regulate by legis\u00adlation the contracts of a particular trade or business such as the business of fire insurance in a single Province.\nIn Attorney-General for Canada v. Attorney-General for Alberta et al.[31], Viscount Haldane said that the power did not extend to legislate for \"the regulation by a licensing system of a particular trade in which Canadians would otherwise be free to engage in the provinces\".\nIn In re The Board of Commerce Act, 1919, and The Combines and Fair Prices Act, 1919[32], it appears to be stated somewhat more broadly (p. 198). There it is said that the authority of Parliament did not enable interfer\u00adence with particular trades in which Canadians would, apart from any right of interference conferred by the heading, be free to engage in the Provinces.\nThe result of the cases in the Judicial Committee appears to me to be most clearly summarized in the judgment of Lord Atkin in Shannon's Case, supra, where it is said (p. 719):\nIt is now well settled that the enumeration in s. 91 of \"the regulation of trade and commerce\" as a class of subject over which the Dominion has exclusive legislative powers does not give the power to regulate for legitimate Provincial purposes particular trades or businesses so far as the trade or business is confined to the Province.\nThe Farm Products Marketing Act continues in exist\u00adence the Farm Products Marketing Board, a body cor\u00adporate theretofore constituted, the members of which are appointed by the Lieutenant-Governor in council. Refer\u00adence has been above made to the various farm products which the Board is given power to control. The extensive powers vested in the Board include power to establish negotiating agencies which may adopt or determine by agreement minimum prices for the regulated product, terms of purchase and sale, and conditions and forms of contract for the purchase and sale of such product; and, except where a marketing agency has been designated for the marketing of a regulated product to \"prohibit the market\u00ading of any class, variety, grade or size of any regulated product\" and to authorize a marketing agency to conduct a pool of the nature referred to in the first question submitted.\nThe Board is, in addition, given power to make regula\u00adtions with respect to any regulated product, including the prohibiting of persons from engaging in marketing or pro\u00adcessing any such product except under the authority of a licence issued by the Board (s. 7(1) (b)), and \"providing for the refusal to grant a licence for any reason which the Board or the local board may deem sufficient\" (s. 7(1)(c)) .\nOther than in the manner in which this is attempted in the amendment made in 1956 above referred to, the statute does not limit the exercise of the powers which may be vested in the Board under its provisions to natural products marketed for consumption in the Province, but includes in its sweeping terms such products which might be sold for export or exported by a producer or one purchasing from him from the Province.\nThe first question is directed to clause (l) of subs. (1) of s. 3 of the Act. This authorizes the Board to\nauthorize any marketing agency appointed under a scheme to conduct a pool or pools for the distribution of all moneys received from the sale of the regulated product and requiring any such marketing agency, after deducting all necessary and proper disbursements and expenses, to distribute the proceeds of sale in such manner that each person receives a share of the total proceeds in relation to the amount, variety, size, grade and class of the regulated product delivered by him and to make an initial payment on delivery of the product and subsequent payments until the total net proceeds are distributed.\nConstruing the reference to intraprovincial transactions in the question and the words \"control and regulation in any or all respects of the marketing within the Province of farm products including the prohibition of such marketing in whole or in part\" in the 1956 amendment, as referring to purchases and sales of the controlled product, whether hogs, fruit or vegetables in their natural form, for consump\u00adtion in the Province, and sales to processors, manufacturers or dealers proposing to sell such products, either in their natural form or after they have been processed by canning, preserving or otherwise treating them, for consumption within the Province, I consider the clause to be within the powers of the Province.\nSuch transactions are, in my opinion, matters of a merely local or private nature in the Province within head 16 of s. 92, and such regulation is in relation to property and civil rights in the Province within head 13.\nThe pools authorized by clause (l) appear to be designed to obtain the most favourable prices for the producers as a whole by selling the regulated product through the medium of a marketing agency, a procedure which, it is apparently hoped, will result in better prices being realized for the crop as a whole than would otherwise be possible. I do not consider that the decision of the Judicial Com\u00admittee in Lower Mainland Dairy Products Sales Adjustment Committee v. Crystal Dairy, Limited[33] supports a contention that the authority to authorize the proposed pools is beyond Provincial powers. In my view, the fact that some of the producers might under such regulations receive less for their product than they would if they were at liberty to sell when the opportunity offers and that others might receive more than they would otherwise receive does not mean that a tax is imposed upon one pro\u00adducer for the benefit of others. The design is apparently to realize what will be over the years better prices for all pro\u00adducers and this, in my opinion, is within the powers given by heads 13 and 16.\nIn answering this question I exclude sales of produce where the producer himself ships his product to other Prov\u00adinces or countries for sale by any means of transport, or sells his product to a person who purchases the same for export. To illustrate, I exclude a shipment by a hog pro\u00adducer of his hogs, alive or dead, to the Province of Quebec and transactions between such producer and a buyer for a packing plant carrying on business in Hull who purchases the hog intending to ship it to Hull, either alive or dead, and transactions between a hog producer and a packing plant operating in Ontario purchasing the hog for the purpose of producing pork products from it and exporting them from the Province to the extent that the carcass is so used.\nThe passage from the judgment in Lawson's Case which is above quoted makes it clear that to attempt to control the manner in which traders in other Provinces will carry out their transactions within the Province, or to prohibit them from purchasing natural products for export, is not a matter of merely Provincial concern but also directly and substantially the concern of the other Provinces. I cannot think that from a constitutional standpoint the fact that the buyer for the packing house elects to have the hog killed before it is exported or cut up and, after treatment, exported as hams, bacon or other pork products, can affect the matter.\nThe order in council referred to in the second question approved the scheme under the powers conferred by s. 4(2) of the Act. The objections to the validity of this order are that the scheme is not confined to marketing in Ontario and envisages marketing extraprovincially and, further, that the Lieutenant-Governor has no power to create a local board. As to the first, the scheme itself, while defining the farm product to which it applies, does not deal with the manner in which the marketing is to be carried on, but merely provides the agencies which are to carry on the proposed activi\u00adties. It is by the regulations passed subsequently by the Board that the manner of operation is defined and the first objection is really directed against them. As to the power of the Lieutenant-Governor to appoint the Board, the sec\u00adtion referred to expressly authorizes the approval of a scheme and part of the scheme is the establishment of such a board. Section 1(d) of the Act defines the expression \"local board\" as meaning a board constituted under a scheme, and power to approve the scheme carries with it, of necessity, in my opinion, the power to approve the con\u00adstitution of the board. Ontario Regulation 102\/55, referred to in the third ques\u00adtion, contains the regulations made by the Board under the powers vested in it by s. 7 of the Act. The regulation in question was made prior to the amendment of 1956 but, in order that the answers made should be of assistance, it is my opinion that the matter should be treated as if this had been made under the statute as amended.\nSection 6 of The Interpretation Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 184, provides that where an Act confers power to make orders or regulations, unless the contrary intention appears, expres\u00adsions used in them shall have the same meaning as in the Act conferring the power. Accordingly, where the word \"marketing\" is used in the regulation, it is to be given the meaning attributed to the word in s. 1(e) of the Act which defines it as meaning, inter alia, buying, selling and offering for sale, packing and shipping for sale and transporting in any manner, and assigns to the words \"market\" and \"mar\u00adketed\" corresponding meanings.\nThe regulation applies to all hogs produced in Ontario, with certain defined exceptions. \"Producer\" is defined as one engaged in the production of hogs. \"Processing\" is defined as meaning the slaughtering of hogs and \"processor\" as one who slaughters hogs or has hogs slaughtered for him.\nThe regulation provides for the appointment of the Ontario Hog Producers' Co-operative as the marketing agency through which all hogs shall be marketed and declares that no person shall market hogs except through that agency, and authorizes the marketing agency, inter alia, to direct and control the marketing of hogs, including the times and places at which they may be marketed, to fix the prices to be paid to producers, to require the price to be paid to be forwarded to the marketing agency and to collect from any person by suit the price or prices of hogs owing to the producer.\nOn the face of it, the regulation assumes to control the marketing of hogs which the producer might wish to export from the Province on his own account, prohibits him, by way of illustration, from selling his hogs to the representa\u00adtive of a packing company in Quebec who proposes to export them from the Province, prohibits the Quebec pack\u00ading house from buying the hogs from him and packing companies operating in Ontario from purchasing hogs from him for the purpose of manufacturing pork products and export\u00ading them, and from purchasing hogs from any person in Ontario other than the marketing agency and except at prices which may be fixed by the marketing agency and at times determined by them. This, as I have said, is, in my opinion, assuming to regulate trade and commerce in mat\u00adters which are not merely of concern to the people of Ontario but are directly and substantially the concern of the people of other Provinces and thus beyond the powers which may be vested by the Province in such a board.\nTo the extent, however, that the regulation assumes to control in this manner hogs sold for consumption within the Province or to packing plants or other processors purchasing the animals for the manufacture of pork products to be consumed within the Province, the regulation is, in my opinion, intra vires as dealing with matters which are merely of a local or private nature in the Province.\nThe regulation also provides for the licensing of persons shipping or transporting hogs or slaughtering them and, so long as this power is exercised under the licensing power given by head 9 of s. 92 and is not used to prevent those desiring to purchase hogs or pork products for export and thus to regulate interprovincial trade, I consider it to be within Provincial powers. This appears to me to be settled by Brewers' and Maltsters' Association of Ontario v. The Attorney-General for Ontario[34]. It will be noted that the Board, by s. 3 of the regulation, may refuse to grant a licence as a processor \"for any reason which the Board may deem sufficient\". As every packing company in Ontario must, of necessity, be a processor within the definition con\u00adtained in the regulation, and since many of the large pack\u00ading companies are presumably incorporated by letters patent under the Dominion Companies Act and have been granted power to carry on their business in all of the Prov\u00adinces of Canada, the decisions of the Judicial Committee in John Deere Plow Company, Limited v. Wharton[35] and in Great West Saddlery Company, Limited v. The King[36], would in the case of such companies be obstacles in the way of the exercise of such a power. The judgments delivered in the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan in In re The Grain Marketing Act 1951[37] contain a valuable review of authorities on the question as to the right of the Province to interfere with export by a producer of grain. I refer par\u00adticularly to the judgments of Turgeon J.A. at p. 155 (W.W.R.), McKay J.A. at p. 167 and Martin J.A. at p. 182.\nThe fourth question relates to an order made by The Ontario Hog Producers' Marketing Board on June 8, 1955, which reads:\nTHAT the service charges to be imposed by the Ontario Hog Producers Co-operative for the marketing of hogs under the said scheme be and the same are hereby fixed at until further order of the Board the sum of 24\u00a2 per hog and a pro rating charge in the sum of 200 per producer settlement statement.\nSection 8(c) of the regulations authorizes the Board to empower the marketing agency to impose service charges on the marketing of hogs and, by para. (d), to pay to the local board from the charges so imposed its expenses in carrying out the purposes of the scheme. It is the local board that fixes the amount of these charges under s. 9. I do not know what the expression \"pro rating charge\" means and answer this question on the footing that the charge of 20 is for preparing and rendering the statement referred to in s. 10(2).\nAssuming that the charges are made in respect of hogs sold for consumption in Ontario as mentioned in the answer to question 3, in the absence of any evidence to the con\u00adtrary, it is, in my opinion, to be assumed that these are fair charges for services to be rendered by the marketing agency and the local board. On this footing, I consider the regula\u00adtion to be a proper exercise of the powers given by heads 13 and 16 of s. 92 and intra vires: Shannon et al. v. Lower Mainland Dairy Products Board, supra, at p. 722.\nQuestion 5 relates to s. 7 of Ontario Regulation 145\/54 dealing with the marketing of peaches for processing which reads:\n(1) Every grower shall pay to the local board licence fees at the rate of 50 cents for each ton or fraction thereof of peaches delivered to a processor. (2) The processor shall deduct the licence fees payable by a grower from the sum of money due to the person from whom the peaches were received.\n(3) The processor shall forward to the local board the licence fees deducted not later than the 1st of December in any year.\nThe scheme to which the regulation in question applies constitutes a local board to be known as \"The Ontario Peach Growers' Marketing Board\" and, in addition, a com\u00admittee in each of the defined districts in Ontario to be known as \"The District Peach Growers' Committee\".\nRegulation 145\/54 defines \"peaches\" as meaning those produced in Ontario which are subsequently used for pro\u00adcessing, and the latter word is defined as including canning, dehydrating, drying, freezing or processing. \"Processor\" includes every person carrying on in the Province the busi\u00adness of processing peaches. Section 2 requires persons engaged in the business of growing peaches, so defined, to have a licence to be issued by the Board, and every grower is deemed to be the holder of such a licence. Processors and dealers in such peaches are also required to obtain licences. The term \"dealer\", as defined, would include persons repre\u00adsenting purchasers outside of the Province who propose to export the fruit to be processed elsewhere than in Ontario.\nThe power vested in the Province to legislate in relation to licences in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial, local or municipal purposes under head 9 of s. 92, in my opinion, authorizes this section, even though their imposi\u00adtion in an amount which varies with the quantity sold may tend to increase the sale-price. It must, I think, be taken as decided by the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Shannon's Case that it is not a valid objection to a licence, plus a fee, that it is directed both to the regulation of trade and to the provision of revenue. While the functions of the marketing board and the growers' committee are not defined in the material, it is proper to assume, in my opinion, that these licence fees are to defray the expenses of these bodies in discharging their duties under the scheme. The fact that the licence fee may be charged in respect of peaches pro\u00adcessed for export does not, in my opinion, invalidate the section.\nQuestion 6 relates to Ontario Regulation 126\/52 referring to the marketing of vegetables for processing. The licence fee payable by a grower is at the rate of one-half of 1 per cent of the total sale-price due to him for each ton or fraction thereof of peaches delivered to a processor and processed by the latter. In other respects, the provisions are similar to those of O.Reg. 145\/54 referred to in the last question.\nFor the same reasons, I consider the imposition of these licence fees to be intra vires the marketing board.\nQuestion 7 relates to a proposed amendment to s. 7 of The Farm Products Marketing Act which reads:\nSubsection (1) of Section 7 of The Farm Products Marketing Act as amended by Section 4 of The Farm Products Marketing Amendment Act, 1951, Section 6 of The Farm Products Marketing Amendment Act, 1954 and Section 7 of The Farm Products Marketing Act, 1955 is amended by adding thereto the following paragraph:\n(ss) authorizing a local board\n(i) to inquire into and determine the amount of surplus of a regulated product,\n(ii) to purchase or otherwise acquire the whole or such part of such surplus of a regulated product as the marketing agency may determine,\n(iii) to market any surplus of a regulated product so purchased or acquired,\n(iv) to require processors who receive the regulated product from producers to deduct from the moneys payable to the producers any licence fees payable by the producer to the local board and to remit such licence fees to the local board,\n(v) to use such licence fees to pay the expenses of the local board and the losses, if any, incurred in the marketing of the surplus of the regulated product and to set aside reserves against possible losses in marketing the surplus of the regulated product,\n(vi) to use such licence fees to equalize or adjust returns received by producers of the regulated product.\nClauses (i), (ii) and (iii) appear to require no comment since there is no compulsion on the part of the producer to sell to the local board.\nClause (iv) appears to me to be unrelated to the previous clauses since if the local board buys from the producer the latter would presumably have nothing to do with the pro\u00adcessors. Processors who have purchased the regulated prod\u00aduct from producers may be required, in my opinion, to deduct any licence fees lawfully payable by the producer from the purchase-money and remit the amounts to the local board. Clauses (v) and (vi), to the extent that they authorize the use of moneys realized from licence fees to pay the operating expenses of the local board, are, in my opinion, intra vires. The proposed amendment is to be construed in the same manner as the section of the Act referred to in the first question and so applying to products marketed or purchased for consumption within the Province. On the assumption that the producer sells his own product on the market, a licence designed to raise moneys not merely for the expenses of the Board but to cover losses incurred by it in its market operations or to equalize or adjust returns received by all the producers would, in my opinion, be ultra vires. So-called licence fees or charges imposed for this purpose would, in my opinion, be taxes the nature of which could not be distinguished from the adjustment levies referred to in the Crystal Dairy case above referred to.\nIt will be seen from the report of that case that, on behalf of the respondent, it was contended not merely that the levies were bad as constituting indirect taxation but also that imposing them was an attempt to regulate trade which was, at least partly, interprovincial. The Judicial Com\u00admittee, finding that the levies, being in the nature of indirect taxes, could not be supported, did not consider the argument based upon head 2 of s. 91. From the fact that the point was argued, however, and the further fact that the fluid milk market referred to was obviously within the Province, it is proper to conclude, in my opinion, that, though this substantial part of the product was sold for local consumption, the objection that the method adopted to equalize the returns of the producers was beyond Pro\u00advincial powers must be given effect to. This aspect of the matter appears to me to be concluded by the judgment in that case.\nI would not construe clauses (v) and (vi) as contem\u00adplating that the imposition and use of such licence fees for the last-mentioned purposes would be a matter of agreement between the local board and the producers. To do so would be to render the question itself pointless.\nWhat I have said as to clauses (v) and (vi) of the proposed amendment referred to in question 7 applies to ques\u00adtion 8. In my opinion, neither the provisions of the Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 314, nor of s. 411 of the Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, are objections to the schemes in question to the extent that they are within the powers which may be validly granted by the Legislature under the terms of the British, North America Act. It cannot be said, in my opinion, that within the terms of para. (a) (vi) of s. 2 of the Combines Investigation Act the scheme \"is likely to operate to the detriment or against the interest of the public, whether consumers, producers or others\". Rather is it a scheme the carrying out of which is deemed to be in the public interest. Furthermore, the offence defined by s. 2 which renders a person subject to the penalties prescribed by s. 32 is a crime against the state. I think that to perform an act which the Legislature is empowered to and has authorized cannot be an offence against the state.\nThe same reasoning applies, in my opinion, to s. 411 of the Criminal Code. I consider that the section has no application to a scheme authorized by a Legislature under its powers conferred by the same statute which, by s. 91, gave to Parliament the power to pass laws in relation to the criminal law. If, indeed, the section could be construed as applying to such an act, I think it would be impossible to say that a scheme deemed by the Legislature to be in the public interest could be held to unduly limit or prevent competition within the meaning of the section.\nI have not dealt with the sufficiency of the Hog Pro\u00adducers' Marketing Scheme or any question of severability as it might affect either the statute or the regulation as, in view of the form of the questions, to do so would, in my opinion, serve no useful purpose.\nMy answers to the various questions are as follows:\nQuestion 1: If the pool for the distribution of moneys received from the sale of the regulated product is limited to such products marketed for use within the Province and excludes such products marketed or purchased for export in their natural state or after treatment, clause (l) of subs. (1) of s. 3 of The Farm Products Marketing Act is not ultra vires of the Legislature.\nQuestion 2: No. Question 3: Yes, except to the extent that the regulation authorizes the control of the marketing of hogs sold for con\u00adsumption within the Province or to packing-plants or other processors purchasing the animals for the manufacture of pork products for use within the Province. The provision for licensing is intra vires, subject to what is said as to the refusal of such a licence.\nQuestion 4: No.\nQuestion 5: No.\nQuestion 6: No.\nQuestion 7: That part of clause (v) which authorizes the imposition of licences for the purpose of providing moneys to pay for the losses referred to, to set up reserves, and for the purposes referred to in clause (vi) is ultra vires.\nQuestion 8: No.\nCARTWRIGHT J. :\u2014The questions referred to the Court by His Excellency the Governor General in council and a sum\u00admary of the provisions of The Farm Products Marketing Act of Ontario, hereinafter referred to as \"the Act\" are set out in the reasons of other members of the Court.\nClause (l) of subs. (1) of s. 3 of the Act to which the first question refers is as follows:\nThe Board may, \u2026\n(1) authorize any marketing agency appointed under a scheme to conduct a pool or pools for the distribution of all moneys received from the sale of the regulated product and requiring any such marketing agency, after deducting all necessary and proper dis\u00adbursements and expenses, to distribute the proceeds of sale in such manner that each person receives a share of the total proceeds in relation to the amount, variety, size, grade and class of the regulated product delivered by him and to make an initial payment on delivery of the product and subsequent payments until the total net proceeds are distributed.\nThe main argument urged by Mr. Robinette against the validity of this clause is that it does not contemplate a pool\u00ading and sale of the regulated product by a marketing agency but rather purports to empower the Board to authorize the agency to take from the sellers of a regulated product a por\u00adtion of the price for which they have sold the product and to pay such portion over to other sellers of the product who have obtained a less favourable price; and that such legisla\u00adtion is beyond the powers of the Provincial Legislature for the reasons given by the Judicial Committee in Lower Mainland Dairy Products Sales Adjustment Committee v. Crystal Dairy, Limited[38]. Whether the clause does purport to authorize such compulsory equalization is a ques\u00adtion of the construction of the words used by the Legislature read with due regard to the other related provisions of the Act. The argument against the construction for which Mr. Robinette contends is put as follows in the factum of the Attorney General of Canada:\nThe interpretation to be adopted must, of course, be based on the assumption that there was a bona fide intention by the province to confine itself to its own sphere. It is submitted that the paragraph in question is open to the interpretation that it does not contemplate any \"equalization\", and, consequently, does not fall within the criticism adopted in the Crystal Dairy ease. The pooling of the product and the provision for the dis\u00adtribution of the sum realized should be interpreted as meaning that each producer will receive his aliquot share according to the amount, variety, size, grade and class of the product delivered by him. Upon this inter\u00adpretation, it is submitted that the provision is valid.\nand as follows in the factum of the Attorney-General for Ontario :\nIt is submitted that the above clause (1) of subsection (1) of Section 3 merely authorizes the mixing or pooling of the regulated product received by the marketing agency from various producers and selling the product in bulk instead of selling each individual producer's commodity separately, and the distribution of the proceeds after deducting all necessary and proper disbursements and expenses.\nIt will be observed that the clause makes no reference to pooling the product or to conducting a pool for the sale of the product; what is to go into the pool is all the money received from the sale of a regulated product. The opera\u00adtion of the clause appears to be confined to cases in which a marketing agency has been appointed under cl. (m) of s. 7 (1) of the Act which, as re-enacted by 1955, c. 21, s. 7, reads:\n7 (1) The Board may make regulations generally or with respect to any regulated product, \u2026\n(m) upon the recommendation of the local board, designating a mar\u00adketing agency through which a regulated product shall be marketed and requiring the regulated product to be marketed through the marketing agency.\nClause (o) of the same subsection is as follows :\n(o) where a marketing agency is designated for a regulated product, authorizing the marketing agency,\n(i) to direct and control, by order or direction, the marketing of the regulated product including the times and places at which the regulated product may be marketed, (ii) to determine the quantity, grade and class of the regulated product that shall be marketed by each producer,\n(iii) to prohibit the marketing of any class, variety, grade or size of the regulated product,\n(iv) to fix from time to time the price or prices that shall be paid to producers for the regulated product or any class, variety, grade or size of the regulated product and to fix different prices for different parts of Ontario,\n(v) to impose such service charges as may from time to time be fixed by the local board for the marketing of the regulated product,\n(vi) to pay to the local board from service charges imposed under subclause v its expenses in carrying out the purposes of the scheme,\n(vii) to require the price or prices to be paid to the producer for the regulated product to be forwarded to the marketing agency,\n(viii) to collect from any person by suit in any court of competent jurisdiction the price or prices of the regulated product owing to the producer.\nIt would appear from the provisions of clause (o), and particularly subclauses (vii) and (viii) thereof, that the Act envisages situations in which while the regulated prod\u00aduct is to be marketed through the designated marketing agency it is the producer and not the agency who becomes the vendor with whom the contract of sale is made and to whom the purchaser becomes indebted for the price. It also appears, particularly from subclause (iv), that the price received during the operation of a scheme by one pro\u00adducer, \"A\", for a quantity of the regulated product of a certain variety, size, grade and class may vary from time to time and from place to place from the price received by another producer, \"B\", for an equal quantity of the product of the same variety, size, grade and class. In such a situa\u00adtion the plain words of cl. (l) appear to me to empower the Board to authorize the marketing agency to distribute the total moneys received by it from the purchasers from \"A\" and \"B\" between \"A\" and \"B\" not having regard to the prices contracted to be paid to each of them but having regard only to the amount of the regulated product sold by each of them, in other words to make an equalization as was sought to be done by the legislation found to be invalid in the Crystal Dairy case.\nI am not unmindful of the rule that if the words of an enactment so permit they shall be construed in accordance with the presumption which imputes to the legislature the intention of limiting the operation of its enactments to matters within its allotted sphere; but this rule does not permit the adoption of a forced construction at variance with the plain meaning of the words employed.\nUsing the example I have given above, the clause in ques\u00adtion appears to me to empower the Board to authorize a marketing agency to deduct from the moneys received from the purchasers of the product of producer \"A\" not only \"all necessary and proper disbursements and expenses\" but also such amount as it may be necessary to add to the moneys received from the purchasers of the product of producer \"B\" to equalize the price received by \"A\" and \"B\" for prod\u00aducts of like variety, size, grade and class. The fact that the amount required to make the equalization will be deducted from moneys received by the marketing agency on behalf of the producers instead of being collected from them as an \"adjustment levy\" does not appear to me to enable us to distinguish the clause in question from the legislation declared to be invalid in the Crystal Dairy case.\nIn my opinion, question 1 should be answered in the affirmative.\nQuestions 2, 3 and 4 may conveniently be dealt with together, as Mr. Robinette and Mr. McFarlane have raised a fundamental objection to the validity of these orders which, in my opinion, must prevail. This is that the so-called scheme set out in sched. 1 to Regulation 104 of C.R.O. 1950 as amended and which is approved and declared to be in force by the Lieutenant-Governor in council is not a scheme within the meaning of the Act.\nIt is common ground that, if it exists, the authority of the Lieutenant-Governor in council to make Regulation 104 is derived from s. 4(2) of the Act, as amended by 1955, c. 21, s. 3, reading in part as follows:\nThe Lieutenant-Governor in Council may,\n(a) approve any scheme or any part thereof with such variations as he may deem proper and declare it to be in force in Ontario or any part thereof; and\n(b) notwithstanding subsection 1d, amend any approved scheme as he may deem proper.\nBy s. 1 (i) of the Act it is provided:\nIn this Act, \u2026\n(i) \"scheme\" means any scheme for the marketing or regulating of any farm product which is in force under this Act. Some of the meanings of the word \"scheme\" given in the Concise Oxford Dictionary and the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary are \"systematic arrangement proposed or in operation\", \"plan for doing something\", \"a plan of action devised in order to attain some end\". To come within the definition given in the Act the \"scheme\" must at least set out a plan for the marketing or for the regulating of some farm product. The name of the so-called scheme suggests that it is a plan for the marketing of hogs but it contains no plan for marketing at all. It simply purports to set up a local board and seven committees and while it prescribes in some detail the manner in which the members of these bodies are to be chosen, nothing is said as to their powers, purposes or duties; the scheme contains no word as to how the marketing is to be carried out; no plan is formulated. In my opinion it cannot be said to be a scheme.\nThe form of question 2 suggests that the regulation referred to was a consolidation or re-enactment in 1950 of an earlier regulation and was amended twice in 1955 but the material before the Court does not indicate the form of the \"scheme\" before such consolidation and amendments. However, its previous form does not appear to be material as the regulation in its present form, as printed in the case, is a complete enactment and it was not suggested that there is any scheme in force in Ontario for the marketing or regulating of hogs other than that set out in sched. 1 to the Regulation 104 which is before us.\nIf I am right in my conclusion that sched. 1 does not contain a scheme within the meaning of that term as used in the Act, it follows that the Lieutenant-Governor in council was not empowered to approve it or to declare it to be in force.\nIt must also follow that hogs are not a \"regulated prod\u00aduct\" as cl. (g) of s. 1 of the Act provides that that expression means \"a farm product in respect of which a scheme is in force\". It results from this that the Farm Products Marketing Board had no authority to make O.Reg. 102\/55 referred to in question 3. This regulation purports to be made in exercise of the powers given to the Board in s. 7 of the Act and all of these which are apt to enable the Board to make the regulation in question are predicated on the existence of a scheme and a regulated product.\nThe order dated June 8, 1955 made by The Ontario Hog Producers' Marketing Board referred to in question 4 purports to be made in exercise of the powers granted to it by s. 9 of O.Reg. 102\/55 and that regulation being, in my opinion, invalid it follows that The Ontario Hog Producers' Marketing Board had no authority to make the order in question.\nIn dealing with questions 5 and 6 there is this preliminary difficulty, that neither the order of reference nor the material in the case contains any information as to the terms of the schemes for the marketing of the products dealt with or as to how they are in fact carried out. During the argu\u00adment, the Court was furnished with printed copies of:\n(i) Regulation 109 of C.S.O. 1950 as amended by O.Reg. 144\/54 purporting to approve \"The Ontario Peach Growers' Marketing-for-Processing Scheme\".\n(ii) Ontario Regulations 146\/54 dealing with marketing of peaches for processing, setting up \"The Negotiating Committee for Peaches for Processing\" and \"The Nego\u00adtiating Committee for Selling and Transporting Peaches for Processing\" and providing for the constitution of a negotia\u00adting board in the event of the committees or either of them failing to arrive at an agreement on or before July 28 in any year. The purposes of the negotiating committees are set out in s. 3(1) and (2) as follows:\n3. (1) The Negotiating Committee for Peaches for Processing may adopt or determine by agreement\n(a) minimum prices for peaches or for any class, variety, grade or size of peaches,\n(b) terms of purchase and sale for peaches,\n(c) storage charges for peaches or for any class, variety, grade or size of peaches, and\n(d) conditions and form of contracts for the purchase and sale of peaches.\n(2) The Negotiating Committee for Selling and Transporting of Peaches for Processing may adopt or determine by agreement handling, transporting or selling charges by dealers for peaches which the dealers handle, transport or sell.\n(iii) Ontario Regulations 125\/52, purporting to approve \"The Ontario Vegetable Growers' Marketing-for-Processing Scheme\". (iv) Ontario Regulations 131\/52, as amended by O.Reg. 119\/53 and O.Reg. 43\/54, setting up a \"Negotiating Com\u00admittee\" having objects similar to those of the two com\u00admittees referred to in O.Reg. 146\/54, above, and a negotia\u00adting board.\nThe introduction of this material appears to me to place the Court in a dilemma. If the material is regarded as being before us as a basis for answers to the questions referred to us then for the reasons I have given above in answering questions 2, 3 and 4, \"The Ontario Peach Growers' Marketing-for-Processing Scheme\" and \"The Ontario Vegetable Growers' Marketing-for-Processing Scheme\" would both appear to be invalid and the regula\u00adtions referred to in questions 5 and 6 would fall with the schemes. If on the other hand the material is regarded as not being before us we have no sufficient basis on which to form an opinion as to whether the regulations referred to in questions 5 and 6 can be upheld, as was argued, as the imposition of fees for services rendered by the authorized instrumentalities of the Province: vide Shannon et al. v. Lower Mainland Dairy Products Board[39]. I am of opinion that there is not sufficient material before the Court to enable us to answer either question 5 or question 6.\nAs to question 7, cis. (i), (ii), and (iii) of the pro\u2014posed para. (ss) do not appear to be open to objection.\nIn dealing with cl. (iv) it must, I think, be assumed that the words \"any licence fees payable by the producer\" contemplate true licence fees such as the Legislature has power to impose or authorize and on this assumption the clause merely provides a method of collection of such fees and is unobjectionable.\nClause (v) purports to authorize the local board to use moneys compulsorily collected from producers of a product to make up the losses sustained by the board in purchasing the surplus of such product from other producers and resell\u00ading the same. In effect the board would be using such moneys to bring about an equalization, or a partial equal\u00adization, of the very sort which the Judicial Committee, in the Crystal Dairy case, held to be beyond the powers of the Legislature. The circumstance that the loss for which equalization is to be brought about is sustained by the local board in purchasing from the less fortunate producers and then reselling rather than by such producers themselves does not enable the nature of the legislation to be differen\u00adtiated from that considered in the Crystal Dairy case; nor does giving to the moneys which the producers are required to pay for this purpose the name of licence fees afford a sufficient ground of distinction. In my view clause (v) is ultra vires of the Legislature; and for similar reasons I am of the same opinion as to cl. (vi).\nFrom the wording of the opening clause of question 8, it would seem that, in view of my answer to question 7, it is not necessary for me to answer question 8, but it follows from the reasons I have given in answering question 7 that, in my opinion, the answer to question 8 would clearly be in the negative.\nThe answers which I would make to the questions sub\u00admitted depend on the construction which I put upon the words of the statute, particularly s. 3(1) (l) and the word \"scheme\", and upon the para. (ss) proposed to be added by amendment to s. 7(1). As the other members of the Court do not share my views on these matters of construction I desire to add that if I were able to construe the statute as my brother Rand does, I would, for the reasons which he has given, answer all the questions as he has done.\nMy answers to the questions referred to the Court are as follows:\nQuestion 1: Yes.\nQuestion 2: Yes, in whole.\nQuestion 3: Yes, in whole.\nQuestion 4: Yes.\nQuestions 5 and 6: On the material before the Court I find it impossible to answer either of these questions.\nQuestion 7: Clauses (v) and (vi) of the proposed para. (ss) are ultra vires of the Ontario Legislature.\nQuestion 8: No.\nFAUTEUX J.:\u2014By an order of His Excellency the Gover\u00adnor General in council (P.C. 1955-1865), dated Decem\u00adber 14, 1955, eight questions, with respect to the validity (i) of The Farm Products Marketing Act, R.S.O. 1950, e. 131, as up to then amended, (ii) of certain regulations and orders purported to be passed thereunder, and (iii) of a proposed amendment thereto, have been referred to this Court for consideration and answer. Subsequent to the date of this order of reference and prior to the hearing thereof, the Legislature of Ontario, by an amendment sanctioned on March 28, 1956 (1956, c. 20, s. 1), added to the Act s. la declaring that:\nThe purpose and intent of the Act is to provide for the control and regulation, in any or all respects, of the marketing within the Province of 'arm products, including the prohibition of such marketing in whole or in part.\n(The italics are mine.)\nIt is as thus amended that the validity of the Act is now being considered.\nThe scheme of the Act may be summarily described as follows: Ten per cent of the producers engaged, within a given area, in the production of a farm product, may pro\u00adpose the adoption of a compulsory scheme for marketing or regulating the farm product. If the scheme is approved by a certain majority of producers, the Farm Products Marketing Board, whose members are appointed by the Lieutenant-Governor in council, may recommend its adop\u00adtion to the latter who may approve it with such variations as deemed proper and declare it in force. Marketing opera\u00adtions under the scheme are conducted by a local board in accordance with the terms of the scheme but the Board may also designate marketing agencies. The scheme may include a system of licensing of persons engaged in producing, mar\u00adketing or processing the regulated product. This licensing is done under the regulations made by the Board which may prohibit persons from engaging in such operations, except under the authority of a licence. Licence fees, to be used by the local board for the purpose of carrying out and enforcing the Act, the regulations and the scheme, may be authorized by the Board. The actual direction of the mar\u00adketing is done by either the Board, a local board or a mar\u00adketing agency which, appointed by and acting pursuant to the regulations of the Board, directs and controls the mar\u00adketing of the product. The marketing agency may be authorized to conduct a pool for the distribution of all moneys received from sales of the product and having deducted its necessary and proper disbursements and expenses, to distribute the proceeds of sales in such a man\u00adner that each person receives a share in relation to the amount, variety, size, grade and class of the regulated prod\u00aduct delivered by him. Violators of any provisions of the Act, of the regulations, of the schemes declared to be in force, or of any order or direction of the Board, local board or marketing agency, shall be guilty of an offence and liable to monetary penalties.\nThere are at present in operation 14 marketing schemes covering 21 farm products. Three of these schemes, relating to hogs, peaches and vegetables respectively, have been referred to this Court.\nCertain general principles, related to the validity of mar\u00adketing legislation, may expediently be stated before enter\u00ading into the individual consideration of each of the questions.\nThe regulation of the marketing of farm products within the Province exclusively is within the legislative com\u00adpetence of the Provincial Legislature and not of Parliament. In Attorney-General of British Columbia v. Attorney-General of Canada et al.[40], the Natural Products Market\u00ading Act, 1934, enacted by Parliament, was held to be ultra vires substantially for the reason that it covered transactions completed within the Province and having no con\u00adnection with interprovincial or export . trade. Later, in Shannon et al. v. Lower Mainland Dairy Products Board[41], the Natural Products Marketing (British Columbia) Act, 1936, providing for the regulation of marketing within the Province, was held intra vires. Such valid regulatory scheme may be carried out and enforced through the means of a licence scheme provided for by a Provincial Legislature for, as stated by Lord Atkin in the Shannon case, supra, at p. 721:\nIf regulation of trade within the Province has to be held valid, the ordinary method of regulating trade, i.e., by a system of licences, must also be admissible.\nUnder its licensing power, derived from heads 9, 13 and 16 of s. 92 of the British North America Act, a Provincial Legislature may raise money to defray the costs of operation of such valid regulatory scheme. Lord Atkin, immediately following the passage quoted above from his reasons in the Shannon case, says:\n... if licences are granted, it appears to be no objection that fees should be charged in order either to defray the costs of administering the local regulation or to increase the general funds of the Province, or for both purposes.\nAgain, in the same case, at p. 722, the learned lord continues:\nThe impugned provisions can also ... be supported on the grounds accepted by Martin C.J. in his judgment on the reference-namely, that they are fees for services rendered by the Province, or by its authorized instrumentalities, under the powers given by s. 92(13) and (16) ... On these grounds, the attack based on the powers to exact licence fees must be held to fail.\nUnder the authority of the Shannon case, supra, this Court in Ontario Boys' Wear Limited et al. v. The Advisory Committee et al.[42], dealing with a compulsory levy to help to defray the expenses of administering codes of work\u00ading conditions under The Industrial Standards Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 191, stated at p. 359:\nIf the assessment be a tax, it is a direct tax within the meaning of the decisions of the Judicial Committee and of this Court; and, in any event, it may be justified as a fee for services rendered by the Province or by its authorized instrumentalities under the powers given provincial legislatures by section 92(13) and (16) of the British North America Act.\nFinally, and as such licence-fees need not meet the test of direct taxation, the variable character of the amount of the payment is not objectionable. This was affirmed by the Ontario Court of Appeal and the correctness of this affirma\u00adtion was not questioned by the Privy Council in Brewers' and Maltsters' Association of Ontario v. The Attorney-General for Ontario[43].\nDealing now with the submissions made at hearing with respect to each of the questions referred:\nThe first and the only question bearing on the Act itself is directed to cl. (l) of subs. (1) of s. 3, enabling the Farm Products Marketing Board to\nauthorize any marketing agency appointed under a scheme to conduct a, pool or pools for the distribution of all moneys received from the sale of the regulated product and requiring any such marketing agency, after deducting all necessary and proper disbursements and expenses, to distribute the proceeds of sale in such manner that each person receives a, share of the total proceeds in relation to the amount, variety, size, grade and class of the regulated product delivered by him and to make an initial payment on delivery of the product and subsequent payments until the total net proceeds are distributed.\nAs formulated, the submission of invalidity as to this clause is that the deduction of all necessary and proper disburse\u00adments and expenses involves taxation of each producer and that there being allegedly a tendency for the tax to be passed on, the taxation is indirect and therefore the clause is ultra vires the Legislature. Compulsory equalization of payment and compulsory deduction, it is said, amount to indirect taxation. To support these views, reliance is placed on the decisions (i) of the Judicial Committee in Lower Mainland Dairy Products Sales Adjustment Committee v. Crystal Dairy, Limited[44], and of this Court in (ii) Lower Mainland Dairy Products Board et al. v. Turner's Dairy Limited et al.[45] and (iii) in The Prince Edward Island Potato Marketing Board v. H. B. Willis Incorporated[46].\nThe factual situation which the Legislature of British Columbia intended to correct, as well as the remedial laws it passed for that purpose and which were impugned in the Crystal Dairy and the Turner's Dairy cases, have no relevant similarity to the factual and legal situations here involved. It being more profitable to dairy farmers to sell milk in a fluid form than to sell products manufactured from it, the market for fluid milk became glutted. To remedy this situation, the Legislature compelled traders in fluid milk to transfer a portion of the returns obtained by them in the fluid milk market to the traders in the manu\u00adfactured products market. These contributions of the fluid milk traders, called \"adjustment levies\", as well as the col\u00adlection of moneys for the operation of the scheme, desig\u00adnated as \"expense levies\", were held to be ultra vires: the adjustment levies, because they amounted to indirect taxa\u00adtion, and the expense levies, being ancillary thereto, were held to share the same jural nature. In both the Crystal Dairy and Turner's Dairy cases, though achieved by differ\u00adent methods, there was compulsory equalization of returns, traders of processed milk products receiving more, at the expense of traders in the fluid milk products. Under the Act here considered, there is no pooling of returns but a pooling of products aiming at more advantageous market\u00ading and, hence, returns: each producer remaining entitled to receive out of the total returns\u2014all necessary and proper disbursements and expenses being deducted\u2014his share according to the amount, variety, size, grade and class of the product he pooled with the other producers. The object of the compulsory equalization and compulsory deduction is not here the same as in the Crystal Dairy and Turner's Dairy cases, supra. In its normal operation, and this under the authorities is the test, the Act, in pith and substance, does not contemplate that one producer or one class of producers should contribute part of his or its returns to another producer or class of producers.\nIn the Prince Edward Island case, supra, order no. 6, related to order no. 2, of the Potato Board, was held ultra vires because the impugned provisions thereof were found by some members of the Court to be referable to inter-provincial or export trade and, by others, to involve indirect taxation; there being in both cases no proper federal legis\u00adlative provisions enabling the Board to so provide. This decision is here only invoked in support of the contention that cl. (l) involves indirect taxation. Assuming that the deduction authorized under this clause would amount to taxation, the opinions expressed in the Prince Edward Island case cannot, in my view, support the proposition that it amounts to indirect taxation for there is no similarity in the operation of the two schemes with respect to the charge. Under the normal operation of cl. (l), the total return received by the agency from the sale of the pooled regulated product, as well as the total amount of the necessary and proper disbursements and expenses incurred by the agency for its marketing are both unknown until after completion of the marketing operation. The portion of the total expenses which is subsequently determined and charged against the return to which each producer is entitled on the basis of the quantity and quality of the product he pooled with other producers cannot be compared to the charge considered in the Prince Edward Island case and, of its nature and character, cannot acquire a tendency to enter as such into the price of the commodity. These deductible expenses are expenses actually incurred for the operation of a marketing scheme designed to bring to each producer a benefit ultimately measured by the amount, variety, size, grade and class of the regulated prod\u00aduct pooled for more effective marketing and hence better returns; they are meant to be in lieu of the expenses which, in the absence of the scheme, each producer would have to incur to market, under comparable conditions, his own product. They do not involve taxation but are tantamount to a service charge and as such it is quite immaterial, under the authority of the ,Shannon case, supra, whether or not the charge has a tendency to enter into the price of the commodity. This test has been formulated simply to dis\u00adtinguish direct from indirect taxation. We were also referred to Lawson v. Interior Tree Fruit and Vegetable Committee of Direction[47], but it must be noted that the views therein expressed must now be read in the light of those stated by the Judicial Committee in the Shannon case.\nThe next three questions\u2014questions 2, 3 and 4 of the reference\u2014are related to the hog scheme. The original provisions with respect to this scheme appear in O.Reg. 52\/46, subsequently amended and then replaced by O.Reg. 93\/49 and O.Reg. 94\/49, both of which, with some modifica\u00adtions intervening, were consolidated in 1950 to become C.R.O. 1950, nos. 104 and 105 respectively. Summarily, the scheme provides for: the establishment of a local board; the regulating of the marketing by regulations made by the Provincial Board; the licensing by the boards of processors and shippers, but not producers; the setting up of an agency through which exclusively hogs have to be marketed; the authority of the agency to direct marketing, to fix from time to time prices to be paid to producers and to impose service charges; the reception by the agency of the sales-price and its remittance to producers less service charges; and the imposition by the agency of a service charge fixed, by order of the local board, at 24\u00a2 per hog and a pro rating charge of 200 per settlement account. The first question related to this scheme is whether Regu\u00adlation 104 of C.R.O. 1950, as amended by O.Reg. 100\/55 and O.Reg. 104\/55, is ultra vires the Lieutenant-Governor in council, either in whole or in part, and if so, in what par\u00adticular or particulars and to what extent.\nThe main submission is that the scheme is applicable to the sale of hogs generally, for import and export as well, and as such regulates trade within the meaning of head 2 of s. 91 of the British North America Act and therefore is ultra vires. In support of this submission, reference was made to ss. 1a and 1b of sched. 1, reading:\nINTERPRETATION\n1a. In this scheme\n(a) \"hogs\" means hogs produced in Ontario except that part thereof comprising the territorial districts and the Provisional County of Haliburton;\n(b) \"processing\" means the slaughtering of hogs; and\n(c) \"producer\" means a producer engaged in production of hogs.\nAPPLICATION OF SCHEME\n1b. This scheme applies to hogs marketed either directly or indirectly for processing but does not apply to\n(a) hogs sold by a producer\n(i) to a producer, or\n(ii) to a consumer, or\n(iii) to a retail butcher, and\n(b) hogs resold by a processor who bought the hogs under this scheme.\nWith respect to importation: It is clear from the above provisions that hogs produced elsewhere than in Ontario are not covered by the scheme. It is equally clear from s. 1a(c) read with the provisions of s. 4 of the scheme, which for the whole purpose thereof provides for the grouping of hog producers by districts within the Province, that producers beyond its boundaries are not affected either. In the result, anyone in Ontario is free to import therein and anyone beyond its boundaries to export thereto the regulated product.\nWith respect to exportation: Were the words \"within the Province\", expressed or held to be implied after each of the words \"marketed\" and \"processing\" appearing in the open\u00ading provision of s. lb, the submission that an Ontario pro\u00adducer is barred from marketing the regulated product else\u2014where than in the Province would fail; and in my view it must be so held for the following reasons. Reference has already been made to the declaratory provision, added to the Act by the Legislature in 1956, and formally stating that: \"The purpose and intent of the Act is to provide for the control and regulation, in any or all respects, of the marketing within the Province of farm prod\u00aducts, including the prohibition of such marketing in whole or in part.\" This provision imports an all-embracing rule of construction with respect to the Act and also with respect to the legislative provisions authorized to be made there-under, for expressions used in orders in council, orders, schemes and regulations are to be given \"the same meaning as in the Act conferring the power\" to make them: The Interpretation Act, R.S.O. 1950, e. 184, s. 6. Thus, the word \"marketing\" defined in s. 1(e) of the Act means \"marketing within the Province\" and a similar meaning attends the word \"marketed\" appearing in the opening provisions of s. lb of Reg. 104. As clearly appears in the latter provision, the operation, to which the scheme applies, is not that of marketing or that of processing, both simpliciter, but that of \"marketing for processing\", i.e., a form of marketing operation, which cannot here be interpreted as one carried beyond the Province without disregarding the formal statement of the 1956 amendment. The amendment is subse\u00adquent to the impugned regulation, but the presumption against construing statutes retrospectively, which was invoked, is inapplicable to an Act which, like the amending Act of 1956, is declaratory in its nature; such Acts, unless providing the contrary, have relation back to the time when the prior Act was passed: Attorney-General v. Theobald[48] ; see also Craies on Statute Law, 5th ed. 1952, p. 364. The marketing in Ontario of hogs produced in Ontario for processing, i.e., slaughtering, in Ontario, is the sole transaction or particular business controlled and regulated under the scheme.\nOther considerations also attend such interpretation. There is a presumptio juris as to the existence of the bona fide intention of a legislative body to confine itself to its own sphere and a presumption of similar nature that general words in a statute are not intended to extend its operation beyond the territorial authority of the Legisla\u00adture. These presumptions are not displaced by the language used in the relevant legislative provisions applicable to this scheme when read as a whole. Indeed such provisions con\u00adsistently imply the intention of the Legislature to restrict the application of the scheme to intraprovincial transactions. Section 2(1) of Reg. 102\/55 prohibiting processors from commencing or continuing in the business of process\u00ading except under the authority of a licence surely cannot be said to be applicable to processors beyond the limits of the Province of Ontario,\nHaving reached the view that the transaction covered by the scheme is intraprovincial, I do not find it necessary or expedient to define in general terms what constitutes an intraprovincial transaction. The suggestion that to be intraprovincial a transaction must be completed within the Province, in the sense that the product, object of the trans-action, must be ultimately and exclusively consumed or be sold for delivery therein for such consumption, is one which would, if carried to its logical conclusion, strip from a Prov\u00adince its recognized power to provide for the regulation of marketing within such Province in disregard of the decisions of the Judicial Committee in Attorney-General for British Columbia v. Attorney-General for Canada et al., supra, and in Shannon v. Lower Mainland Dairy Products Board, supra.\nThat joint action of Parliament and of the Legislature may better solve the difficulties arising in particular cases is well known to those entrusted with the government of the nation and the Provinces but provides no answer to the questions here referred for consideration.\nThe invalidity of the regulation is also contended for on the basis that: (i) It does not constitute a scheme under the Act but merely provides for the establishment of a local board; (ii) it is ultra vires the Lieutenant-Governor in council to create a local board and to adopt this scheme, con\u00adstituting an entirely new scheme, without prior approval of producers. As already indicated, the original hog scheme was set up by O.Reg. 52\/46, the reading of which shows compliance with statutory prerequisites for its adoption by the Lieutenant-Governor in council. Ever since the adop\u00adtion of O.Reg. 52\/46, the scheme related to hogs was main\u00adtained, though the original legislative provisions related thereto were amended, replaced, and consolidated to become ultimately, in form and substance, what they now are. None of the arguments advanced substantiates these objec\u00adtions and, on further consideration, nothing was found to support the proposition that the wide powers given, under the Act, to the Lieutenant-Governor in council, particularly under s. 4(2) (b), have been exceeded.\nThe second question related to the hog scheme, question 3 of the reference, is whether O.Reg. 102\/55 respecting the marketing of hogs is ultra vires the Farm Products Market\u00ading Board either in whole or in part and, if so, in what par\u00adticular or particulars and to what extent. This regulation of the Board, approved by the Lieutenant-Governor in council, replaced C.R.O. 1950, No. 105, consolidating O.Reg. 94\/49, O.Reg. 99\/50 and O.Reg. 215\/50.\nHere again it was submitted that there is nothing in the regulations to confine the marketing to marketing within the Province. This point has already been considered and disposed of.\nThe next attack is related to s. 6 of the regulations pro\u00adviding that all hogs shall be marketed, and that no person shall market hogs except, through the marketing agency therein designated. The argument is that s. 6 is repugnant to s. 25 of the Live Stock and Live Stock Products Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 167, enacting that:\nNotwithstanding anything in this Part, any farmer or drover may sell his own live stock at a stockyard on his own account.\nSection 25 appears in Part I of the Act referred to, which part deals with the internal operation of stockyards. In its very terms, the section is not attributive but protective of the right farmers or drovers may otherwise have to sell their own livestock at a stockyard on their own account. The fact that, on proper provincial marketing legislation, this right is to be exercised through the instrumentality of a marketing agency is entirely a different matter. The provisions of s. 6 are not, in my view, repugnant to those of s. 25; but, were they held to be so, the question of the validity of those of s. 25 would then immediately arise, for under undisputed principles, regulating the marketing of farm products within a Province is within the exclusive legislative competence of the Legislature and not of Parliament. The next attack is directed to s. 8 of the regulations which, it is said, involves delegation unauthorized by s. 7(1)(o) of the Act. The latter section enumerates a number of functions which the Board may, by regulation, authorize a designated marketing agency to perform. Pursu\u00adant to that power, the Board, by s. 8, allotted to the mar\u00adketing agency therein designated certain functions, all being referable to, and couched in similar language as in, s. 7(1)(o). This is not a delegation to legislate but an authority to perform administrative duties. The case of The Attorney General of Canada v. Brent[49], quoted in support of this objection, has no relevancy.\nFollowing the line of argument adopted with respect to questions 1 or 2 of the reference, similar points were raised with respect to O.Reg. 102\/55. Thus it was said that ss. 9 and 10 involve indirect taxation, that in making these regulations, the authority of the Board was exceeded, mainly for the reason that a new scheme, unapproved by the producers, is set up. As to these points, reference is made to what has already been said.\nIt was also argued that these marketing legislative provisions conflict with certain federal laws, namely, (i) the Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 314, and the provisions of the Criminal Code relating to combines; and (ii) the Agricultural Prices Support Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 3. As to (i) : A like submission was unsuccessfully made in Rex v. Cherry[50] and Ontario Boys' Wear Limited et al. v. The Advisory Committee et al., supra. The object of Parliament in legislating with respect to private agreements involving monopolies is to protect the public interest in free competition. The adoption by Parliament of an \"Act to assist and encourage co-operative marketing of agricultural products\", 3 Geo. VI, c. 28, now R.S.C. 1952, c. 5, does not suggest that marketing schemes devised by Parliament or a Legislature within their respec\u00adtive fields, are prima facie to be held to come within the scope of the anti-monopoly legislation. As to (ii) : Under the Agricultural Prices Support Act, a Board constituted of members appointed by the Governor General in council is, under certain conditions, given authority to fix the prices at which it may itself either purchase agricultural products or pay to the producers thereof the difference between such fixed price and the average market-price, thus, as the title of the Act suggests, supporting the price of such products. The intent and purpose of both Acts alleged to be in conflict are quite different. Both are intended to assist producers. One, however, i.e., the Act here considered, aims at procuring maximum returns by means of orderly marketing, while the other aims at assuring minimum returns, under certain circumstances and conditions. The Ontario Legis\u00adlature cannot be presumed to have intended its legislation to be operative beyond the limits of its own sphere and con\u00adtrary to any federal legislation validly adopted.\nThe last question related to the hog scheme, the fourth in the reference, is whether the order dated June 8, 1955, made by The Ontario Hog Producers' Marketing Board, fixing the service charges to be imposed by the marketing agency, is ultra vires the said board. This order, made by the local board, i.e., The Ontario Hog Producers' Market\u00ading Board, under s. 9 of O.Reg. 102\/55, fixed the service charges to be imposed by the marketing agency, i.e., the Ontario Hog Producers Co-operative, at \"the sum of 24\u00a2 per hog and a pro rating charge of 20\u00a2 per producer settlement statement\". On the statement of facts appearing in the order of reference, the said marketing agency is a co-operative corporation incorporated under Part V of The Corporations Act, 1953 (Ont.), c. 19, and its by-laws provide that any surplus of service charges, after providing for reserves, shall be allocated, credited or paid to those mar\u00adketing hogs through the agency, and computed at a rate in relation to the value of hogs marketed by such person. It is said that the order is invalid for the reason that neither the Act nor the regulation contemplates a service charge of that nature and that, in any event, indirect taxation is involved. The contention that the service charges, author\u00adized under the Act and the regulation, involve any form of taxation has already been considered and found to be unsupported; and nothing that was said substantiates the proposition that the service charges fixed by order of the local board are of a different nature than those authorized under the Act and the regulation. The argument for the contrary view stems from the fact that the by-laws of the marketing agency provide for setting up reserves before a distribution of surplus service charges, if any, is made. As stated in the Shannon case, supra, fees for services rendered by the Province or by its authorized instrumentalities may validly be charged, under the powers given in s. 92(13) and (16) of the British North America Act. Such service charges are not invalid merely because they may exceed the actual expenses of the recipient. The nature of the use thereafter made of such surplus might, in certain cases, indicate a colourable attempt to tax or do indirectly what could not validly be done directly, but nothing that was submitted to us supports the contention that any such use is here contemplated.\nBy questions 5 and 6 in the order of reference, we are asked to consider the validity of s. 7 of O.Reg. 145\/54 and s. 5 of O.Reg. 126\/52, both sections imposing \"licence fees\" to be paid to the local board by every grower engaged in the production for processing of peaches and vegetables respec\u00adtively. Invalidity of these two sections is contended for on the basis that they are a colourable attempt to raise money under the guise of a licence and that their true effect is to raise money by taxation. The marketing of peaches and vegetables for processing is controlled by regulations of the Provincial Board which prohibit any person from engaging in the business of a grower, processor or dealer, in the case of peaches, and of processor, in the case of vegetables, unless he is or is deemed to be, under the regulations, the holder of a licence from the Board, for which no specific charge is made to the grower. Under the regulations, each grower of peaches or vegetables for processing is \"deemed to be the holder of a licence in form I\". The \"licence fees\" imposed upon the grower of peaches are at the rate of 50\u00a2 for each ton or fraction thereof of peaches delivered to a processor; under the scheme related to vegetables, the \"licence fees\" imposed upon every grower are at the rate of one-half of 1 per cent of the total sale-price due him for each ton or fraction thereof of vegetables delivered to and processed by, the processor. These \"licence fees\" are col\u00adlected by the processor by deducting them from the sum of money due to the person from whom peaches or vegetables were received, and are remitted to the local board. What functions are performed by The Ontario Peach Growers' Marketing Board and The Ontario Vegetable Growers' Marketing Board, being, respectively, the local boards appointed under these schemes, is not clear from the material submitted; however, we were given, at the hearing, the unchallenged information that the local boards negotiate the price to be paid for these products and that the fees charged to growers were meant to defray expenses thus incurred for the operation of the schemes. On the facts stated in the order of reference, one ton of peaches makes 144 dozen 20-ounce cans of peaches or 1,728 cans. For reasons already given, these \"licence fees\" are, in my view, tantamount to a service charge which can validly be imposed under the authority of the Province. Furthermore, there is no evidence as to the extent of the expenses incurred by these local boards for the operation of the schemes; and the amount of fees which each grower has to pay, when related to his returns, does not suggest that taxa\u00adtion is involved in the service charge.\nThe last two questions, questions 7 and 8 of the reference, are related to the proposed amendment of the Act adding to subs. (1) of s. 7 para. (ss), conferring upon a local board the additional powers described in subparagraphs num\u00adbered from (i) to (vi) inclusively. Under subparas. (v) and (vi), one of the purposes for which the use of licence fees is authorized, is to make some form of equalization payment. To that extent the provisions of these subpara\u00adgraphs cannot be validly adopted by the Province, in view of the decisions of the Judicial Committee and of this Court in the Crystal Dairy and the Turner's Dairy cases respectively.\nMy answers to the questions referred to the Court are therefore as follows:\nQuestion 1: No.\nQuestion 2: No.\nQuestion 3: No.\nQuestion 4: No.\nQuestions 5 and 6: No. Question 7: Subparagraph (v) except to the extent that it authorizes the use of licence fees to pay expenses of the local board, and the whole of subpara. (vi), of the proposed para. (ss), are ultra vires the Ontario Legislature.\nQuestion 8: No.\nABBOTT J.:\u2014I have had an opportunity of considering the able and exhaustive reasons prepared by my brother Fauteux and I am in agreement with the views which he has expressed. I desire only to add a few brief observations.\nThe Farm Products Marketing Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 131, is in the usual form of marketing legislation in Canada. With the inclusion of s. la, added in March 1956, the Act contains, in substance, the same provisions as the Natural Products Marketing (British Columbia) Act, R.S.B.C. 1936, c. 165, which was before the Judicial Committee in Shannon et al. v. Lower Mainland Dairy Products Board[51], and the Agricultural Products Marketing (Prince Edward Island) Act, 1940 (P.E.I.), c. 40, which was before this Court in The Prince Edward Island Potato Marketing Board v. H. B. Willis Incorporated[52].\nIt might be noted, perhaps, that the British Columbia Act covered \"any product of agriculture, or of the forest, sea, lake, or river\". The Ontario Act is somewhat more limited in its application and relates only to farm products.\nIn its essential features, the Ontario Act is, in my opinion, indistinguishable from the British Columbia Act, which was held by the Judicial Committee in Shannon's Case to be an Act to regulate particular businesses entirely within the Province and therefore intra vires of the Province. Pre\u00adsumably because of the decision in Shannon's Case no ques\u00adtion as to the validity of the Prince Edward Island Act was raised on the reference to this Court and it was assumed to be intra vires for the purposes of that reference. Each marketing scheme adopted under an Act such as the one under consideration, and the regulations applicable to such scheme, must, of course, be looked at to see whether they come within the authority conferred by the Act, but, as I have stated, I share the view expressed by my brother Fauteux that The Farm Products Marketing Act of Ontario, including cl. (l) of subs. (1) of s. 3, is intra vires the Ontario Legislature.\nTurning now to the three schemes which are the subject-matter of the present reference, the hog scheme applies only to hogs produced in Ontario and marketed, i.e., sold, for processing in Ontario. The compulsory features of the scheme are (1) licensing requirements and the imposition of licence fees and service charges and (2) prohibition of the sale of live hogs produced in Ontario to a processor in Ontario except through a designated marketing agency. The hog scheme regulates only the sale of live hogs pro\u00adduced in Ontario to a processor in Ontario for slaughtering in that Province. It does not purport to interfere with either (a) the sale of live or dressed hogs to anyone in Ontario other than a processor in Ontario, or (b) the impor\u00adtation or exportation of live or dressed hogs by anyone in Ontario. In the scheme \"processing\" is defined as meaning the slaughtering of hogs.\nThe peach scheme and the vegetable scheme are primarily licensing schemes, with powers given to what is described as a negotiating committee, to negotiate minimum prices, to establish contract conditions and the like. The only compulsory provisions appear to be the licence requirements and the imposition of licence fees. There are no compulsory marketing provisions as in the case of the hog scheme. What is regulated under all three schemes is the sale of locally-produced hogs, peaches and vegetables, to a proces\u00adsor for processing in the Province. All three schemes contemplate the regulation of dealings in particular commodi\u00adties in a particular way, not of trade in such commodities as a whole.\nIt has long been settled that rights arising out of or in connection with contracts, such as a contract of sale made in a Province between a producer and a processor, are civil rights within the meaning of head 13 of s. 92 of the British North America Act and as such within the legislative power of a Province: The Citizens Insurance Company of Canada v. Parsons; The Queen Insurance Company v. Parsons[53]. In John Deere Plow Company, Limited v. Wharton[54], Viscount Haldane L.C., referring to the words \"civil rights\", said :\nAn abstract logical definition of their scope is not only, having regard to the context of ss. 91 and 92 of the Act, impracticable, but is certain, if attempted, to cause embarrassment and possible injustice in future cases.\nIn my opinion it would be equally impracticable and undesirable to attempt an abstract logical definition of what constitutes interprovincial or export trade. Each transaction must be looked at, in order to ascertain whether or not, in fact, it involves such trade. It is also dangerous, I think, on a reference such as this to go beyond the terms of the reference and to attempt to decide, by analogy, ques\u00adtions which are not submitted for the opinion of the Court.\nAside from the attack made on the licence fees imposed under the three schemes, as being indirect taxation, which has been fully dealt with by my brother Fauteux, the prin\u00adcipal attack made on the validity of these schemes was that they purport to regulate extraprovincial trade.\nIt is hard to conceive of any important article of com\u00admerce, produced in any Province, which would not, to some extent at least, enter into interprovincial or export trade. Certainly milk, which was the product regulated in Shannon's Case, in its processed form at any rate, must be exported from British Columbia. Similarly it is common knowledge that potatoes in substantial quantities are shipped out of Prince Edward Island.\nThe power to regulate the sale within a Province of specific products, is not, in my opinion, affected by reason of the fact that some, or all, of such products may subse\u00adquently, in the same or in an altered form, be exported from that Province, unless it be shown, of course, that such regulation is merely a colourable device for assuming con\u00adtrol of extraprovincial trade. Similarly, the power to regulate the wages of those engaged in processing such prod\u00aducts within a Province, is not affected by the fact that the resulting product may be exported, although it is obvious that the scale of such wages would have a significant effect upon the export price. It is the immediate effect, object or purpose, not possible consequential effects, that are relevant, in determining whether The Farm Products Market\u00ading Act of Ontario and the three schemes adopted under it, which are the subject of the present reference, are laws in relation to a matter falling within Provincial legisla\u00adtive competence. As Viscount Simon said in Attorney-General for Saskatchewan v. Attorney-General for Canada et al.[55]\nConsequential effects are not the same thing as legislative subject-matter. It is \"the true nature and character of the legislation\"\u2014not its ultimate economic results\u2014that matters.\nWhat is regulated under these schemes is not the farm product itself but certain transactions involving that prod\u00aduct, and the transaction which is regulated is completed before the product is consumed either in its original or in some processed form. Processing may take many forms and the original product may be changed out of all recognition. The place where the resulting product may be consumed, therefore, is not in my opinion conclusive, as a test to determine by what legislative authority a particular transaction involving such farm product may validly be regulated.\nAs I have stated, the fact that some, or all, of the result\u00ading product, after processing, may subsequently enter into extraprovincial or export trade does not, in my view, alter the fact that the three schemes submitted in this reference, regulate particular businesses carried on entirely within Provincial legislative jurisdiction, and are therefore intra vires.\nMy answers to the questions referred to the Court are therefore as follows:\nQuestion 1: No.\nQuestion 2: No.\nQuestion 3: No.\nQuestion 4: No.\nQuestion 5: No.\nQuestion 6: No. Question 7: Subparagraph (v), except to the extent that it authorizes the use of licence fees to pay expenses of the local board, and the whole of subpara. (vi) of the proposed para. (ss) are ultra vires the Ontario Legislature.\nQuestion 8: No.\nNOLAN J. agrees in the reasons and answers of LOCKE J.\n[ScanLII Collection]\n[1] (1881), 7 App. Cas. 96 at 113.\n[2] [1938] &C.R. 100 at 121, [1938] 2 D.L.R. 81, affirmed sub nom.

Co., G shot the constable and that C, \"in complicity with [G], was a party with [G] to the said crime of murder\". Both accused were convicted and appealed. G's appeal was dismissed but a new trial was ordered for C on grounds of misdirection. The Crown appealed.\nHeld (Locke and Cartwright JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the conviction should be restored.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Fauteux and Abbott JJ.: There was evidence that G and C formed an intention in common to carry out the unlawful purpose of robbery with violence, and to assist each other therein, that in carrying out that common purpose G committed murder, and that C knew, or ought to have known, that murder would be a probable consequence. It was unnecessary to decide whether the words \"in carrying out the common purpose\" in s. 21(2) of the Criminal Code should be construed as requiring acts going beyond mere preparation for an offence and amounting to an attempt as defined in s. 24, because in this case the evidence disclosed that the acts of the two accused did in fact amount to an attempt to rob.\nSection 24(2) requires the presiding judge to determine, as a matter of law, whether or not the acts of the accused constitute an attempt, but that determination must be in substance a finding of fact. His function is not merely to decide, in a given case, that there is no evidence of an attempt and therefore withdraw that issue from the jury, but also to decide, as a question of fact and law, whether what was done, if found by the jury, amounted to an attempt. Regina v. Miskell, [1954] 1 W.L.R. 438 at 440, does not express the law of Canada as laid down in s. 24(2).\nThere was no evidence from which the jury could have found that the common intention had been abandoned before the constable was shot. In any event, this issue was not withdrawn from the jury; it was left to them to find whether it had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the common intention persisted.\nPer Rand J.: Assuming that the Crown, because of the position taken by counsel in opening, was bound to prove an intent to rob W. Co. rather than a mere intent to reconnoitre with or without an intent to rob generally, the trial judge had made it clear to the jury that the intent that they must find was the specific one to rob W. Co. It was by no means clear that s. 21(2) was restricted to cases where an attempted offence had been reached but, in any event, the trial judge's finding that the acts alleged, if the jury found them to have been done, amounted to an attempt, could not be successfully challenged. Although there was no direct evidence that it was part of the common intention to overcome all resistance by force of arms, that intention could be found as an inference from the total circumstances of the case. The question of an abandonment of the intent to rob had not been withdrawn from the jury.\nPer Locke J., dissenting: It is not a necessary element of liability under s. 21(2) that the acts done in carrying out the common purpose should be such as to amount to an attempt, as defined in s. 24, but what was said by the trial judge in this case amounted to taking away from the jury the decision of the question of fact as to whether there had been an attempt.\nFurther, there was evidence on which the jury might have found that, even assuming that there had been an attempt, it had been abandoned at the time of the shooting. Although the trial judge told the jury that this question was for them, he also told them on two occasions that there was no evidence that the attempt had been abandoned, and the effect of this would be that the jury would not consider the matter.\nPer Cartwright J., dissenting: If, as was probable from the charge, the jury were directing their minds to s. 202 (d) (i) in connection with C's guilt, it was of vital importance that they should consider whether G caused the constable's death while committing or attempting to commit robbery. Assuming, without deciding, that the trial judge was right in telling the jury that if they found the facts which he outlined to them they must accept his ruling that both the accused had committed the offence of attempted robbery, he was wrong in withdrawing from them (as in fact he did) the question whether the attempt had been abandoned before the firing of the fatal shots. What he told them in effect was that if they once found that the attempt to rob was made, they had no choice but to find that that attempt continued up to the time of the shooting. Since there was evidence on which the jury might have found that the attempt, if made, had been abandoned, the verdict could not stand\u2026. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia [1], setting aside the conviction of the respondent for murder, and ordering a new trial. Appeal allowed.\nWilliam A. Schultz, Q.C., for the appellant.\nNorman D. Mullins, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Fauteux and Abbott JJ. was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014This is an appeal by the Attorney-General for British Columbia from a decision of the Court of Appeal for that Province [2], setting aside the conviction of murder of the respondent Carey and directing a new trial. The appeal is based upon the grounds of dissent of Mr. Justice Sidney Smith.\nCarey and Gordon were jointly indicted for the murder of police constable Sinclair on December 7, 1955, at the city of Vancouver, the allegation being that Gordon fired the bullet, or bullets, which killed Sinclair and that Carey \"in complicity with the said Joseph Gordon, was a party with the said Joseph Gordon to the said crime of murder\". A motion by Carey for a separate trial was denied. Gordon called witnesses and testified himself in an endeavour to prove an alibi but Carey elected to call no witnesses and did not go into the witness-box. At the conclusion of a very lengthy trial both accused were found guilty. Gordon's conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeal and his application for leave to appeal to this Court was dismissed.\nIn his factum Mr. Mullins, counsel for the respondent, set forth the three matters of dissent to which the Crown was restricted in its appeal as:\n(1) misdirection by the trial judge \"with respect to preparation as opposed to attempt\";\n(2) misdirection by the trial judge \"in failing to distinguish between intent to rob generally and intent to rob Watkins Winram\";\n(3) misdirection by the trial judge \"with respect to abandonment\".\nMr. Schultz, for the Crown, may have put the points of dissent in a different form but the substance is the same. So far as the events of December 7, 1955, are concerned, the main, but not the only, evidence against the respondent depended upon the testimony of Mr. and Mrs. Nielson and of one Goll; and also upon the testimony, apparently given unwillingly, as might be expected, of (a) Noreen Lewry, who was living with the respondent although not married to him, and (b) Robert Smith, a friend of both accused who accompanied them, together with Mrs. Lewry and the six weeks' old child of her and the respondent, to the vicinity of the fatal shooting. There was evidence that, within the meaning of subs. (2) of s. 21 of the Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, Gordon and the respondent formed an intention in common to carry out an unlawful purpose (i.e., to rob with violence) and to assist each other therein. There was also evidence that in carrying out that common purpose Gordon committed the offence of murder and that the respondent knew or ought to have known that murder would be a probable consequence of carrying out the common purpose. Mr. Justice Davey considered that the trial judge erred in omitting reference to the suggestion that Gordon had a strong personal motive to kill and that, therefore, the shooting was not part of a common purpose. While it is necessary for a trial judge to put to the jury any defence which is open, I am unable to find in the present case any evidence to found such a contention.\nAbout 5.30 o'clock in the afternoon of December 7, 1955, Gordon arrived at the premises where the respondent lived with Mrs. Lewry and their child. The respondent and Mrs. Lewry had just finished eating a meal when Gordon arrived. Shortly thereafter the respondent left his suite and during his absence Gordon picked up a duster, tied a knot in the top, and placed it over his head and Mrs. Lewry cut out two eyeholes, thereby making a mask. Gordon stated to Mrs. Lewry that he needed $2,000 by the afternoon of December 8, on which day he expected to be committed for trial on a bank robbery charge and that he intended to obtain the $2,000 by armed robbery. Gordon had in his possession a .38-calibre Webley revolver and wrapped it in the mask and placed both in one pocket of his overcoat. A .45-calibre semi-automatic pistol, which it was proved had been in the possession of the respondent in the previous month, appeared on December 7 on the kitchen table in the respondent's premises, although Mrs. Lewry testified that she did not know how it had got there. Upon the respondent's return to the kitchen Gordon took the .45 pistol from the table and put it in the other pocket of his overcoat.\nMrs. Lewry, the baby and the respondent left the latter's premises in an automobile driven by Gordon. On the trip Mrs. Lewry noticed an automobile driven by Robert Smith, who left his car and entered Gordon's. She had already testified that it had been agreed between her and the accused that they should go to a friend's house for dinner in Burnaby, but that would be to the east, whereas the car proceeded west. It stopped at Skilling Brothers fuel office. Whatever may be the description of the attention paid to those premises Gordon drove farther west and parked his car under the new Granville Street bridge about 200 feet directly west of the rear of Watkins-Winram fuel office, the front of which faced Granville Street. Before parking the car Gordon had driven north on Granville Street past the front of the Watkins-Winram premises, which were lighted and wherein two employees working in the office could be seen, together with a vault and a safe.\nMr. and Mrs. Nielson saw two men, who the jury might believe were Gordon and the respondent, examining the rear of the Watkins-Winram premises. One of the men drew on a pair of white gloves and the other man was seen to perform movements which indicated that he was doing the same thing. One of the men placed a mask on his head. Two men proceeded north on what is described as the north-south lane to Third Avenue. It was as a result of a telephone message by Nielson that the police were alerted and police constable Sinclair was shot and killed. After the shots which killed Sinclair were fired, the respondent and Gordon ran in different directions. Gordon's car which, in the meantime, had been moved by Smith to a different location, but still generally speaking at the rear of the Watkins-Winram premises, was, with Mrs. Lewry and the infant as passengers, driven by Smith from its last position to Fourth Avenue where it stopped and shortly thereafter was entered by the two accused. The car then proceeded to the northwest corner of Fifth Avenue and Fir Street where the two accused alighted from the car and ran in different directions. Before entering an apartment building on west Fifth Avenue the respondent threw the .45-calibre semi-automatic pistol on the lawn of adjoining premises, whence it was recovered within a half-hour and bore no fingerprints. Gordon was taken into custody that same night but the respondent was not located until a long time later in Toronto, Ontario.\nThe evidence was overwhelming and the trial judge, in a charge that was necessarily lengthy, left it to the jury to find, as regards the respondent, what was necessary in order to substantiate his guilt, including an intention in common with Gordon to carry out an unlawful purpose of robbing with violence, in general. In the course of his able argument Mr. Mullins contended that the words in subs. (2) of s. 21 of the Criminal Code \"in carrying out the common purpose\" should be construed in the same way as the words in subs. (1) of s. 24, \"does or omits to do anything for the purpose of carrying out his intention\", and should be related to subs. (2) of s. 24:\nThe question whether an act or omission by a person who has an intent to commit an offence is or is not mere preparation to commit the offence, and too remote to constitute an attempt to commit the offence, is a question of law.\nIt is not necessary to determine that point because, even if the argument be sound, the evidence discloses that in carrying out the common purpose of robbery much more than mere preparation took place and in fact that there was an attempt. The charge to the jury was sufficient upon the question of \"carrying out the common purpose\" of robbery in general.\nBecause of the fact that the accused and Gordon were being tried jointly and because of Gordon's defence of an alibi, it was necessary that the trial judge should deal with the charge against the two accused in a comprehensive manner. As to point no. 2, that he failed to distinguish between intent to rob generally and the intent to rob Watkins-Winram, some members of the Court of Appeal considered that in his charge the trial judge after itemizing a number of events dealt with the matter in such a way as to confuse the jury. In my opinion, with respect, this is not so and the trial judge did in fact distinguish between the two cases. As to the carrying out of the intention to rob Watkins-Winram, the trial judge told the jury that in accordance with subs. (2) of s. 24 of the Code, he had determined as a matter of law that certain facts relied upon by the Crown were not too remote to constitute an attempt to commit the offence of robbing Watkins-Winram with violence. Following the listing of the events referred to, the trial judge said this, which is particularly objected to: \"It is not necessary that you find positively all but at least if you find substantially all these facts have been established beyond a reasonable doubt, then my instruction to you is that there was an attempted robbery.\" In my opinion the subsection requires the presiding judge to determine as a matter of law the point mentioned but that determination must be in substance a finding of fact. Mr. Justice Coady considered that this would invade the province of the jury and referred to a number of cases, none of which, however, in my view, so holds. In Regina v. Miskell [3], Hilbery J. stated:\nOnce it is decided by the court that what the accused has done can be an attempt to commit the crime, it is a question of fact for the jury whether what was done should be decided to have been an attempt.\nEven if that be so at common law, it is not the position under subs. (2) of s. 24 of the Criminal Code. The jury must, of course, decide the question of intention and consider any other defence raised on behalf of the accused, but the question of attempt or no attempt is for the judge. His function is not merely to decide in a given case that there is no evidence of an attempt and, therefore, withdraw that issue from the jury, but also to decide as a question of fact and a question of law whether what was done, if found by the jury, was an attempt. There is nothing inconsistent with this in the decision in Henderson v. The King [4], or in any of the other cases referred to. Here it was left to the jury to determine whether the facts had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. It is said that the effect of his charge was to withdraw from the jury the consideration of all the other circumstances but upon a careful reading of the charge, in which at several points it was made clear that the jury was the arbiter of facts, in my opinion this is not so. As to the third ground of dissent, Mr. Justice Coady considered that there was some evidence for the jury to consider, assuming the intention and attempt to rob Watkins-Winram was established, that the two accused were not continuing their attempt but had abandoned it. With respect, I can find no evidence of abandonment. Even if there be such evidence, I am satisfied that it was left to the jury to find whether it had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the common intention either to rob generally or to rob Watkins-Winram persisted down to the time of the firing of the shots by Gordon. The last sentence of the following extract is relied upon as indicating that this point was removed from the consideration of the jury:\nThen counsel takes another position: He says, \"If you think I was there and this venture was more than a preparation, was actually an attempt, then we abandoned it; we didn't go through with it, and if we have abandoned it, then the section won't apply, because we were not engaging in attempting to commit a robbery.\" Well, that is a matter for you. The only evidence we have on that point is that two men were seen, one with the mask, and then after they had looked in the window of Watkins-Winram they came around the corner and along Third Avenue. We have no evidence except the gun shot after that, two bullets. If you conclude there was an attempt, we have no evidence that it was ever abandoned; at least, I think that is the situation; it is a matter for you. But, to be frank, I could not quite follow Mr. LePage in his argument that there was an abandonment. I can recall no evidence that there was\u2014if there was an attempt, there was no evidence that that attempt was abandoned.\nHowever, in view of the earlier part where the judge told the jury that it was a matter for them and in view of the many other places in the charge where he made it clear that they were the judges of the facts, my conclusion is that the matter was not withdrawn from their consideration.\nWhen the trial judge was dealing with the defences of provocation, accident and self-defence he left no doubt that he was withdrawing them from the jury, as is shown by the following:\nI accept the responsibility of directing you that there is no evidence here that the offender acted in the heat of passion caused by sudden provocation. Now, if there was some evidence I would have to leave the matter with you. If I am convinced that there is no evidence, then I take the responsibility, and I do take the responsibility, there was no provocation. I likewise direct you that there is no evidence that the shooting was done by accident or in self-defence. You are relieved from considering provocation, accident and self-defence. The jury could not fail to be impressed by a comparison between that language and what was said by the trial judge in connection with the point of abandonment.\nIt was argued that the opening by counsel for the Crown indicated that the Crown was proposing to prove only that the common intention was to rob Watkins-Winram and not to rob generally and that if that had not been understood the accused might have been put in the witness-box. When one reads the indictment and the opening address of Crown counsel it is impossible to say that the scope of the case alleged against the respondent was restricted.\nMr. Mullins, as he was entitled to do, referred to the following additional points which had been raised by him on behalf of the respondent before the Court of Appeal but which were not dealt with by the members of that Court, in view of the disposition made of the appeal:\n(a) Comment on the character of the accused. None of the matters referred to in this heading appear to me to have any substance.\n(b) Comment on the failure of the accused to testify. Having considered the extracts relied on in connection with the entire charge, I am of opinion that there was no such comment.\n(c) Misdirection by twisting, misinterpretation, and misconception of evidence. I can find no evidence of this in the charge of the trial judge. If there was any slight error as to what had been said by any of the witnesses, the trial judge made it abundantly clear that the members of the jury were to rely upon their own recollection as to the evidence and he pointed out that in case of any question arising, reference could be had to the notes of the reporter.\n(d) Misdirection by deprecating and rebutting defence submissions and failing to put the defence as fully and fairly as the Crown's case. I can find no basis for this objection.\nThe appeal should be allowed, the order of the Court of Appeal set aside and the conviction of the respondent restored.\nRAND J.:\u2014I agree generally with the reasons and conclusions of the Chief Justice, but in the particular circumstances I think it desirable to state in my own words the considerations which to me seem controlling. Mr. Mullins contended that the prosecution had, on opening the case, bound itself to the view that both Gordon and Carey, in carrying out their purpose, that is, to rob Watkins-Winram, had been guilty of an attempt to commit that offence. As a result, it was said, of having taken this position, the accused was not called as a witness and, on the footing that attempt had not been reached, the Crown could not now urge that the death could be inferred as a probable consequence of a general purpose to rob.\nI find it unnecessary to examine this contention. I will assume, though I do not accept it, that the Crown is so bound but for the reasons which follow the point ceases to be material.\nThe ground on which Davey J.A. proceeded was based upon the absence in the charge of an adequate distinction between the intent to reconnoitre with or without an intent to rob generally, and the intent specifically to rob Watkins-Winram, and the relation of that failure both to the question of attempt and of murder being a probable consequence under s. 21(2). He seems, also, to have assumed the Crown to have committed its case to the specific intent and that the acts done amounted to an attempt. Thus he says [5]:\nIf there had been only an intent to rob such likely victim as the prisoners might find during the reconnaissance, and that intent had not crystallized into an intention to rob Watkins Winram Ltd.\u2014and it was open to the jury to so find\u2014it would necessarily follow that there had been no atempt to rob Watkins Winram Ltd. upon which the Crown based its case against Carey, for without such intent there could be no attempt to carry it out as required by s. 24(1).\nWhen Manson J., in considering s. 24, stressed the intent to commit an offence, he made it abundantly clear that what he meant was the offence of robbing Watkins-Winram; and his finding that an attempt had been made was made equally clearly to depend upon that crystallized and accompanying intent. The other interpretation of the facts, that, in the critical period and circumstances, there was mere reconnaissance for some future purpose, was also brought out plainly and distinctly. That was the substantial defence and to imagine the jury to have lacked full appreciation of it would be doing much less than justice to the intelligence of its members. Limited to the specific sense of intent and to the attempt, what was given the jury on the question of probable consequence under s. 21(2)\u2014and it was given on no other basis\u2014was in fact more favourable to the accused than seems to have been called for, because it is by no means clear that s. 21(2) is restricted to cases where an attempted offence has been reached. Assuming, as I think to be the case, the charge in relation to intent in both aspects to have been unobjectionable, the finding by Manson J. that the acts done did amount to an attempt cannot, in my opinion, be successfully challenged.\nCoady J.A. comments first upon the statement in the opening address\n\u2026that it was a part of the common intention to overcome all resistance by force of arms either whether that resistance was encountered outside the premises or inside the premises and to prevent arrest or detention by the police by shooting if necessary.\nIt is said that no evidence relating to such an intention was offered; nothing direct, certainly, but that it could not have been found as an inference from the total circumstances is, in my opinion, untenable.\nHe then proceeds to consider the manner in which the matter of attempt was dealt with and he concludes that the trial judge improperly took that question from the jury. What the latter did was to summarize the material facts with the direction that if they were found against Carey and his acts had been carried out with the intent to rob Watkins-Winram, they constituted an attempt to do that. It is said that other matters, not specified, but relevant to the intent, were in effect excluded. The interpretation of the main or significant facts as well as the intent obviously had to be determined in the light and background of the entire situation. That was reviewed in its details and their relevance to the determinative facts was obvious. Under s. 24(2) it is for the judge to rule whether the act \"is or is not mere preparation\", and having ruled that it was not, it necessarily followed here that there was an attempt. What the judge determines is the point, in the line of events between the first motion towards a criminal act and its commission, at which preparation ceases; that done, in such circumstances as we have here, I know of no intervening area between that stage and attempt. The acts must be done in carrying out the purpose, admittedly, but no question of that arises here where the intent to rob specifically was required and has been found: with that intent accompanying them, there could have been no other object than the specific purpose in doing them. The direction in this respect is what is given every day to juries that if they find certain facts, including intent, their verdict will be so and so.\nThe final submission was that if there had been an attempt it had been abandoned. I cannot agree that that question was withdrawn from the jury. What Manson J. said was that, in his opinion, there was no evidence of it\u2014a view in which I concur\u2014but that it was for them, the jury, to decide. The last remark in the paragraph quoted by my brother Cartwright simply repeats what had previously been said and was expressly qualified to be the trial judge's opinion only.\nUnnecessary complication seems to have been injected into the case. The broad features are simple and it tends only to confusion to treat them as being subtly and intricately involved. The second essential question, whether what happened was a probable consequence in the carrying out of the common and unlawful purpose of robbing Watkins-Winram, was left with the jury on these, among other, significant matters of evidence: that the two men had been together alone for some minutes shortly after Gordon entered Carey's home, that they had passed the front of the office of Watkins-Winram on Granville Street through the window of which a safe and vault were visible, that together, after parking their car a short distance to the west, they had reached the scene of the alleged purpose in the rear of the premises, that gloves were put on, that one at least was armed with a revolver, that they looked through a rear window, that the accused had remained near a rear door for several minutes with a hood on his head though not drawn down over his face while Gordon went a short distance northerly toward adjoining premises, that upon his return they walked northerly together on a lane to Third Avenue and turned east toward Granville Street on which, as mentioned, fronted the Watkins-Winram premises, a direction opposite to that of their car, and that both had fled the point of the shooting. A mask was found on a pile of tires a few feet from that point, and the gun from which the bullet was fired was traced to Gordon who was in possession of it at the time to the knowledge of Carey. On these damaging facts, supported as they were by those going back to the arrival of Gordon at the Carey home, the charge, although susceptible of minor criticism in parts of its order or structure, presented the determinative issues in such a manner as could be grasped adequately by the jury.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and restore the conviction.\nLOCKE J. (dissenting):\u2014The charge of murder against the respondent Carey was based upon subs. (2) of s. 21 of the Criminal Code which reads:\nWhere two or more persons form an intention in common to carry out an unlawful purpose and to assist each other therein and any one of them, in carrying out the common purpose, commits an offence, each of them who knew or ought to have known that the commission of the offence would be a probable consequence of carrying out the common purpose is a party to that offence.\nIt is not, in my opinion, a necessary element of the offence thus defined that the acts done in carrying out the common purpose referred to are such as to amount to an attempt, within the meaning of that expression in the Criminal Code. It was, however, made clear in the opening address to the jury on behalf of the Crown that it was contended that the unlawful purpose was to hold up and rob the premises of the Watkins-Winram company, to overcome any resistance by force of arms, whether that resistance was encountered inside or outside the premises, and to prevent arrest by the police by shooting if necessary and that at the time Gordon and Carey encountered Sinclair the offence of attempted robbery had been committed. In the concluding argument of counsel for the Crown the matter was put rather differently, the unlawful purpose being then stated as that of robbery generally, but it was repeated that an attempt had been or was being made when it was interrupted by the arrival of the police officer.\nCounsel for the present respondent contended before the jury that it was an essential element of the offence alleged that there had been an attempt to rob the Watkins-Winram company and that the murder was committed while such attempt was being made and argued that Gordon, who actually fired the shots which killed Sinclair, was only making a reconnaissance of the premises, presumably with the purpose of robbing them later.\nIt was necessary under these circumstances that the jury should be charged as to what constituted in law an attempt to commit an offence and it is the manner in which this was done which constitutes one of the two main grounds upon which the Court of Appeal has proceeded in directing that there should be a new trial.\nSubsection (1) of s. 24 declares that every one who, having an intent to commit an offence, does anything for the purpose of carrying out his intention is guilty of an attempt to commit the offence. Subsection (2) declares that whether an act or omission by a person who has an intent to commit an offence is or is not mere preparation to commit the offence and too remote to constitute an attempt is a question of law.\nBefore dealing with ss. 21 and 24 the learned trial judge explained to the jury the provisions of ss. 201 and 202. In so far as the accused Gordon was concerned, it would appear upon the evidence that nothing more was required than to explain s. 201. In Carey's case, however, s. 202 was of vital importance if there had been in fact an attempt to rob, within the meaning of s. 24, and that attempt was continuing at the time the men were intercepted by Constable Sinclair. Carey was shown to have been aware that Gordon carried a loaded revolver and, if the attempt were in progress when Sinclair was shot or if he and Gordon were in flight after attempting to commit the offence of robbery, he would have been a party to the offence defined in cl. (d) of s. 202, whether or not he knew that the commission of the offence would be a probable consequence of carrying out the common purpose within subs. (2) of s. 21.\nThe learned trial judge informed the jury that it was necessary for them to find whether or not there had been an attempt in which Carey was involved and, after saying that an intention to commit the offence of robbery was necessary in order to find guilt, explained the difference between what was mere preparation and what would be in law an attempt. The explanation given was in accordance with that given by Blackburn J. in Regina v. Cheeseman[6], and that approved in the judgment of this Court in John v. The Queen [7]. Thereafter, after reciting a number of the acts of Carey and Gordon before they arrived at the premises of the Watkins-Winram company and while they were there, the learned judge instructed the jury that if they found that substantially all those facts had been established there had been an attempted robbery. He did not include among the facts enumerated the fact that, after whichever of the two men had worn the mask had removed it, they had gone north in the lane and turned east on Third Avenue, a means by which they might have reached the front of the premises, as an act done in the course of the attempt.\nWith the greatest respect for the learned and experienced trial judge, I think that, for the reasons given by Coady J.A., this really amounted to taking the decision of the question of fact as to whether there had been an attempt from the jury. Whether the actions of Carey and Gordon when they were at the rear of the premises and when they were going east on Third Avenue when they met the police officer were merely to reconnoitre the premises with the view of coming at some later time and robbing the place, or whether they actually intended then and there to attempt to rob, were matters for the jury alone.\nI am further in agreement with the majority of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal that the issue as to whether, assuming there had been an attempt, that attempt had been abandoned at the time of the shooting was in effect taken away from the jury. The passage from the charge dealing with this matter is quoted in other reasons to be delivered and it is unnecessary to repeat it. It is true that the learned judge said that the matter was one for the jury, but the question as to whether there was any evidence of abandonment was one of law and for him and not for the jury and, in the passage quoted, the jury was told twice that there was no evidence that the attempt was abandoned. In my opinion, the effect of this would be that the jury would not consider the matter. While the evidence was that when the two men reached Third Avenue they turned to the east, which was away from the direction in which their waiting car stood, it was at least arguable that by proceeding to the corner and going from there south on Granville Street they could more quickly reach their car than by proceeding west on Third Avenue. In my view, the evidence of abandonment was weak, but there was some, and that was a matter for the jury.\nI would accordingly dismiss this appeal.\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):\u2014The respondent was tried, jointly with one James Gordon, before Manson J. and a jury on the following charge:\nJOSEPH GORDON AND JAMES CAREY stand charged:\nTHAT at the City of Vancouver, in the County and Province aforesaid, on the seventh day of December, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and fifty-five, they, the said JOSEPH GORDON and the said JAMES CAREY, unlawfully did murder Gordon Sinclair, contrary to the form of the Statute in such case made and provided, and against the peace of our Lady the Queen her Crown and Dignity, in that, at the place and on the date aforesaid, the said JOSEPH GORDON did in fact fire the bullet or bullets which killed the said Gordon Sinclair and did thereby commit murder, contrary to the Criminal Code, while the said JAMES CAREY, in complicity with the said Joseph Gordon, was a party with the said Joseph Gordon to the said crime of murder.\nBoth accused were convicted.\nA summary of the subsequent proceedings and of the effect of portions of the evidence is given in the reasons of other members of the Court and I shall endeavour to avoid repetition.\nIn his factum, counsel for the appellant summarizes the errors of law which he alleges are to be found in the reasons of the majority in the Court of Appeal as follows:\nIt is submitted that the Court of Appeal, the Honourable Mr. Justice Sidney Smith dissenting, erred in holding:\u2014\n(1) That the learned trial Judge misdirected the jury in his instructions on \"attempt\" under section 24(2) of the Criminal Code, when the learned trial Judge directed the jury that if the jury found certain enumerated facts to have been proved beyond a reasonable doubt, then the acts constituted an attempt to commit robbery, as distinguished from mere preparation to commit the offence and too remote to constitute an attempt.\n(2) That the learned trial Judge misdirected the jury by instructing the jury that there was an attempt to commit robbery under section 24(1) of the Criminal Code.\n(3) That the Appellant's case against the Respondent, under section 21(2), upon which the Appellant chose to go to the jury was (a) that the common intention to carry out an unlawful purpose was to rob Watkins Winram Ltd. and (b) that murder of Sinclair occurred during an attempt to rob Watkins Winram Ltd., so that the learned trial Judge misdirected the jury on section 24(1) of the Criminal Code by failing to instruct the jury that the jury must find an intent to rob Watkins Winram Ltd. specifically before the jury was required to determine the facts of preparation or attempt under section 24(2), in order to find an attempt to rob Watkins Winram Ltd.\n(4) That the learned trial Judge failed to put the theory and evidence of the defence relating to (3) in the manner required by Azoulay v. The Queen, [1952] 2 S.C.R. 495.\n(5) That the learned trial Judge withdrew from the jury the theory of \"abandonment\" of an attempt to commit robbery.\n(6) That there was any evidence to support the theory of \"abandonment\" of an attempt to commit robbery.\n(7) That the foregoing (1) to (6), inclusive, or any of them, constituted misdirection going to the substance of any vital issue in the case of the Respondent under section 21(2) of the Criminal Code, or misled the jury, so as to constitute a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice, for which the Respondent should be granted a new trial.\nWhile Sidney Smith J.A. did not deal separately with each of these points, he expressed the view that the charge of the learned trial judge was accurate and adequate; and the right of the Attorney-General to appeal to this Court pursuant to s. 598(1) (a) of the Criminal Code was not challenged.\nAfter having put to the jury the theory of the Crown that Gordon fired the fatal shots under such circumstances that he was guilty of murder under s. 201 (a) (i) of the Code in that he meant to cause Sinclair's death, the learned trial judge also dealt with s. 202 and in so doing related the terms of that section particularly to the respondent. He said in part:\nNow we pass on to s. 202. That is the section that you would fall back on so far as Gordon is concerned if you had any doubt at all about his guilt under s. 201. Mind you, if you find that Gordon was present and that he fired the shots, then you do not need to worry about anything after 201, it seems to me. It is for you, of course. Gordon would be, I am sure, found to be a person who intended to kill Sinclair. However, he is not the only man who is charged here, and for that reason I want to correlate 202 to the evidence.\nThe learned trial judge instructed the jury that if Gordon while attempting to commit robbery used a revolver or had it upon his person and the death of Sinclair ensued as a consequence then Gordon was guilty of murder. This instruction was doubtless correct under s. 202 (d) (i). When the learned judge came to deal with s. 21(2) he made it plain to the jury that if they found that Gordon and Carey formed a common intention to rob and to assist each other in so doing and, while they were engaged in an attempt to rob, Gordon used a revolver and Sinclair's death ensued as a consequence, then Carey as well as Gordon would be guilty of murder if he knew or ought to have known that the commission by Gordon of murder, as defined in s. 202 (d) (i), would be a probable consequence of carrying out the common purpose to rob. After reading and rereading the charge I think it most probable that it was on this view of the evidence that the jury proceeded in finding Carey guilty. Certainly this may have been the view on which they proceeded, for they had, in the passage quoted above, been invited to direct particular attention to s. 202 (d) (i) in considering their verdict as to Carey.\nIf, as I think probable, the jury were directing their minds to s. 202 (d) (i) it was of vital importance that they should consider the question whether Gordon caused Sinclair's death while committing or attempting to commit robbery. It is obvious that if the jury concluded that, at the crucial moment, the two accused were still engaged in an attempt to rob they would answer this question adversely to the respondent.\nAssuming, without deciding, that the learned trial judge was right in telling the jury that, if they found the list of facts stated by him, they must accept and follow his ruling that both accused had committed the offence of attempted robbery, he was, in my respectful opinion, wrong in withdrawing from them the question whether the attempt had been abandoned before the firing of the fatal shots.\nI agree with the conclusion of the majority in the Court of Appeal that the learned trial judge did withdraw this question from the jury. He deals with it in only one passage in his charge, which is as follows:\nThen counsel takes another position: He says, \"If you think I was there and this venture was more than a preparation, was actually an attempt, then we abandoned it; we didn't go through with it, and if we have abandoned it, then the section won't apply, because we were not engaging in attempting to commit a robbery.\" Well, that is a matter for you. The only evidence we have on that point is that two men were seen, one with the mask, and then after they had looked in the window of Watkins Winram they came around the corner and along Third Avenue. We have no evidence except the gun shot after that, two bullets. If you conclude there was an attempt, we have no evidence that it was ever abandoned; at least, I think that is the situation; it is a matter for you. But, to be frank, I could not quite follow Mr. LePage in his argument that there was an abandonment, I can recall no evidence that there was\u2014if there was an attempt, there was no evidence that that attempt was abandoned.\nIt is true that twice in this passage the learned judge tells the jury that it is a matter for them; but, in my opinion, the concluding words which I have italicized would be taken by the jury as the final word of the judge that there was no evidence of abandonment for them to consider and would prevent them from giving any further consideration to the matter.\nIt appears to me that the learned trial judge told the jury, in effect, that if they once found that the attempt to rob was made, they had no choice but to find that such attempt was continuing at the crucial moment.\nI share the view of the majority in the Court of Appeal that on the evidence in the record it was open to the jury to find that if an attempt had been made it had been abandoned and so at the moment the fatal shots were fired the accused were neither committing nor attempting to commit robbery; and, consequently, I agree with their conclusion that the verdict cannot stand.\nThis renders it unnecessary for me to deal with any of the other matters which were discussed before us.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal allowed and conviction restored, LOCKE and CART-WRIGHT JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the appellant: William A. Schultz, Vancouver.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Norman D.

Fineberg v. Taub (1939), 77 Que. S.C. 233, overruled.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Locke, Cartwright, Fauteux and Nolan JJ.: The statute is legislation in respect of criminal law which, under head 27 of\ns. 91 of the British North America Act, is within the exclusive competence of the Parliament of Canada. B\u00e9dard v. Dawson et al., [1923] S.C.R. 681, distinguished.\nPer Rand, Kellock and Abbott M.: The subject-matter of the statute is not within any of the powers specifically assigned to the Provinces by\ns. 92 of the British North America Act and it constitutes an unjustifiable interference with freedom of speech and expression essential under the democratic form of government established in Canada.\nPer Taschereau J., dissenting: The legislation is not in respect of criminal law but deals with property in the Province, under head 13 of s. 92 of the British North America Act. It is calculated to suppress conditions favouring the development of crime and to control properties in order to protect society against illegal uses that may be made of them. B\u00e9dard v. Dawson et al., supra, applied.\nCourts\u2014Supreme Court of Canada\u2014Jurisdiction\u2014Whether lis remains between parties\u2014Intervention of Attorney-General.\nThe plaintiff sued for cancellation of a lease on the ground that the defendant, the lessee, had committed a breach of a provincial statute. The defendant, in his plea, contested the validity of the statute and gave notice of this contestation to the Attorney-General under art. 114 of the Quebec Code of Civil Procedure. The Superior Court gave judgment for the plaintiff on the claim for cancellation but dismissed a further claim made by her for damages; it also maintained the intervention and declared the statute valid and effective. This judgment was affirmed by a majority of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side. The defendant then appealed, by leave of the provincial Court, to the Supreme Court. The plaintiff took no part in the appeal, stating by her counsel that she would rely on the argument to be adduced on behalf of the intervenant.\nHeld (Taschereau J. dissenting) : The Court had jurisdiction to hear the appeal and should dispose of it. The appellant's claim in the intervention should be considered on the merits and, since the result of that claim affected the plaintiff's claim in the original action, it also should be decided. Cot\u00e9 v. The James Richardson Company (1906), 38 S.C.R. 41; B\u00e9dard v. Dawson et al., supra, applied.\nPer Taschereau J., dissenting: Since the lease from the plaintiff to the defendant had expired long before the appeal was brought to this Court, and the claim for damages had been dismissed, the only issue that remained between the original parties was as to costs. The intervenant claimed nothing except a declaration that the statute was intra vires of the Province and this was not a reference in which the Court was called upon to express its opinion as to the validity of the statute in an abstract way but an ordinary action where the statute was challenged only in relation to the main action. The intervention was not an \"aggressive\" one as in Cot\u00e9 v. Richardson, supra.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Quebec[1], affirming (Barclay J. dissenting) the judgment of Collins J. at trial. Appeal allowed.\nAbraham Feiner, F. R. Scott and J. Perrault, for the defendant, appellant.\nL. Emery Beaulieu, Q.C., and Lucien Tremblay, Q.C., for the intervenant, respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE :\u2014This appeal was brought by John Switzman pursuant to leave granted by the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side) for the Province of Quebec from its judgment (1) confirming that of the Superior Court cancelling and annulling a certain lease between the plaintiff, Freda Elbling, and the defendant Switzman and maintaining the intervention of the Attorney-General of the Province of Quebec and declaring \"An Act to Protect the Province against Communistic Propaganda\", R.S.Q. 1941, c. 52, to be intra vires of the Legislature of the Province of Quebec. It is quite true that if no lis exists between parties this Court will decline to hear an appeal, even though leave has been granted by a provincial Court of Appeal: Coca-Cola Company of Canada Limited v. Mathews[2], where the earlier cases are collected.. While, in the present case, it is suggested that the time has elapsed when the. appellant had any interest in the lease to him from Freda Elbling, and therefore as between those two parties it is argued that there was nothing left in dispute except the questions of costs, the intervention of the Attorney-General of the Province of Quebec, pursuant to art. 114 of the Quebec Code of Civil Procedure, raises an issue between him and the present appellant as to the constitutionality of the statute mentioned.\nThe plaintiff Freda Elbling presented no factum and took no part in the appeal, a letter being filed in this Court from her counsel to the attorneys for the appellant stating that he would rely upon the argument to be adduced on behalf of the intervenant. Mr. Beaulieu did not argue that we had no jurisdiction, or that we should not deal with the constitutionality of at least part of the statute, but both points were considered by the members of this Court and all except Mr. Justice Taschereau are of opinion that the appeal is competent and should be disposed of. No question as to the amount or value in controversy arises since the appeal is brought by leave and it cannot be said that there is no issue between the appellant and the Attorney-General of the Province of Quebec. The decision in Cot\u00e9 v. The James Richardson Company[3] is important as there it was decided that the demand as between the intervenant and the opposite party is that contained in the intervention. Here the appellant's claim in the intervention should be considered on the merits and, as the result therein affects the claim of the plaintiff in the original action, it also, under the circumstances, should be decided.\nI am unable to agree with Mr. Beaulieu's contention that there is in issue the constitutional validity of only part of the statute. The order signed by the Attorney-General of the Province of Quebec, dated January 27, 1949, recites the provisions of both ss. 3 and 12 of that Act and in his intervention the Attorney-General asked the Court to declare the said Act in its entirety constitutional and valid and in full force and effect.\nSection 1 provides :\nThis Act may be cited as Act Respecting Communistic Propaganda. Sections 3 and 12 read:\n3. It shall be illegal for any person, who possesses or occupies a house within the Province, to use it or allow any person to make use of it to propagate communism or bolshevism by any means whatsoever.\n12. It shall be unlawful to print, to publish in any manner whatsoever or to distribute in the Province any newspaper, periodical, pamphlet, circular, document or writing whatsoever propagating or tending to propagate communism or bolshevism.\nSections 4 to 11 provide that the Attorney-General, upon satisfactory proof that an infringement of s. 3 has been committed, may order the closing of the house; authorize any peace officer to execute such order, and provide a procedure by which the owner may apply by petition to a judge of the Superior Court to have the order revised. Section 13 provides for imprisonment of anyone infringing or participating in the infringement of s. 12. In my opinion it is impossible to separate the provisions of ss. 3 and 12.\nThe validity of the statute was attacked upon a number of grounds, but, in cases where constitutional issues are involved, it is important that nothing be said that is unnecessary. In my view it is sufficient to declare that the Act is legislation in relation to the criminal law, over which, by virtue of head 27 of s. 91 of the British North America Act, the Parliament of Canada has exclusive legislative authority. The decision of this Court in B\u00e9dard v. Dawson et al.[4] is clearly distinguishable. As Mr. Justice Barclay points out, the real object of the Act here under consideration is to prevent propagation of communism within the Province and to punish anyone who does so-with provisions authorizing steps for the closing of premises used for such object. The B\u00e9dard case was concerned with the control and enjoyment of property. I am unable to agree with the decision of Greenshields C.J. in Fineberg v. Taub[5]. It is not necessary to refer to other authorities, because, once the conclusion is reached that the pith and substance of the impugned Act is in relation to criminal law, the conclusion is inevitable that the Act is unconstitutional. The appeal should be allowed, the judgments below set aside and the action dismissed with costs, but there should be no costs as between the appellant and the respondent Elbling in the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side) or in this Court. The intervention of the Attorney-General should be dismissed and it should be declared that the statute is ultra vires of the Legislature of the Province of Quebec in toto. The appellant is entitled, as against the Attorney-General, to his costs occasioned by the intervention in all Courts.\nTASCHEREAU J. (dissenting) :\u2014La cause qui est soumise \u00e0 la consid\u00e9ration de cette Cour, a pris naissance de la fa\u00e7on suivante: L'intim\u00e9e, demanderesse en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, a lou\u00e9 un immeuble situ\u00e9 dans la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al \u00e0, un nomm\u00e9 Max Bailey, avec droit de sous-louer. Ce dernier, s'autorisant de ce droit, a c\u00e9d\u00e9 son bail \u00e0 l'appelant dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, et d\u00e9fendeur en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure.\nL'intim\u00e9e all\u00e8gue dans son action en r\u00e9siliation de bail, que l'appelant, sous-locataire, s'est servi et a permis qu'on se serve de l'immeuble en question, pour la diffusion de la doctrine communiste, et qu'il a ainsi viol\u00e9 une loi provinciale d'ordre public, intitul\u00e9e \"Loi prot\u00e9geant la province contre la propagande communiste\", S.R.Q. 1941, c. 52.\nLe 27 janvier 1949, le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la province de Qu\u00e9bec a en effet \u00e9mis une ordonnance, tel que la loi l'autorise, prescrivant la fermeture de la maison pour toute fin quelconque, pour une p\u00e9riode d'une ann\u00e9e. La maison fut donc \"cadenass\u00e9e\", et c'est maintenant la pr\u00e9tention de l'intim\u00e9e qu'\u00e0 cause de l'usage ill\u00e9gal que l'appelant en a fait, elle est en droit d'exiger la r\u00e9siliation du bail, l'\u00e9viction de l'occupant, et des dommages qu'elle a \u00e9valu\u00e9s dans ses conclusions \u00e0 $2,170.\nL'appelant a admis s'\u00eatre servi de l'immeuble pour la propagation de la doctrine communiste, mais a sp\u00e9cifiquement plaid\u00e9 que ladite loi (S.R.Q. 1941, c. 52) est ultra vires de la l\u00e9gislature de Qu\u00e9bec, et qu'elle constitue un empi\u00e9tement sur le pouvoir l\u00e9gislatif de l'autorit\u00e9 f\u00e9d\u00e9rale qui seule pourrait l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer en la mati\u00e8re. Comme la constitutionnalit\u00e9 d'une loi provinciale \u00e9tait attaqu\u00e9e, avis a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 au procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, suivant les dispositions de l'art. 114 C.P.C., et ce dernier a produit une intervention, o\u00f9 il a soutenu la validit\u00e9 compl\u00e8te de la l\u00e9gislation.\nM. le Juge Collins de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a maintenu l'action, annul\u00e9 le bail, d\u00e9clar\u00e9 bien fond\u00e9e l'intervention du .procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, et a reconnu en cons\u00e9quence la validit\u00e9 de la loi. Ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par la Cour du Banc de la Reine, avec la dissidence de M. le Juge Barclay.\nIl se pr\u00e9sente dans cette cause une premi\u00e8re question tr\u00e8s s\u00e9rieuse qui m\u00e9rite quelques observations. L'action en r\u00e9siliation de bail a \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9e au mois de f\u00e9vrier 1949, et le bail se terminait, en raison de la clause de renouvellement dont on a pris avantage, le 30 avril 1950. Il s'ensuit que quand l'appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e devant cette Cour en juillet 1954, le bail se trouvait expir\u00e9, et quant \u00e0 l'appelant et l'intim\u00e9e, il ne restait qu'\u00e0 d\u00e9terminer une question de frais. Il n'y a aucune somme d'argent en jeu, vu que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance n'a pas accord\u00e9 de dommages. Le \"substratum\", ce sur quoi reposait le litige, \u00e9tait donc disparu. C'est la jurisprudence constante qu'en pareil cas, cette Cour refuse d'entretenir l'appel vu qu'il ne reste rien \u00e0 \u00eatre d\u00e9cid\u00e9 entre les parties: Glasgow Navigation Company v. Iron Ore Company[6] ; Moir v. The Village of Huntingdon et al.[7] ; McKay v. The Township of Hinchinbrook[8] ; Commissioner of Provincial Police v. The King[9]; Coca-Cola Company of Canada Limited v. Mathews [10]).\nOn soutient cependant qu'un autre litige subsiste entre l'appelant et l'intervenant, dans lequel doit \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9e la validit\u00e9 de la l\u00e9gislation contest\u00e9e. Il s'agirait bien dans l'occurrence d'une intervention aggressive, dans laquelle l'intervenant soutient ses propres droits, et non pas d'une simple intervention accessoire faite dans l'inter\u00eat de l'une des parties et qui doit n\u00e9cessairement tomber quand dispara\u00eet le \"substratum\" entre les principaux litigants, soit le demandeur et le d\u00e9fendeur: La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Immobili\u00e8re Maisonneuve Limit\u00e9e v. Les Chevaliers de Maisonneuve[11]. Cette derni\u00e8re cause, et la cause actuelle, se pr\u00e9sentent sous un jour enti\u00e8rement diff\u00e9rent. Dans la cause des Chevaliers de Maisonneuve, supra, les intervenants r\u00e9clamaient pour leur b\u00e9n\u00e9fice, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de certains biens, et demandaient qu'un titre leur soit consenti \u00e0 cet effet. Il importait peu, par cons\u00e9quent, qu'il n'y eut point d'appel sur l'action principale qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e, vu que la contestation devenait exclusivement entre le demandeur et les intervenants.\nIci, tel n'est pas le cas; l'intervenant ne r\u00e9clame rien, sauf une d\u00e9claration que la loi est constitutionnelle, dans le but unique de faire d\u00e9clarer la r\u00e9siliation d'un bail. Il ne s'agit en aucune fa\u00e7on d'une \"r\u00e9f\u00e9rence\", o\u00f9 cette Cour serait appel\u00e9e \u00e0 se prononcer sur la validit\u00e9 ou sur l'invalidit\u00e9 d'une loi d'une fa\u00e7on purement abstraite, mais bien d'un cas concret, d'une action ordinaire, o\u00f9 n'est contest\u00e9e la loi en question que par rapport \u00e0 l'action principale. Dans ces cas, nous ne devons retenir que les points essentiels \u00e0 la d\u00e9termination de la cause: Winner v. S.M.T. (Eastern) Limited[12]. Comme dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, il n'y a rien \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer dans l'action principale, il me semble rationnel de dire que nous ne pouvons juger de la validit\u00e9 de l'intervention et que nous ne devrions pas entretenir le pr\u00e9sent appel. Je ne vois pas de mati\u00e8re essentielle n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 un litige civil; il n'y a pas de fond dans ce proc\u00e8s.\nLe seul point en litige est la r\u00e9siliation du bail, et si l'appel \u00e9tait maintenu, il faudrait d\u00e9clarer que le bail n'est pas r\u00e9sili\u00e9 et, cependant, il y a six ans qu'il n'existe plus. Il ne s'agirait donc que d'une question de frais. Comme le disait Sir Lyman Duff dans Commissioner of Provincial Police v. The King, supra:\nFrom that point of view the appeal had no practical object. Even if the appellant's technical objection to the proceeding by way of mandamus had been well founded, the licenses and number plates would still remain in the hands of the respondent; the purported suspension would still remain a void act and the only question for discussion on the appeal would be the academic technical question with regard to the propriety of proceeding by mandamus and the question of costs. Je n'oublie pas la d\u00e9cision de cette Cour dans la cause de Cot\u00e9 v. The James Richardson Company[13], o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l'intervention ne tombe pas n\u00e9cessairement, si, \u00e0 cause d'un d\u00e9faut de juridiction, cette Cour ne peut \u00eatre saisie de l'action principale. Il s'agissait dans cette cause non pas d'un d\u00e9bat purement acad\u00e9mique, mais bien d'un cas o\u00f9 l'intervenant r\u00e9clamait comme \u00e9tant sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9, une certaine quantit\u00e9 de bois que le demandeur avait saisie entre les mains du d\u00e9fendeur, et qui avait une valeur d'au del\u00e0 de $2,000. Il s'agissait, contrairement au cas qui nous occupe, d'une intervention agressive, o\u00f9 l'intervenant ne supportait pas les droits du d\u00e9fendeur, mais, au contraire, affirmait uniquement les siens.\nDans Cot\u00e9 v. Richardson, supra, le jug\u00e9 est le suivant:\nAn intervention filed under the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure of the Province of Quebec is a \"judicial proceeding\" within the meaning of section 29 of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, and a final judgment thereon is appealable to the Supreme Court of Canada where the matter in controversy upon the intervention amounts to the sum or value of 82,000 without reference to the amount demanded by the action in which such intervention has been filed.\nSir Charles Fitzpatrick, alors juge en chef, parlant pour la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour, s'exprime d'une fa\u00e7on bien cat\u00e9gorique lorsqu'il dit, \u00e0 la page 44:\nThe intervening party stands in the same position as a plaintiff. L'intervention n'est que l'exercice d'une action; Rousseau & Laisney, Vol. 5, p. 494, n. 8. When, as in the present case, the intervenant is a third party who comes into the case, not to maintain nor contest the principal demand, but to assert a right personal to himself, new issues are raised which may be disposed of independently of the main suit: Walcot v. Robinson, 11 L.C. Jur. 303.\nA la page 46, il souligne qu'il s'agit d'une revendication de la part de l'intervenant, par cons\u00e9quent, d'une intervention agressive, cr\u00e9ant n\u00e9cessairement un lis entre ce dernier et l'une des parties. Voici ce qu'il dit:\nHere the proceeding in intervention is to all intents and purposes an action in revendication. Miller v. D\u00e9ch\u00e8ne, 8 Q.L.R. 18.\nDans la m\u00eame cause, \u00e0 la page 52, l'honorable juge Girouard dit:\nIf an intervention is a mere incident, it seems to me impossible to conceive that it can survive the principal demand. Dans Mulholland v. Benning et al.[14], approuv\u00e9 par cette Cour dans la cause de Cot\u00e9 v. Richardson, supra, la Cour du Banc de la Reine de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le d\u00e9sistement de la demande principale ne peut mettre fin \u00e0 une intervention, lorsque cette intervention a pour objet de revendiquer la chose saisie dans la demande principale. On voit donc que la Cour du Banc de la Reine de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, conditionne l'existence d'une intervention \u00e0 la revendication par l'intervenant d'un droit susceptible d'une appr\u00e9ciation p\u00e9cuniaire.\nLa pr\u00e9sente cause doit \u00eatre distingu\u00e9e de celle de B\u00e9dard v. Dawson et al.[15]. Dans cette derni\u00e8re, la question de juridiction entre l'appelant et l'intervenant a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e, \u00e0 cause de l'absence devant cette Cour d'un appel sur le litige principal. Mais il existait tout de m\u00eame un \"substratum\", car le litige principal subsistait toujours, vu que le dossier avait \u00e9t\u00e9 retourn\u00e9 par la Cour d'Appel \u00e0 la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, pour preuve additionnelle, et \u00e9tait en cons\u00e9quence susceptible d'\u00eatre entendu de nouveau pour \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9 finalement \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re du jugement rendu par la Cour Supr\u00eame sur l'intervention.\nM\u00eame si j'entretenais encore quelque doute sur l'interpr\u00e9tation \u00e0 \u00eatre donn\u00e9e \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re cause, il devrait n\u00e9cessairement dispara\u00eetre apr\u00e8s les jugements rendus dans la cause des Chevaliers de Maisonneuve, supra, et surtout dans la cause de Winner, supra, d'o\u00f9 il ressort clairement, que quand il ne s'agit pas d'une r\u00e9f\u00e9rence, mais bien d'une intervention comme celle qui nous est soumise, il ne faut en retenir que ce qui est n\u00e9cessaire pour la determination de l'action principale.\nParce que les points que je viens d'exprimer ne rencontrent pas les vues de la majorit\u00e9 de cette Cour, je crois qu'il devient n\u00e9cessaire de dire ce que je pense de la validit\u00e9 de la loi dont on conteste la constitutionnalit\u00e9.\nIl ne fait pas de doute qu'en vertu de l'art. 91 de l'Acte de l'Am\u00e9rique britannique du Nord (s. 27), le droit criminel est une mati\u00e8re qui rel\u00e8ve exclusivement de l'autorit\u00e9 f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, sur laquelle cette derni\u00e8re seule a le pouvoir de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer. Et dans un cas comme celui-l\u00e0, la th\u00e9orie dite de l'\"unoccupied field\" ne peut trouver son application, et ne peut justifier une l\u00e9gislature provinciale de s'arroger un pouvoir que la constitution lui refuse: The Fisheries Case[16] ; Attorney General for Alberta v. Attorney General for Canada et al.[17].\nLa loi dite \"Loi prot\u00e9geant la province contre la propagande communiste\" stipule qu'il est ill\u00e9gal pour toute personne qui poss\u00e8de ou occupe une maison dans la province, de l'utiliser ou de permettre \u00e0 une personne d'en faire usage pour propager le communisme ou bolch\u00e9visme par quelque moyen que ce soit. La loi autorise le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, sur preuve satisfaisante d'une infraction, d'ordonner la fermeture de la maison pour une p\u00e9riode n'exc\u00e9dant pas une ann\u00e9e. Le recours conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par la loi au propri\u00e9taire de la maison, est de pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate \u00e0 la Cour pour faire reviser l'ordonnance, en prouvant qu'il \u00e9tait de bonne foi, qu'il ignorait que la maison f\u00fbt employ\u00e9e en contravention \u00e0 la loi, ou que la maison n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9e pour les fins qu'on lui reproche.\nL'appelant pr\u00e9tend que cette l\u00e9gislation rel\u00e8ve exclusivement du droit criminel, et qu'en cons\u00e9quence, elle d\u00e9passe la comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative de l'autorit\u00e9 provinciale. Je m'accorderais volontiers avec lui, si la l\u00e9gislature avait d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 que le communisme \u00e9tait un crime punissable par la loi, car il y aurait l\u00e0 clairement un empi\u00e9tement dans le domaine f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, qui frapperait la l\u00e9gislation d'ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 et la rendrait \"ultra vires\" de la province. Mais tel n'est pas le cas qui se pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 nous. La l\u00e9gislature, en effet, n'a \u00e9rig\u00e9 aucun acte au niveau d'un crime, et elle n'a nullement donn\u00e9 le caract\u00e8re de criminalit\u00e9 \u00e0 la doctrine communiste. Si la l\u00e9gislature n'a pas le droit de cr\u00e9er des offenses criminelles, elle a le droit de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer pour pr\u00e9venir les crimes, les d\u00e9sordres, comme la trahison, la s\u00e9dition, les attroupements ill\u00e9gaux, d\u00e9clar\u00e9s des crimes par l'autorit\u00e9 f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, et pour faire dispara\u00eetre les conditions qui sont de nature \u00e0 favoriser le d\u00e9veloppement du crime. Pour atteindre ces buts, je n'entretiens pas de doute qu'elle peut validement l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer sur la possession et l'usage d'un immeuble, car ceci est exclusivement du domaine du droit civil, et rel\u00e8ve en vertu de l'art. 92 de l'Acte de l'Am\u00e9rique britannique du Nord (s. 13) de l'autorit\u00e9 provinciale.\nLa cause de B\u00e9dard v. Dawson et al., supra, pr\u00e9sente beaucoup de similitude avec le litige actuel. L\u00e0 encore la validit\u00e9 d'une loi provinciale intitul\u00e9e \"Loi concernant les propri\u00e9taires de maisons employ\u00e9es comme maisons de d\u00e9sordre\", 10 Geo. V (1920), c. 81, a \u00e9t\u00e9 attaqu\u00e9e. Cette loi d\u00e9clarait qu'il \u00e9tait ill\u00e9gal pour toute personne qui poss\u00e8de ou occupe une maison ou b\u00e2tisse de quelque nature que ce soit, de l'utiliser ou de permettre \u00e0 une personne d'en faire usage comme maison de d\u00e9sordre. Une copie certifi\u00e9e de tout jugement d\u00e9clarant une personne coupable d'un acte criminel, ou d'une infraction en vertu des arts. 228, 228a, 229 ou 229a de l'ancien Code criminel, constituait une preuve \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue que la maison avait servi aux fins pour lesquelles la condamnation a \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenue. Apr\u00e8s avis donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e, si cette maison continuait d'\u00eatre employ\u00e9e comme maison de d\u00e9sordre, une injonction pouvait \u00eatre dirig\u00e9e contre le propri\u00e9taire ou le locataire, leur d\u00e9fendant de s'en servir ou de tol\u00e9rer l'usage de cette b\u00e2tisse pour les fins susdites. La Cour pouvait ordonner, apr\u00e8s un d\u00e9lai de dix jours, la fermeture de cette maison.\nLa Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada, confirmant la Cour d'Appel de la province de Qu\u00e9bec[18], a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que cette loi \u00e9tait constitutionnelle, et bien que la loi criminelle et les r\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure qui s'y rapportent soient du ressort exclusif du Parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, le Parlement provincial avait droit de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer sur toutes les mati\u00e8res civiles en rapport avec le droit criminel, et de sanctionner ses lois par une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9.\nLe jug\u00e9[19] de cette cause est le suivant:\nThe Quebec statute entitled \"'An Act respecting the owners of houses used as disorderly houses,\" 10 Geo. V, c. 81, authorizing a judge to order the closing of a disorderly house, is intra vires the provincial legislature, as it deals with matter of property and civil rights by providing for the suppression of a nuisance and not with criminal law by aiming at the punishment of a crime. M. le juge Idington s'exprime dans ses raisons de la fa\u00e7on suivante[20]:\nI have long entertained the opinion that the provincial legislatures have such absolute power over property and civil rights, as given them by section 92 of the B.N.A 'Act, item 13 thereof, that so long as they did not in fact encroach upon the powers assigned by the said 'Act to the Dominion Parliament it would be almost impossible to question any such exercise of power so given unless by the exercise of the veto power given the Dominion Government. That veto power was originally designed to prevent an improper exercise of legislative power by the provincial legislatures.\nM. le juge Duff exprime ainsi son opinion[21] :\nThe legislation impugned seems to be aimed at suppressing conditions calculated to favour the development of crime rather than at the punishment of crime. This is an aspect of the subject in respect of which the provinces seem to be free to legislate. I think the legislation is not invalid.\nDe son c\u00f4t\u00e9, M. le juge Anglin trouve la loi constitutionnelle et s'exprime ainsi[22] :\nThe judgment of the Superior Court maintaining the intervention of the 'Attorney General on the other hand was confirmed and in that proceeding there is a final judgment upholding the constitutionality of the Quebec Statute (10 Geo. V, c. 81). Substantially for the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Greenshields, I am of the opinion that this statute in no wise impinges on the domain of criminal law but is concerned exclusively with the control and enjoyment of property and the, safeguarding of the community from the consequences of an illegal and injurious use being made of it\u2014a pure matter of civil right. In my opinion in enacting the statute now under consideration the legislature exercised the power which it undoubtedly possesses to provide for the suppression of a nuisance and the prevention of its recurrence by civil process.\nM. le juge Brodeur partage les m\u00eames vues et dit[23] :\nLe parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral peut d\u00e9clarer criminelle une action quelconque; mais cela ne saurait emp\u00eacher les provinces de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer sur la m\u00eame mati\u00e8re en tant que les droits civils sont concern\u00e9s.\nEnfin, M. le juge Mignault n'est pas moins cat\u00e9gorique lorsqu'il affirme[24] :\nC'est cette loi que l'appelante attaque pr\u00e9tendant qu'elle empi\u00e8te sur la juridiction du parlement canadien sur le droit criminel. A mon avis, il n'y a pas l\u00e0 l\u00e9gislation criminelle. La l\u00e9gislature veut emp\u00eacher qu'on ne se serve d'un immeuble pour des fins immorales; elle ne punit pas l'offense .elle-m\u00eame par l'amende ou l'emprisonnement, mais elle ne fait que statuer sur la possession et l'usage d'un immeuble. Cela rentre pleinement dans le droit civil. Dans une cause de Lymburn et al. v. Mayland et al.[25], le Conseil Priv\u00e9 a eu \u00e0 d\u00e9cider de la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de la \"Security Frauds Prevention Act, 1930, of Alberta\". Cette loi stipulait que personne ne pouvait faire le commerce de valeurs mobili\u00e8res, \u00e0 moins d'\u00eatre enregistr\u00e9 au d\u00e9partement du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Effectivement cette loi d\u00e9fendait \u00e0 une compagnie publique de vendre ses actions \u00e0 moins que ce ne fut par l'interm\u00e9diaire d'une personne enregistr\u00e9e, ou que la compagnie elle-m\u00eame fut enregistr\u00e9e. En vertu de la loi, le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, ou son d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9, pouvait enqu\u00eater si quelque acte frauduleux avait \u00e9t\u00e9 ou \u00e9tait sur le point d'\u00eatre commis. La loi imposait des p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s pour toute violation de ses dispositions, et, en vertu de l'art. 20 de la loi, c'\u00e9tait une offense de commettre un acte frauduleux qui n'\u00e9tait pas punissable en vertu des dispositions du Code criminel du Canada. Le Conseil Priv\u00e9 en est venu \u00e0 la conclusion que cette loi \u00e9tait dans les limites des pouvoirs de la l\u00e9gislature provinciale en vertu de l'art. 92 de l'Acte de l'Am\u00e9rique britannique du Nord, qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas invalide en ce qui concerne les compagnies f\u00e9d\u00e9rales parce qu'elle ne leur d\u00e9fendait pas de vendre \u00e0 moins qu'elles ne soient enregistr\u00e9es, mais les assuj\u00e9tissait simplement \u00e0 certaines r\u00e8gles applicables \u00e0 toutes les personnes faisant le commerce des valeurs mobili\u00e8res. Le Conseil Priv\u00e9 a aussi conclu qu'il ne s'agissait pas l\u00e0 d'une tentative d\u00e9tourn\u00e9e pour empi\u00e9ter sur le pouvoir l\u00e9gislatif f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, en ce qui concerne le droit criminel.\nLord Atkin s'exprime de la fa\u00e7on suivante, \u00e0 la page 323:\nIt was contended on behalf of the Attorney-General for the Dominion that to impose a condition making the bond fall due upon conviction for a criminal offence was to encroach upon the sole right of the Dominion to legislate in respect of the criminal law. It indirectly imposed an additional punishment for a criminal offence. Their Lordships do not consider this objection well founded. If the legislation be otherwise intro vires, the imposition of such an ordinary condition in a bond taken to secure good conduct does not appear to invade in any degree the field of criminal law.\nEt plus loin, \u00e0 la page 327, il dit ce qui suit:\nIn any case it appears to their Lordships, after reviewing the whole Act, that there is no ground for holding that the Act is a colourable attempt to encroach upon the exclusive legislative power of the Dominion as to criminal law. They have already given their reasons for holding that the Act cannot be considered invalid as destroying the status of Dominion companies. The provisions therefore of Part II of the Act appear to be competent Provincial enactments dealing with property and civil rights and have to be obeyed by persons subject to them.\nEnfin, dans la cause The Provincial Secretary of Prince Edward Island v. Egan (1), la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l'art. 84[26] du Highway Traffic Act, 1936 de l'\u00cele du Prince \u00c9douard \u00e9tait valide, malgr\u00e9 qu'il autorisait la confiscation par l'autorit\u00e9 provinciale de la licence de conducteur de toute personne conduisant son v\u00e9hicule, alors qu'elle \u00e9tait sous l'influence de liqueurs enivrantes. On a soutenu qu'il s'agissait d'une offense criminelle pr\u00e9vue par l'art. 285(4) du Code criminel, et que cette loi provinciale imposait une sanction additionnelle. La Cour a rejet\u00e9 ces pr\u00e9tentions et Sir Lyman Duff, alors juge en chef, a dit ce qui suit[27] :\nIt is, of course, beyond dispute that where an offence is created by competent Dominion legislation in exercise of the authority under section 91(27), the penalty or penalties attached to that offence, as well as the offence itself, become matters within that paragraph of section 91 which are excluded from provincial jurisdiction.\nThere is, however, no adequate ground for the conclusion that these particular enactments (section 84(1)(a) and (c)) are in their true character attempts to prescribe penalties for the offences mentioned, rather than enactments in regulation of licences.\nRinfret J. parlant pour lui-m\u00eame et pour Crocket et Kerwin JJ. s'est exprim\u00e9 de la fa\u00e7on suivante, it la page 414:\nIt cannot be open to contention for a moment that the imposing of such a penalty for enforcing a law of the competency of Prince Edward Island is an interference with criminal law, under section 91, subs. 27. Regina v. Watson (1890), 17 Ont. A.R. 221, at 249. It is not an additional penalty imposed for a violation of the criminal law. It provides for a civil disability arising out of a conviction for a criminal offence.\nEt, plus loin, \u00e0 la page 415, il ajoute:\nIt does not create an offence; it does not add to or vary the punishment already declared by the Criminal Code; it does not change or vary the procedure to be followed in the enforcement of any provision of the Criminal Code. It deals purely and simply with certain civil rights in the Province of Prince Edward Island. Such legislation can rely upon the decision, in this Court, of B\u00e9dard v. Dawson and the Attorney-General for Quebec [supra].\nHudson J. partage les m\u00eames vues \u00e0 la page 417:\nThe section in question does not create a new offence but makes provision in regard to the licence which has been issued under the provincial authority. I do not think that this can be regarded as an addition to any punishment or penalty provided for in section 285 of the Criminal Code. The situation seems to be analogous to that dealt with by the Judicial Committee in Lymburn v. Mayland [supra].\nEt, it la page 418, Taschereau J. dit:\nThis section merely provides for a civil disability arising out of a conviction for a criminal offence. The field of criminal law is in no degree invaded by this legislation which is aimed at the suppression of a nuisance on highways. There can be no doubt that the control of the roads and highways and the regulation of traffic thereon is assigned by the B.N.A. Act to the Legislatures of the Provinces.\nJe suis clairement d'opinion que si une province peut validement l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer sur toutes les mati\u00e8res civiles en rapport avec le droit criminel, si elle peut adopter des lois destin\u00e9es \u00e0 supprimer les conditions qui favorisent le crime, et contr\u00f4ler les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s afin de prot\u00e9ger la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 contre tout usage ill\u00e9gal qu'on peut en faire, si elle a le pouvoir incontestable de r\u00e9glementer les courtiers dans leurs transactions financi\u00e8res pour prot\u00e9ger le public contre la fraude, si, enfin, elle a le droit d'imposer des incapacit\u00e9s civiles comme cons\u00e9quence d'une offense criminelle, je ne vois pas pourquoi elle n'aurait pas \u00e9galement le pouvoir de d\u00e9cr\u00e9ter que ceux qui pr\u00eachent et \u00e9crivent des doctrines de nature \u00e0 favoriser la trahison, la violation des secrets officiels, la s\u00e9dition, etc., soient priv\u00e9s de la jouissance des immeubles d'o\u00f9 se propagent ces th\u00e9ories destin\u00e9es \u00e0 saper \u00e0 ses bases, et renverser l'ordre \u00e9tabli.\nL'exp\u00e9rience, il nous est permis d'en prendre une connaissance judiciaire, nous enseigne, en effet, que des Canadiens, il y a moins de dix ans, malgr\u00e9 les serments d'all\u00e9geance qu'ils avaient pr\u00eat\u00e9s, n'ont pas h\u00e9sit\u00e9 au nom du communisme \u00e0 violer les secrets officiels, et \u00e0 mettre en p\u00e9ril la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de l'\u00c9tat. La suppression de la diffusion de ces doctrines subversives par des sanctions civiles, est s\u00fbrement aussi importante que la suppression des maisons de d\u00e9sordre. Je demeure convaincu que le domaine du droit criminel, exclusivement de la comp\u00e9tence f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 envahi par la l\u00e9gislation en question, et qu'il ne s'agit que de sanctions civiles \u00e9tablies pour la pr\u00e9vention des crimes et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du pays.\nOn a aussi pr\u00e9tendu que cette l\u00e9gislation constituait une entrave \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 de la presse et \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 de parole. Je crois \u00e0 ces libert\u00e9s : ce sont des droits ind\u00e9niables dont b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient heureusement les gens de ce pays, mais ces libert\u00e9s ne seraient plus un droit, et deviendraient un privil\u00e8ge, si on permettait \u00e0 certains individus d'en abuser et de s'en servir pour diffuser des doctrines malsaines, qui conduisent n\u00e9cessairement it de flagrantes violations des lois \u00e9tablies. Ces libert\u00e9s, dont jouissent les citoyens et la presse, d'exprimer leurs croyances, leurs pens\u00e9es et leurs doctrines, sans autorisation ou censure pr\u00e9alables, ne sont pas des droits absolus. Elles sont n\u00e9cessairement limit\u00e9es, et doivent s'exercer dans le cadre de la l\u00e9galit\u00e9. Quand les bornes sont d\u00e9pass\u00e9es, elles deviennent abusives, et la loi doit alors intervenir pour exercer une action r\u00e9pressive, et prot\u00e9ger les citoyens et la soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\nLe m\u00eame raisonnement doit n\u00e9cessairement servir \u00e0 rencontrer l'objection soulev\u00e9e par l'appelant it l'effet que la loi attaqu\u00e9e, est une entrave \u00e0 la libre expression de pens\u00e9e de tout individu, candidat \u00e0 une \u00e9lection. Les id\u00e9es destructives de l'ordre social et de l'autorit\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, par des m\u00e9thodes dictatoriales, n'ont pas plus de droits en temps \u00e9lectoraux qu'en aucun autre temps. Cette loi, dans l'esprit de certains, peut para\u00eetre s\u00e9v\u00e8re, il ne m'appartient pas d'en juger la sagesse, mais la s\u00e9v\u00e9rit\u00e9 d'une loi adopt\u00e9e par le pouvoir comp\u00e9tent ne la marque pas du caract\u00e8re d'inconstitutionnalit\u00e9.\nPour toutes ces raisons, je suis d'avis que le pr\u00e9sent appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens payables par l'appelant \u00e0 l'intervenant. Je ne crois pas qu'il doit y avoir d'ordonnance en ce qui concerne les frais devant cette Cour entre l'appelant et l'intim\u00e9e.\nRAND J. :\u2014By 1 Geo. VI, c. 11, passed by the Legislature of the Province of Quebec and entitled \"An Act to Protect the Province against Communistic Propaganda\" (now R.S.Q. 1941, c. 52), the following provisions are enacted:\n3. It shall be illegal for any person, who possesses or occupies a house within the Province, to use it or allow any person to make use of it to propagate communism or bolshevism by any means whatsoever.\n12. It shall be unlawful to print, to publish in any manner whatsoever or to distribute in the Province any newspaper, periodical, pamphlet, circular, document or writing whatsoever propagating or tending to propagate communism or bolshevism. The word \"house\" is defined to extend to any building or other construction whatever. By s. 4 the Attorney-General,\n... upon satisfactory proof that an infringement of section 3 has been committed, may order the closing of the house against its use for any purpose whatsoever for a period of not more than one year; the closing order shall be registered at the registry office of the registration division wherein is situated such house, upon production of a copy of such order certified by the Attorney-General.\nWhen a house is closed, an owner who has not been in possession may apply to the Superior Court to have the order revised upon proving that in good faith he was ignorant of the use being made in contravention of the Act or that the house has not been so used during the twelve months preceding the order. Conversely, after an order has been so modified or terminated, the Attorney-General may, on application to the same Court, obtain a decree reviving it. No remedy by resort to a Court is extended to the person in possession against whom the order has become effective. The Attorney-General may at any time permit reoccupation on any conditions thought proper for the protection of the property and its contents or he may revoke the order.\nThe action in this appeal was brought by an owner against a tenant to have a lease set aside and for damages on the ground of the use of the leased premises for the illegal purpose so defined and their closure under such an order. As the validity of the Act was challenged by the defence, the Attorney-General intervened and that issue became the substantial question in the proceedings.\nIn addition to the closure, a large quantity of documentary matter was seized and removed. In the order both ss. 3 and 12 are recited and the concluding paragraph is in these terms :\nJe, soussign\u00e9, procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, croyablement inform\u00e9 des infractions et violations ci-dessus, vous enjoins de fermer pour toutes fins quelconques, pendant un an \u00e0 compter de l'ex\u00e9cution de cet ordre, la maison portant le num\u00e9ro civique 5321 de l'avenue du Pare, dans la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, et de plus, vous \u00eates par les pr\u00e9sentes autoris\u00e9, et je vous donne les instructions en cons\u00e9quence, \u00e0. saisir et confisquer tout journal, revue, pamphlet, circulaire, document ou \u00e9crit quelconque imprim\u00e9, publi\u00e9 ou distribu\u00e9 en contravention \u00e0 la dite loi, en particulier et sans restrictions it saisir et \u00e0 d\u00e9truire les exemplaires du journal \"Combat\". From this it is clear that the order was based upon both sections.\nIn the intervention, conclusion C was in these words:\nAdjuger que la dite loi, et toutes les dispositions d'icelle, sont constitutionnelles et valides, et en pleine force et vigueur.\nIn conformity with this and the conclusions in the action, the judgment of the Superior Court declared the statute in all respects to be valid, allowed the claim for resiliation, but dismissed that for damages because they had not been sufficiently proved. On appeal by the defendant that judgment was affirmed.\nMr. Beaulieu, for the Attorney-General, as a preliminary point, urged that the dismissal of the claim for damages removed the relevancy of s. 12 to the issue on the intervention and that this Court should consider only s. 3, a point which, if upheld, would entail a modification of the judgments below. But the validity of the entire statute was put in issue by the intervention and maintained by the Courts below; and in the circumstances of the case, apart from any question of severance and of prejudice to the rights of the appellant in relation to the judgment on the claim as well as against those executing the order should it not be upheld, I see no sufficient warrant at this stage to limit the scope of the appeal.\nThe first ground on which the validity of s. 3 is supported is head 13 of s. 92 of the British North America Act, \"Property in the Province\", and Mr. Beaulieu's contention goes in this manner : by that head the Province is vested with unlimited legislative power over property; it may, for instance, take land without compensation and generally may act as amply as if it were a sovereign state, untrammelled by constitutional limitation. The power being absolute can be used as an instrument or means to effect any purpose or object. Since the objective accomplishment under the statute here is an Act on property, its validity is self-evident and the question is concluded.\n1 am unable to agree that in our federal organization power absolute in such a sense resides in either legislature. The detailed distribution made by ss. 91 and 92 places limits to direct and immediate purposes of provincial action. Under head 13 the purpose would, in general, be a \"property\" purpose either primary or subsidiary to another head of the same section. If such a purpose is foreign to powers vested in the Province by the Act, it will invade the field of the Dominion. For example, land could not be declared forfeited or descent destroyed by attainder on conviction of a crime, nor could the convicted person's right of access to provincial Courts be destroyed. These would trench upon both criminal law and citizenship status. The settled principle that calls for a determination of the \"real character\", the \"pith and substance\", of what purports to be enacted and whether it is \"colourable\" or is intended to effect its ostensible object, means that the true nature of the legislative act, its substance in purpose, must lie within s. 92 or some other endowment of provincial power. That a power ostensibly as here under a specific head cannot be exercised as a means directly and immediately to accomplish a purpose not within that endowment is demonstrated by the following decisions of the Judicial Committee: Union Colliery Company of British Columbia, Limited et al. v. Bryden[28], holding that legislative power in relation to employment in a coal mine could not be used as a means of nullifying the civil capacities of citizenship and, specifically, of persons qualifying under head 25 of s. 91, Naturalization and Aliens; Canadian Federation of Agriculture v. Attorney-General for Quebec et al.[29], holding that the Dominion, under its power in relation to criminal law, could not prohibit the manufacture of margarine for the purpose of benefiting in local trade one class of producer as against another. The heads of ss. 91 and 92 are to be read and interpreted with each other and with the provisions of the statute as a whole; and what is then exhibited is a pattern of limitations, curtailments and modifications of legislative scope within a texture of interwoven and interacting powers.\nIn support of the legislation on this ground, B\u00e9dard v. Dawson et al.[30] was relied on. In that case the statute provided that it should be illegal for the owner or occupier of any house or building to use it or allow it to be used as a disorderly house; and procedure was provided by which the Superior Court could, after a conviction under the Criminal Code, grant an injunction against the owner restraining that use of it. If the use continued, the Court could order the building to be closed for a period of not more than one year.\nThis power is seen to have been based upon a conviction for maintaining a public nuisance. Under the public law of England which underlies that of all the Provinces, such an act was not only a matter for indictment but in a civil aspect the Court could enjoin its continuance. The essence of this aspect is its repugnant or prejudicial effect upon the neighbouring inhabitants and properties.\nOn that view this Court proceeded in B\u00e9dard. Idington J. at p. 684 says:\nIndeed the duty to protect neighbouring property owners in such cases as are involved in this question before us renders the question hardly arguable.\nThere are many instances of other nuisances which can be better rectified by local legislation within the power of the legislatures over property and civil rights than by designating them crimes and leaving them to be dealt with by Parliament as such.\nAnglin J. at p. 685:\n... I am of the opinion that this statute ... is concerned exclusively with the control and enjoyment of property and the safeguarding of the community from the consequences of an illegal and injurious use being made of it\u2014a pure matter of civil right. In my opinion in enacting the statute now under consideration the legislature exercised the power which it undoubtedly possesses to provide for the suppression of a nuisance and the prevention of its recurrence by civil process.\nBrodeur J. at pp. 685-6:\nLa l\u00e9gislature provinciale de Qu\u00e9bec, sachant que ces maisons affectaient consid\u00e9rablement la valeur des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s du voisinage et rendaient plus difficile la r\u00e9glementation polici\u00e8re, a jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos d'ordonner leur fermeture si, apr\u00e8s avis, les propri\u00e9taires ne voyaient pas \u00e0 y faire cesser le commerce immoral qui s'y faisait.\nIl est incontestable que si une personne maintient une maison ou fait une chose qui constitue une nuisance, et que cet acte soit consid\u00e9r\u00e9 criminel par le parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, nos tribunaux peuvent \u00eatre autoris\u00e9s par des lois provinciales \u00e0 \u00e9mettre une injonction pour mettre fin \u00e0 ces violations du droit public.\nThat the scene of study, discussion or dissemination of views or opinions on any matter has ever been brought under legal sanction in ternis of nuisance is not suggested. For the past century and a half in both the United Kingdom and Canada, there has been a steady removal of restraints on this freedom, stopping only at perimeters where the foundation of the freedom itself is threatened. Apart from sedition, obscene writings and criminal libels, the public law leaves the literary, discursive and polemic use of language, in the broadest sense, free.\nThe object of the legislation here, as expressed by the title, is admittedly to prevent the propagation of communism and bolshevism, but it could just as properly have been the suppression of any other political, economic or social doctrine or theory; and the issue is whether that object is a matter \"in relation to which\" under s. 92 the Province may exclusively make laws. Two heads of the section are claimed to authorize it: head 13, as a matter of \"Civil Rights\", and head 16, \"Local and Private Matters\".\nMr. Tremblay in a lucid argument treated such a limitation of free discussion and the spread of ideas generally as in the same category as the ordinary civil restrictions of libel and slander. These obviously affect the matter and scope of discussion to the extent that it trenches upon the rights of individuals to reputation and standing in the community; and the line at which the restraint is drawn is that at which public concern for the discharge of legal or moral duties and government through rational persuasion, and that for private security, are found to be in rough balance.\nBut the analogy is not a true one. The ban is directed against the freedom or civil liberty of the actor; no civil right of anyone is affected nor is any civil remedy created. The aim of the statute is, by means of penalties, to prevent what is considered a poisoning of men's minds, to shield the individual from exposure to dangerous ideas, to protect him, in short, from his own thinking propensities. There is nothing of civil rights in this; it is to curtail or proscribe those freedoms which the majority so far consider to be the condition of social cohesion and its ultimate stabilizing force.\nIt is then said that the ban is a local matter under head 16; that the social situation in Quebec is such that safeguarding its intellectual and spiritual life against subversive doctrines becomes a special need in contrast with that for a general regulation by Parliament. A similar contention was made in Re Section 6 of The Farm Security Act (1944) of Saskatchewan[31]. What was dealt with there was the matter of interest on mortgages and a great deal of evidence to show the unique vicissitudes of farming in that Province was adduced. But there, as here, it was and is obvious that local conditions of that nature, assuming, for the purpose of the argument only, their existence, cannot extend legislation to matters which lie outside of s. 92.\nIndicated by the opening words of the preamble in the Act of 1867, reciting the desire of the four Provinces to be united in a federal union with a constitution \"similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom\", the political theory which the Act embodies is that of parliamentary government, with all its social implications, and the provisions of the statute elaborate that principle in the institutional apparatus which they create or contemplate. Whatever the deficiencies in its workings, Canadian government is in substance the will of the majority expressed directly or indirectly through popular assemblies. This means ultimately government by the free public opinion of an open society, the effectiveness of which, as events have not infrequently demonstrated, is undoubted.\nBut public opinion, in order to meet such a responsibility, demands the condition of a virtually unobstructed access to and diffusion of ideas. Parliamentary government postulates a capacity in men, acting freely and under self-restraints, to govern themselves; and that advance is best served in the degree achieved of individual liberation from subjective as well as objective shackles. Under that government, the freedom of discussion in Caanda, as a subject-matter of legislation, has a unity of interest and significance extending equally to every part of the Dominion. With such dimensions it is ipso facto excluded from head 16 as a local matter.\nThis constitutional fact is the political expression of the primary condition of social life, thought and its communication by language. Liberty in this is little less vital to man's mind and spirit than breathing is to his physical existence. As Such an inherence in the individual it is embodied in his status of citizenship. Outlawry, for example, divesting civil standing and destroying citizenship, is a matter of Dominion concern. Of the fitness of this order of government to the Canadian organization, the words of Taschereau J. in Brassard et al. v. Langevin[32] should be recalled:\nThe object of the electoral law was to promote, by means of the ballot, and with the absence of all undue influence, the free and sincere expression of public opinion in the choice of members of the Parliament of Canada. This law is the just sequence to the excellent institutions which we have borrowed from England, institutions which, as regards civil and religious liberty, leave to Canadians nothing to envy in other countries.\nProhibition of any part of this activity as an evil would be within the scope of criminal law, as ss. 60, 61 and 62 of the Criminal Code dealing with sedition exemplify. Bearing in mind that the endowment of parliamentary institutions is one and entire for the Dominion, that Legislatures and Parliament are permanent features of our constitutional structure, and that the body of discussion is indivisible, apart from the incidence of criminal law and civil rights, and incidental effects of legislation in relation to other matters, the degree and nature of its regulation must await future consideration; for the purposes here it is sufficient to say that it is not a matter within the regulation of a Province.\nMr. Scott, in his able examination of the questions raised, challenged also the validity of ss. 4 et seq. which vest in the Attorney-General the authority to adjudicate upon the commission of the illegal act under s. 3 and to issue the order of closure; but in view of the conclusions reached on the other grounds, the consideration of this becomes unnecessary.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal, set aside the judgments below, dismiss the action and direct a declaration on the intervention that the statute in its entirety is ultra vires of the Province. The appellant will be entitled to the costs of the action in the Superior Court against the respondent Elbling and the costs occasioned by the intervention in all Courts against the Attorney-General. KELLOCK J.:\u2014-I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of my brother Rand, with which I agree. I only desire to add a reference to my own judgment in Saumur v. The City of Quebec[33], and particularly to the statement there reproduced from Mr. Justice Mignault's work, vol. 1, p. 131, as follows:\nLes droits sont les facult\u00e9s ou avantages que les lois accordent aux personnes. Ils sont civils, politiques ou publics ...\nCertains droits existent qui, \u00e0 proprement parler, ne sont ni civils ni politiques,' tels sont les droits de s'associer, de s'assembler paisiblement et sans armes, de p\u00e9titionner, de manifester sa pens\u00e9e par la voie de la presse ou autrement, la libert\u00e9 individuelle et enfin la libert\u00e9 de conscience. Ces droits ne sont point des droits civils, car ils ne constituent point des rapports de particulier \u00e0 particulier; ce ne sont pas non plus de v\u00e9ritables droits politiques, puisqu'on Ies exerce sans prendre aucune part au gouvernement du pays. Quelques personnes les rangent dans une classe particuli\u00e8re sous la d\u00e9nomination de droits publics.\nIn my opinion, legislation of the character of that here in question cannot be supported as being in relation to civil rights in the Province within the meaning of head 13 of s. 92 of the British North America Act, and equally, it cannot be said to be in relation to matters of a merely local or private nature in the province.\nNo objection was raised by the Attorney-General to the entertaining of this appeal on the ground that there no longer remained any lis as between the appellant and the respondent Elbling, but the point should perhaps be noticed. In my view, any such objection, had it been made, would be completely answered by the decision of this Court in B\u00e9dard v. Dawson et al.[34]. There the action had been taken by the respondent Dawson with regard to certain premises alleged to have been used or allowed to be used by the appellant contrary to a statute of the Quebec Legislature entitled \"An Act respecting the Owners of Houses used as Disorderly Houses\". The constitutional validity of the statute having been brought into question by the appellant, the Attorney-General intervened. The Superior Court maintained the action and the intervention, but by the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, Appeal Side, the main action between the plaintiff and the defendant was remitted to the Superior Court to permit of further proof being adduced in regard to the defendant's ownership of the property in question. That judgment, not being a final judgment, was not the subject of appeal to this Court. On the other hand, the judgment of the Superior Court maintaining the intervention of the Attorney-General was confirmed by the Court of King's Bench. This was a final judgment and was the subject of the appeal to this Court, which overruled an objection to the entertaining of the appeal on the ground that the main action, having been referred back, had still to be dealt with by the trial Court. I am unable to distinguish, in substance, the circumstances of that case from the present.\nI would allow the appeal, set aside the judgments below, dismiss the action and direct a declaration on the intervention that the statute in its entirety is ultra vires of the Province. The appellant should have the costs of the action in the Superior Court against the respondent Elbling and the costs occasioned by the intervention in all Courts against the Attorney-General.\nThe judgment of Locke and Nolan JJ. was delivered by\nNOLAN J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side)[35] dismissing an appeal from the judgment of the Superior Court and maintaining the intervention of the Attorney-General for the Province of Quebec.\nBy a lease dated December 29, 1947, the respondent Freda Elbling leased to one Max Bailey the premises bearing civic number 5321 Park Avenue in the city of Montreal for the term of 151 months from January 15, 1948.\nOn December 30, 1947, the respondent Elbling granted to the lessee Bailey an option to renew the lease for an additional period terminating on April 30, 1950.\nOn February 5, 1948, the lessee Bailey assigned the lease and option to the appellant.\nThe option was exercised and the appellant, on January 27, 1949, was in possession of the premises under a lease which expired on April 30, 1950.\nOn February 15, 1949, the respondent Elbling commenced an action against the appellant, praying for cancellation of the lease and for damages in the amount of $2,170. The ground of action was the alleged use of the premises for the purpose of propagating communism contrary to the provisions of \"An Act to protect the Province against Communistic Propaganda\", R.S.Q. 1941, c. 52, hereinafter referred to as the Padlock Act.\nThe appellant admitted that the premises were used to propagate communism, but pleaded that the Padlock Act was wholly ultra vires of the Legislature of the Province of Quebec. In accordance with art. 114 of the Quebec Code of Civil Procedure, notice of his intention to contest the constitutionality of the legislation was given to the Attorney-General, who intervened in the action.\nThe learned trial judge ordered cancellation of the lease and rejected the claim for damages. There was no appeal on the question of damages.\nThe learned trial judge also held that the Act was constitutional and, in pith and substance, was not criminal law and was not related to any matters exclusively reserved to the Dominion Parliament. He found that it was related to property and civil rights in the Province and was a matter of merely local or private nature.\nThis judgment was affirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side), Barclay J. dissenting.\nOn January 27, 1949, the Attorney-General of the Province of Quebec ordered the director of the provincial police to close the premises for a period of one year from the execution of the order and to seize and confiscate all newspapers, reviews, pamphlets, circulars, documents or writings published in contravention of the Padlock Act.\nThe pertinent sections of the Padlock Act read as follows:\n3. It shall be illegal for any person, who possesses or occupies a house within the Province, to use it or allow any person to make use of it to propagate communism or bolshevism by any means whatsoever.\n4. The Attorney-General, upon satisfactory proof that an infringement of section 3 has been committed, may order the closing of the house against its use for any purpose whatsoever for a period of not more than one year; ...\n12. It shall be unlawful to print, to publish in any manner whatsoever or to distribute in the Province any newspaper, periodical, pamphlet, circular, document or writing whatsoever propagating or tending to propagate communism or bolshevism. 13. Any person infringing or participating in the infringement of section 12 shall be liable to an imprisonment of not less than three months nor more than twelve months, in addition to the costs of prosecution, and, in default of payment of such costs, to an additional imprisonment of one month... .\n14. Any constable or peace officer, upon instructions of the Attorney-General, of his substitute or of a person specially authorized by him for the purpose, may seize and confiscate any newspaper, periodical, pamphlet, circular, document or writing whatsoever, printed, published or distributed in contravention of section 12, and the Attorney-General may order the destroying thereof.\nThe main question for determination on this appeal is whether or not the enactment in question is in relation to \"Criminal Law\" as that term is used in head 27 of s. 91 of the British North America Act. It has been held by the Judicial Committee in Attorney-General for Ontario v. The Hamilton Street Railway Company et al.[36] and by this Court in Re Section 498A of the Criminal Code[37] that the term \"Criminal Law\" means criminal law \"in its widest sense\" and is in no way confined to what was criminal law by the law of England or of any Province in 1867. It must extend to the power to make new crimes.\nIt was contended on behalf of the appellant before this Court that the legislation, judged by its true nature and purpose, is related to public wrongs rather than private rights and is, therefore, criminal law within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada.\nThe respondent took the position that the legislation was in no sense criminal law, but was related to property and civil rights and to matters of a local or private nature in the province.\nThe history of the legislation is not without interest. In 1919 the Criminal Code was amended (9-10 Geo. V, c. 46, s. 1) by adding thereto ss. 97A and 97n, which provided that any assoication the purpose of which was to bring about any governmental, industrial or economic change within Canada by the use of force was an unlawful association. Penalties were imposed on anyone who acted as an officer or member thereof, or who published or imported any literature on their behalf. Sections 97A and 97B later became s. 98 in R.S.C. 1927, c. 36.\nIn 1930 s. 133A (which is substantially embodied in the present s. 61) was added to the Criminal Code (by 20-21 Geo. V, c. 11, s. 2) and ameliorated the sedition laws.\nIn 1934 the Legislature of Quebec enacted \"An Act respecting certain public meetings endangering public, social or religious order\", entitled the Certain Meetings Advertising Act (24 Geo. V, c. 51), which forbade the distribution of certain circulars in towns or villages unless prior approval had been obtained from the chief of police, and prohibited approval if the printer, maker or author of the circular was not domiciled in the Province.\nIn 1936 s. 98 of the Criminal Code was repealed by 1 Edw. VIII, c. 29, s. 1, and by s. 4 of the same Act a new subs. (4) was added to s. 133 of the Criminal Code (now s. 60, subs. (4)) as follows:\n133 (4) Without limiting the generality of the meaning of the expression \"seditious intention\" everyone shall be presumed to have a seditious intention who publishes, or circulates any writing, printing or document in which it is advocated, or who teaches or advocates, the use, without the authority of law, of force, as a means of accomplishing any governmental change within Canada.\nIn 1937 the Legislature of Quebec enacted the Padlock Act (1 Geo. VI, c. 11) and on the same day repealed the Certain Meetings Advertising Act (by 1 Geo. VI, c. 79).\nAt the outset it becomes necessary to consider the judgment of this Court in B\u00e9dard v. Dawson et al.[38], which held that another padlock law, namely, \"An Act respecting the Owners of Houses used as Disorderly Houses\" (now R.S.Q. 1941, c. 50), was intra vires.\nSection 3 of that Act provides:\n3. It shall be illegal for any person, who owns or occupies any house or building of any nature whatsoever, to use or to allow any person to use the same as a disorderly house.\nSection 9 of the Act authorizes a judge to order the closing of a disorderly house. This Court held that the legislation was intra vires of the Provincial Legislature, as it dealt with a matter of property and civil rights by providing for the suppression of a nuisance and not with criminal law by aiming at the punishment of a crime.\nAnglin J. (later C.J.C.) said at p. 685:\nI am of the opinion that this statute in no wise impinges on the domain of criminal law but is concerned exclusively with the control and enjoyment of property and the safeguarding of the community from the consequences of an illegal and injurious use being made of it\u2014a pure matter of civil right. In my opinion in enacting the statute now under consideration the legislature exercised the power which it undoubtedly possesses to provide for the suppression of a nuisance and the prevention of its recurrence by civil process.\nIn my view B\u00e9dard v. Dawson et al. may be distinguished on the ground that the statute there considered was concerned with the control or enjoyment of property and with safeguarding the community from the consequences of an illegal or injurious use being made of property, whereas that in the present case is aimed at the prevention of the propagation of communism. The question of the suppression of a local nuisance does not arise.\nIn Johnson v. The Attorney General of Alberta[39] Locke J., referring to B\u00e9dard v. Dawson et al., supra, said at p. 157:\n(1) [1954] S.C.R. 127, [1954] 2 D.L.R. 625, 108 C.C.C. 1.\n... it was the opinion of all the members of the Court that the real purpose of the statute [the Disorderly House Act] was the control and enjoyment of property and that it was not directed to the punishment of a crime.\nMoreover, in B\u00e9dard v. Dawson et al. the offence was created under the Criminal Code of Canada (ss. 228, 228a, 229 and 229a) and not under the provincial legislation (the Disorderly House Act). The provincial legislation merely provided what would be the civil effect on the owner of a house in which such an offence had been committed.\nThe facts that in B\u00e9dard v. Dawson et al. the offence committed was defined in the Criminal Code, whereas in the present case it is that The nature of the offence dealt with in B\u00e9dard v. Dawson et al. was so different from that under consideration in the present case as to preclude comparison; and that there is a radical difference in the procedural aspects of the two cases, all impel me to the conclusion that the two cases are clearly distinguishable. B\u00e9dard v. Dawson et al. was followed by Greenshields C.J. in Fineberg v. Taub[40]. In that case the constitutionality of the Act now under consideration in the present case, was subjected to attack on similar grounds. In upholding the constitutionality of the legislation Greenshields C.J., at p. 237, said:\nThe underlying purpose of the incriminated statute is to protect the Province of Quebec against communistic propaganda. Nowhere in the Act is a crime or criminal offence created. The purpose of the Act is to prevent and not to punish. Clause (3) of the Act declares it to be illegal for any person who possesses or occupies a house within the Province to use it or allow any person to make use of it to propagate communism or bolshevism by any means whatever. That is clearly a declaration affecting the use of property within this Province.\nWith respect, I am unable to agree that the legislation under attack is purely and simply to determine the civil consequences of a criminal act. Clearly it affects the use of property within the Province, but, in my view, it is not related to property and civil rights or to matters of a local or private nature in the Province, but its true nature and purpose is the suppression of communism by creating a new crime with accompanying penal provisions.\nThe respondent the Attorney-General contended that only the constitutionality of s. 3 should be passed upon by this Court on the ground that, admittedly, the offence committed was in propagating communism in a house and consequently s. 12 was not in issue.\nIt should be pointed out that both ss. 3 and 12 were specifically referred to in the order of the Attorney-General closing the house. Moreover, the appellant in his notice of plea of unconstitutionality, given pursuant to art. 114 of the Code of Civil Procedure, stated that he had pleaded the unconstitutionality of the whole of the statute and the Attorney-General intervened on the ground that the whole of the statute was infra vires of the Provincial Legislature. In my view, therefore, the constitutionality of both ss. 3 and 12 is properly before this Court for adjudication.\nIt was also contended by the respondent the Attorney-General that ss. 3 and 12 of the Act created two separate and independent illegalities imposing different penalties and that consequently the sections were severable and the invalidity of one would not affect the validity of the other. On this point I agree with the contention of the appellant that the two separate sections in the statute are so inter-connected that they must be read together as expressing a single legislative purpose. In addition the question of severability could only arise if one or other of these sections were held to be intra vires, so that the valid might be severed from the invalid. If both are invalid there can be no severance.\nThe respondent the Attorney-General contended that, there being no provision in the Criminal Code, or in any law passed by the Parliament of Canada, which made communism a crime or which forbade the propagation of communism, the field was unoccupied and the provincial legislation was valid. I do not agree with this contention.\nIn Union Colliery Company of British Columbia, Limited et al. v. Bryden[41], Lord Watson, in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee, made it clear that the abstinence of the Dominion Parliament from legislating to the full limit of its powers could not have the effect of transferring to any Provincial Legislature the legislative power which had been assigned to the Dominion by s. 91 of the Act of 1867. Attention is also drawn to Attorney-General for Canada v. Attorneys-General for Ontario, Quebec and Nova Scotia; Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for Canada; Attorneys-General for Quebec and Nova Scotia v. Attorney-General for Canada[42], and to Attorney-General for Alberta v. Attorney-General for Canada et al.[43], both to the same effect.\nThe appellant took the position before this Court that the legislation in question deals with sedition and seditious literature and is an encroachment upon ss. 133 and 133A of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36. It was contended that these sections provide a complete series of rules governing freedom of discussion and governing the publication of printed matter dealing with political and governmental affairs and consequently the theory of the unoccupied field was inapplicable. In my view of the matter it is unnecessary to decide upon the merit of this contention because, whether or not the Dominion Parliament has made communism a crime or forbidden its propagation, it has the exclusive jurisdiction so to do.\nHolding, as I do, that the legislation under attack, judged by its true nature and purpose, is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada, it is unnecessary to consider the other grounds put forward by the appellant in support of the appeal.\nI would dispose of the appeal as proposed by my brother Abbott.\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014The question in this appeal is whether c. 52 of R.S.Q. 1941, formerly c. 11 of the statutes of Quebec, 1937, 1 Geo. VI, entitled \"Act to protect the Province against Communistic Propaganda\", hereinafter referred to as the Act, is intra vires of the Legislature. The relevant circumstances and the nature of the arguments addressed to us sufficiently appear in the reasons of other members of the Court.\nIn my opinion the Act is invalid in toto, as being in pith and substance legislation in relation to the criminal law, a matter assigned by s. 91, head 27, of the British North America Act to the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada.\nThe nature and purpose of the legislation clearly appear from the words of the Act. The propagation of communism or bolshevism is regarded as an evil and such propagation, by any means whatsover in a house within the Province and by any writing whatsoever elsewhere in the Province, is forbidden under punitive sanctions.\nThe circumstance that the penalty prescribed for a breach of the provisions of s. 3 is the closing of a house within the Province has not the effect of making the enactment one in relation to property and civil rights in the Province, and I find myself unable to relate the Act to any provincial purpose falling within head 13 or 16 of s. 92 of the British North America Act. The purpose and effect of the Act are to make criminal the propagation of communism or bolshevism which the Legislature in the public interest intends to prohibit. It is legislation in relation to what is conceived to be a public evil not in relation to civil rights or local matters.\nHaving reached this conclusion I do not find it necessary to deal with any of the other grounds upon which the validity of the Act was impugned.\nI would dispose of the appeal as proposed by my brother Abbott. ,\nFAUTEUX J.:\u2014L'action en r\u00e9siliation de bail, intent\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 l'appelant, se fonde uniquement sur la Loi concernant la propagande communiste, S.R.Q. 1941, c. 52. La constitutionnalit\u00e9 de cette loi a \u00e9t\u00e9 attaqu\u00e9e par ce dernier, soutenue par le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et maintenue, en premi\u00e8re instance, par un jugement confirm\u00e9 par une d\u00e9cision majoritaire de la Cour d'Appel. Subs\u00e9quemment, et consid\u00e9rant que la question en \u00e9tait une de \"consid\u00e9rable importance\", la Cour d'Appel autorisa un pourvoi devant cette Cour.\nLa loi attaqu\u00e9e est intitul\u00e9e \"Loi prot\u00e9geant la province contre la propagande communiste\" et peut \u00eatre cit\u00e9e sous le titre de Loi concernant la propagande communiste (art. 1). Le statut comporte deux dispositions de substance: (i) l'art. 3 d\u00e9clare ill\u00e9gale l'utilisation d'une maison pour la diffusion du communisme ou du bolch\u00e9visme; et (ii) l'art. 12 d\u00e9clare ill\u00e9gales l'impression, la publication, la distribution de tout \u00e9crit quelconque propageant ou tendant \u00e0 propager l'une ou l'autre de ces doctrines. La violation de l'une ou l'autre de ces dispositions constitue une infraction sanctionn\u00e9e, dans le premier cas, par la fermeture de la maison pour toutes fins quelconques pendant une p\u00e9riode n'exc\u00e9dant pas un an (art. 4) et, dans le second cas, par un emprisonnement d'au moins trois mois et d'au plus douze mois (art. 13). Bref, et sauf la propagande verbale \u00e0 ciel ouvert, la loi prohibe toute propagande des doctrines indiqu\u00e9es, que ce soit au moyen d'\u00e9crits ou de la parole.\nD'autres dispositions de la loi incrimin\u00e9e assurent, par des d\u00e9finitions compr\u00e9hensives et par une proc\u00e9dure exceptionnelle et exp\u00e9ditive, l'atteinte en pl\u00e9nitude des fins vis\u00e9es aux deux articles de substance. C'est ainsi que (art. 2) :\nLe mot \"maison\" d\u00e9signe tout b\u00e2timent, abri, appentis, hangar ou autre construction, sous quelque nom qu'elle soit connue ou d\u00e9sign\u00e9e attach\u00e9e au sol ou portative, \u00e9rig\u00e9e ou plac\u00e9e au-dessus ou au-dessous du sol, de fa\u00e7on permanente ou temporaire; et lorsqu'il s'agit d'une maison au sens du pr\u00e9sent paragraphe situ\u00e9e partie dans le territoire de la province et partie hors de ce territoire, le mot \"maison\" d\u00e9signe la partie situ\u00e9e dans le territoire de la province de Qu\u00e9bec;\net c'est ainsi que l'\u00e9mission des ordonnances de fermeture, de saisie, de confiscation et de destruction des \u00e9crits, \u00e9chappe \u00e0 la juridiction normale des tribunaux pour demeurer de la comp\u00e9tence exclusive du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral (arts. 4 et 14). Enfin, les autres articles donnent, dans certaines circonstances et \u00e0 certaines conditions, un pouvoir de revision de l'ordonnance de fermeture \u00e0 la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure ou au procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral.\nDe cet examen, il appara\u00eet qu'il ne s'agit pas ici d'une loi complexe, c'est-\u00e0-dire une loi ayant des dispositions embrassant plusieurs mati\u00e8res, au sens des arts. 91 et 92 de l'Acte de l'Am\u00e9rique britannique du Nord, 1867. Il s'agit au contraire d'une loi simple et dont les deux articles de substance, les arts. 3 et 12, ne portent que sur une m\u00eame mati\u00e8re, manifestant ainsi l'unit\u00e9 de leur objet et de celui de la loi enti\u00e8re, soit : la prohibition de la propagande communiste. Et ce, dans la mesure et par des sanctions pr\u00e9cis\u00e9es.\nPour d\u00e9terminer la nature et le caract\u00e8re v\u00e9ritable de la loi, on ne saurait cons\u00e9quemment\u2014soit dit en toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour ceux qui entretiennent une opinion contraire\u2014sous le pr\u00e9texte que le litige se fonde uniquement sur l'art. 3 ou qu'il ne s'agisse pas ici d'une r\u00e9f\u00e9rence, limiter le champ de la consid\u00e9ration \u00e0 ce dernier article, \u00e0 l'exclusion de l'art. 12. On ne saurait de plus, pour d\u00e9terminer l'objet de cet art. 3, l'extraire du contexte de la loi o\u00f9 il se trouve pour, le consid\u00e9rant ainsi isol\u00e9ment, lui assigner un objet diff\u00e9rent de celui que sa pr\u00e9sence dans le cadre de la loi et que le titre d'icelle doivent normalement lui donner. C'est d'ailleurs conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ces vues que le probl\u00e8me a \u00e9t\u00e9 compris et envisag\u00e9, en premi\u00e8re instance, tant par l'appelant, le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et le juge: ils ont consid\u00e9r\u00e9 l'art. 3 comme faisant partie d'un tout en attaquant, soutenant et maintenant respectivement la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de la loi dans son entier.\nQue l'unique objet l\u00e9gal de cette loi soit de prohiber, avec sanctions p\u00e9nales, la propagande communiste, ou plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, de faire de la propagande communiste un acte criminel, la chose, je crois, ne peut \u00eatre plus manifeste. Quiconque \"commet une infraction \u00e0 l'article 12\", dit l'art. 13, est passible d'emprisonnement. Ici, la punition prend la forme d'une main-mise de l'\u00c9tat sur la personne du coupable; c'est la restriction de la libert\u00e9. Le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \"sur preuve satisfaisante d'une infraction \u00e0 l'article 3\", dit l'art. 4, peut ordonner la fermeture de la maison utilis\u00e9e en contravention de cet article. Ici, la punition prend la forme d'une main-mise de l'\u00c9tat sur les biens; c'est l'atteinte au droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, d'usufruit ou d'usage, du coupable ou d'une personne qui ne l'est pas mais que la loi pr\u00e9sume l'\u00eatre jusqu'\u00e0 preuve de sa bonne foi (art. 6(a) ). Dans les deux cas, la violation de la loi constitue une infraction qu'elle punit. Peu importe la forme de la loi, l'agencement des articles et les mots employ\u00e9s. Comme le signale le Lord Chancelier, le Vicomte Caldecote, dans Board of Trustees of The Lethbridge Northern Irrigation District et al. v. Independent Order of Foresters; The King v. Independent Order of Foresters[44], au premier paragraphe de la page 534: \"The substance and not the form of the enactment in question must be regarded.\" Dans cette derni\u00e8re cause, le Comit\u00e9 Judiciaire du Conseil Priv\u00e9 n'a pas h\u00e9sit\u00e9, pour rechercher l'essence et la v\u00e9ritable substance, \"the pith and substance\", d'une l\u00e9gislation, \u00e0 faire entrer dans la consid\u00e9ration de la question, l'examen des lois contemporaines de la m\u00eame L\u00e9gislature, examen qui r\u00e9v\u00e9la l'unit\u00e9 d'objet, d'essence et de substance de ces diff\u00e9rentes l\u00e9gislations; et en d\u00e9clarant ultra vires la l\u00e9gislation sous consid\u00e9ration, on a appliqu\u00e9 le principe qu'on ne peut faire indirectement ce qu'on n'a pas le pouvoir de faire directement. Bref, la loi incrimin\u00e9e prohibe et punit la propagande communiste par la perte temporaire d'un droit \u2014celui de la libert\u00e9 ou de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9\u2014et non par la perte d'un privil\u00e8ge. En cela, elle rencontre int\u00e9gralement les conditions de la formule classique \u00e9tablie par Lord Atkin aux pages 324-5 dans Proprietary Articles Trade Association et al. v. Attorney-General for Canada et al.[45], pour conclure \u00e0 la nature criminelle d'un acte: \"Is the act prohibited with penal consequences?\" Qu'une L\u00e9gislature provinciale ait le pouvoir de prohiber avec sanctions p\u00e9nales certaines actions ou omissions, la chose est \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire. C'est l\u00e0 un pouvoir que le para. 15 de l'art. 92 \u00e9tablit, mais limite dans les termes suivants:\n15. The Imposition or Punishment by Fine, Penalty, or Imprisonment for enforcing any Law of the Province made in relation to any Matter coming within any of the Classes of Subjects enumerated in this Section.\nManifestement, ce pouvoir donn\u00e9 \u00e0 une L\u00e9gislature d'infliger des punitions est, de son essence\u2014contrairement \u00e0 ce qui est le cas du pouvoir du Parlement d'\u00e9tablir des crimes\u2014un pouvoir auxiliaire, \"ancillary\". Aussi bien, la validit\u00e9 d'une disposition l\u00e9gislative d'ordre p\u00e9nal d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9e par une L\u00e9gislature, en vertu du para. 15 de l'art. 92, est subordonn\u00e9e \u00e0 la validit\u00e9 de la disposition l\u00e9gislative principale dont la disposition auxiliaire tend \u00e0 assurer l'ex\u00e9cution. En l'esp\u00e8ce, la mati\u00e8re de la disposition principale\u2014prohibition de la propagande communiste\u2014n'en est certes pas une qui en soi tombe dans la cat\u00e9gorie des sujets \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s en l'art. 92 comme \u00e9tant de la comp\u00e9tence de la L\u00e9gislature. Seul le Parlement, l\u00e9gif\u00e9rant en mati\u00e8re criminelle, a comp\u00e9tence pour d\u00e9cr\u00e9ter, d\u00e9finir, d\u00e9fendre et punir ces mati\u00e8res d'un \u00e9crit ou d'un discours qui, en raison de leur nature, l\u00e8sent l'ordre social ou la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de l'\u00c9tat. Tels sont, par exemple, les libelles diffamatoires, obsc\u00e8nes, blasph\u00e9matoires ou s\u00e9ditieux. Dans ces cas, il ne s'agit plus de l\u00e9sion de droits individuels donnant droit \u00e0 compensation mon\u00e9taire. Il s'agit de l\u00e9sion des droits de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, emportant punition. Ceci n'implique pas \u00e9videmment que la L\u00e9gislature ne peut validement adopter aucune disposition l\u00e9gislative d'ordre p\u00e9nal affectant indirectement la libert\u00e9 d'expression; telle serait, par exemple, une prohibition avec sanctions p\u00e9nales de la tenue de toute assembl\u00e9e publique dans les 24 heures pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant le jour du scrutin. En ce cas, la disposition l\u00e9gislative est une disposition auxiliaire \u00e0 une disposition principale portant sur une mati\u00e8re qui est de la comp\u00e9tence de la L\u00e9gislature, soit la r\u00e9glementation des \u00e9lections dans la province. Aussi bien, les tribunaux tiendront comme n'\u00e9tant pas des empi\u00e9tements sur le droit criminel les dispositions p\u00e9nales d'ordre provincial \u00e9tablies dans le but d'assurer l'ex\u00e9cution d'une loi de la Province, sur une mati\u00e8re \u00e9galement tenue comme \u00e9tant de sa comp\u00e9tence. C'est l\u00e0 le fondement des d\u00e9cisions de cette Cour dans B\u00e9dard v. Dawson et al.[46] et dans The Provincial Secretary of Prince Edward Island v. Egan [47].\nOn a soumis, en invoquant la d\u00e9cision de B\u00e9dard v. Dawson et al., supra, que la mati\u00e8re de l'art. 3 tombait sous le para. 13 de l'art. 92: \"13. La propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et les droits civils dans la province.\" L'article 3, dit-on, ne vise qu'\u00e0 r\u00e9glementer la possession et l'usage des maisons. Pour ainsi interpr\u00e9ter l'art. 3, on l'a isol\u00e9 du texte de la loi enti\u00e8re intitul\u00e9e \"Loi prot\u00e9geant la province contre la propagande communiste\". A la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, l'objet v\u00e9ritable de l'art. 3, aussi bien que la technique l\u00e9gislative adopt\u00e9e pour r\u00e9aliser cet objet, ne pouvaient \u00eatre d\u00e9nonc\u00e9s en des termes plus clairs que ceux apparaissant \u00e0 l'extrait suivant des raisons de jugement de l'un des juges de la majorit\u00e9 en Cour d'Appel, dans la pr\u00e9sente cause :\nDans l'esp\u00e8ce, la loi sous attaque ne d\u00e9finit pas le communisme pour une excellente raison, c'est qu'elle n'entend pas en faire un crime. Ce qu'elle veut r\u00e9primer, ce sont les activit\u00e9s de ce mouvement subversif. Il est \u00e9vident que la L\u00e9gislature se serait r\u00e9jouie de pouvoir mettre le communisme hors la loi en faisant, des adeptes de cette doctrine, des criminels au sens du droit criminel. Elle savait fort bien qu'elle n'avait pas ce pouvoir, mais elle n'ignorait pas non plus qu'elle avait la responsabilit\u00e9, dans le cadre de sa comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative, de chercher, par tous moyens de r\u00e9glementation, \u00e0 paralyser l'action de ces gens et \u00e0 r\u00e9primer la propagation de cette doctrine. Le champ de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et des droits civils lui \u00e9tait ouvert et elle s'en est pr\u00e9value.\nMais, ainsi qu'on l'affirme implicitement dans la derni\u00e8re phrase de cette citation, la L\u00e9gislature pouvait-elle validement utiliser son pouvoir de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et les droits civils comme moyen pour arriver \u00e0 sa fin v\u00e9ritable, soit \u00e0 faire une l\u00e9gislation relativement \u00e0 une mati\u00e8re \u00e9chappant \u00e0 sa comp\u00e9tence? La n\u00e9gative n'est pas douteuse: Attorney-General for Ontario v. Reciprocal Insurers et al.[48] ; Attorney-General for Alberta v. Attorney\u2011General for Canada et al.[49]. Dans Ladore et al. v. Bennett et al.[50], Lord Atkin, \u00e0 la page 482, d\u00e9clare:\nIt is unnecessary to repeat what has been said many times by the Courts in Canada and by the Board, that the Courts will be careful to detect and invalidate any actual violation of constitutional restrictions under pretence of keeping within the statutory field. A colourable device will not avail.\nEn tout respect, aucune raison ne permet de diff\u00e9rencier, quant \u00e0 leur nature et \u00e0 leur caract\u00e8re v\u00e9ritable, \"pith and substance\", les dispositions de l'art. 3 de celles de l'art. 12 qui prohibe, avec sanctions p\u00e9nales, l'impression, la publication et la distribution d'\u00e9crits propageant ou tendant \u00e0 propager le communisme, pour en d\u00e9duire que la L\u00e9gislature n'a vis\u00e9, par l'art. 3, qu'\u00e0 r\u00e9glementer la possession et l'usage des maisons.\nSignalons, de plus, deux diff\u00e9rences fondamentales entre la pr\u00e9sente loi et la \"Loi concernant les propri\u00e9taires de maisons employ\u00e9es comme maisons de d\u00e9sordre\", dont la constitutionnalit\u00e9 fut affirm\u00e9e par cette Cour dans B\u00e9dard v. Dawson et al, supra. Dans la Loi des maisons de d\u00e9sordre, il n'y a pas, comme dans la pr\u00e9sente loi, une disposition de l'ordre de l'art. 12, mais simplement une de l'ordre de l'art. 3, c'est-\u00e0-dire une disposition d\u00e9clarant ill\u00e9gale l'utilisation d'une maison comme maison de d\u00e9sordre. De plus, dans la Loi des maisons de d\u00e9sordre, on a, par r\u00e9f\u00e9rence, adopt\u00e9 comme d\u00e9finition de \"maison de d\u00e9sordre\", la d\u00e9finition de cette expression au Code criminel. On a ainsi int\u00e9gralement subordonn\u00e9, dans son principe et dans sa mesure, l'existence et l'op\u00e9ration de la loi provinciale sur l'existence et l'op\u00e9ration des dispositions \u00e9tablies au Code criminel. Aussi bien a-t-on jug\u00e9 que la L\u00e9gislature n'avait pas cr\u00e9\u00e9 un crime mais simplement d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 des cons\u00e9quences civiles r\u00e9sultant de la commission d'un crime \u00e9tabli par l'autorit\u00e9 comp\u00e9tente, et supprim\u00e9 les conditions conduisant \u00e0 la commission de ce crime. Voil\u00e0 bien la base qui manque en l'esp\u00e8ce; ici, ce n'est pas le Parlement mais c'est la L\u00e9gislature qui a cr\u00e9\u00e9 le crime. Cet aspect de la question ne se pr\u00e9sentait pas dans la cause de B\u00e9dard v. Dawson et al., supra; il se pr\u00e9sentait, mais n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9, dans celle de Fineberg v. Taub[51]. Pour ces raisons, ni la d\u00e9cision de cette Cour dans la premi\u00e8re cause, ni la d\u00e9cision de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure dans la seconde, ne peuvent \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9es au soutien de la proposition qu'il s'agit ici de \"La propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et les droits civils dans la province\", tombant sous le para. 13 de l'art. 92.\nOn a soutenu aussi que la mati\u00e8re de la loi incrimin\u00e9e tombait sous le para. 16 de l'art. 92: \"16. G\u00e9n\u00e9ralement toutes les mati\u00e8res d'une nature purement locale ou priv\u00e9e dans la province\". Ce serait une t\u00e2che insurmontable que d'assumer de d\u00e9montrer que la propagande communiste est une mati\u00e8re locale. Dans son essence, la doctrine elle-m\u00eame a un caract\u00e8re international. Mais, dit-on, il existe dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, contrairement \u00e0 ce qui pourrait \u00eatre la situation dans le reste du Canada, une n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 particuli\u00e8re de prot\u00e9ger la population de la province contre la propagande communiste. Cette affirmation est peut-\u00eatre plus ing\u00e9nieuse que flatteuse, mais elle n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9e.\nOn invoque aussi la d\u00e9claration de Lord Watson dans Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for the Dominion et al.[52]. A la page 365, le savant juriste indique qu'au para. 16 de l'art. 92 est compris un pouvoir pour la L\u00e9gislature de faire des lois pour la paix, l'ordre et le bon gouvernement de la province relativement aux mati\u00e8res d'une nature purement locale ou priv\u00e9e dans la province. On reconna\u00eet, cependant, aux raisons du juge-ment faisant l'objet du pr\u00e9sent appel, que ce pouvoir ne justifie pas la L\u00e9gislature d'\u00e9tablir des crimes; et tel que d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9, la mati\u00e8re de la loi n'en est pas une \"d'une nature purement locale ou priv\u00e9e dans la province\".\nQu'il y ait ou non, au pays, une propagande communiste agissante; que les invitations des propagandistes soient ou non fructueuses; qu'il en r\u00e9sulte ou non un danger ou une possibilit\u00e9 de danger; qu'il y ait lieu ou non pour le l\u00e9gislateur de conjurer ce danger ou sa possibilit\u00e9 en ajoutant aux mesures visant d\u00e9j\u00e0 la s\u00e9dition, des mesures coercitives de censure et de main-mise sur la personne et sur les biens, tel que pourvu en la loi incrimin\u00e9e, plut\u00f4t que de laisser \u00e0 la conscience \u00e9clair\u00e9e des citoyens le soin de rejeter ou combattre les invitations de cette propagande : voil\u00e0 autant de questions qui, en raison de la s\u00e9paration des pouvoirs, \u00e9chappent aux tribunaux pour \u00eatre et demeurer exclusivement de la juridiction du l\u00e9gislateur. Dans notre syst\u00e8me f\u00e9d\u00e9ratif de gouvernement o\u00f9 la comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative se partage, suivant la mati\u00e8re de la loi, entre le Parlement, d'une part, et les L\u00e9gislatures de dix provinces, d'autre part, le corps l\u00e9gislatif qui, d'apr\u00e8s la constitution, a exclusivement cette comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative, la responsabilit\u00e9 et le droit d'\u00e9tablir et contr\u00f4ler les moyens pour y satisfaire, seul a jurisdiction pour consid\u00e9rer et d\u00e9cider de ces questions. Ces questions, qui s'\u00e9l\u00e8vent aux dimensions de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de l'\u00c9tat, ne peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme une mati\u00e8re \"d'une nature purement locale ou priv\u00e9e dans la province\", ni \u00eatre tenues comme \u00e9tant en relation avec \"la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et les droits civils dans la province\". Le pouvoir qu'une L\u00e9gislature peut avoir de decr\u00e9ter les cons\u00e9quences civiles d'un crime \u00e9tabli par l'autorit\u00e9 comp\u00e9tente, ou de supprimer les conditions qui conduisent \u00e0 ce crime, n'inclut pas celui de cr\u00e9er un crime pour la pr\u00e9vention d'un autre crime validement \u00e9tabli, tel, par exemple, celui de la s\u00e9dition.\n\u00c9tant d'avis que la mati\u00e8re v\u00e9ritable de la loi incrimin\u00e9e est une mati\u00e8re de droit criminel et, comme telle, de la comp\u00e9tence exclusive du Parlement, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de consid\u00e9rer les autres moyens soulev\u00e9s par l'appelant pour disposer de cet appel et conclure \u00e0 l'inconstitutionnalit\u00e9 de la loi.\nSur le point soulev\u00e9 par mon coll\u00e8gue M. le Juge Taschereau, en pr\u00e9liminaire et en marge du m\u00e9rite de la question constitutionnelle, j'adopterais les raisons de jugement de mon coll\u00e8gue M. le Juge Kellock. Sur le m\u00e9rite, je rendrais l'ordonnance propos\u00e9e par M. le juge en chef.\nABBOTT J.:\u2014The sole question in issue in this appeal is the constitutional validity of a statute of the Province of Quebec commonly known as the Padlock Act, the official title of which is \"An Act to protect the Province against Communistic Propaganda\". The Act in question was passed in 1937 and was 1 Geo. VI, c. 11, of the statutes of Quebec of that year. It is now R.S.Q. 1941, c. 52.\nSection 3 of the Act declares it to be illegal for any person\nwho possesses or occupies a house within the Province, to use it or allow it to be used to \"propagate communism or bolshevism by any means whatsoever\". Section 12 declares it to be unlawful to print, publish or distribute in the Province any newspaper, periodical, pamphlet, circular, document or writing \"propagating or tending to propagate communism or bolshevism\".\nNo attempt has been made in the Act to define communism or bolshevism but the term \"house\" is defined in the broadest possible terms and under s. 4 the Attorney-General \"upon satisfactory proof\" that a house has been used to propagate communism (as to which he is to be the sole judge) may order it closed for a period of not more than one year. This is the only sanction provided for the contravention of s. 3. Contravention of s. 12 renders the offender liable to prosecution and penalties under the Quebec Summary Convictions Act.\nAppellant was the tenant of premises in Montreal, which were the subject of a padlock order by the Attorney-General under the Act referred to. Sued by his landlord for cancellation of the lease and damages under art. 1624 of the Civil Code on the ground that the premises were used for illegal purposes, namely the propagation of communism, appelant in defence pleaded the unconstitutionality of the Padlock Act and, as required by art. 114 of the Code of Civil Procedure, gave notice to the Attorney-General of Quebec of the questions that he intended to raise. The Attorney-General intervened in the action, as he was entitled to do under the provisions of arts. 114 and 220 C.C.P., and in the conclusions of his intervention asked that the Padlock Act, in its entirety, be declared to be within the legislative competence of the Province. The learned trial judge maintained the action and cancelled and annulled appellant's lease but did not award damages on the ground that these had not been proved. In the sanie judgment he maintained the intervention of the Attorney-General, and this judgment was confirmed in the Court below, Barclay J. dissenting.\nAppellant has attacked the constitutional validity of this legislation upon a number of grounds of which I find it necessary to deal with one only.\nThe first question to be determined is whether the impugned legislation, in pith and substance, deals with the use of real property or with the propagation of ideas. As Mr. Scott put it to us in his very able argument : (1) the motive of this legislation is dislike of communism as being an evil and subversive doctrine, motive, of course, being something with which the Courts are not concerned; (2) the purpose is clearly the suppression of the propagation of communism in the Province, and (3) one means provided for effecting such suppression is denial of the use of a house.\nIn my opinion the Act does not create two illegalities which are separate and independent, as was suggested to us by Mr. Beaulieu, it creates only one, namely, the propagation of communism in the Province. Both s. 3 and s. 12 are directed to the same purpose, namely, the suppression of communism, although different means are provided to achieve that end. The whole Act constitutes one legislative scheme and in my opinion its provisions are not severable.\nSince in my view the true nature and purpose of the Padlock Act is to suppress the propagation of communism in the Province, the next question which must be answered is whether such a measure, aimed at suppressing the propagation of ideas within a Province, is within the legislative competence of such Province.\nThe right of free expression of opinion and of criticism, upon matters of public policy and public administration, and the right to discuss and debate such matters, whether they be social, economic or political, are essential to the working of a parliamentary democracy such as ours. Moreover, it is not necessary to prohibit the discussion of such matters, in order to protect the personal reputation or the private rights of the citizen. That view was clearly expressed by Duff C.J. in Re Alberta Statutes[53], when he said:\nUnder the constitution established by The British North America Act, legislative power for Canada is vested in one Parliament consisting of the Sovereign, an upper house styled the Senate, and the House of Commons. Without entering in detail upon an examination of the enactments of the Act relating to the House of Commons, it can be said that these provisions manifestly contemplate a House of Commons which is to be, as the name itself implies, a representative body; constituted, that is to say, by members elected by such of the population of the united provinces as may be qualified to vote. The preamble of the statute, moreover, shows plainly enough that the constitution of the Dominion is to be similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom. The statute contemplates a parliament working under the influence of public opinion and public discussion. There can be no controversy that such institutions derive their efficacy from the free public discussion of affairs, from criticism and answer and counter-criticism, from attack upon policy and administration and defence and counter-attack; from the freest and fullest analysis and examination from every point of view of political proposals. This is signally true in respect of the discharge by Ministers of the Crown of their responsibility to Parliament, by members of Parliament of their duty to the electors, and by the electors themselves of their responsibilities in the election of their representatives.\nThe right of public discussion is, of course, subject to legal restrictions; those based upon considerations of decency and public order, and others conceived for the protection of various private and public interests with which, for example, the laws of defamation and sedition are concerned. In a word, freedom of discussion means, to quote the words of Lord Wright in James v. Commonwealth, [1936] A.C. 578, at 627, \"freedom governed by law.\"\nEven within its legal limits, it is liable to abuse and grave abuse, and such abuse is constantly exemplified before our eyes; but it is axiomatic that the practice of this right of free public discussion of public affairs, notwithstanding its incidental mischiefs, is the breath of life for parliamentary institutions.\n... Any attempt to abrogate this right of public debate or to suppress the traditional forms of the exercise of the right (in public meeting and through the press) would, in our opinion, be incompetent to the legislatures of the provinces, or to the legislature of any one of the provinces, as repugnant to the provisions of The British North America Act, by which the Parliament of Canada is established as the legislative organ of the people of Canada under the Crown, and Dominion legislation enacted pursuant to the legislative authority given by those provisions. The subject matter of such legislation could not be described as a provincial matter purely; as in substance exclusively a matter of property and civil rights within the province, or a matter private or local within the province. It would not be, to quote the words of the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Great West Saddlery Co. v. The King, [1921] 2 A.C. 91 at 122, \"legislation directed solely to the purposes specified in section 92\"; and it would be invalid on the principles enunciated in that judgment and adopted in Caron v. The King, [1924] A.C. 999 at 1005-6.\nThe Canada Elections Act, the provisions of the British North America Act which provide for Parliament meeting at least once a year and for the election of a new parliament at least every five years, and the Senate and House of Commons Act, are examples of enactments which make specific statutory provision for ensuring the exercise of this right of public debate and public discussion. Implicit in all such legislation is the right of candidates for Parliament or for a Legislature, and of citizens generally, to explain, criticize, debate and discuss in the freest possible manner such matters as the qualifications, the policies, and the political, economic and social principles advocated by such candidates or by the political parties or groups of which they may be members. This right cannot be abrogated by a Provincial Legislature, and the power of such Legislature to limit it, is restricted to what may be necessary to protect purely private rights, such as for example provincial laws of defamation. It is obvious that the impugned statute does not fall within that category. It does not, in substance, deal with matters of property and civil rights or with a local or private matter within the Province and in my opinion is clearly ultra vires. Although it is not necessary, of course, to determine this question for the purposes of the present appeal, the Canadian constitution being declared to be similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom, I am also of opinion that as our constitutional Act now stands, Parliament itself could not abrogate this right of discussion and debate. The power of Parliament to limit it is, in my view, restricted to such powers as may be exercisable under its exclusive legislative jurisdiction with respect to criminal law and to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the nation.\nFor the reasons which I have given, I would allow the appeal and dismiss the action against the respondent Elbling with costs in the trial Court, dismiss the intervention of the Attorney-General with costs occasioned by such intervention in all Courts, and declare the Act I Geo. VI, c. 11, now R.S.Q. 1941, c. 52, ultra vires of the Legislature of Quebec. The respondent Elbling was a party to the appeal in the Court below and in this Court but was not represented by counsel at the hearing before us. In the circumstances, there should be no order as to costs against her here or in the Court of Queen's Bench.\nAppeal allowed, TASCHEREAU J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Marcus & Feiner, Montreal.\nSolicitor for the intervenant, respondent: L.

The wife immediately remarried in Nevada. Shortly after this marriage, the second husband, who was also an American citizen, obtained a position in British Columbia, and he, the wife and the two children moved there in May 1955. The father made an application in the Courts of British Columbia for custody of the children and the trial judge, after hearing viva voce evidence for 8 days, awarded custody to him. The Court of Appeal reversed this order and awarded custody to the mother, primarily on the grounds that (1) the father had, by his own conduct, shown that he thought the children should be in their mother's custody rather than in his and (2) the evidence showed that the mother had so far brought them up with affection and care.\nHeld: The order of the trial judge should be restored. It was impossible to say that he had not made full judicial use of the opportunity given to him, and denied to the appellate Courts, of seeing and hearing the parties. This was particularly important in a case of this sort where so much depended upon the character of the parents whose claims were in conflict. It was not suggested that the trial judge misdirected himself on any question of law and the Court of Appeal was not warranted in setting aside his decision that it was in the best interest of the children that they should be in their father's custody.\nAs to the particular circumstances relied on by the Court of Appeal, it could not be said that the trial judge failed to give due weight to the second consideration, and on all the facts and circumstances of the case, the first had ceased to be of importance.\nIt was unnecessary in the circumstances to decide whether, under the law of British Columbia, the father of an infant had, as against the mother, a prima facie right to custody, if all other things were equal. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] reversing an order of Manson J. in respect of the custody of two infants. Appeal allowed.\nW. B. Williston, Q.C., and M. M. McFarlane, Q.C., for the applicant, appellant.\nA. S. Pattillo, Q.C., and J. F. Howard, for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal, brought pursuant to special leave granted by this Court, from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[2] pronounced on June 7, 1956, reversing an order of Manson J. made on February 9, 1956, and awarding the custody of the above-named infants to the respondent Betty Carson Blatchley.\nThe facts are fully stated in the reasons for judgment in the Courts below and a comparatively brief recital will be sufficient to make clear the reasons for the conclusion at which we have arrived.\nThe appellant and the respondent Betty Carson Blatchley, to whom reference will sometimes hereinafter be made as \"the father\" and \"the mother\", are the parents of the two girls whose custody is in question, Lynn Scott Bickley born on October 12, 1945, and Ann Felton Bickley born on October 20, 1947. All the parties are citizens of the United States of America.\nThe father and mother were married on February 19, 1944, at Newark, New Jersey. After the father's return in 1946 from overseas service with the American army they lived in various places in the eastern United States. They agree that from 1947 their married life was not entirely happy, and that it gradually deteriorated from year to year. The father is a hard-working and successful business-man. In ten years he has risen to the position of general sales manager of his company, with a remuneration of approximately $20,000 a year. The demands of business frequently required him to be absent from home for the greater part of each week, and one of the mother's complaints is that he sacrified his home life to success in his work.\nFor some time prior to July 1954 the Bickleys had been close friends of the respondent Raymond W. Blatchley and his wife. The Blatchleys' marriage was also deteriorating. The respondents say that on July 7, 1954, they both realized for the first time that they were in love with each other. Mrs. Bickley at once informed the appellant and told him that she and Blatchley proposed to get divorces and to marry. The appellant asked her to defer action for a time in the hope that their marriage could be saved. They continued marital relations until September 1, 1954, and lived together until some time in October 1954 when the mother told the father that she intended to proceed at once with her plan for divorce and to marry Blatchley at some indefinite time thereafter. The appellant reluctantly acquiesced in this, and also in allowing the mother to have the custody of the children, although holding a lingering hope that in the new surroundings she might see things differently.\nThe appellant discussed the proposed divorce with the mother's attorney, and apparently agreed to attorn to the jurisdiction of the Nevada Courts in which she intended to proceed. According to the evidence such an attornment would have had the result that the Courts of the State of Pennsylvania would have recognized as valid a divorce granted by the Nevada Court. The parties appear to have assumed that prior to their separation the domicile of the Bickleys was in Pennsylvania. It may well be, as Mr. Pattillo argues, that their domicile was not clearly proved, but no one has suggested that it was in the State of Nevada at that time.\nOn October 19, 1954, after having made a division of their furniture and effects, the appellant took his wife and children to a hotel where they all stayed over night, and on the following morning put them on a plane for Reno, Nevada. On arrival the mother and the children took up residence there with the expectation that the appellant would instruct a Nevada attorney to appear for him, thus submitting to the jurisdiction of the Nevada Courts and enabling her to get her decree early in December and to return to the eastern States by Christmas.\nIn the meantime, Blatchley had left his wife early in July 1954. He had been transferred by his employer to work which allowed him to reside at Hot Springs, Arkansas. While there he retained a lawyer to effect a financial settlement with his wife. Meanwhile, Bickley had delayed sending instructions to appear. Late in November or early in December he learned for the first time that his wife had committed adultery in the fall of 1951 with one Buckner, and he determined not to submit to the jurisdiction of the Nevada Courts. Buckner and his wife had been close friends of the Bickleys in and prior to 1951.\nEarly in December 1954, having completed six weeks' residence in Nevada, the mother commenced divorce proceedings, effected personal service on the appellant in Pennsylvania, and secured an undefended decree of divorce in Reno on December 31, 1954. This decree awarded her custody of the two children.\nWhen the mother decided to proceed in this way, she telephoned Blatchley at Hot Springs. He immediately resigned his position with his company and left for Reno where he took up residence and commenced divorce proceedings against his wife. He secured his decree on February 17, 1955, and on that day married Mrs. Bickley.\nBlatchley tried unsuccessfully to get satisfactory employment in Nevada. Early in 1955 he was appointed controller of a company in British Columbia at a substantial salary. His position with this company required him to live in Vancouver. He and the mother and children moved there early in May 1955, and established a home in which, at the date of the hearing before Manson J., the children were happily settled. While the motion for custody was not launched until December 5, 1955, it appears that the appellant had given instructions some time earlier and it cannot be said that he was guilty of undue delay in commencing proceedings.\nThe hearing of the application before Manson J. occupied eight days. Twenty-four affidavits were filed. Of the twenty-two deponents who made these affidavits, five were called as witnesses at the hearing, these being Dr. Whitman, Dr. Davidson, the appellant and the two respondents. There was no cross-examination upon the other affidavits. A total of fifteen witnesses were examined at the hearing. The father and the mother each gave evidence on three different days. It is obvious that the learned trial judge had an unusually full opportunity of observing the manner and demeanour of the parties. The mother of the appellant was called as a witness and the learned trial judge had the advantage of forming from personal observation an impression as to her suitability for the task of assisting in bringing up the children.\nOn reading and rereading the reasons of the learned trial judge in the light of all the evidence in the record we find it impossible to say that he did not make full judicial use of the opportunity given to him, and denied to the appellate Courts, of seeing and hearing the parties; the advantage thus afforded to the trial judge is always great but peculiarly so in a case of this sort where so much depends upon the character of the parents whose claims are in conflict. It is not suggested that the learned judge misdirected himself on any question of law; and, in our respectful opinion, the Court of Appeal were not warranted in setting aside his decision that it was in the best interest of the children that they should be given into the custody of their father.\nIt may be that the strictures of the learned trial judge upon the conduct of the mother were expressed in terms unnecessarily severe, but the facts upon which they are mainly based are not controverted.\nThe evidence supports the view of the conduct and character of the father and of the suitability of his mother to assist him in caring for the children which the learned trial judge expressed in the following terms:\nAs to [Bickley] I have had the advantage of seeing and hearing him under oath. I find him to be a quiet, sincere individual completely frank and honest. He admitted his shortcomings and his occasional flash of temper\u2026. In my judgment there is nothing in the evidence to suggest that the applicant is cruel or a bully. There is probably no such thing as a perfect husband and father nor a perfect wife and mother. I find nothing in the evidence to support the view that the applicant is motivated by vindictiveness towards the mother of the children or by any other motive than a sincere affection for his children. He is in receipt of a good income as pointed out above. He rents a large home with two or three acres about it in a suburban residential area. School and church are within easy reach. Relatives are not too far distant, including both the grandmothers and the maternal grandfather. The applicant seems to be on very good terms with the maternal grandmother and it is noteworthy that the maternal grandmother has not taken any part in these proceedings. No affidavit of hers has been filed and the inference is that she does not think ill of her son-in-law. [It should be noted that we were informed by counsel that the maternal grandfather has since died.] If the children are given into his [i.e., the appellant's] custody his mother, a woman of 64 and in good health and a sincere person of deep religious convictions whom I have had the advantage of seeing and hearing in the witness-box, will take up residence with her son and with the assistance of one or two servants to do the housework, will undertake the guidance and upbringing of the children during such hours as her son is at work. I am entirely satisfied that with her son the children in his home would have excellent care and upbringing.\nIn reaching the conclusion that the order of the learned trial judge should be reversed the Court of Appeal found two circumstances to be decisive,[3] that the father's opinion, expressed by his conduct, was that the children should be in their mother's custody rather than in his, and (ii) that the mother has so far brought them up with affection and care as is evidenced by the opinion of all the witnesses that the children are happy and well-behaved.\nIn our opinion, it cannot be said that the learned trial judge failed to give due weight to the second of these considerations. As to the first, it is quite true that, after all his efforts to persuade the mother to keep their home together and to give up Blatchley had failed, the father unwillingly agreed to her taking proceedings for divorce and keeping the children, with, we think, the lingering hope previously mentioned; but it must be remembered that at this time he was quite unaware of the mother's relationship with Buckner in 1951. It is not surprising that when he learned of it he took a different view of the proposed arrangement and of the mother's suitability to bring up the children. The Court of Appeal put aside this explanation for the reason that[4] ,\neven after learning of that [the Buckner incident] he did not think it made his wife unfit to have the children, because he made no effort to disturb the existing arrangement, but merely sought to preserve his freedom of action should he consider later that it was better to remove them from the mother's custody.\nThis passage appears to overlook the fact that as the children were then in Nevada, the only effective action which the father could have taken would have been in the Court of that State where the mother's action was pending, and by applying to that Court he would have attorned to its jurisdiction which was the very thing which he had determined not to do. The mother cannot be heard to say that she was lulled into security by his inaction for, on December 14, 1954, some days after the father had told her he was not going to attorn to the jurisdiction of the Nevada Court, she swore that he had on numerous occasions threatened to come to Nevada and surreptitiously obtain physical control of the children and that she was in fear that he would remove them from her care and custody unless restained from so doing, and on December 17, 1954, her attorney had written to his attorney as follows:\nLast week Mr. Bickley was served at his home with the summons in divorce. I rather assume he will not participate in the divorce proceedings since an appearance was not entered for him in Nevada; and since the agreements were delivered upon condition that an appearance was to be entered for him there, it is my understanding, and I believe we agree, that the agreements are void.\nWould you kindly, therefore, return the agreements to me as they are now cancelled.\nIn his reasons for judgment the learned trial judge stated that the spirit of the Equal Guardianship of Infants Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 139, is that in all matters of custody the parents shall stand on equal footing. Mr. Williston argues that under the law of British Columbia, while the welfare of the infants is the paramount consideration, if all other things are equal the father has as against the mother a prima facie right to custody. We do not find it necessary to deal with this argument as the learned trial judge, while assuming an exact equality of prima facie right as between the parents, reached the conclusion that on the facts of this case the welfare of the children clearly required that their custody should be given to the father, and we have already expressed our opinion that that conclusion should not be disturbed.\nIt remains to consider whether we should make an order as to access. In our opinion it is desirable that the mother should have reasonable access to the children and that the children should not be deprived altogether of the companionship and society of the mother to whom they are so attached. But the practical difficulties of arranging such access are great and, as the result of our order will be that the children return to their father's home and the determination of such matters will thereafter lie within the jurisdiction of the Courts of their residence, we have concluded that Manson J. was right in deciding to leave the question of access to the decision of those Courts, in the event of the parties not being able to reach an agreement. We observe that the formal order of Manson J. contained the following paragraph:\nAND THIS COURT DOTH FURTHER ORDER AND ADJUDGE that the Respondents be at liberty to apply regarding the right of access to the said infants or either of them by either parent.\nIn our opinion this paragraph is unnecessary and should be struck out.\nFor the above reasons the appeal is allowed, the paragraph above quoted is ordered to be struck out and the order of Manson J. is otherwise restored. The appellant is entitled to his costs in the Court of Appeal and in this Court, including the costs of the motion for leave to appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Lawrence, Shaw, McFarlane & Stewart, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Davis, Hossie, Lett, Marshall & McLorg, Vancouver.\n[1] 6 D.L.R.

(Defendants) Respondents.\n1957: February 14, 15; 1957: March 27.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nTown planning\u2014Approval of plan by Minister\u2014Subsequent withdrawal of approval\u2014Application for reinstatement\u2014Jurisdiction of Minister and Ontario Municipal Board\u2014The Planning Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 277, ss. 26(9), 29(1).\nA plan of subdivision which had been approved by the Minister of Planning and Development was not registered within one month and the Minister withdrew his approval under s. 26(9) of The Planning Act, 1950. A letter was subsequently written by one T, of the Department of Planning and Development, saying that if the plan was submitted again for approval the applicants must \u201cstart ab initio and submit a completely new plan\u201d. Application was later made by mortgagees and lienholders for reinstatement of the plan and the Minister referred this application to the Ontario Municipal Board.\nHeld: The Board had jurisdiction to deal with the application and to approve the plan, subject to the conditions imposed by it.\nPer Kerwin C.J.: Although the Minister withdrew his approval of the plan, he did not require that a new application be made and was therefore entitled to refer the matter to the Municipal Board which acquired jurisdiction to approve the plan.\nPer Rand and Kellock JJ.: An application for approval of a plan, until expressly or impliedly recalled, remained a request for permission to develop the land for the purposes indicated. The mention of a new application in T\u2019s letter was neither a termination of the application nor the exhaustion of the Minister\u2019s authority. Its only effect was to prevent the registration of the plan until a new final approval had been given. The Minister was entitled to form opinions, which might be reversed, modified or changed, so long as they did not become fixed, temporarily or permanently, by the statute or by the action of others.\nPer Locke and Cartwright JJ: For the reasons given by the Court of Appeal, it should be held that, although the Minister withdrew his approval of the final plan, he did not require the making of a new application. It was unnecessary to determine whether the Minister, if he had required a new application, would thereby have become functus officio and without authority to refer the matter to the Municipal Board. That question should, therefore, be left open.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario [1] dismissing an appeal from the Ontario Municipal Board. Appeal dismissed.\nThe facts are fully stated in the reasons for judgment of the Court of Appeal. For the purposes of this report, they may be summarized as follows:\nOne Selkirk, owner of all except qualifying shares in Langstaff Land Development Limited, applied, in the name of the company, for approval of a plan of subdivision. This application was made in 1954 under the provisions of The Planning Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 277. After consultations and negotiations, the Minister approved the plan on October 6, 1954. Selkirk had proceeded with the construction of houses before approval of the formal plan.\nThe plan was not registered within one month and on December 13, 1954, the Minister\u2019s approval of the plan was withdrawn under s. 26(9) of The Planning Act (now s. 26(12) of 1955 (Ont.), c. 61). On February 10, 1955, one Tyrrell, of the Department of Planning and Development (who had signed both the letter setting out the Minister\u2019s approval of the plan and that announcing that the approval had been withdrawn) wrote the following letter:\nAs you are aware, the Minister withdrew this plan of subdivision on December 13, 1954.\nIn the event that the applicants, the Langstaff Development Co., should decide to submit the plan again it will be necessary for them to start ab initio and submit a completely new plan.\nWe are sending carbon copies of this letter to everyone concerned in order that there may be no mistake.\nIn the spring of 1955, Selkirk and his creditors sought to have the plan reinstated as approved. The council of the municipality declined to approve the plan except on conditions which were not acceptable to Selkirk and the trustees for his creditors. The trustees thereupon appealed to the Minister under s. 29 of the Act and the Minister referred the matter to the Ontario Municipal Board.\nBefore the Board, and in the Court of Appeal, it was argued that the Board lacked jurisdiction to approve the plan on two grounds:\n(1) The Minister, having exercised his powers under s. 26(9) by withdrawing his approval of the plan, had no power under s. 29(1) to refer to the Board a subsequent application for reinstatement of his earlier approval.\n(2) If the Minister had the power, he could exercise it only on the application of the original applicant or the owner for the time being, and not, as in this case, on the application of a mortgagee or a lienholder.\nBoth the Board and the Court of Appeal rejected these arguments. The Court of Appeal, in reasons delivered by Roach J.A., held that Tyrrell\u2019s letter stating that a new application must be made was not the act of the Minister and that the Minister, although he had withdrawn his approval of the plan, had not required that a new application be submitted. He had not disposed of the original application and it remained pending and in the same state as if the plan had never been approved. The Minister was therefore entitled to refer the application for reinstatement to the Board under s. 29(1) and he was entitled to act on the application of the mortgagees or lienholders.\nDonald M. Fleming, Q.C., and K.D. Finlayson, for the appellant. G.F. Henderson, Q.C., for the respondents Langstaff and Selkirk.\nR.F. May, Q.C., for the respondents Gotfrid, Sher and May.\nI THE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014I agree with the reasoning of Roach J.A. that, although the Minister withdrew his approval of the plan, he did not require that a new application be submitted. This is sufficient to dispose of the matter, as the Board had jurisdiction to authorize the conditions imposed by its order, and the appeal is, therefore, dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Rand and Kellock JJ. was delivered by\nRAND J.:\u2014By s. 26(9) of The Planning Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 277, and s. 26(12) of 1955 (Ont.), c. 61, when a final plan is approved by the Minister but is not registered within one month, the latter may withdraw his approval and may require a new application to be submitted.\nRoach J.A. interpreted this to mean that once the Minister called for the new application, by that fact he became functus of the existing application and could not act thereafter upon it except on its being placed again in the course of an application de novo. In the circumstances, however, he found the letter of February 10, 1955 from the Department not to have been authorized by and, therefore, not the act of the Minister and that consequently it did not bring to an end the existing application.\nI am unable to agree that the circumstances of the letter are to be so found; prima facie this correspondence carried on in the manner in which it was is of an official character and as from the Minister himself; but in the view I take of the statutory provisions, that does not affect the result at which Roach J.A. arrived.\nWhat the legislation provides for is an administration of a subject that has become one of importance in municipal government, a matter of planning a structure of sectional allocation of the various conditions and functions of community life, i.e., homes, schools, shops, industries, public places, etc., that will best serve the interests of that life as it grows and develops. By the factual particulars required by s. 26 to be shown on the draft plan, the matters to be regarded by the Minister, the sources of information to which he may resort, his discretion to withdraw his approval of the draft plan at any time before that of the final plan, and his power to withdraw final approval if the plan is not registered within one month of the date of that approval, a procedure is furnished of a continuing nature until final decision and action taken on it effects a determination.\nAn application for approval until expressly or impliedly recalled remains a request for permission to develop the land for the purposes indicated. Behind it is the urgency to bring to an end the suspension of the use of the land desired. But the owner remains in control: he is not bound to act even on an approval; he may disregard it or withdraw the application and hold the land for such other use as is not within the statute and for so long as he pleases.\nThe mention of a new application in the letter in question was not, then, in any technical sense, either a termination of the application or the exhaustion of the Minister\u2019s authority; it created a pause in the process: its only effect was to prevent the registration of the plan until a new final approval had been given.\nThat there was no intention on the part of the owner to withdraw the application is seen by the position taken by him before the Municipal Board; and prior to that hearing communications had been passing between the applicant and the Department. On such a matter the Minister forms opinions which may be reversed, modified or changed so long as they do not become fixed temporarily or permanently by the statute or by the action of others.\nThe reference to the Board was, then, within the Minister\u2019s discretion. The conditions annexed to the approval by the Board were such as were deemed to respect and protect the interests of the Township, the purpose for which the Board has been given administrative jurisdiction.\nThe appeal must, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Locke and Cartwright JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014In this appeal I agree with the decision of Roach J.A. and also with his reasons, subject only to the one following reservation. As, for the reasons given by Roach J.A., I agree with his conclusion that although the Minister withdrew his approval of the final plan he did not \u201crequire that a new application be submitted\u201d, I find it unnecessary to determine whether if the Minister had so required he would thereby have become functus officio and without authority to refer the matter to the Municipal Board. I wish to reserve my opinion upon that question until it becomes necessary to decide it.\nI agree with the Chief Justice that the Board had jurisdiction to impose the conditions contained in its order.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Kingsmill, Mills, Price & Fleming, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the respondents Langstaff Land Development Limited and Selkirk: Parkinson, Gardiner, Roberts, Anderson & Conlin, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the respondents Gotfrid, Sher and May: McLaughlin, Macaulay, May & Soward, Toronto.\n[1] 1956 O.R. 164, 2 D.L.R.

The offence was alleged to have been committed on March 16, 1955, and the information was laid on January 17, 1956.\nWhen the accused was brought before a magistrate, Crown counsel, on being asked, stated that he wished to proceed summarily. The accused pleaded not guilty and his counsel immediately moved for dismissal of the charge on the ground that the prosecution was barred under s. 693(2), the information having been laid more than 6 months after the commission of the offence. The magistrate permitted counsel for the Crown to withdraw the information and to lay a new one on which a preliminary hearing was held, resulting ultimately in the conviction of the accused.\nThe Court of Appeal set aside the conviction on the ground that what had taken place before the magistrate amounted to an acquittal on the first information and that the accused was therefore entitled to succeed on a plea of autrefois acquit.\nHeld (Cartwright J. dissenting): The conviction should be restored.\nPer Kerwin C.J.: The Crown had a right to withdraw the information and to change its election. There was no formal acquittal by the magistrate and what occurred at that time did not amount to an acquittal; to have this effect the first trial must have been concluded by an adjudication or its equivalent.\nPer Taschereau J.: The withdrawal of the first information did not amount to an acquittal and the Crown could consequently proceed by indictment as it did. The accused was not placed in jeopardy on the first occasion. Per Fauteux and Abbott JJ.: The first information, considered as the institution of proceedings by summary conviction, was bad on its face, and the Crown therefore had no right to proceed by way of summary conviction, and the magistrate had no jurisdiction to accept the Crown\u2019s election and act upon it by receiving a plea. The election and plea were therefore void and did not constitute a bar to the subsequent proceedings by indictment.\nPer Cartwright J., dissenting: In the circumstances of the case, the withdrawal of the first information was tantamount to an acquittal, since counsel for the defence was not raising a technical objection which would be a bar to the magistrate adjudicating upon the charge but was bringing forward a defence in law to which there was no answer. The magistrate should have dismissed the charge and his action in permitting it to be withdrawn was, in the circumstances, the equivalent of a dismissal.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] setting aside a conviction. Appeal allowed.\nW.B. Common, Q.C., and E.R. Pepper, for the appellant. Stanley Smither, for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014The Crown had the right to change its election before the magistrate and also the right to withdraw the information. Assuming that the respondent raised the plea of autrefois acquit before His Honour Judge Forsyth, there had certainly not been a formal acquittal by the magistrate on January 24, 1956, and in my opinion what occurred at that time did not amount to an acquittal. The first trial must have been concluded by an adjudication, or what amounts thereto: Regina v. Charlesworth[2]; Re Rex v. Ecker; Re Rex v. Fry[3]. It has been held that where a trial had commenced and the jury had been discharged and a new one empanelled, the plea could not avail even if the discharge of the first jury had been improper or if a Court of Error or Appeal considered that under the circumstances the first jury should not have been discharged: Regina v. Charlesworth, supra; Winsor v. The Queen[4]; Rex v. Lewis[5].\nThe appeal should be allowed, the conviction restored and the case remitted to the Court of Appeal so that the respondent\u2019s application for leave to appeal from the sentence may be dealt with. TASCHEREAU J.:\u2014I am of the opinion that the withdrawal by the Crown of the first information did not amount to an acquittal, giving rise to the plea of autrefois acquit, and that the Crown could consequently proceed by indictment as it did. The respondent was not in jeopardy.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the conviction, and remit the case to the Court of Appeal so that the respondent\u2019s application for leave to appeal from the sentence may be dealt with.\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):\u2014This appeal is brought, pursuant to leave granted by this Court, from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario pronounced on November 29, 1956, quashing the conviction of the respondent on September 21, 1956, at the General Sessions of the Peace for the County of York and directing a verdict of acquittal to be entered.\nThe proceedings against the respondent were commenced by the swearing of an information on January 17, 1956, charging:\nthat on the 16th day of March in the year 1955, at the City of Toronto, in the County of York, owing to the presence of a vehicle bearing license nurnber 139675 (Saskatchewan) for the year 1954 on the highway, to wit, on Dundas St. W. an accident had occurred to SAM PECALIS and that PETER KARPINSKI the person having the care, charge or control of the vehicle with intent to escape liability, either civil or criminal, failed to stop his vehicle, offer assistance and give his name and address, contrary to the Criminal Code, section 221, sub-section 2.\nOn January 24, 1956, the respondent appeared before His Worship Magistrate Bigelow to answer the charge. As the offence created by s. 221(2) may be dealt with either as an indictable offence or as an offence punishable on summary conviction, the clerk of the Court after reading the charge to the respondent asked Crown counsel how he wished to proceed and he elected to proceed summarily. The clerk then called upon the respondent to plead and he pleaded \u201cnot guilty\u201d. After this plea and before any evidence had been given counsel for the respondent moved to dismiss the charge on the ground that the proceeding had been instituted more than six months after the time when the alleged offence was committed and was consequently barred by the provisions of s. 693(2) of the Criminal Code. The learned magistrate then permitted counsel for the Crown to withdraw the information against the protest of counsel for the respondent who submitted that he was entitled to have the charge dismissed.\nA new information was then laid and read to the respondent and Crown counsel elected to proceed by way of indictment. The respondent, having refused to elect as to his method of trial on the ground that the proceedings were improper, was committed for trial after a preliminary inquiry had been held by the learned magistrate. In due course Crown counsel preferred a bill of indictment. The grand jury returned a true bill. The trial was held on September 20 and 21, 1956, before His Honour Judge Forsyth and a jury.\nAt the opening of the trial and before pleading counsel for the respondent moved to quash the indictment on grounds which are summarized as follows in the factum of counsel for the appellant:\n(a) The Crown had no right to change their election before the magistrate.\n(b) The Crown had no right to withdraw the information.\n(c) If the Crown withdrew the information without the consent of the accused, that withdrawal was tantamount to a dismissal and the accused can successfully plead autrefois acquit.\nThe learned trial judge declined to give effect to the motion and proceeded with the trial which resulted in the conviction which was quashed by the Court of Appeal.\nWhile the point was not pressed, it was suggested that the respondent had failed to raise the plea of autrefois acquit before His Honour Judge Forsyth. There appears to have been some lack of formality in the proceedings, but the record shows that before entering a plea of not guilty, counsel for the respondent made it clear that he relied on the submission that his client was entitled to be discharged on the plea of autrefois acquit and the matter was argued at length before the learned trial judge. In my view the plea was sufficiently raised.\nIt is argued for the appellant that the respondent was not in jeopardy in the summary proceedings before the magistrate, \u201cthat there was no adjudication on the merits or otherwise, nor could there have been, since the learned Magistrate was without jurisdiction\u201d. I am unable to give effect to this argument. Section 693(2) which limits the time within which proceedings in respect of offences punishable on summary conviction may be instituted is as follows:\n(2) No proceedings shall be instituted more than six months after the time when the subject matter of the proceedings arose.\nThe effect of this subsection is not, in my opinion, to deprive the magistrate of jurisdiction in a case in which the subject matter of the proceedings in fact arose more than six months before their institution but rather to afford a defence to the charge. While no such difficulty arises in the case at bar, the decisions collected in 21 Halsbury, 2nd ed. 1936, at p. 598 show that questions of fact and law may well arise as to when the six months\u2019 period commences to run in a particular case.\nIn the case at bar, after the information had been read, the Crown had elected to proceed summarily, the respondent had been called upon to plead and had pleaded \u201cnot guilty\u201d, the learned magistrate had jurisdiction over the accused and over the offence with which he was charged and, as is pointed out by Laidlaw J.A., the trial had commenced. Prima facie, it was the duty of the learned magistrate to proceed with the trial as provided by s. 708(3) and s. 711 of the Criminal Code, reading as follows:\n708(3) Where the defendant pleads not guilty or states that he has cause to show why an order should not be made against him, as the case may be, the summary conviction court shall proceed with the trial, and shall take the evidence of witnesses for the prosecutor and the defendant in accordance with the provisions of Part XV relating to preliminary inquiries.\n711. When the summary conviction court has heard the prosecutor, defendant and witnesses it shall, after considering the matter, convict the defendant or make an order against him or dismiss the information, as the case may be.\nThe provisions of s. 697(3) emphasize the importance of the respondent having pleaded. That subsection reads as follows:\n(3) Subject to section 698, in proceedings under this Part no summary conviction court other than the summary conviction court by which the plea of an accused is taken has jurisdiction for the purposes of the hearing and adjudication, but any justice may\n(a) adjourn the proceedings at any time before the plea of the accused is taken, or\n(b) adjourn the proceedings at any time after the plea of the accused is taken for the purpose of enabling the proceedings to be continued before the summary conviction court by which the plea was taken. I do not find it necessary to determine in what circumstances, if any, a charge may properly be withdrawn against the objection of the accused after the commencement of a trial before a summary conviction court, as I have concluded that Mr. Smither is right in his submission that in the case at bar the withdrawal was tantamount to an acquittal.\nOn the argument before us both counsel referred to the judgment of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court in Re Bond[6], and relied upon the following passage from the judgment of Graham J. at p. 515:\nIt remains to consider whether the withdrawal should be construed under any other rule of law to be an acquittal. The cases in other jurisdictions are not easy to reconcile, and we are, therefore, thrown back on reason and the application of principles.\nThe withdrawal of a charge before any evidence is given may be tantamount to a trial, and so may put an end to the complaint; but that can only be so when the true inference from the circumstances is, that the magistrate permitted the withdrawal, because he decided that there was not a proper case for trial or that trial was unnecessary, and so passed upon the merits. The general law is that to support the plea of autrefois acquit there must have been a trial and an acquittal on the merits.\nIn Haynes v. Davis[7], Lush J. said:\nI quite agree that \u201cacquittal on the merits\u201d does not necessarily mean that the jury or the magistrate must find as a matter of fact that the person charged was innocent; it is just as much an acquittal upon the merits if the judge or the magistrate were to rule upon the construction of an Act of Parliament that the accused was in law entitled to be acquitted as in law he was not guilty, and to that extent the expression \u201cacquittal on the merits\u201d must be qualified, but in my view the expression is used by way of antithesis to a dismissal of the charge upon some technical ground which had been a bar to the adjudicating upon it. That is why this expression is important, however one may qualify it, and I think the antithesis is between an adjudication of not guilty upon some matter of fact or law and a discharge of the person charged on the ground that there are reasons why the Court cannot proceed to find if he is guilty.\nApplying the reasoning of the above passages to the facts of the case at bar, it appears that in the course of the trial Mr. Smither brought to the attention of the learned magistrate the undisputed fact that the alleged offence was committed more than six months before the commencement of the proceedings. In so doing he was not raising a technical ground which would be a bar to the magistrate adjudicating upon the charge; he was bringing forward a defence in law to which there was no answer. To use the words of Graham J., quoted above, any further trial \u201cwas unnecessary\u201d; the learned magistrate was in a position to pass upon the merits as no evidence could have been given that would have altered the result. In my respectful view, the learned magistrate ought to have dismissed the charge, and his action in permitting it to be withdrawn was, in the circumstances, the equivalent of a dismissal.\nIt may be mentioned in passing that in actions for malicious prosecution the withdrawal of a charge in open Court by the Crown Attorney, otherwise than in pursuance of a compromise or agreement between the parties, has consistently been held to constitute a termination of the criminal proceedings in favour of the accused; see for example Fancourt v. Heaven[8], and the cases there cited.\nIf it should be suggested that, in the result, a man who was convicted on sufficient evidence before a properly instructed jury goes free because of the decision, perhaps made inadvertently, to proceed summarily before the magistrate, I would recall the words of Viscount Sankey L.C. in Maxwell v. The Director of Public Prosecutions[9], which although used in different circumstances are of general application:\nBut it must be remembered that the whole policy of English criminal law has been to see that as against the prisoner every rule in his favour is observed... It is often better that one guilty man should escape than that the general rules evolved by the dictates of justice for the conduct of criminal prosecutions should be disregarded and discredited.\nThe general rule on which the respondent relies was not questioned. It is stated in the following terms in Broom\u2019s Legal Maxims, 10th ed. 1939, p. 223:\nThe maxim nemo debet bis vexari pro una et eadem causa expresses a great fundamental rule of our criminal law, which forbids that a man should be put in jeopardy twice for one and the same offence. It is the foundation of the special pleas of autrefois acquit and autrefois convict. When a criminal charge has been once adjudicated upon by a Court of competent jurisdiction, that adjudication is final, whether it takes the form of an acquittal or a conviction, and it may be pleaded in bar of a subsequent prosecution for the same offence... Provided that the adjudication be by a Court of competent jurisdiction, it is immaterial whether it be upon a summary proceeding before justices or upon a trial before a jury. I have already indicated my view that, in the circumstances of the case at bar, the withdrawal of the charge before the learned magistrate was tantamount to an acquittal.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nThe judgment of Fauteux and Abbott JJ. was delivered by\nFAUTEUX J.:\u2014The circumstances giving rise to this appeal are fully stated in the reasons for judgment of my brother Cartwright and need not be related here to a similar extent.\nA first information, laid and sworn to on January 17, 1956, charged respondent with having, on March 16, 1955, failed to stop at the scene of an accident, contrary to s. 221(2) of the Criminal Code. Such an offence may be prosecuted by way of indictment or of summary conviction at the option of the complainant. The information here having been laid and sworn to more than six months after the date of the alleged violation, proceedings in the latter form were then barfed by the provisions of s. 693(2) reading:\n693(2). No proceedings shall be instituted more than six months after the time when the subject matter of the proceedings arose.\nNotwithstanding the clear terms of this statutory prohibition, counsel for the Crown was requested, upon arraignment of respondent, to elect and elected to proceed by way of summary conviction. Whereupon respondent pleaded not guilty, and, promptly invoking the statutory prohibition, moved for the dismissal of the charge. The magistrate refused to grant this motion, permitting instead the withdrawal of the information. Respondent was immediately arraigned upon a fresh information, couched in terms similar to those of the first, and was ultimately indicted and convicted.\nThe submission of respondent, rejected by the trial judge but accepted in the Court of Appeal, is that, the Crown having no right to change its election and withdraw the information after the plea of not guilty, such withdrawal was therefore tantamount to a dismissal giving rise to a plea of autrefois acquit. In my respectful view, it is unnecessary to deal with the merits of the conclusion of this proposition, for the premises upon which it rests are not established. In the circumstances of this case, there were no right for the Crown to, elect to proceed by way of summary conviction and no jurisdiction for the magistrate to accept and act upon the election by receiving a plea. On the face of the information itself, it was manifest that more than six months had elapsed from the date when the subject matter of the proceedings had arisen; and of its nature the offence charged was not capable of being one having a continuing character. Non\u2011compliance with the statutory requirement of s. 693(2) was fatal to the validity of the election and plea, both of which were void.\nOther grounds of appeal were raised by the accused in the Court of Appeal but were abandoned at the hearing before us.\nI would dispose of the appeal as proposed by my Lord the Chief Justice.\nAppeal allowed, CARTWRIGHT J. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the appellant: C.P.

Robillard and McLaughlin, [1957] S.C.R. 351\nDate: 1957-04-12\nWilliam Mizinski (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nWilbert Robillard and Jack McLaughlin (Defendants) Respondents.\n1957: March 29; 1957: April 12.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nTrial judge dispensing with jury\u2014Nature of order\u2014Discretion\u2014The Judicature Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 190, s. 57(3)\u2014The Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 259, s. 44.\nWhen a trial judge, in the course of a trial by jury, decides to discharge the jury and complete the trial himself, under s. 57(3) of the Ontario Judicature Act, his order is a discretionary one and was therefore not appealable to the Supreme Court of Canada under s. 44 of the Supreme Court Act as it was before its amendment in 1956. APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming the judgment of Barlow J. at trial. Appeal dismissed.\nA. Moloney, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant.\nDavid J. Walker, Q.C., for the defendant McLaughlin, respondent.\nW. Gibson Gray, for the defendant Robillard, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Cartwright, Fauteux and Abbott JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario pronounced on May 12, 1954, dismissing an appeal from the judgment of Barlow J. dated October 1, 1953, whereby the appellant\u2019s action was dismissed with costs.\nThe appellant suffered serious injuries in an automobile accident which occurred on May 22, 1952. He brought action against the respondents alleging that each of them had been guilty of acts of negligence which had caused the accident. The action came on for trial before Barlow J. and a jury in September 1953. The respondents were separately represented. Evidence was called on behalf of the respondent McLaughlin but not on behalf of the respondent Robillard and consequently at the conclusion of the evidence Mr. Walker, counsel for McLaughlin, addressed the jury first followed by Mr. MacDonald, counsel for the appellant, who would in the ordinary course have been followed by counsel for Robillard.\nAt the conclusion of Mr. MacDonald\u2019s address Mr. Walker moved the learned trial judge to discharge the jury and continue the trial himself without a jury. Counsel for the respondent Robillard supported this motion. The motion, which was argued at length, was based on the allegations (i) that counsel for the appellant had mis-stated the effect of the evidence to the jury in several respects of which eight were specified, and (ii) that the address was inflammatory. In opposing the motion, Mr. MacDonald said in part:\nMy address was not inflammatory in any sense of the word. All I tried to do was to discharge my duty as a plaintiff\u2019s counsel to his client. I would think that from the vast experience which your Lordship has had, you would have stopped me if I had been delivering an inflammatory address. I am not prepared to take the quotations which Mr. Walker read to your Lordship as being my utterances, and if there is any doubt about it I think there should be a transcript.\nTo this the learned trial judge replied: \u201cI took them down as Mr. Walker has stated them.\u201d But on the argument before us counsel for the appellant in a careful analysis of the transcript of Mr. MacDonald\u2019s address and of the complaints which had been made against it showed that a number of the alleged mis-statements of fact complained of before the learned trial judge had not in fact been made. In this connection it may be noted that in the factum of the respondent McLaughlin filed in this Court only four mis-statements are specified.\nAt the conclusion of the argument of the motion the learned trial judge said:\nCounsel for the defendants ask that I take this case from the jury on the ground of mis\u2011statement of facts by counsel for the plaintiffs, and also that the address was inflammatory.\nIt is the duty and the right of a trial judge to deal with such a motion, the purpose being that justice may be done between the parties. If, in the opinion of the trial judge, he considers that the address of counsel for the plaintiffs is of such a nature that it may lead to a verdict which is not warranted by the evidence, then it is quite proper for him to take the case from the jury.\nThere is no doubt in my mind that the address was of an inflammatory nature, and there were also various mis-statements of fact made by counsel for the plaintiffs. I made a note of some of them, and I made a note of some of the inflammatory statements, such as, for example, \u201cI suggest to you that there was guilt in his soul\u201d, meaning Mr. McLaughlin; \u201che knew in his heart that he had caused the accident\u201d; \u201cwas that the act of a man who had something on his conscience?\u201d Those are only some of the statements that are quite improper, in my opinion, so far as the inflammatory nature of it is concerned.\nFor that reason, and also by reason of the mis-statements of facts which are of such a nature that I could never expect to correct them, and ought not to have to correct them in my charge to the jury, I think that I would only be doing what is right and proper in the administration of justice in taking this case from the jury and concluding it myself.\nThe learned judge then discharged the jury.\nThe appellant in his notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal set up only the following grounds:\n1. His Lordship, the trial judge, erred in ruling that Counsel for the Plaintiffs had mis\u2011stated evidence in his jury address and that the said jury address was of an inflammatory nature. 2. His Lordship, the trial judge, erred in ordering the jury dismissed and concluding the trial himself, and his action, in so doing, was an improper exercise of his judicial discretion, and a denial to the Plaintiffs of their right to have their causes tried by a jury.\nNo other ground was advanced in the appellant\u2019s factum or in his argument in this Court.\nAt the opening of the argument before us Mr. Walker raised the preliminary objection that, the only ground of appeal being that the learned trial judge erred in taking the case from the jury, no appeal lies to this Court as the order discharging the jury was one made \u201cin the exercise of judicial discretion\u201d, and the right of appeal is denied by s. 44 of the Supreme Court Act. The Court decided to delay consideration of this preliminary objection until after the argument of the appeal. It will be observed that if this preliminary objection is entitled to prevail this Court could not give leave to appeal as the action was commenced before the amendment of s. 41(1) by 4-5 Eliz. II (1956), c. 48, s. 3: see La Cit\u00e9 de Verdun v. Viau[1]\nIn Ontario the power of a judge presiding at a trial before a jury to discharge the jury and complete the trial himself is found in subs. (3) of s. 57 of The Judicature Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 190, reading as follows:\n(3) Notwithstanding the giving of the notice [i.e., a jury notice] the issues of fact may be tried or the damages assessed without the intervention of a jury if the judge presiding at the sittings so directs or if it is so ordered by a judge.\nThe subsection has existed in its present form since 1913 when it appeared as sub. (3) of s. 56 of 3 and 4 Geo. V, c. 19.\nIts predecessors were s. 18 of The Administration of Justice Act of 1873, 36 Vic., c. 8, and s. 255 of The Common Law Procedure Act, R.S.O. 1877, c. 50, which read respectively as follows:\n18. All other issues shall be tried as heretofore, unless the court in which the action or proceeding is pending, or a judge thereof, upon application being made before trial, or unless the presiding judge upon the trial, directs or decides that the issue or issues shall be tried and damages assessed without the intervention of a jury.\n255. Notwithstanding anything in the two next preceding sections contained, the Judge presiding at the trial may in his discretion direct that any such action shall be tried or the damages assessed by a jury; And upon application to the Court in which the action is pending, or to a Judge thereof, by an order made before the trial, or by the direction of the Judge presiding at the trial, the issues may be tried and damages assessed without the intervention of a jury. The power given to the trial judge by the subsection in its present form does not appear to me to differ in kind from that conferred by the sections last quoted above. In Ontario, it has consistently been held that the exercise of this power is committed to the discretion of the judge at the trial.\nIn Brown v. Wood[2], Armour J. at the trial had struck out the jury notice and tried the case without a jury against the protests of counsel for the defendant. On appeal Boyd C., with whom Ferguson and Robertson JJ. concurred, said, at p. 200:\nThe difficulty is to get over sec. 255 of the C.L.P. Act. If this were an appeal from the order of a Judge in Chambers striking out a jury notice, before the trial, the cases cited by Mr. Read would be overwhelming in his favour, but the discretion of a Judge at the trial is much larger\u2026 As no affidavit of merits has been filed, and the defendant has not brought and does not seek to bring the amount of the verdict into Court, and as the motion is against a discretion that the trial Judge undoubtedly has to determine the method of trial, it should be dismissed, with costs.\nIn Wise v. Canadian Bank of Commerce[3], Middleton J., as he then was, said at p. 345:\nIt has been held that the discretion conferred upon the Judge presiding at the trial is an absolute discretion, not subject to review: Brown v. Wood (1887), 12 P.R. 198.\nIn Currie v. Motor Union Insurance Co.[4], Latchford C.J., giving the judgment of the Appellate Division in a case in which the trial judge had dispensed with the jury, said at pp. 99-100:\nEven before the enactment of sec. 56(3) the discretion of a trial Judge in dispensing with a jury was not interfered with by an appellate Court: Brown v. Wood (1887), 12 P.R. 198. It was within the power of the trial judge to determine the method of trial, and his determination was not open to review.\nIn Owens v. Martindale[5], Ferguson J.A. with whom the majority of the Court agreed left open the question whether such an order could be reviewed by the Court of Appeal. He said at p. 97:\nI am clearly of the opinion that the circumstances disclosed in evidence and particularly the situation pointed out by Mr. Slaght in his second proposition justified the learned trial Judge in exercising his discretion in the manner he did, and that it is therefore unnecessary to express an opinion as to our right to review an order made by a trial Judge striking out a jury notice. In Telford v. Secord; Telford v. Nasmith[6], judgment had been entered for the plaintiff at the trial pursuant to the verdict of a jury; the Court of Appeal set this judgment aside and directed that a new trial be had without a jury. This Court affirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeal in so far as it set aside the trial judgment but directed that the new trial should be before a jury. Kellock J. in giving the unanimous judgment of this Court said at p. 282:\nThere rests with the trial judge sufficient power and authority to conduct the trial as it should be conducted, and, should he see reason to try the action without a jury or to dispense with the jury at any stage, his discretion is not subject to review.\nI have quoted from the above judgments, and there are many others containing expressions to the same effect, for the purpose of indicating that the order of a trial judge dispensing with a jury during the course of the trial is consistently treated as the exercise of a discretion vested in him by the statute. There may be cases in which the order could be shown to have been made otherwise, as for example if the judge in his reasons made it clear that he had discharged the jury only because he had erroneously decided that he was bound as a matter of law to do so. Logan et al. v. Wilson et al.[7] was a case of this sort.\nIn the case at bar counsel for the appellant contends that it has been shown (i) that in reaching his decision to discharge the jury the learned trial judge was proceeding, in part at least, on a mistaken view as to what had in fact been said by Mr. MacDonald in his address as to the evidence, and (ii) that there was nothing in that address which could properly be held to be inflammatory. From this he seeks to draw the conclusion that the order was not one made in the exercise of judicial discretion.\nI am unable to reach that conclusion. The reasons of the learned trial judge quoted above show that he directed his mind to the question whether the address of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel was of a nature which might lead the jury to an unwarranted verdict and for that reason he should dispense with the jury. His conclusion that he should do so was based on some mis-statements actually, although no doubt unintentionally, made by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel and on several passages which in my opinion it was open to the learned judge to regard as \u201cinflammatory\u201d. The circumstances that the learned judge mistakenly thought that there had been additional mis-statements and that on reading the written record an appellate tribunal might regard the passages said to be inflammatory as not going beyond the bounds permitted to counsel do not make the order one made otherwise than in the exercise of his discretion. At the most those circumstances, assuming their existence, would afford grounds for submitting that the learned judge had exercised his discretion mistakenly.\nThe decision which the learned trial judge was called upon to make appears to me to have required the exercise of discretion within the definition of that term in Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary which was adopted by Cannon J. in Glesby v. Mitchell[8]:\nThat part of the judicial function which decides questions arising in the trial of a cause, according to the particular circumstances of each case, and as to which the judgment of the court is uncontrolled by fixed rules of law.\nThe power exercised by courts to determine questions to which no strict rule of law is applicable but which, from their nature, and the circumstances of the case, are controlled by the personal judgment of the court.\nI have concluded that the order of the learned trial judge was made in the exercise of the judicial discretion given to him by s. 57(3) of The Judicature Act and that we have no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal, even if we should be of opinion that his discretion was exercised mistakenly.\nI do not intend by anything I have said above to express an opinion as to whether the discretion of the learned judge was or was not rightly exercised in the particular circumstances of this case.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs as of a motion to quash. LOCKE J.:\u2014In my opinion, the order complained of was made in the exercise of a judicial discretion within the meaning of s. 44 of the Supreme Court Act and, accordingly, we are without jurisdiction.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the plaintiff, appellant: W.E.

The resulting duty under the latter item is less than under item 445g. The decision of the Board was affirmed in the Exchequer Court.\nHeld (Taschereau and Kellock JJ. dissenting): The Tariff Board did not err in law in classifying the motor under item 445g. Per Kerwin C.J. and Abbott and Nolan JJ.: The specific classification in item 445g was intended by Parliament to override and does override the general provision \"complete parts of the foregoing\" in item 427a. Parliament, in item 445g, has singled out a special piece of machinery, not specially dealt with elsewhere in the tariff, whereas in item 427a, it has imposed a lower rate of duty on machinery generally, not specifically dealt with elsewhere, and complete parts thereof.\nPer Taschereau and Kellock JJ., dissenting: By its plain meaning, item 427a includes any parts of the class of machinery the item describes, whether it be a motor or any other component of the complete machine, and consequently the electric motor, constituting a part of the machinery, was \"otherwise provided for\" within the meaning of item 445g. If it be conceded, as it must be, that a part falls within item 427 or 427a, it is then otherwise provided for. An electric motor, taken by itself, is a machine, but from the standpoint of item 427a, the motor in question here is only a \"part\" and, as such, is within that item and not within item 445g. It is not necessary that the \"provision otherwise\" must be couched in any particular language but it is sufficient that another tariff item, properly construed, does, in fact, make provision otherwise, as does item 427a.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of Cameron J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada 1, affirming the decision of the Tariff Board. Appeal dismissed.\nG. F. Henderson, Q.C., and R. H. McKercher, for the appellant.\nK. E. Eaton and G. W. Ainslie, for the respondent the Deputy Minister.\nR. I. Martin, for the respondent Canadian Electrical Manufacturers' Association.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and Abbott and Nolan JJ. was delivered by\nAbbott J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice Cameron of the Exchequer Court of Canada 2, rendered on March 6, 1956, dismissing the appellant's appeal from a declaration of the Tariff Board dated March 1, 1955, by which the appellant's appeal to the Board from a decision of the Deputy Minister respondent dated August 10, 1954, under the Customs Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 58, as to the tariff classification of an electric motor, imported by the appellant from the United States, had been dismissed.\nThe article imported was a replacement motor for a five cubic yard electric shovel, and the question in issue is whether this motor should be classified as a complete part of machinery under item 427a of Sched. \"A\" of the Customs Tariff, or as an electric motor under item 445g.\nThe appeal to the Exchequer Court and to this Court, pursuant to leave granted, was on the following question of law:\nDid the Tariff Board err as a matter of law in deciding that a part, namely a 125 h.p. open ball bearing vertical shaft motor, for P & H Model 1500 5-cubic yard Electric Shovel, imported under Montreal Customs Entry No. 121526-C, February 3, 1954, is dutiable under tariff item 445g, rather than tariff item 427a?\nThe tariff items in question read as follows:\n427a. All machinery composed wholly or in part of iron or steel, n.o.p., of a class or kind not made in Canada; complete parts of the foregoing \u2026\n445g. Electric motors, and complete parts thereof, n.o.p. \u2026\nBriefly stated appellant's contention is that giving effect to the plain meaning of tariff item 427a, the electric motor in question is clearly covered by the words \"complete parts of the foregoing\" in that item and that in consequence item 445g cannot apply by reason of the n.o.p.3 provision contained therein.\nElectric motors are. machines in themselves and the Tariff Board found as a fact (and this finding is conclusive so far as this Court is concerned) that electric motors are in their very nature generally intended to be incorporated in or attached to machinery or equipment. This being so, it was urged by respondents that unless the symbol \"n.o.p.\" in item 445g is interpreted as excluding from the operation of that item only electric motors provided for by special mention in other items in the tariff, there would be little room for the application of tariff item 445g. The Tariff Board stated in its decision that \"since the legislators have provided for electric motors eo nomine in tariff item 445g, we must conclude that this classification is intended to override any 'basket' provision such as 'parts' in tariff item 427a; otherwise tariff item 445g is virtually ineffective\". Respondents argued that such a result, i.e., that item 445g would be virtually ineffective, is not one that could have been intended by Parliament. I believe this argument to be well founded. In item 445g Parliament has singled out a special piece of machinery, not specially dealt with elsewhere in the tariff, and has imposed a special rate of duty upon it, presumably to protect the Canadian manufacturers of that type of machine.\nIn item 427a, on the other hand, Parliament has imposed upon machinery generally, which is not specifically dealt with elsewhere and \"complete parts\" thereof another and a lower rate of duty than that imposed upon the special machines provided for in 445g and in other like items where specific types of machinery or equipment are singled out for special and higher rates of duty.\nIn my opinion the specific classification provided in 445g was intended to override and does override the general provision \"complete parts of the foregoing\" contained in item 427a.\nFor this reason, as well as for those given by Cameron J., with which I am in respectful agreement, in my opinion the Tariff Board did not err as a matter of law in classifying the motor in question as subject to duty under tariff item 445g.\nI would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Taschereau and Kellock JJ. was delivered by\nKellock J. (dissenting):\u2014This appeal comes to this Court by leave from the Exchequer Court upon the following question of law:\nDid the Tariff Board err as a matter of law in deciding that a part, namely, a 1'25 h.p. open ball bearing vertical shaft motor, for P & H Model 1500 5-cubic yard Electric Shovel, imported under Montreal Customs Entry No. 121526-C, February 3, 1954, is dutiable under tariff item 445g, rather than tariff item 427a?\nAs stated in the factum of the respondent Deputy Minister, \"the article imported was a replacement motor\". The motor is so constructed that its shaft fits the shaft of a generator which it is the function of the motor to drive. The Tariff Board held that item 445g of Sched. \"A\" of the Customs Tariff was the governing item and not item 427a as the appellant contends. An appeal to the Exchequer Court 4 was dismissed. The tariff items in question are as follows:\n427a. All machinery composed wholly or in part of iron or steel, n.o.p., of a class or kind not made in Canada; complete parts of the foregoing\u2026\n445g. Electric motors, and complete parts thereof, n.o.p. \u2026\nIn the view of the Board, item 445g, as it provides specifically for electric motors, should be considered as overriding a \"basket\" provision such as item 427a. The Board considered that if that were not so, item 445g would be rendered virtually ineffective. The Board therefore held that the \"not otherwise provided for\" provision in item 445g must be deemed to include all electric motors not elsewhere provided for in the tariff specifically \"as motors\".\nIn the Exchequer Court, this view was interpreted not as meaning that the actual words \"electric motors\" must occur but that any words clearly indicating \"electric motors \u2014that is, machinery providing motion\", would be sufficient.\nIt is properly conceded in the case at bar that a complete shovel of the type here in question, including its motors, of which there are at least four, each performing a different function, is entitled to entry under 427a as \"machinery\" whether it arrives at the border completely assembled, or in its various components to be assembled in Canada. This involves the consequence that the motors are \"parts\" but there would remain nothing upon which the words \"complete parts of the foregoing\" in the item could operate unless they are to be applied to the importation of any of these components for replacement purposes. Accordingly, item 427a, construed in its ordinary plain meaning, includes all the parts of the class of machinery the item describes, whether the part in question is a motor, a generator, a scoop, or any other component of the complete machine.\nAccordingly, an electric motor constituting a part of such machinery is \"otherwise provided for\" within the meaning of item 445g. By force of its own terms, therefore, the last-mentioned item cannot extend to such an article. It is not necessary, in my opinion, that the \"provision otherwise\" must be couched in any particular language but it is sufficient that another tariff item, properly construed, does, in fact, make provision otherwise, as does item 427a.\nTo construe item 445g as it has been construed by the Tariff Board and the Exchequer Court involves, in my ] opinion, the addition to it of words not to be found therein. This is not a legitimate means of construing the statute.\nIt is contended that unless an electric motor, although it is a component part of a machine falling within item 427a, is to be considered as none the less falling within item 445g, notwithstanding the n.o.p. provision of that item, the last-mentioned item will be rendered virtually ineffective, particularly in view of the presence in the tariff of item 427, which is couched in language similar to 427a save that it does not include the words \"of a class or kind not made in Canada\". This contention involves a contradiction in its mere statement for the reason that if it be conceded that a part falls within item 427 or 427a, it is otherwise provided for within the meaning of item 445g.\nOverlooking this contradiction, it may be, as stated by the Tariff Board, that electric motors are generally intended for incorporation in or attachment to machinery or equipment, but the only electric motors which fall within items 427 and 427a are those which can properly be regarded as parts of a machine which itself falls within one or other of these items. Unless a motor comes within the meaning of \"parts\" as that word is used in these items, they have no application to it. It would seem obvious that there must be many electric motors of which it cannot be said at the time of the importation into Canada, by a dealer, for example, that they are a \"part\" or a \"replacement part\" of any machine whatever. No doubt they may ultimately be used in conjunction with some machine, but that would not, in my opinion, of itself, render them \"parts\" of such machine within the meaning of either 427 or 427a.\nA further argument was advanced by counsel for the Deputy Minister, namely, that as the electric motor here in question is itself \"a machine\", it falls within item 427a qua \"machinery\" and not qua \"parts\", while it is also within 445g as an electric motor. It is then said that, this being so, the n.o.p. provisions of these items cancel each other out with the result that item 445g, as the more specific provision, governs. It is quite true that an electric motor, taken by itself, is a machine, but from the standpoint of item 427a, such a motor as that here in question is only a \"part\" and, as such, is within that item and not within item 445g at all.\nI would therefore allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Exchequer Court and the order of the Tariff Board and direct an appropriate declaration to be made in accordance with the above reasons. The appellant should have its costs throughout.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, Taschereau and Kellock JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Gowling, MacTavish, Osborne & Henderson, Ottawa.\nSolicitor for the respondent, The Deputy Minister: K.

Clause 14 of the agreement provided for the construction of branch lines. In 1951, the Supreme Court of Canada, on appeal from the judgment on a reference under The Constitutional Questions Act, now R.S.S. 1953, c. 78, held that the exemption did not apply to properties of the kind enumerated used for the working of branch lines \"except such properties, if any \u2026 as are entitled to the benefit of the exemption from taxation as being required and used for the construction and working of the railway described in sections 1, 2 and 3 of the Act 37 Vict. cap. 14\". No specific properties were considered on the reference and the railway now sued three municipalities for declarations that properties within those municipalities were exempt from taxation under clause 16. Held: The action must fail. The properties in question, all situated on branch lines, were not \"required and used for the construction and working\" of the main line of the company, which was \"the railway\" described in the Act of 1874. It could not be said that the functions of the branch lines were so related to the main line as to be embraced within the expression \"Canadian Pacific Railway\" in clause 16 of the contract, which clearly distinguished between the main line and branch lines and granted the exemption from taxation to the main line only.\nJudgments and orders\u2014Effect of judgment on reference\u2014The Constitutional Questions Act, R.S.S. 1953, c. 78\u2014The Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 259, s. 55.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Locke and Cartwright JJ.: The judgment of the Court on the reference referred to above was not binding on the parties to this litigation, since matters referred to the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan under The Constitutional Questions Act did not differ from references to the Supreme Court under what was now s. 55 of the Supreme Court Act.\nAPPEALS by the plaintiff from the judgments of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan 1, varying the judgments of Davis J. 2, in three actions tried together.\nC. F. H. Carson, Q.C., Allan Findlay, Q.C., and H. M. Pickard, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nE. C. Leslie, Q.C., and Roy S. Meldrum, Q.C., for the defendants, respondents.\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014I agree with Mr. Justice Locke and Mr. Justice Nolan.\nTaschereau J.:\u2014I agree with Mr. Justice Locke and Mr. Justice Nolan.\nThe judgment of Rand and Kellock JJ. was delivered by\nRand J.:\u2014The facts of this controversy are set out in detail in the reasons of my brother Nolan; I agree with his conclusion but I desire to add a few paragraphs on the general contention of Mr. Carson.\nIt is conceded that all of the branches were constructed as independent lines of railway, each serving its own territory and in the course of it carrying products, chiefly grain, to the main line for furtherance to many points in Canada and abroad. The proposition is that by reason of the particular activities on the branch lines described in the evidence the latter have become facilities\u2014\"other things required and used\"\u2014of the main line, auxiliary adjuncts which, so long as those activities continue, and for the purposes of clause 16, are embraced within the expression \"Canadian Pacific Railway\" or the main line.\nBoth the main line and the branch lines are expressly dealt with in the charter and are specifically distinguished from one another. With a full appreciation of this distinction the tax exemption was limited to the main line. The items mentioned in clause 16 are merely a detailed enumeration of what, besides the right-of-way, roadbed and trackage of the main line, are its ordinary and necessary facilities. That they are required to be contained within the normal right-of-way is not suggested. Joint facilities may present questions of some nicety; they will, in any event, call for an appreciation of their particulars, and their inclusion in any degree will depend upon considerations which we are not called upon here to deal with.\nThat the same scope of property on the branch lines, that is, right-of-way, trackage, etc., can, in the manner claimed, be brought within clause 16 as mere facilities of the main line and thus effect the exemption of virtually the entire branch-line system throughout Saskatchewan and Alberta seems scarcely to call for serious comment. Nothing that has been brought up in the argument could have been absent from the minds of those who drafted the clause as well as the charter and the legislation bringing the enterprise into existence. It was contemplated that these subsidiary lines would be the instrumentalities for opening up the prairies; that there would necessarily be associated operation over both divisions of the railway system; and that there would be interrelated functioning. Foreseeing all this, the negotiators agreed that the trunk line should be exempt and the branch lines not exempt. Once a branch line is constructed as such and so long as it retains the functions which it was designed to perform, it is subject to taxation as all other property within the Province.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeals with costs. Locke J.:\u2014The matter to be determined is as to the construction of clause 16 of the agreement of October 21, 1880, which, so far as it is necessary to consider its terms, reads:\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway, and all stations: and station grounds, work shops, buildings, yards and other property, rolling stock and appurtenances required and used for the construction and working thereof \u2026 shall be forever free from taxation by the Dominion, or by any Province hereafter to be established or by any Municipal Corporation therein.\nThe question as to whether this exemption extends not only to the railway as described in the Act 37 Vict., c. 14, or whether it extends to the branch lines constructed either under the powers conferred by clause 14 of the contract or by other authority, was not rendered res judicata as between the parties to this litigation by the decision of this Court upon the reference 3, or by the judgment of the Judicial Committee 4, dismissing the appeal taken by the Attorney General for Saskatchewan by special leave upon two of the questions involved in that reference. In so far as the defendant municipalities are concerned, they were not parties to and were not heard upon the reference and, in so far as the present appellant is concerned, even though it was represented on the hearing before the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan when the matter was considered 5 and appealed to this Court from the judgment of the Court of Appeal and was represented in the proceedings before the Judicial Committee, I think it is not bound either by the opinions expressed by the Judicial Committee or by this Court. In this respect, matters referred to the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan under The Constitutional Questions Act of that Province (now R.S.S. 1953, c. 78) do not differ from references to this Court under what is now s. 55 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 259. As to references under the last-mentioned statute, see In re References by the Governor-General in Council 6, per Duff J. at p. 588; In Re Criminal Code 7, per Duff J. at p. 451.\nWhile upon the reference, by consent of the parties who were represented, a number of documents which came into being prior to the making of the contract in question were received in evidence as an aid to the interpretation of clause 16 and these documents were not put in evidence in the present actions, I remain of the opinion expressed by all of the members of the Court that the exemption, except to the extent hereinafter stated, does not extend to the branch lines of the Canadian Pacific Railway in the Province of Saskatchewan. The qualification to the answer to the first question excepted\nsuch properties, if any, real or personal, enumerated in clause 16, situate upon the branch lines in Saskatchewan as are entitled to the benefit of the exemption from taxation as being required and used for the construction and working of the railway described in sections 1, 2 and 3 of the Act 37 Vict. c. 14.\nThis answer, so expressed, was adopted by the majority of the members of the Court hearing the reference.\nWhile it does not affect any of the questions to be determined upon the present appeal, I think it should be pointed out that question 1 was directed only to property of the nature referred to situate on the branch lines, and it was to this alone that the answer was directed. No opinion was expressed as to whether the right to the exemption might be asserted as to properties not situate upon a branch line such as the Milestone pumping-station but which might be, within the meaning of clause 16, required and used for the operation of the main line of the Canadian Pacific Railway.\nIn my opinion, the \"stations and station grounds, work shops, buildings, yards and other property, rolling stock and appurtenances required and used for the construction and working\" of \"the Canadian Pacific Railway\" include property of the nature referred to, whether situate upon the main line or elsewhere, including branch lines. I am unable, with great respect for the differing opinions expressed in the Court of Appeal by Mr. Justice Gordon and by the learned trial judge, to agree that this enumeration applies only to properties of this nature situate upon the branch lines. While undoubtedly capable of that interpretation, my conclusion is that the enumeration was included for the purpose of making it clear that it was not merely the right-of-way of the main line but all of the properties and facilities needed for working it as an entity that were to be exempted from taxation.\nAt the hearing of the present matter, evidence was given of a fact that is self-evident\u2014that, without the traffic supplied by the branch lines which connect with the main line of the Canadian Pacific Railway, the operation would be financially an impossibility. It is not, however, contended on the argument addressed to us that the exemption extends to any of the properties in question by reason of the fact that the traffic they provide is necessary in this sense for the operation of the railway. The ground advanced may be stated broadly as being that the various properties the taxation of which is in question are necessary and used for the physical operation of the main line.\nWhile in the action against the Town of Estevan, only some 2\u00bd miles of the roadway of the Portal subdivision and 1\u00bd miles of the roadway of the Estevan subdivision are involved, the appellant claims that the roadway of both of these subdivisions, from Roche Percee to Pasqua and from Estevan to Kemnay, is exempt. The various other properties at Estevan, which include the station grounds some 82 acres in extent, are claimed to be exempt on the footing that they are used for the various purposes of keeping the roadway and tracks of the two subdivisions in proper operating order, in handling the receipt and delivery of freight traffic, providing accommodation for section-men, maintaining and repairing locomotives used to haul coal from Roche Percee and Bienfait, storing coal other than lignite for locomotives operating in and around Estevan, or passing through Estevan on their way to and from the main line, and for switching and marshalling trains, including cars of coal, coming from Bienfait and Roche Percee. As shown by the evidence of Mr. C. E. Lister, the general manager of the Prairie Region of the railway company, the Estevan subdivision was built in the year 1892 and the Portal subdivision in the following year. Neither of these subdivisions follows the most direct route to the main line, the Portal subdivision running in a northwesterly direction from North Portal at the border to Pasqua, while the Estevan subdivision runs for a considerable part of the route almost due east to Napinka in Manitoba, and thence in a northerly direction to Kemnay. It is not suggested that either of these branches was built for the purpose of securing lignite coal from any of the coal fields in the vicinity of Estevan for use by the railway company. The coal found at Bienfait and Roche Percee is lignite and unsuitable for use in locomotives. There was, however, a market in Winnipeg for this coal, commonly described as Souris coal, as early as 1887, and very large quantities have been supplied to that market as well as to other places in western Canada since the branches were built. The main line had been completed in 1885 and it was, according to Mr. Lister, not until about the year 1930 that this coal was used for company purposes at Winnipeg, which was one of the first places on the main line where it was so used. The coal has since been used in stationary boiler-plants in roundhouses on the main line from Fort William to Swift Current to produce steam power for its shops and heat for its railway cars and station buildings.\nOf the lignite coal hauled from these fields over these two branches, about 9 per cent. is, according to Mr. Lister, carried for these uses on the main line: the remainder is carried for commercial purposes at the instance of others. Of the total traffic carried over these lines, the coal so carried for company purposes is an insignificant percentage.\nThe function discharged by the Portal and Estevan branches in carrying this coal for company service is the main basis of the claim for exemption. It will be apparent from the above statement of facts that no such claim could have been advanced between the years 1892 and 1893, when these branches were respectively built, and the year 1930, being the earliest date at which it is suggested that the coal was carried for these purposes. Presumably before 1930, the coal used in the roundhouses and stations on this\n[Page 372],\nportion of the railway was bituminous coal, of which there are great quantities in western Canada, obtained elsewhere. It is the action of the company itself in making the necessary changes in its stationary boiler-plants to enable lignite coal to be used, and the consequent demand for this fuel from Bienfait and Roche Percee which are the basis of the claim for the exemption. If the argument advanced were to be carried to its logical conclusion, then long after the construction of an extensive branch line connecting with the main line in Saskatchewan built for the usual purpose of obtaining profitable traffic for the company, the whole line could be rendered exempt from taxation by the utilization of timber at the point on the line furthest distant from the main line suitable for the production of railway ties, material in constant use upon the main line of the railway, and the transport of these to the main line. Similarly, the establishment of a small metal-fabricating plant at such a point, producing material required and used on the railway tracks on the main line, might be made the basis of a claim for exemption of the whole line. The contract should not, in my opinion, be construed in a manner which would result in upholding any such claim.\nWe have been told that these are in the nature of test cases but, while this may be so, it is undesirable, in my opinion, to attempt to lay down any rule applicable in all circumstances for the construction of clause 16. Speaking generally, the extension of the exemption granted to the main line to other properties required and used for its construction and working was, I think, designed to cover such situations as would result by the placing of railway shops or roundhouses off the principal right-of-way and connected by a spur line with the main line, or gravel pits or quarries situate at a distance from the main line from which material could be obtained for the construction and maintenance of the right-of-way. I agree with Mr. Justice Procter that, if the pumping-station at Milestone on Moose Jaw Creek had been built or was maintained in order to obtain a supply of water to be conveyed to the main line for use in locomotives or other company purposes, this would fall within the exemption, even though some of the water were diverted for use on the Portal subdivision. The common and universal principle for the interpretation of an agreement is that it should receive that construction which its language will admit which will best effectuate the intention of the parties (Chitty on Contracts, 21st ed. 1955, p. 144) and, applying this rule to the construction of the contract in question, it is my opinion that the intention of the parties to this contract was that the exemption should extend only to stations, workshops and other properties of the nature referred to, the primary purpose of the acquisition or construction or maintenance of which was to be of use in the construction or operation of the main line as an entity. In the case of the right-of-way of these two branch lines, it is quite clear from the evidence that the purpose of bringing them into being was to obtain profitable traffic for the undertaking of the railway company, and the various stations, workshops and other buildings erected at various points along the subdivisions were designed to handle such traffic as should develop. Neither at the time the subdivisions were built nor at any time thereafter has the primary purpose of their operation or maintenance been to carry the comparatively small quantity of traffic resulting from the use of this lignite coal upon the main line.\nThe claim to exemption of the roundhouses, stations and other buildings referred to is made upon the ground that they are required and used for the working of the main line since they are used variously for the maintenance of the roadway of the two subdivisions, the servicing of rolling stock required and used for the working of the main line, to provide facilities for company employees who perform the work of billing the traffic and the marshalling of trains which are destined for the main line, work which must be done, it is said, on the subdivisions in order to avoid congestion, delays and confusion on the main line.\nIn my opinion, none of these claims can be sustained. The services referred to are made necessary not by reason of the operation of the main line as an entity but by reason of the operation of that line and of the subdivisions in question and of traffic coming on to them from other sources, such as the Soo Line and the Neptune and other branches. The primary purpose of the construction and maintenance of these facilities was and is the handling of traffic of the nature thus referred to and of incoming traffic brought to places upon the subdivisions from elsewhere;\nAs to the Municipality of Caledonia, the claim to exemption for that part of the railway line of the Portal subdivision within its boundaries should, in my opinion, fail for the reason I have stated. As to the water-supply site and pump-house, the water made available is not used by locomotives operating upon the main line and these facilities were not constructed nor are they maintained for the purpose of its operation as such, but rather of the Portal subdivision.\nAs to the basis of the claim for exemption advanced against the Rural Municipality of Swift Current, while the Empress subdivision and, to a lesser extent, the Vanguard and Shamrock subdivisions are used as alternate routes for main line traffic, it is perfectly plain from the evidence that this was not the primary purpose for the construction of these branches, nor is it of their maintenance as branch lines of the railway described in the statute of 1874. The Empress branch, according to the evidence, is one of the best producers of profitable traffic in the western system of the railway company and the fact that at times main line trains are routed over its right-of-way, or that a particularly fine variety of sand required for use generally upon the main line is found and transported to that line from one of the places upon the branch, cannot justify the claim for exemption, in my opinion, for the reasons I have stated.\nI would dismiss these appeals with costs.\nCartwright J.:\u2014I agree with the reasons and conclusion of my brothers Locke and Nolan and would dispose of the appeals as they propose.\nNolan J.:\u2014The Canadian Pacific Railway Company, as plaintiff, brought three actions against the respondent municipalities, which were tried together, and the Company now appeals from the judgments of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan, which, by a majority (Gordon J.A. dissenting), dismissed the appeals of the Company from the judgments of the trial judge and allowed the cross-appeals of the respondents the Town of Estevan and the Rural Municipality of Caledonia. In each of the actions the Canadian Pacific Railway Company (hereinafter sometimes referred to as \"the Company\") claimed exemption from assessment and taxation for the years 1948 to 1953 inclusive in respect of certain railway properties situate within the boundaries of the respondent municipal corporations. The basis of the claim was that such property was exempted from taxation by reason of the provisions of clause 16 of the agreement entered into between the Government of Canada and George Stephen and others dated October 21, 1880, and ratified by the Parliament of Canada in 1881 by 44 Vict., c. 1, which agreement will be hereinafter referred to as \"the contract\".\nThe appellant further claimed an injunction restraining the respondent municipalities from levying, or attempting to levy, any taxes in respect of certain properties situate in the respondent municipalities and claimed repayment from the Rural Municipality of Swift Current of sums of money paid in respect of taxation levied against it during the years in question. The relief sought by way of injunction applied to the years 1948 to 1953, as well as to subsequent years.\nClause 16 of the contract provides as follows:\n16. The Canadian Pacific Railway, and all stations and station grounds, work shops, buildings, yards and other property, rolling stock and appurtenances required and used for the construction and working thereof, and the capital stock of the Company, shall be forever free from taxation by the Dominion, or by any Province hereafter to be established, or by any Municipal Corporation therein; and the lands of the Company, in the North-West Territories, until they are either sold of occupied, shall also be free from such taxation for 20 years after the grant thereof from the Crown.\nBefore dealing with the reasons for judgment in the Courts below it should be pointed out that in 1948, by order in council, the Government of Saskatchewan referred to the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan 8 four questions concerning the exemption of the Company under clause 16 of the contract and its application in the Province of Saskatchewan. On appeal to this Court 9 the first question and the answer given by the majority were as follows:\n1. Does clause 16 of the contract set forth in the Schedule to Chapter 1 of the Statutes of Canada, 44 Victoria (1881), being an Act respecting the Canadian Pacific Railway, exempt and free from taxation the stations and station grounds, work shops, buildings, yards, and other property, used for the working of the branch lines of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company situated in Saskatchewan?\nAnswer: No, except such properties, if any, real or personal, enumerated in clause 16, situate upon the branch lines in Saskatchewan as are entitled to the benefit of the exemption from taxation as being required and used for the construction and working of the railway described in sections 1, 2 and 3 of the Act 37 Vict. cap. 14.\nThe third question and the answer given by the majority were as follows:\n3. Are the provisions of the said The Village Act, 1946, The Rural Municipalities Act, 1946, The Local Improvement Districts Act, 1946, The City Act, 1947, and The Town Act, 1947, all as amended, relating to the assessment and taxation of the real estate of railway companies, operative in respect of branch lines of Canadian Pacific Railway Company in the Province of Saskatchewan constructed pursuant to clause 14 of the said contract?\nAnswer: Yes, except in respect of such real estate, if any, situate upon branch lines constructed pursuant to clause 14 of the contract as is entitled to the benefit of the exemption from taxation under clause 16 as being required and used for the construction and working of the railway as described in sections 1, 2 and 3 of the Act 37 Vict. cap. 14.\nQuestions 2 and 4 related to questions of business tax and are irrelevant to the matters under discussion.\nOn the appeal to this Court on the reference it was unnecessary to consider particular properties and the present actions instituted by the appellant were in an endeavour to have the answers of this Court applied to particular properties of the appellant.\nOn appeal before this Court the appellant did not contend that all of its properties within the respondent municipalities were entitled to exemption as coming within the words \"required and used\" for the working of the Canadian Pacific Railway. It thus becomes necessary to discuss the particular properties in detail. The Portal subdivision of the appellant extends from Pasqua, on the main line near Moose Jaw, to the Canada-United States border, where it connects with the Soo Line. It runs through the town of Estevan.\nThe Estevan subdivision runs from Estevan to Kemnay, on the main line near Brandon.\nThe evidence discloses that large quantities of lignite coal come from the Souris Valley coal fields at Roche Percee and Bienfait near Estevan. This coal is hauled over the Portal and Estevan subdivisions for use in stationary boiler-plants in roundhouses at Fort William, Ignace, Kenora, Winnipeg, Brandon, Broadview, Regina, Moose Jaw and Swift Current, all situate on the main line of the Company. It is not used at Estevan or at any station on the Estevan or Portal subdivisions. These stationary boiler-plants generate steam power for railway shops and steam heat for railway cars, stations and other railway buildings. The plants are adapted to the use of lignite coal, which is the most economical available and obtainable only in the Souris area.\nCoal from the Bienfait and Roche Percee coal fields, which is to be delivered to main line points to the west of Broadview, comes into Estevan and moves north over the Portal subdivision to Pasqua and then along the main line to its destination. Coal from these fields, which is to be delivered to main line points east of Broadview, moves over the Estevan subdivision to Kemnay, on the main line, and then to its destination.\nThe appellant contends that the roadway of the Portal and Estevan subdivisions is exempt as being required and used for the working of the main line.\nThe Company also contends that 2.55 miles of roadway of the Portal subdivision and 1.51 miles of roadway of the Estevan subdivision, together with the station, station grounds, work shops, buildings, yards and other properties situate in and assessed by the respondent Town of Estevan are required and used for the working of the main line and are, therefore, exempt from taxation under the provisions of clause 16 of the contract.\nThe Company also contends that 8.333 miles of roadway situate in and assessed by the respondent Rural Municipality of Caledonia are required and used for the working of the main line and are; therefore, exempt. A claim for exemption on the same grounds is made in respect of the Milestone water-supply site and pumphouse, an area of 26.98 acres on Moose Jaw Creek, from which water is pumped approximately 2 miles into a water tower alongside the tracks in the town of Milestone, which is the last watering place before Moose Jaw and is used by all locomotives proceeding to the main line of the Company.\nThe Empress subdivision commences at Java on the main line of the Company west of Swift Current and runs in a north-westerly direction to Empress, Alberta. At that point it connects with the Bassano subdivision and runs to Bassano, Alberta, thus forming a single-track loop with the main line of the Company. It is submitted by the Company that the Empress subdivision is exempt as being required and used for the working of the main line.\nThe Company also contends that 8.707 miles of the roadway of the Empress subdivision, together with the station and station grounds, the section, tool and bunk houses at Cantuar, situate in and assessed by the respondent Rural Municipality of Swift Current, are required and used for the working of the main line and are, therefore, exempt from taxation.\nThe Vanguard subdivision runs southerly from the city of Swift Current to Meyronne and the Shamrock subdivision runs east from Hak on the Vanguard subdivision to Archive on the Expanse subdivision, which runs northerly to the main line of the Company near Moose Jaw. The Company contends that the roadway of the Vanguard subdivision north of Hak, consisting of 17.539 miles of roadway within the respondent Rural Municipality of Swift Current, together with the roadway of the Shamrock subdivision, consisting of 3.504 miles of roadway, and the station and station grounds, section, bunk and tool houses at Wymark and the station and station grounds at Dunelm, situate in and assessed by the respondent Rural Municipality of Swift Current, are also exempt from taxation as being required and used for the working of the main line.\nThe learned trial judge dismissed the action against the respondent Rural Municipality of Swift Current and held that none of the property enumerated in the statement of claim in the action against that respondent was required and used for the construction and working of the Canadian Pacific Railway, as that railway is defined in the contract. The learned trial judge further held in the action against the respondent Town of Estevan that all the properties claimed by the appellant to be exempt from taxation, other than the roadway consisting of 4.5 miles, were not presently subject to taxation and were not so subject during the years 1948 to 1953 inclusive. The learned trial judge also held in the action against the respondent Rural Municipality of Caledonia that the water-supply site and the pump-house were exempt from taxation, but that the roadway of the appellant within the respondent municipality consisting of 8.333 miles was subject to taxation.\nIn the Court of Appeal Martin C.J.S., with whom McNiven J.A. and Culliton J.A. concurred, dismissed the appeals of the appellant and allowed the cross-appeals of the respondents the Town of Estevan and the Rural Municipality of Caledonia and held that the properties in question were not required and used for the construction and working of the Canadian Pacific Railway, as that railway is defined in the contract, and that the appellant was, therefore, not entitled to the benefit of the exemption provided in clause 16 thereof. With this view Procter J.A. agreed. Gordon J.A. would have allowed the appeals and dismissed the cross-appeals and was of the opinion that a station on the main line of the railway of the appellant would be entitled to the exemption even if no longer required and used for the construction and working of the main line. The learned judge further held that the stations and station grounds, buildings, yards and other properties referred to in clause 16 of the contract refer to those on the branch lines and, when required and used for working of the main line, are exempt from taxation. With regard to the roadbed and right-of-way of the branch lines themselves, Gordon J.A. held that they were exempt from taxation, under whatever authority they were built, if required and used in the working of the main line.\nThe appellant contended before this Court that all of the properties indicated above, situate within the respondent municipalities, together with the roadway of the branch lines, were required and used for the, working of the Canadian Pacific Railway, as that railway is defined in the contract, and came within the exemption in clause 16.\nAs has been set out above, questions 1 and 3 on the reference to the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan, supra, and to this Court, supra, pertain particularly to clause 16 of the contract. In answer to question 1 this Court and the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan both stated that the station and station grounds, work shops, buildings, yards and other property used for the working of the branch lines of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company situate in Saskatchewan were subject to taxation. This Court, however, went on to make an exception of those properties, if any, real or personal, enumerated in clause 16, situate upon the branch lines in Saskatchewan, which are entitled to the exemption as being required and used for the construction and working of the railway as described in ss. 1, 2 and 3 of the Act 37 Vict., c. 14. A similar exception was included by this Court in the answer to question 3.\nOn appeal to the Privy Council 10, the judgment of the Judicial Committee was largely limited to the constitutional aspect of the matter and to the application of the exemption to business taxes.\nThe judgment of this Court was affirmed and the answers given by this Court were in no way varied by the judgment of the Judicial Committee.\nIt will be seen that, while the judgment of the Judicial Committee is, in the main, irrelevant to the issues involved in this appeal, nevertheless the judgment of this Court was affirmed and it remains to be decided what specific property of the Company falls within the exception set out in the answers given by this Court to questions 1 and 3.\nBy the Statutes of Canada 1874, 37 Vict., c. 14, the Parliament of Canada passed An Act to provide for the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway. The preamble refers to the agreement with the Province of British Columbia with respect to the construction of the railway and also to a resolution of the House of Commons that the railway should be constructed and worked by private enter- prise, assisted by such liberal grants of land and such subsidy in money, or other aid, as the Parliament of Canada should thereafter determine.\nSection 1 provides that a railway, to be called the \"Canadian Pacific Railway\", shall be constructed from some point near to and south of Lake Nipissing to some point in British Columbia on the Pacific Ocean, both of the points to be determined and the course and line of the railway to be approved by the Governor in council.\nSection 2 provides that the whole of the said railway, for the purpose of its construction, shall be divided into four sections; the first section to begin at a point near to and south of Lake Nipissing, and to extend towards the upper or western end of Lake Superior; the second section to begin at some point on Lake Superior, to be determined by the Governor in council, and connecting with the first section, and to extend to Red River, in the Province of Manitoba; the third section to extend from Red River, in the Province of Manitoba, to some point between Fort Edmonton and the foot of the Rocky Mountains, to be determined by the Governor in council; the fourth section to extend from the western terminus of the third section to some point in British Columbia on the Pacific Ocean.\nSection 3 provides for the construction of two branch lines:\nFirst.\u2014A branch from the point indicated as the proposed eastern terminus of the said railway to some point on the Georgian Bay, both the said points to be determined by the Governor in Council.\nSecondly.\u2014A branch from the main line near Fort Garry, in the Province of Manitoba, to some point near Pembina on the southern boundary thereof.\nSection 4 provides that these two branch railways shall be considered as forming part of the Canadian Pacific Railway, and as so many distinct sections of the said railway, and shall be subject to all the provisions thereafter made with respect to the said Canadian Pacific Railway, except in so far as otherwise provided by the Act. It is to be observed that the branch railways referred to in s. 3 of the Act, supra, are not in the Province of Saskatchewan.\nBy the Statutes of Canada 1881, 44 Vict., c. 1, an Act was passed respecting the Canadian Pacific Railway. By s. 1 of the Act the contract, appended thereto as a schedule, was approved and the Government was authorized to carry out the conditions contained in the contract.\nSection 2 authorized the Government to incorporate the persons named in the contract with the corporate name of the \"Canadian Pacific Railway Company\" and to grant to them a charter conferring upon them the powers contained in the contract.\nUnder s. 4 the Government was authorized to permit the admission, free of duty, of steel rails and other material to be used in the original construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway, as defined in 37 Vict., c. 14.\nClause 1 of the contract, annexed as a schedule to the Act, after defining Eastern, Lake Superior, Central and Western sections, concludes as follows: \"And that the words 'the Canadian Pacific Railway', are intended to mean the entire railway, as described in the Act 37th Victoria, chap. 14.\" Clause 1 of the contract is also declared to be \"for the better interpretation of this contract\" and it seems clear that wherever the words \"Canadian Pacific Railway\" occur in the contract they must be construed to mean the main line, consisting of the four sections referred to above, together with the two branch lines described in 37 Vict., c. 14, unless the language used in any clause plainly indicates some other construction.\nThe construction of branch lines is referred to in two -clauses of the contract, namely, clauses 11 and 14. In clause 11 the Company is authorized to locate a part of the land grant \"on each side of any branch line or lines of railway to be located by the Company\" in substitution for sections found to be \"not fairly fit for settlement\".\nClause 14 provides that the Company shall have the right, from time to time, to construct branch lines of railway and that the Government shall grant to the Company the lands required for the roadbed of such branches and for the stations, station grounds, buildings, work shops, yards and other appurtenances requisite for the efficient construction and working of such branches. Clause 14 contains no obligation on the part of the Company to construct any branch lines, nor is such an obligation contained in any other part of the contract. It should be observed at the outset that s. 24 of the Saskatchewan Act, 1905, 4-5 Edw. VII (Can.), c. 42, provided that the powers granted to the Province established thereby \"shall be exercised subject to the provisions of section 16 of the contract set forth in the schedule to chapter 1 of the statutes of 1881, being an Act respecting the Canadian Pacific Railway Company\".\nI have made no reference to the provisions of the various taxing statutes of the Province of Saskatchewan, empowering the respondent municipalities to assess and to impose the taxes in question. I assume that it is not in dispute that the respondent municipalities have the power to make the assessments and levy the taxes in question, assuming that the exemption is not applicable.\nIt is clear that for the purposes of these appeals the relevant words of clause 16 of the contract, in part, are:\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway, and all stations and station grounds, work shops, buildings, yards and other property, rolling stock and appurtenances required and used for the \u2026 working thereof \u2026 shall be forever free from taxation \u2026\nBefore this Court the points which were presented in support of the claim for exemption were:\n(a) the carriage of materials or supplies originating at a point on a branch line and used for the operation of facilities on the main line;\n(b) furnishing supplies at points on the branch lines to enable rolling stock to carry on their operations on the main line;\n(c) branch lines furnishing alternative routes for running trains between points on the main line, either because of breakdowns or for the more efficient dispatch of traffic.\nBefore dealing with the specific properties or roadways for which exemption is claimed, it should be stated that it is conceded that the branch lines of the Company are lines of railway primarily serving their own territory and, in the course of their own operations, carrying traffic, both freight and passenger, to the main line, to be transported to points in Canada and elsewhere. The proposition is that the functions of the branch lines are so related to the main line that they have become subordinate facilities and are \"other property\" which, so long as these functions continue, are embraced, for the purposes of clause 16 of the contract, within the expression \"Canadian Pacific Railway\", meaning the main line of the system. By the Act of 1874, providing for the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway, and the subsequent legislation of 1881 with the contract annexed, both main line and branch lines are expressly dealt with and distinguished one from the other. With a full appreciation of this distinction, the tax exemption was limited to the main line and the branch lines named in s. 3 of the statute. As has been shown, the words \"the Canadian Pacific Railway\" are stated in clause 1 of the contract as being intended to mean the entire railway as described in the Act of 1874.\nNothing that has been brought up in the argument could have been absent from the minds of those who drafted the legislation bringing the enterprise into existence. It must have been contemplated that branch lines would be the instrumentalities opening up the vast prairie region and that there would necessarily be integrated operation over both portions of the railway and interrelated functioning. With all this in mind the negotiators agreed that the main line would be exempt and that once a branch line was constructed as such, and so long as it functioned for that purpose, it would be subject to taxation.\nIt is plain on the appeal to this Court on the reference, supra, that there was nothing in the statute 1874, c. 14, which could be taken to include branch lines and that the words \"Canadian Pacific Railway\" are restricted in their meaning to include only the main line and the branch lines named in s. 3 of the statute.\nThe remaining matter for determination is the meaning of the words \"required and used for the \u2026 working\" of the railway described in ss. 1, 2 and 3 of the Act 37 Vict., c. 14, a question which arises by reason of the limitation placed by this Court in the answers to the questions on the reference with respect to properties, if any, real or personal, situate on branch lines in Saskatchewan.\nThe appellant contends that by clause 7 of the contract the Company is obligated to work and run the railway efficiently and that any property which would assist the Company in efficiently operating the railway should be exempt. It was further contended that the property which might be required for such efficient operation must largely be a matter of judgment and the judgment must be that of the Company; also it was said that the test of what is required is not what is absolutely necessary or indispensable, but what is reasonably required, and that good faith is a necessary element. Reliance was placed by the appellant on City and South London Railway Company v. London County Council 11. In my view this authority may be distinguished on the ground that it involved an original taking of land, which is not the case here.\nIt may be useful to apply the arguments of the appellant to the properties in question situate within the respondent municipalities.\nIt is contended by the appellant that the coal required for stationary boiler-plants is hauled to the main line in substantial quantities from the Souris area over parts of the roadway of the Portal and Estevan subdivisions, which runs through Estevan, and that consequently the roadway of the Portal and Estevan subdivisions is \"required and used\" for the working of the main line and is exempt.\nThe evidence discloses that the main line boiler-plants have been adapted to the use of lignite coal, which is produced in the Souris area and is an economical form of fuel. The haulage of coal over the Portal subdivision represents a small proportion of the total freight traffic over that branch line. Nevertheless a large tonnage is hauled. The evidence discloses that the Portal subdivision was built in 1893 and the principal purpose of its construction was to give the Company the shortest route between the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul and the Pacific north-west. A secondary purpose was to carry coal commercially from the developing Souris coal field. As early as 1887 coal from that field was being carried down the Souris River to Winnipeg, but it was not until 1930 or 1935 that coal from this field was first used by the Company in its main line boiler-plants.\nI am unable to agree with the contention that the Portal and Estevan subdivisions are \"required and used\" for the working of the main line because lignite coal is carried over those branch lines to provide fuel for stationary boiler-plants on the main line. To agree would be to extend the argument for exemption to other branch lines transporting material and supplies to main line points. Neither do I agree with the contention that the roadway in the Portal and Estevan subdivisions, together with the stations, station grounds, houses and other buildings located in the respondent Town of Estevan, can be said to be exempt. Clearly they are used for the convenience of passengers, for the maintenance of the roadway of the two subdivisions and for the servicing of rolling stock, but, in my view, it cannot be said that they are also required and used for the working of the main line.\nWhat I have said regarding the roadway of the Portal subdivision applies equally to the roadway in the respondent Rural Municipality of Caledonia, which roadway is part of the Portal subdivision. Milestone water-supply site and pumphouse, situate in this respondent municipality, although the last watering point before Moose Jaw, are, in my view, not entitled to exemption as being required and used for the working of the main line.\nAs has been pointed out, in the Rural Municipality of Swift Current an alternative route for main line traffic was built in 1914 between Java, near Swift Current, and Bassano in Alberta. It is used to take care of overflow main line traffic and transports a special kind of subsequently discovered sand from the Empress area to the main line. This alternative route is some distance from the main line. The evidence is that it was constructed as a branch line and, in my opinion, is not a part of the Canadian Pacific Railway which the contractors were obligated to build under the contract and is not required and used for the working of the main line.\nWhat I have said regarding the liability to taxation in respect of properties in the town of Estevan applies equally to those properties in the Vanguard, Shamrock and Stewart Valley subdivisions in the respondent Rural Municipality of Swift Current and, in my view, they are not exempt. The reasoning which I have applied to the Empress subdivision applies equally to the roadway of the Vanguard and Shamrock subdivisions, running south from Swift Current to Hak, then east to Archive, then north to Curie, which, while it is not a regular alternative route to the main line, is used as an emergency route when there are breakdowns in the main line. It is a branch line and is not entitled to exemption from taxation.\nI would dismiss the appeals with costs.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the plaintiff, appellant: E. H. M.

McColl-Frontenac Oil Company Limited v. Hamilton et al., [1953] 1 S.C.R. 127, distinguished.\nPer Rand and Cartwright JJ.: The document under consideration in this case had the effect that the title to the oil and gas remained in the owner subject to the incorporeal right of the \"lessee\", which right was extinguished on the termination of the lease. The rents and royalties were obviously profits and, like rent from a leasehold, were embraced in the devise. The instrument created either a profit \u00e0 prendre or an irrevocable licence to search for and to win the substances named. It was (unnecessary in this case to decide whether petroleum and natural gas in situ were to be classed as corporeal hereditaments and sold as land. Per Kellock, Locke and Nolan JJ.: While it was quite competent for an owner of land so to convey minerals lying in or under it that there-after there were two separate estates in fee, that was not the result of the instrument here in question. Reading all the terms of the \"lease\", they were quite inconsistent with any conception of a grant in fee, whether of the minerals in situ or of a profit \u00e0 prendre. The instrument was to be construed as a grant of a profit \u00e0 prendre for an uncertain term which might be brought to an end upon the happening of any of the various contingencies for which the \"lease\" provided.\nAPPEAL by the defendant Elven J. Berkheiser from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan 1, affirming the judgment of Graham J. 2, on an originating notice of motion.\nE. C. Leslie, Q.C., for the defendant, appellant.\nJ. P. Nelligan, for the defendants, respondents.\nThe judgment of Rand and Cartwright JJ. was delivered by\nRand J.:\u2014The facts in this appeal are these. By will dated May 2, 1947, a testatrix devised to the appellant a quarter-section of land in Saskatchewan; under date of December 18, 1951, with an incorporated company, she entered into what is called a \"lease\" of all petroleum and natural gas \"within, upon or under\" the quarter-section for a term of 10 years \"and so long thereafter as the leased substances or any of them are produced\" from the land; on July 9, 1953, she died. The lease called for a down payment of $320; it provided, in the event of deferred operations, for an annual acreage rental of $160, for certain royalties related to the oil and gas as they were produced, and for other matters mentioned later. Following the death of the lessor a payment of the rental was made to the executors which deferred drilling to December 18, 1954. Under a clause headed \"Surrender\", the lease was terminated by notice given after the death but before April 15, 1955, when these proceedings were launched. The respondents are the residuary beneficiaries under the will, and the substantial question raised is whether the interest of oil and gas is now vested in them or in the appellant. In the Courts below the transaction was treated as an out-and-out sale or agreement of sale of minerals in situ, the sale of a corporeal hereditament; the title to the minerals in fee simple was thereby severed from the rest of the fee; this worked an ademption of the devise to the extent of the oil, gas and royalties, and on termination the title fell into the residue. Apart from any question of the effect of a \"termination\" by notice of an estate, legal or equitable, in fee simple, or any question of a determinable fee or a fee on condition, the controversy hinges on the validity of that interpretation of the lease and it becomes necessary to examine its terms.\nThe operative words in the premises are:\nThe Lessor \u2026 doth hereby grant and lease \u2026 all the petroleum and natural gas \u2026 within, upon or under the lands \u2026 together with the exclusive right and privilege to explore, drill for, win, take, remove, store and dispose of, the leased substances and \u2026 to drill wells, lay pipe lines, and build and install such tanks, stations, structures and roadways as may be necessary \u2026.\nProvisos were stipulated, (a) in effect, that if the drilling of a well was not commenced within the second year (the first year having been carried over by the down payment) the lease should terminate unless the lessee should pay the rental which would defer the work for a further year, with, like payments for like deferred periods thereafter; (b) that if, at any time within the 10-year period and prior to discovery, a dry well or wells should have been drilled, or if after the discovery, during that term, production should cease, the lease should terminate at the next anniversary date unless operations for further drilling had been commenced or the rental paid, in which event thereafter the rental proviso would continue in force; and (c) that if at any time after the 10-year period production had ceased but the lessee had begun further work, the lease should remain in force so long as the operations were prosecuted and, if successful, so long thereafter as production continued. In any case, the time of any cesser of drilling, working or production from any cause beyond the lessee's control should not be counted against it. Royalties were provided, (1) on crude oil, of 12\u00bd per cent. of the current market value at the point of measurement; (2) on natural gas, of 12\u00bd per cent. of the current value at the point of measurement, and on gas treated in a plant, that percentage of the residual gas therefrom marketed; (3) on plant products, related to the current market-price at the plant where produced on a basis, the details of which are not material. The lessor might, in lieu of the cash royalty, on notice, take one-eighth of the oil, for collecting which the lessee would provide free of cost tanks for not more than 10 days' accumulation. The lessee agreed to drill offset wells whenever and wherever they might be required by reason of production on lands laterally adjoining the quarter-section and not owned by the lessor.\nThe language of the provision for surrender read:\nNotwithstanding anything herein contained, the Lessee may at any time or from time to time determine or surrender this Lease and the term hereby granted as to the whole or any part or parts of the leased substances and\/or the said lands, upon giving the Lessor written notice to that effect, Whereupon this Lease and the said term shall terminate as to the whole or any part or parts thereof so surrendered and the annual acreage rental shall be extinguished or proportionally reduced as the case may be, but the Lessee shall not be entitled to a refund of any such rent theretofore paid.\nIf within 90 days of notice of default given by the lessor for breach, non-observance or non-performance by the lessee of any covenant, proviso, condition, restriction or stipulation, the default was not remedied, the lease would thereupon terminate.\nWhether petroleum and natural gas in situ are to be classed as corporeal hereditaments and sold as land has been the subject of a great deal of consideration by Courts, particularly in the United States, and the application of common law conceptions to substances of such character, whose utility was little appreciated before this century, has produced a wide variance of opinion; but for the reasons following, the determination of that question here becomes unnecessary.\nA corporeal hereditament was looked upon at common law as property of a permanent and indestructible character. When land was spoken of there was in mind not only the substances of the soil but also the space in which the substances were contained. To the ownership of land applied the maxim cujus est solum, ejus est usque ad coelum. In this conception of space filled with substance there is, for the purposes of law, an indestructible base to which incorporeal rights can be related. But as stated in Challis's Real Property, 3rd ed. 1911, at p. 54, the classification of minerals\u2014and the illustration there given of coal indicates the kind of mineral in mind\u2014as corporeal hereditaments, is, in the foregoing respect, an anomaly; the use of minerals has, as its primary object, their removal from the soil and to that extent, their destruction as part of it. A fortiori would that consideration operate in respect of the fugacious minerals we are dealing with.\nWhat as a practical matter is sought by such a lessor is the undertaking of the lessee to explore for discovery and in the event of success to proceed with production to its exhaustion. Neither presence nor absence of the minerals was here known, and the initial task was to verify the existence or non-existence of the one or the other. The fugitive nature of each is now well known; a large pool of either, underlying many surface titles, may in large measure be drained off through wells sunk in one of them; tapping the reservoir against such abstraction may, then, become an urgent necessity of the owner.\nIn that situation the notion of ownership in situ is not the likely thing to be suggested to the mind of any person interested because primarily of the difficulty of the factual conception itself. The proprietary interest becomes real only when the substance is under control, when it has been piped, brought to the surface and stored. Any step or operation short of that mastery is still in the stage of capture. To the ordinary producer that course of action is compatible with the risk of discovering nothing, but an initial grant of a title to something that may prove to be non-existent can scarcely be said to be so.\nThe language of the lease confirms this. The word \"grant\" is no more significant to a fee title than to an easement or a profit \u00e0 prendre or, apparently, under the land law of Saskatchewan, an irrevocable licence to take. Indeed it is more appropriate to incorporeal than it is to corporeal rights. At common law a grant of a freehold title was ineffectual unless accompanied by livery of seisin, and, in the case of a tenement, attornment. Livery in relation to mines involves difficulties and, in later conveyancing, a transfer of minerals of an open mine appears to have been limited in practice to a bargain and sale under the statute of uses, or a lease of the surface and a release of the minerals, or by a statutory deed: Challis, op. cit., p. 58. An unopened mine has been referred to as an incorporeal hereditament, but that is considered by Challis to be an unsound view. The word \"lease\" in its ordinary meaning implies in relation to land the possession of an indestructible substance (although at common law the lessee for years held the seisin or possession for the freeholder). For oil or gas, livery would seem to be out of the question and for the reasons mentioned other modes of conveyance appropriate to a corporeal hereditament would not accord with the notion of ownership of those substances.\nThe idea suitable to the partial use of the surface of lands as a necessary means of seeking for and drawing off these fluid substances, apart from the influence by analogy of existing concepts related to different substances, is that of operations to reduce to possession something by its nature generally ready for flight, which, as embodying a property interest, is adequately symbolised by the general term incorporeal right. The word \"grant\", then, not being-significant of title and the word \"lease\" not carrying with it the possession with which it is ordinarily associated, we look to the detailed description of the acts authorized for the true intendment of the instrument and doing that here I interpret it as either a profit \u00e0 prendre or an irrevocable licence to search for and to win the substances named.\nThis view is strengthened by the provision for payment of taxes. The lessor is to pay \"all taxes, rates and assessments\" levied directly or indirectly against her by reason of her interest in production or her ownership of mineral rights, as well as those assessed against the surface of the land. On the other hand, the lessee is to pay all taxes levied in respect of the undertaking and operations and of the lessee's interest in production. The effect of this is not modified by the stipulation that the lessee shall reimburse the lessor for seven-eighths of any taxes imposed on the latter by reason of being the registered owner of the leased substances. This treats the legal title to the substances as remaining in the lessor and the interest of the lessee as analogous to that of an ordinary lessee of land, that is, as having only an interest in relation to them. Rights of this nature have long been recognized in coal and other minerals and profits. In Muskett v. Hill et al. 3, the instrument was construed to be a licence coupled with a grant and the interest of the assignee held to be assignable. Tindal C.J. quoted the following language from Thomas v. Sorrell 4:\nBut a licence to hunt in a man's park, and carry away the deer kill'd to his own use; to cut. down a tree in a man's ground, and to carry it. away the next day after to his own use, are licences as to the acts of hunting and cutting down the tree; but as to the carrying away of the. deer kill'd and tree cut down, they are grants.\nIn Wilkinson v. Proud et al. 5, the decision went on the distinction between such a right and title; in the language of Parke B.:\nThis is not a claim of a prescriptive right to take coal in the plaintiff's close, but a prescription for all the strata and seams of coal lying under it, that is, for a part of the soil itself, and not for the right to get the coal, which would be the subject of a grant.\nIn Martyn v. Williams 6, a licence was granted to the defendant \"to dig, work, and search for china clay, and to raise, get, and dispose of the same \u2026 for the term of 21 years\". The grantee covenanted, among other things, that at the expiration of the term he or his assigns would deliver up the works to the grantor in good repair. The grantor assigned and an action was brought by the assignee against the grantee on the covenant. It was held that the grant created an incorporeal hereditament, the covenants relating to which under 32 Hen. VIII, c. 34, ran with the land. Martin B., in delivering the judgment, made observations which are of special interest here:\nThese cases Woe d. Hartley v. Wood (1819), 2 B. & Ald. 724, 106 E.R. 529, and Muskett v. Hill et al., supra] establish that it is an incorporeal hereditament, a property, and an estate capable of being inherited by the heir, and assigned to a purchaser, or otherwise conveyed away. It is in truth \"a tenement\" within the definition of Lord Coke in the First Institute, 20 a., who says that the word \"tenement includeth not only corporate inheritances, but also all inheritances issuing out of them, or concerning or annexed to, or exerciseable within them, as rent, estovers, common, or other profits whatever, granted out of land.\" \u2026 The statute in express terms therefore extends to incorporeal hereditaments and tenements, and is not confined merely to lands. If, therefore, there had been an estate in fee of the right or interest created by the indenture mentioned in the declaration, and the owner in fee of the right had demised it for twenty-one years, and there had been a covenant such as that secondly declared on, we should have been of opinion, that the assignee of the reversion could have sued upon it for a breach committed in his own time. But in the present case no estate in fee in the right to take the china clay has been created. The owners of the fee simple merely granted the right for a term of years, and after the expiration of this term, the plaintiff, Who was then the owner of the land, was entitled to do all which the defendant was authorised and licensed by the indenture to do, not by virtue of the same estate which the defendant had, having reverted and continuing an existing estate, but by virtue of his ownership of and dominion over his own land; (for the owner of land exercises his right over it, not by virtue of any licences or liberties or easements, but by virtue of his ownership in which all interests of this kind merge: Greathead v. Morley, 3 M. & G. 139); and the question is, whether the conveyance or assignment of the land to the plaintiff, during the existence of the term in the incorporeal tenement, was an assignment of the reversion within the statute of 32 H. 8. We think that it was. There is in reality the relation of reversioner and ownership of particular estates between them; there is exactly the same privity of estate as exists between reversioner and tenant properly so called, and upon the determination of the term the entire interest in the land reverted to the plaintiff, as upon the expiration of an ordinary lease.\nIn Hooper et al. v. Clarke 7, an exclusive right and licence to take and kill game on certain land with the use of a cottage was similarly treated: Blackburn J. at pp. 202-3 said:\nThe first question is, this being the demise of an incorporeal hereditament, do convenants which would run with a demise of land, run with it? Martyn v. Williams [supra] decides that they do.\nTo the like effect was the decision in Lord Hastings v. North Eastern Railway Company 8, where a covenant to pay for the privilege of a way-leave on which to make and use a railway, based on a rate on the coal carried to a certain port, was held to run with the reversion.\nIn such cases the title to the substances as part of the land remains in the owner and upon it is imposed the incorporeal right which the termination of the lease, as in this case, extinguishes. As stated in Jarman on Wills, 8th ed. 1951, p. 939 (vol. 2), an immediate devise of land in fee to a person in esse, carries the rents and profits of the land from the death of the testator. The rents and royalties here are obviously profits and like rent from a leasehold, in the absence of a specific bequest of them, which, if an assignment of the lessor's interest in the lease, would require a grant of the minerals themselves, are embraced in the devise. It follows that both the right to the payment of $160 and the reversionary interest in the petroleum and gas enured to the appellant.\nThe interpretation given the instrument is not at all affected by the judgment of this Court in McColl-Frontenac Oil Company Limited v. Hamilton et al. 9. In the majority reasons written by Kellock J. at pp. 136-7, dealing with that question, he says:\nWhether the proper construction of the instrument is that, with respect to minerals, it is a grant of the minerals as land, as in Gowan's case 10, or a demise of the surface to which is super-added a profit \u00e0 prendre, the result is, in my opinion, the same.\nThe finding that the agreement was a sale of property within the Act there being examined was satisfied by the transfer of title as the oil or gas was obtained in production ; but that piecemeal sale and acquisition is the completion of the exercise of the right to win them, in contrast to the out-and-out conveyance of them in situ.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal, set aside the judgment below by declaring the petroleum and natural gas rights to be vested in the appellant and that the appellant is entitled to the sum of $160 received by the executors. The costs in this Court will be according to the terms on which leave to appeal was granted; those in the Courts below will be as directed by their judgments respectively.\nThe judgment of Kellock, Locke and Nolan JJ. was delivered by\nKellock J.:\u2014It is quite competent for an owner of land so to convey mineral lying in or under the land that thereafter two separate estates in fee exist, the one in the mineral conveyed and the other in that which is retained. The respondents contend that this is the result of the instrument here in question.\nUnder the instrument the late Esther Elizabeth Sykes (described as \"Lessor\") \"doth hereby grant and lease\" to the Canadian Devonian Petroleums Limited (described as \"Lessee\")\n\u2026 all the petroleum and natural gas and related hydrocarbons except coal and valuable stone, (hereinafter referred to as the \"leased substances\"), within, upon or under the lands hereinbefore described and all the right, title, estate and interest of the Lessor in and to the leased substances or any of them within, upon or under any lands excepted from, or roadways, lanes, rights-of-way adjoining the lands aforesaid, together with the exclusive right and privilege to explore, drill for, win, take, remove, store and dispose of, the leased substances and for the said purposes to drill wells, lay pipe lines, and build and install such tanks, stations, structures and roadways as may be necessary, and, insofar as the Lessor has the right so to grant, and for the said purposes, the right of entering upon, using and occupying the said lands or so much thereof and to such an extent as may be necessary or convenient.\nTo Have and Enjoy the same for the term of Ten (10) years from the date hereof and so long thereafter as the leased substances or any of them are produced from the said lands, subject to the sooner termination of the said term as hereinafter provided.\n(The italics are mine.)\nThe document further provides that if operations for the drilling of a well are not commenced within one year from its date the lease shall thereupon terminate unless the lessee shall have paid or tendered to the lessor $160, called \"annual acreage rental\", which payment shall \"confer the privilege\" of deferring the commencement of drilling operations for a period of one year. There may be further extensions upon \"like payments or tenders\", but, so far as this provision is concerned, the lease would terminate, at the latest, at the expiration of the 10-year term.\nIt is also provided that if at any time during the 10-year term and prior to \"discovery of production\" on the lands, the lessee should drill a dry well or wells, or if at any time during the term and after the discovery of production, such production should cease, the lease shall terminate \"at the next ensuing anniversary date\" unless drilling operations for a further well have been commenced or unless further tender of the annual acreage rental is made, in which latter event the earlier provision as to payment or tender of such rental is to be deemed to have continued in force. Again, there is nothing in this provision which, in my view, would allow the extension of the term beyond the 10-year period.\nIt is further provided, however, that if at any time after the expiration of the 10-year term the \"leased substances\" are not being produced but the lessee is then engaged in drilling or working operations on the land, the lease shall remain in force for so long as such operations are prosecuted. and for so long as any resulting production continues. Provision is also made for payment of a royalty to the lessor upon any and all production. The instrument also contains a clause that the lessee may, at any time, terminate or surrender the lease \"as to the whole or any part or parts of the leased substances and\/or the said lands\" upon written notice to the lessor to that effect. Provision is also made for termination of the lease by the lessor upon notice to the lessee of any default on its part under the instrument and failure to remedy such default within a period of 90 days from receipt of such notice.\nIn Armour on Real Property, 2nd ed. 1916, the following is stated on p. 47:\n\u2026 a grant of all the coal or other mineral in or upon certain land, is a grant of part of the land itself, and passes complete ownership in the mineral to the grantee.\nBut the learned author continues:\nBut a grant of the right to enter, search for and dig coal, and carry away as much as may be dug, is a grant of an incorporeal right to enter and dig, and passes the property in such coal only as shall be dug.\nAs stated in 11 Halsbury, 2nd ed. 1933, p. 386, s. 678:\nA profit \u00e0 prendre may be created for an estate in perpetuity analogous to an estate in fee simple, or for any less period or interest such as a term of years \u2026.\nIn the case at bar the Courts below have construed the instrument as a conveyance in fee. The basis of this view is sufficiently indicated in the following extracts from the judgment of Martin C.J.S., speaking for the Court of Appeal 11:\nAuthorities are to the effect that petroleum and natural gas leases in the form of the one under review are sales of a portion of the land with liberty to enter upon the land for the purpose of searching for and carrying away the petroleum and natural gas within, upon or under the land\u2026\nApplying these authorities the testatrix disposed of an interest in the land when she entered into the petroleum and natural gas lease and the lease was in effect at the time of her death on July 9, 1053, but came to an end on December 18, 1954. The will of the testatrix spoke from her death, namely July 9, 1953, and as the sale of the petroleum and natural gas was then in effect just as she had made it on December 18, 1951, the devise of the interest in the land consisting of petroleum and natural gas was adeemed. Where there is a specific legacy and the subject-matter does not remain the property of the testator at his death the legacy is said to be adeemed. \u2026\n\u2026 I cannot agree that the testatrix, so far as petroleum and natural gas are concerned, had anything left at the time of her death which she could dispose of. Section 19 of The Wills Act, R.S.S. 1953, ch. 120, cannot be applied because the testatrix had no estate in the petroleum and natural gas which she had \"power to dispose of by will at the time of her death.\" \u2026 I am unable to distinguish the sale of minerals\u2014an interest in land\u2014from the case where a testator in his will makes a specific devise of land but subsequently sells the land under agreement for sale.\nWhile what is referred to as a \"mining lease\" commonly amounts to a \"sale of land\", so to characterize any given instrument does not necessarily equate it with either a grant in fee simple of the mineral in place or of a profit \u00e0 prendre. For example, the grant in question in Gowan v. Christie et al. 12, was only for a term of 21 years. Nevertheless, the oft-quoted citation from the judgment of Lord Cairns, on pp. 283-4, was quite properly applicable to it. Lord Cairns was there differentiating a mineral from an agricultural lease in that the agricultural lessee, while entitled to \"fruits\", is not entitled to either a corporeal or an incorporeal interest in the lands.\nThe words of Lord Cairns were also cited in Joggins Coal Company Limited v. The Minister of National Revenue 13, but the decision of the issue there arising did not require the Court to determine anything more with respect to the instrument before the Court than that the appellant had such an interest in the mineral that it was entitled to claim a share in depletion allowance as a \"lessee\" within the meaning of. the Income War Tax Act.\nThe question which arose in McColl-Frontenac Oil Company Limited v. Hamilton, et al. 14, was whether the instrument before the Court was \"a contract for the sale of property\" within the meaning of the Alberta Dower Act. Whether the agreement was one for the sale of the mineral in place or of a profit \u00e0 prendre was immaterial. In either case the Court considered the language of the statute to apply.\nIn the case at bar it is necessary to decide whether the interest in the mineral created in favour of the grantee was of such a nature that the devise to the appellant was, pro tanto, adeemed. In my opinion, this is not so. The provisions of the instrument as analyzed above are, in my opinion, quite inconsistent with any conception of a grant in fee whether of the minerals in place or of a profit \u00e0 prendre. In my opinion, the instrument is to be construed as a grant of a profit \u00e0 prendre for an uncertain term which might be brought to an end upon the happening of any of the various contingencies for which it provides. It did not bring about that separation of the estate in the minerals from the estate in the land apart from the minerals which is the necessary basis for the operation of the doctrine of ademption.\nIn Martyn v. Williams 15, a profit \u00e0 prendre in certain minerals had been granted to the defendant for a term of years by the owner in fee, who subsequently conveyed all his estate to the plaintiff. Martin B., delivering the judgment of the Court, said, at p. 829:\nBut in the present case no estate in fee in the right to take the china clay has been created. The owners of the fee simple merely granted the right for a term of years, and after the expiration of this term, the plaintiff, who was then the owner of the land, was entitled to do all which the defendant was authorised and licensed by the indenture to do, not by virtue of the same estate which the defendant had, having reverted and continuing an existing estate, but by virtue of his ownership of and dominion over his own land; (for the owner of land exercises his right over it, not by virtue of any licences or liberties or easements, but by virtue of his ownership in which all interests of this kind merge: Great-head v. Morley, 3 M. & G. 139); and the question is, whether the conveyance or assignment of the land to the plaintiff, during the existence of the term in the incorporeal tenement, was an assignment of the reversion within the statute of 32 H. 8. We think that it was. There is in reality the relation of reversioner and ownership of particular estates between them; there is exactly the same privity of estate as exists between reversioner and tenant properly so called, and upon the determination of the term the entire interest in the land reverted to the plaintiff, as upon the expiration of an ordinary lease.\nAccordingly, upon the termination of the interest of the grantee under the lease here in question, the estate of the appellant in the lands was no longer subject to it. The doctrine of ademption does not apply. Equally the appellant is entitled to the amount paid for acreage rental by the lessee following the death of the testatrix. The appeal should, therefore, be allowed. I agree with the order as to costs proposed by my brother Rand.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitors for the defendant Elven J.

Subsection (2) of s. 83 is designed to enable the judge to \"deal with\" the matter of its newly-alleged condition only, and does not entitle him to embark upon a new inquiry as to the settlement of the child.\nAPPEAL by the Town of Lunenburg from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, in banco[1], affirming, on an equal division of the Court, the judgment of Currie J.[2], dismissing an application for a writ of certiorari. C. R. Coughlan, Q.C., and Archibald Burke, for the appellant.\nR. A. Kanigsberg, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRAND J.:\u2014The question raised in this appeal is that of the settlement of a child committed to the care and custody of a Children's Aid Society as a neglected child who, later, on an application to the Court, is found also to be a defective child.\nWhen under Part III of the Child Welfare Act, R.S.N.S. 1954, c. 30, a child is brought before a judge or magistrate for a declaration that it is a neglected child, the judge, under s. 30 (1) must, among other things, determine its place of settlement. , On the application in this case that was found to be the town of Lunenburg.\nSubsequently an application was made under s. 83 to have the child declared a defective. On that hearing the magistrate ruled that the settlement already found was binding on him and he declined to enter upon a reconsideration of it.\nMr. Coughlan's contention is that on the subsequent application the question of settlement must, by subs. (2; of s. 83, be inquired into anew and be decided in the light of the then existing circumstances. The subsection reads:\nIn the case of a defective child, or a child believed to be a defective child, who has been delivered to a Society or to the Director under Part III, the judge may hold the examination as in subsection (1)* and may deal with the case and may make any order or finding on the report of a psychiatrist and the reports of the Society or the Director without the necessity of hearing any further or other persons or evidence.\nThe new circumstance was that between the two applications the settlement of the father had changed from the town to the municipality of Lunenburg.\nIt is argued that the original finding does not establish a fixed statutory settlement; that settlement is to be determined from time to time by the appropriate law, in which case it would change with that of the parent or guardian. But it is agreed that there is nothing in the statute which permits the original finding on an application for that purpose to be reopened. . That means that, apart from the effect of s. 83, the settlement of the child so found remains fixed regardless of the residence of his parent. It is then only the accident of a further application being made under s. 83 for the declaration of defectiveness that is said to permit a new determination; and this, it is argued, is required by the language of the section.\nI- am unable to accept that contention. The purpose of s. 83 is limited to an enquiry into the alleged new condition of the child, its defectiveness, in order that the society, the guardian, may be invested with a new and extended authority in relation to its custody. Subsection (2) is designed to enable the judge to act upon the reports of a psychiatrist and the Society or Director \"without the necessity of hearing any further or other persons or evidence\". Certainly this ex facie excludes evidence on the question of settlement. That the judge \"may deal with the case\" means no more than to deal with the matter of its newly-alleged condition. The word \"examination\" harks back to the same word in line 3 of subs. (1)*, not to the requirement that the judge shall \"investigate the facts of the case and ascertain the age of the child and his settlement\". The word is used consistently throughout the section in contradistinction to \"investigate\" and in spite of the conflict of opinion in the Court below I am unable to feel any doubt upon the meaning the language was intended to bear.\nThis in substance was the view of the statute taken by Currie J. on the appeal from the magistrate and by MacQuarrie J. and MacDonald J. in the Court below, and in my opinion it is the sound view.\nThe appeal must, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: C.

The Queen, [1957] S.C.R. 403\nDate: 1957-05-13\nHoward Smith Paper Mills Limited and Others (Plaintiffs) Appellants;\nand\nHer Majesty The Queen (Defendant) Respondent.\n1956: October 29, 30, 31; 1956: November 1, 2, 5, 6, 7; 1957: May 13.\nPresent: Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Rand, Kellock, Locke, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nCriminal law\u2014Conspiracy in restraint of trade\u2014Defences\u2014Whether intended prevention or lessening of competition \u201cundue\u201d\u2014Validity of indictment\u2014Whether different offences created by the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36, s. 498(1)(d)\u2014Application and effect of the Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 26, s. 41, enacted by 1949 (2nd sess.), c. 12, s. 3, renumbered and amended by 1952, c. 39, ss. 6, 8\u2014The Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 158, s. 19.\nIt is not necessary, to support a charge under s. 498(1)(d) of the Criminal Code, 1927, that the prosecution should establish any detriment to the public from the agreement made, nor is it a defence to such a charge that the agreement resulted in public benefit, through reasonable prices and profits. The section is designed to protect free competition, and any agreement for the prevention or lessening of that competition, to an extent that is \u201cundue\u201d within the authorities, is punishable. The section proceeds on the footing that the preventing or lessening of competition is in itself an injury to the public, and is not concerned with public injury or public benefit from any other standpoint.\nAn indictment alleging that the accused conspired \u201cto unduly prevent or lessen competition in the production, manufacture, purchase, barter, sale, transportation or supply\u201d of goods is not bad for duplicity, or as charging several offences in the alternative. A single conspiracy is contemplated by s. 498(1)(d), viz., one to \u201cprevent or lessen competition\u201d, and the words following are merely means by which that competition may be prevented or lessened. For the same reason, it is not correct to strike out the words \u201cproduction\u201d and \u201cmanufacture\u201d from the conviction merely on the ground that there was no evidence of a conspiracy expressly directed to the prevention or lessening of competition in these two respects.\nSection 41 of the Combines Investigation Act, 1927, as enacted in 1949 and amended and renumbered in 1952, applies on a prosecution for a conspiracy completed before the coming into force of the 1952 amendment. The effect of the section is to render admissible in evidence written communications, described as \u201cinter-office memoranda\u201d, from one servant of an accused corporation to another even if they never left the premises of the company in whose possession or on whose premises they have been found. Such documents, when admitted, are prima facie evidence not only against the corporation in whose possession they were found but against other alleged conspirators mentioned in them. APPEAL by 22 companies and one individual from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming the conviction of the appellants and one other company by Spence J.[2] on an indictment under s. 498(1)(d) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36 (one other company and another individual, also indicted and convicted, did not appeal to the Court of Appeal), and a cross-appeal by the respondent. Appeal dismissed and cross-appeal allowed.\nLeave was granted by Cartwright J. on November 22, 1955, to appeal on the following questions of law:\n1. Did the Courts below err in holding that section 41 of the Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1952, Ch. 314 as enacted by, 1949 (Second Session) Ch. 12, section 3, and as amended by 1952, 1 Elizabeth II, Ch. 39, was applicable to this case?\n2. Did the Courts below err in law in holding that a number of documents consisting of written communications from one servant of an accused corporation to another servant of the same corporation, which documents were referred to at the trial as \u201cinter-office memoranda\u201d, were admissible in evidence against all the accused?\n3. Did the Court of Appeal for Ontario err in not holding that the indictment and\/or the conviction was void for duplicity in that it states two separate offences in the alternative under section 498(1)(d) of The Criminal Code namely the offence of agreeing to unduly lessen competition and the offence of agreeing to unduly prevent competition?\n4. Did the Court of Appeal for Ontario err in not holding that the indictment and\/or the conviction was void for duplicity in that it states in the alternative the several offences under section 498(1)(d) of agreeing as to manufacture, purchase, barter, sale, transportation or supply?\n5. Did the Court of Appeal err in law in not holding that the effect of wartime control orders, directives and requests, proven in evidence, was to constitute a break in the continuity of any alleged agreement or agreements between the accused and in not holding that the conviction was bad in law as being a conviction on one count with reference to two alleged agreements which are distinct in time?\n6. Did the Courts below err in holding that the element of \u201cundueness\u201d required by section 498(1)(d) may be proved by reference only to the scope and extent of the agreement or arrangement complained of and without proof of detriment to the public?\n7. Did the Courts below err in ruling that they were precluded from having regard to evidence tending to show public benefit, reasonableness of prices and profits, and, particularly, did the learned Trial Judge err in the ruling which he expressed (at 1954, O.R. p. 572) in the following words, \u201cIn considering the evidence adduced I am not free to find that the lessening intended was not undue on the basis of any necessity of the industry, reasonableness of prices resulting or reasonableness of profits obtained\u201d? The application for leave to appeal was opposed. Counsel for the respondent moved for leave to cross-appeal but stated that such leave was sought only if the application of the appellants should be allowed. Leave was granted to cross-appeal on the following question of law:\nDid the Court of Appeal for Ontario err as a matter of law in varying the conviction by striking out the words \u201cproduction\u201d and \u201cmanufacture\u201d?\nJoseph Sedgwick, Q.C., John J. Robinette, Q.C., Hazen Hansard, Q.C., John D. Pickup, Q.C., A. Laurendeau, Q.C., D.K. MacTavish, Q.C., and John M. Coyne, for the appellants.\nN.L. Mathews, Q.C., and B.J. MacKinnon, for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014I agree with Mr. Justice Kellock and desire merely to make a reference to the refusal by this Court of leave to appeal from the decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia in Regina v. Morrey[3]. There the accused had been found guilty of an indictment preferred under the Combines Investigation Act, but the Court of Appeal set aside the conviction. The Crown did not appeal to this Court on any dissent expressed by Mr. Justice Davey, but desired leave in order to raise a number of questions. This Court thought that, irrespective of these questions, the order made by the Court of Appeal setting aside the conviction and, if the Crown so desired, ordering a new trial could be justified on other grounds, and that if any of the points suggested by the Crown arose in the present appeal they could be dealt with when judgment was delivered. It is apparent, however, that none is involved in the present determination.\nTASCHEREAU J.:\u2014The appellants were charged under s. 498(1)(d) of the Criminal Code, as in force prior to November 1, 1952, on an indictment, the material portion of which, for the purposes of the present appeal, reads as follows:\nDuring the period from 1933 to the 31st day of October, 1952, both inclusive,...did unlawfully conspire, combine, agree or arrange together and with one another and with...[others named in the indictment] to unduly prevent, or lessen competition in the production, manufacture, purchase, barter, sale, transportation or supply of articles or commodities which may be the subject of trade or commerce, to wit, book papers including general printing and converting papers, fine papers including rag content and sulphite writing paper, coated papers, miscellaneous fine papers including blotting and bristols, groundwood printing and specialty papers containing more than 50% groundwood and other fine papers, and did thereby commit an indictable offence contrary to the provisions of the Criminal Code, section 498, subsection (1)(d).\nThe appellants were found guilty by Mr. Justice Spence, sitting without a jury, and this judgment was unanimously confirmed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario. Mr. Justice Cartwright granted leave to appeal to this Court on questions of law, and leave was also granted to cross-appeal on the following question:\nDid the Court of Appeal for Ontario err as a matter of law in varying the conviction by striking out the words \u201cproduction\u201d and \u201cmanufacture\u201d?\nThe facts are not in dispute, and as they have been summarized by my colleagues, it is unnecessary to deal with them once more.\nI agree with Kellock and Cartwright JJ. and I am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nI wish however to add a few observations concerning the necessity of showing detriment to the public, and as to the meaning of the word \u201cunduly\u201d found in s. 498(1)(d) of the old Criminal Code, under which the charge is laid.\nIt has been argued on behalf of the appellants that the offence is not complete, unless it has been established by the Crown beyond a reasonable doubt, that the agreement was detrimental to the public, in the sense that the manufacture or production was effectively lessened, limited or prevented, as a result of the agreements entered into. It has also been suggested that there is no offence, if it is shown that the acts complained of were beneficial to the public. With these submissions I entirely disagree. Conspiracy is a crime by itself, without the necessity of establishing the carrying out of an overt act. Stephen (Digest of the Criminal Law, 9th ed. 1950, p. 24), basing his opinion on Regina v. Whitchurch et al.[4], goes as far as saying:\nWhen two or more persons agree to commit any crime, they are guilty, of a misdemeanour called conspiracy whether the crime is committed or not, and though in the circumstances of the case it would be impossible to commit it. The public is entitled to the benefit of free competition, and the prohibitions of the Act cannot be evaded by good motives. Whether they be innocent and even commendable, they cannot alter the true character of the combine which the law forbids, and the wish to accomplish desirable purposes constitutes no defence and will not condone the undue restraint, which is the elimination of the free domestic markets.\nIt is my strong view that traders, manufacturers and producers cannot, as the law now stands, monopolize a substantial part of the markets of the country in given industries, to promote their own business interests, and then set themselves up as public benefactors, by saying to the Courts that the conspiracy was organized in order to achieve the stabilization of prices and production.\nI believe that the law has been clearly expressed by Mr. Justice Mignault in Stinson-Reeb Builders Supply Company et al. v. The King[5]:\nInjury to the public by the hindering or suppressing of free competition, notwithstanding any advantage which may accrue to the business interests of the members of the combine, is what brings an agreement or a combination under the ban of section 498 Cr. C.\nVide also Container Materials, Limited et al. v. The King[6] where Sir Lyman Duff, then Chief Justice, said at p. 152:\nThe enactment before us, I have no doubt, was passed for the protection of the specific public interest in free competition. That, in effect, I think, is the view expressed in Weidman v. Shragge (1912), 46 S.C.R. 1, in the judgments of the learned Chief Justice, of Mr. Justice Idington and Mr. Justice Anglin, as well as by myself. This protection is afforded by stamping with illegality agreements which, when carried into effect, prevent or lessen competition unduly and making such agreements punishable offences; and, as the enactment is aimed at protecting the public interest in free competition, it is from that point of view that the question must be considered whether or not the prevention or lessening agreed upon will be undue\u2026 That is only another way of putting what was laid down in Stinson-Reeb v. The King [supra], which, it may be added, was intended to be in conformity with the decision in Weidman v. Shragge, as indicated in the passages quoted in the judgment.\nWeidman et al. v. Shragge[7] and Rex v. Elliott[8] are also to the same effect. I have therefore reached the conclusion that this appeal should be dismissed, and I would dispose of the cross-appeal as proposed by my brother Kellock.\nThe judgment of Rand, Kellock and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by\nKELLOCK J.:\u2014As the questions submitted to this Court are questions of law, our jurisdiction being limited to such questions, the findings made by the Courts below upon the evidence are not in question. It will be convenient to deal first with questions 6 and 7.\nThe offence of which the appellants have been convicted is provided for by s. 498(1)(d) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36, which provides that:\nEvery one is guilty of an indictable offence...who conspires, combines, agrees or arranges with any other person, or with any railway, steamship, steamboat or transportation company,...\n(d) to unduly prevent or lessen competition in the production, manufacture, purchase, barter, sale, transportation or supply of any such article or commodity, or in the price of insurance upon person or property.\n\u201cSuch\u201d refers back to the earlier paragraphs in which the article or commodity is described as \u201cany article or commodity which may be a subject of trade or commerce\u201d.\nIt is contended that as the word \u201cprevent\u201d is used in s. 498(1)(d) in the sense of absolute elimination, the word \u201cunduly\u201d is meaningless unless it be interpreted as involving injury to the public. It is therefore argued that it is a defence to a charge under the section if it be shown that the agreement entered into by the accused had in view the interests of the parties or public benefit such as \u201creasonableness of prices\u201d or obviation of the \u201chardships of a depression by keeping all mills working part-time as a result of which a real public advantage is gained\u201d, to use language employed by the appellants in their factum. While \u201cprevent\u201d quite commonly is used in the above sense it is also used in the sense of \u201chinder\u201d or \u201cimpede\u201d. In the French version the word is \u201cpr\u00e9venir\u201d which also is commonly used in the sense of \u201cemp\u00eacher\u201d. In this sense the word \u201cunduly\u201d is appropriate in connection with both \u201cprevent\u201d and \u201clessen\u201d. The appellants further contend that the word \u201cunduly\u201d in the statute should be interpreted by calling in aid the provisions of the definition of \u201ccombine\u201d in the Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 26, as amended by 25-26 Geo. V. (1935), c. 54, s. 2, where it is defined for the purposes of that statute as, inter ali\u00e0, a combination which \u201chas operated or is likely to operate to the detriment or against the interests of the public whether consumers, producers or others\u201d. It is contended that if s. 498(1)(d) of the Criminal Code is to be construed without reading similar words into it \u201cparties to the same agreement might be found guilty if charged under section 498(1)(d), without proof of public detriment, while they would go free on the same evidence if charged under the Combines Investigation Act\u201d.\nI cannot accept this contention. If there is a difference between the offences described in the two statutes, Parliament has deliberately so intended. It will be seen, however, that s. 498(d) does have in view injury to the public but injury to the public of a character expressly specified by the section itself.\nIn the course of his judgment in Container Materials, Limited et al. v. The King[9], Duff C.J.C. said:\nThe second point arises from the contention of the appellants that the essence of the offence is an agreement to do something injurious to the public; that such injury to the public must appear from the evidence and must be found as a fact in order to establish a legal basis for a conviction.\nAt p. 152, the learned Chief Justice dealt with this contention as follows:\nThe enactment before us, I have no doubt, was passed for the protection of the specific public interest in free competition. That, in effect, I think, is the view expressed in Weidman v. Shragge (1912), 46 S.C.R. 1, in the judgments of the learned Chief Justice, of Mr. Justice Idington and Mr. Justice Anglin, as well as by myself. This protection is afforded by stamping with illegality agreements which, when carried into effect, prevent or lessen competition unduly and making such agreements punishable offences; and, as the enactment is aimed at protecting the public interest in free competition, it is from that point of view that the question must be considered whether or not the prevention or lessening agreed upon will be undue\u2026 That is only another way of putting what was laid down in Stinson-Reeb v. The King, [1929] S.C.R. 276, which, it may be added, was intended to be in conformity with the decision in Weidman v. Shragge, as indicated in the passages quoted in the judgment.\nThe other members of the Court who took part in the judgment expressed in other words the same principle. When it is considered that in the course of his dissenting judgment in the Court of Appeal in the above case[10] Henderson J.A. had said at pp. 195-6(D.L.R.):\nIn many of the cases the purpose or objective of the alleged conspiracy has been, per se, a crime. A very different situation arises where the purpose of the agreement is a proper one on its face and entered upon in good faith in the belief not only that it is within the legal rights of the parties, but in the case of a trade agreement, is for the good of the particular industry and the public who are concerned.\nAt p. 196:\nThe Crown accepts the view that there having been an association of manufacturers in this industry prior to 1931, and the industry being in a bad way financially, having taken heavy losses and being in danger of collapse, the object of the accused was to form an association which would stabilize the industry, put it on a sound footing and make it prosperous.\nIt is charged by the Crown that in effecting this object the accused did unduly stifle competition. No evidence is offered in support of the view that in standardizing their products the accused did any injury to the public or to their consumers. For all that appears to the contrary, one is entitled to conclude that this stabilization and standardization was all for the benefit both of the industry and of the consuming public\u2026\nAt 204:\nI do not find in this huge record\u2026 evidence to prove injury to trade and commerce. To the contrary, I find that the evidence indicates that Canadian manufacturers in this industry have, by their efforts, stabilized the industry, greatly increased its sales to the benefit of shareholders, employees and the public interest,\nit is plain that the contention now put forward by the appellants was effectively negatived by the judgment of this Court.\nAnglin J., as he then was, in Weidman et al. v. Shragge[11] had said at pp. 42-3:\n...the prime question certainly must be, does it, however advantageous or even necessary for the protection of the business interests of the parties, impose improper, inordinate, excessive, or oppressive restrictions upon that competition the benefit of which is the right of every one? The King v. Elliott, 9 C.C.C. 505, at p. 520.\nThis judgment received the approval of this Court in Stinson-Reeb Builders Supply Company v. The King[12], per Mignault J. at p. 278. At p. 280 Mignault J. said:\nInjury to the public by the hindering or suppressing of free competition, notwithstanding any advantage which may accrue to the business interests of the members of the combine, is what brings an agreement or a combination under the ban of section 498 Cr. C. It is therefore clear that the Courts below dealt with the matter before them from the proper point of view. The statute proceeds upon the footing that the preventing or lessening of competition is in itself an injury to the public. It is not concerned with public injury or public benefit from any other standpoint.\nIt was contended that the case at bar was distinguishable from all previous cases of a similar character which had reached this Court in that the agreement constituting the conspiracy was not to be found within the four corners of a written document but had to be deduced from oral evidence, correspondence, minutes and other writings. This contention is, in my opinion, untenable. It relates merely to a matter of evidentiary proof.\nThe answer to questions 6 and 7 must, therefore, be in the negative.\nWith respect to question 5, it is not necessary, in my opinion, to discuss the argument which was addressed to us in so far as that argument was founded upon matters of evidence. The essence of the argument is that although the agreement, which the Courts below have found to contravene the provisions of s. 498(1)(d), continued without break throughout the period mentioned in the indictment, and although s. 498(1)(d) remained unrepealed, the agreement ceased to come within the ban of the section during the period of the wartime controls for the reason that all possibility of competition in fine papers was eliminated by virtue of the legislation then in effect.\nIn my opinion the short answer to this contention is contained in part of the reasons for judgment of Duff C.J.C. in the Container Materials case, supra. At p. 153 the learned Chief Justice, after pointing out that the Court of Appeal had held that the aim of the parties to the agreement there in question had been to secure effective control of the market in Canada and that they had been very largely successful in effectuating that aim, went on to say: \u201cBut the fact that such was the agreement affords in point of law a sufficient basis\u201d for a finding that the section had been contravened. Assuming that during any part of the period of control the aim of the parties to the agreement could not have been successfully carried into execution, such a fact would not, in law, constitute any answer to the indictment.\nIn Regina v. Aspinall et al.[13], Brett J.A., as he then was, said, at pp. 58-9:\nNow, first, the crime of conspiracy is completely committed, if it is committed at all, the moment two or more have agreed that they will do, at once or at some future time, certain things. It is not necessary in order to complete the offence that any one thing should be done beyond the agreement. The conspirators may repent and stop, or may have no opportunity, or may be prevented, or may fail. Nevertheless the crime is complete; it was completed when they agreed.\nIn his Digest of the Criminal Law, 9th ed. 1950, Stephen J. says at p. 24:\nWhen two or more persons agree to commit any crime, they are guilty of the misdemeanour called conspiracy whether the crime is committed or not, and though in the circumstances of the case it would be impossible to commit it.\nThe authority relied on is Regina v. Whitchurch et al.[14], and, in my opinion, it fully justifies the statement in the text.\nThe appellants referred to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in England in Rex v. West et al.[15] In that case, however, the regulations in question had been amended so that in effect there were three separate offences charged. Nothing of that kind is in question here. Section 498(1)(d) remained in force throughout. The fact that the wartime controls were of a temporary nature no doubt influenced the parties to the conspiracy in continuing their agreement throughout. That the agreement did continue is sufficient in itself in point of law even had the Courts below been unable to find, as in fact they did find, that the agreement was not as ineffective during the period of the controls as the appellants contend.\nIn my opinion, therefore, question 5 must also be answered in the negative.\nWith regard to question 3, it is contended that the indictment states two separate offences in the alternative, namely, the offence of agreeing to unduly lessen competition and the offence of agreeing to unduly prevent competition. Again, with regard to question 4, the error the Court below is alleged to have fallen into is in failing to hold that the indictment was void for duplicity in that it states in the alternative the several offences under s. 498(1)(d) of agreeing as to manufacture, purchase, barter, sale, transportation or supply.\nTo return to the statutory language that everyone is guilty of an indictable offence \u201cwho conspires, combines, agrees or arranges with any other person...(d) to unduly prevent or lessen competition in the production\u201d, etc., in my opinion, upon the proper construction of these words, there is but one offence created. To adopt in part language used by Meredith J., as he then was, in Rex v. Elliott[16]:\nThe crime is in the conspiracy, not in the unlawful acts comprehended in it.\nA little later on the same page the learned judge pointed out that\nBy looking at the acts agreed to be done, instead of only at the agreement to do them, the crime is apt to be wrongly multiplied.\nAs the question involved in the cross-appeal is allied to questions 3 and 4, I propose to consider it at this point also. That question is as to whether the Court of Appeal erred in law in striking from the conviction the words \u201cmanufacture\u201d and \u201cproduction\u201d. In the course of its judgment the Court of Appeal[17] affirmed the finding of the trial judge that\nthe Mills as a group and the Merchants as a group did conspire with one another to lessen or prevent competition in the fine paper industry in Canada; the Mills at the production level, the Merchants at the wholesale level. Within that broad, over-all, all\u2011embracing agreement each group had its part to play in accomplishing their common purpose.\nThe Mills, pursuant to a common understanding between them and the Merchants, co\u2011operated with the Merchants to prevent, if possible, any inroads by others into the wholesale field in which the Merchants operated; and the Merchants in turn, pursuant to a common understanding between them and the Mills, co-operated with the Mills to prevent, if possible, any mill competition from the only source where it really existed, namely, foreign manufacturers.\n(The italics are mine.)\nThere was, of course, evidence upon which such a finding could be made. In my opinion, on the plain reading of s. 498(1)(d), the accused may be charged with conspiring \u201cto unduly prevent\u201d competition in any one or more of the modes mentioned in para. (d) depending upon the evidence to be adduced, or, similarly, \u201cto unduly lessen\u201d competition and he may also and no doubt will invariably be charged with conspiring \u201cto unduly prevent or lessen\u201d by any one or more of such means. The fact that, as in the case at bar, there was no evidence directed to the word \u201cbarter\u201d has no effect upon the result nor would it have had if that word or any of the other intended modes of carrying the conspiracy into effect had been omitted, so long as one of the statutory means was specified. The Crown could, for example, if it did not intend to adduce evidence with regard to any of the other words contained in the section, confine itself to charging a conspiracy with regard to \u201cmanufacture\u201d only.\nAccordingly, the form of the present indictment is authorized by s. 498(1)(d) and that being so, it falls within ss. 852(3) and 854 of the Criminal Code. The decision of this Court in Belyea v. The King; Weinraub v. The King[18], is authority for the view I have expressed and is unaffected by the fact that s. 1010(2) of the Criminal Code as it then stood no longer exists.\nWith regard to the question raised by the cross-appeal, it will be observed that in the extract from the reasons of Roach J.A., quoted above, the learned judge was directing his mind to the essence of the charge under s. 498(1)(d), namely, the conspiracy to prevent or lessen \u201ccompetition\u201d. Subsequently, however, when the learned judge came to deal with the question which is now the subject of the cross-appeal in this Court, he did so in the following two passages:\nI do not think that the evidence establishes that they conspired to prevent or lessen production and manufacture in Canada, but of that I shall have more to say later[19].\nAnd subsequently:\nAs earlier stated herein, I do not think that as between the two groups there was a conspiracy to lessen or prevent production or manufacture[20]. With respect, these passages appear to lose sight of the nature of the charge, namely, the conspiracy to unduly prevent or lessen \u201ccompetition\u201d in production, manufacture, etc. There is, therefore, here an error in a matter of law, namely, an erroneous construction of the statutory offence and the charge contained in the indictment, and not in the question of fact as to whether or not there existed or did not exist any evidence of conspiracy to lessen or prevent competition in production or manufacture, as to which the learned Justice of Appeal had made a contrary finding, namely, that\nthe Mills as a group and the Merchants as a group did conspire with one another to lessen or prevent competition in the fine paper industry in Canada; the Mills at the production level, the Merchants at the wholesale level. Within that broad, over-all, all\u2011embracing agreement each group had its part to play in accomplishing their common purpose[21].\nIn my opinion, this a finding that the mills and merchants together did conspire to unduly prevent or lessen competition in both production and manufacture as well as in purchase and sale. The object of the mills was to limit competition in production and manufacture to themselves as against outsiders and in this they were aided by the common agreement of the merchants. Even if the mill competition which was in view was from foreign manufacturers, the finding expressly includes this, namely, that there was a common understanding between mills and merchants \u201cto prevent, if possible, any mill competition from the only source where it really existed, namely, foreign manufacturers\u201d. In my opinion, therefore, the Court of Appeal erred in striking out the words \u201cproduction\u201d and \u201cmanufacture\u201d from the indictment.\nIt is contended on behalf of the appellants that there is no jurisdiction in this Court under the provisions of s. 1025 of the Criminal Code to entertain the cross-appeal as it is said that there was no \u201csetting aside\u201d of the conviction within the meaning of s. 1014. I cannot agree. A conviction upon a charge of conspiring to unduly prevent or lessen competition in the barter of any commodity is, to my mind, as I have already pointed out, not the same as a conviction of conspiring with respect to the preventing or lessening of competition in the purchase or sale of a commodity. Accordingly, in substituting a conviction of conspiring to unduly prevent or lessen competition in the purchase, barter, sale, transportation and supply of an article, the Court of Appeal necessarily set aside the conviction made by the trial judge, namely, that of conspiring to unduly prevent or lessen competition in the production, manufacture, purchase, barter, sale, transportation or supply of that commodity.\nWith regard to question 1, the contention of the appellants is essentially founded upon the language of subs. (2) of s. 41 of the Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 26, as enacted by 1949 (2nd sess.), c. 12, s. 3, and amended by 1952, c. 39, ss. 6 and 8. By virtue of s. 6 of the 1952 Act the former s. 39A was renumbered as s. 41.\nIt is contended for the appellants that s. 41 is not a procedural but a substantive enactment and can have no restrospective operation, and further, that the reference to s. 498 in subs. (2) is confined to s. 498 of the Criminal Code as enacted by s. 11 of the statute of 1952, which begins with the following words:\n11. Sections four hundred and ninety-eight and four hundred and ninety-eight A of the Criminal Code chapter thirty-six of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927, are repealed and the following substituted therefor:\nThe contention is that the words \u201csection four hundred and ninety-eight\u201d in subs. (2) of s. 41 refer to the s. 498 enacted by the statute of 1952 and, accordingly, that even though s. 41 is to be considered a procedural enactment, it is expressly made applicable only to prosecutions under the new s. 498. It is therefore said also that, as the prosecution here in question is in respect of the period ending with October 31, 1952, to which s. 498 of the Criminal Code as it stood on that date is the applicable section, resort cannot be had to the antecedent of s. 41, namely, s. 39A, enacted in 1949 by 13 Geo. VI, c. 12, as that section, although continued by s. 6 of the 1952 legislation as s. 41, ceased, by reason of its amendment by s. 8 of the same statute, to have any application to a prosecution under the old s. 498.\nThere is no question, in my opinion, that s. 41 is procedural in its nature and in so far as the appellants\u2019 argument is dependent upon a contrary view it cannot be supported.\nIn my opinion the Interpretation Act, now R.S.C. 1952, c. 158, affords an answer to the appellants\u2019 contention. By s. 19(1), it is provided that where any Act or enactment is repealed, then, unless the contrary intention appears, such repeal does not, save as in the section is otherwise provided,\n(d) affect any offence committed against any Act, enactment or regulation so repealed or revoked, or any penalty or forfeiture or punishment incurred in respect thereof, or\n(e) affect any...legal proceeding or remedy in respect of any such...penalty, forfeiture or punishment as aforesaid,\nand any such...penalty, forfeiture or punishment may be imposed, as if the Act...had not been repealed.\nAccordingly, regardless of any repeal of s. 498 of the Criminal Code, the liability to prosecution thereunder continued. This, of course, the appellants concede.\nIt is further provided by subs. (2) of s. 19 that\nWhere other provisions are substituted for those so repealed or revoked, then, unless the contrary intention appears,...\n(c) in the recovery or enforcement of penalties and forfeitures incurred...under the Act, enactment or regulation so repealed or revoked,...the procedure established by the substituted provisions shall be followed as far as it can be adapted.\nThis appears to be a clear enactment that s. 41, as enacted or amended by the statute of 1952, is to apply with any necessary adaptation to a prosecution under s. 498 as it stood prior to the legislation of 1952. The \u201cnecessary adaptation\u201d is, of course, to read \u201csection four hundred and ninety-eight of the Criminal Code\u201d as referring to the \u201cold section\u201d 498.\nIn my opinion also, the objection raised by the appellants which is the subject-matter of the second question is completely answered by the language of s. 41. Granted the applicability of the section to the prosecution here in question, para, (c) of subs. (2) provides that\na document proved to have been in the possession of a participant or on premises used or occupied by a participant or in the possession of an agent of a participant\nshall not only be \u201cadmitted in evidence\u201d without further proof but\nshall be prima facie evidence\u2026\n(ii) that anything recorded in or by the document as having been done, said, or agreed upon by any participant or by an agent of a participant was done, said or agreed upon as recorded and, where anything is recorded in or by the document as having been done, said or agreed upon by an agent of a participant, that it was done, said or agreed upon with the authority of the participant.\n(The italics are mine.)\nIt is, in my opinion, the plain language of this legislation that where a document of the character mentioned states, for example, that two participants agreed upon a thing, that is prima facie evidence against both notwithstanding that the statement may appear in a document which is an \u201cinter-office memorandum\u201d which never left the premises of the participant in whose possession or on whose premises (\u201cused or occupied\u201d) it was found. This subject does not lend itself to extended comment. There was, accordingly, no error on the part of either Court below in the respect raised by the second question.\nIn this view, the appellants fail, the cross-appeal succeeds and the conviction made by the learned trial judge should be restored.\nThe judgment of Locke and Cartwright JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J. [after quoting the indictment and setting out the questions on which leave to appeal and to cross-appeal was given]:\u2014The facts are set out in the reasons for judgment of the learned trial judge[22] and in those of the Court of Appeal[23], and it is not necessary to repeat them. I propose to deal with the questions in regard to which leave to appeal was granted in the order in which they are set out above.\nAs to the first question two submissions were made. It was argued, first, that s. 41 does not fall within the general rule that enactments dealing with procedure apply to bygone transactions, that the radical changes it makes in the law of evidence go beyond any mere matter of procedure, and that consequently it ought not to be given retrospective effect; and, secondly, that on the true construction of An Act to Amend the Combines Investigation Act and the Criminal Code, 1952, 1 Eliz. II, c. 39, s. 41 does not apply to breaches of s. 498 which occurred before the repeal of that section and its re-enactment, in a slightly different form, by s. 11 of the 1952 Act.\nAs to the first of these submissions, it may well be that the circumstance that a statute deals with a matter of evidence is not necessarily conclusive as to its having retrospective effect. I agree with the following observations of the learned author of Phipson on Evidence, 9th ed. 1952, p. 1:\nLaw is commonly divided into Substantive Law, which defines rights, duties and liabilities; and Adjective Law, which defines the procedure, pleading and proof by which the substantive law is applied in practice.\nThe rules of Procedure regulate the general conduct of litigation; the object of Pleading is to ascertain for the guidance of the parties and the Court the material facts in issue in each particular case; Proof is the establishment of such facts by proper legal means to the satisfaction of the Court, and in this sense includes disproof. The first-mentioned term is, however, often used to include the other two.\nIn Gardner v. Lucas et al.[24], Lord Blackburn says, at p. 603:\nNow the general rule, not merely of England and Scotland, but, I believe, of every civilized nation, is expressed in the maxim, \u201cNova constitutio futuris formam imponere debet non praeteritis\u201d\u2014prima facie, any new law that is made affects future transactions, not past ones. Nevertheless, it is quite clear that the subject-matter of an Act might be such that, though there were not any express words to shew it, it might be retrospective. For instance, I think it is perfectly settled that if the Legislature intended to frame a new procedure, that instead of proceeding in this form or that, you should proceed in another and a different way; clearly there bygone transactions are to be sued for and enforced according to the new form of procedure. Alterations in the form of procedure are always retrospective, unless there is some good reason or other why they should not be. Then, again, I think that where alterations are made in matters of evidence, certainly upon the reason of the thing, and I think upon the authorities also, those are retrospective, whether civil or criminal.\nIt will be observed that Lord Blackburn differentiates between enactments making alterations in the form of procedure and those making alterations in matters of evidence but appears to regard both as prima facie retrospective; he continues:\nBut where the effect would be to alter a transaction already entered into, where it would be to make that valid which was previously invalid\u2014to make an instrument which had no effect at all, and from which the party was at liberty to depart as long as he pleased, binding\u2014I think the prima facie construction of the Act is that it is not to be retrospective, and it would require strong reasons to shew that is not the case.\nThe very question raised in this first submission is dealt with by Casey J., giving the unanimous judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, in Eddy Match Co. Ltd. et al. v. The Queen[25], particularly at p. 13, which was followed by the learned trial judge. I am in substantial agreement with the reasons of Casey J. on this point. While s. 41 makes a revolutionary change in the law of evidence, it creates no offence, it takes away no defence, it does not render criminal any course of conduct which was not already so declared before its enactment, it does not alter the character or legal effect of any transaction already entered into; it deals with a matter of evidence only and, in my opinion, the learned trial judge was right in holding that it applied to the trial of the charge before him.\nAs to the second submission of the appellants, in regard to the effect of s. 11 of the 1952 Act, set out above, for the reasons given by my brother Kellock I agree with his conclusion that this submission must be rejected.\nIt follows that I would answer question 1 in the negative.\nAs to question 2, I am in agreement with the reasons and conclusion of my brother Kellock.\nQuestions 3 and 4 may conveniently be dealt with together. In opening his argument on these questions Mr. Robinette called attention to the fact that the very point involved appears to have been decided, adversely to his contention, by the judgment of this Court in Belyea v. The King; Weinraub v. The King[26], particularly at pp. 281-2; but he argued that the judgment of this Court in Archer v. The Queen[27] is inconsistent with that in Belyea v. The King and that we are free to examine the matter de novo. The question raised in the Archer case was as to the validity of a conviction in proceedings under The Summary Convictions Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 379. This Court was unanimously of opinion that a conviction on an information charging two offences in the alternative was invalid and that the defect was not cured by s. 723 or s. 725 of the 1927 Criminal Code. The governing principle is stated by my brother Locke at p. 40, quoting from the judgment of Avory J. in Rex v. Surrey Justices; Ex parte Witherick[28]:\nIt is an elementary principle that an information must not charge offences in the alternative, since the defendant cannot then know with precision with what he is charged and of what he is convicted and may be prevented on a future occasion from pleading autrefois convict.\nThat this principle, except in so far as it may have been modified by statute, is equally applicable to a count in an indictment does not appear to me to admit of doubt. It is so decided in many cases and it is sufficient to refer to the statement of Humphreys J. giving the unanimous judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Rex v. West et al[29]:\n...it is elementary law that no more than one offence may be charged in any one count of an indictment.\nI can find nothing in the judgments of this Court or of the Court of Appeal in the Belyea case to indicate that those Courts decided whether the fifth count in the indictment, which is set out in the report of the trial judgment[30], and was in substance identical with that in the case at bar, charged only one offence or charged in the alternative more offences than one; although there is a sentence in the judgment of the trial judge, Wright J., which suggests that he assumed for the purposes of his decision that the count contained charges of separate offences. That learned judge said, at p. 205:\nI do not think the fact that the offences were stated in the alternative, under the particular circumstances of this case, leaves the indictment open to be quashed.\nAs at present advised, I do not think that the judgment of this Court in the Belyea case requires us to hold that more offences than one can validly be charged in a single count whether in the alternative or otherwise and I desire to reserve my opinion on that question until it becomes necessary to decide it. The reason that I do not find it necessary to pursue the matter further is that I agree with the conclusion reached by my brother Kellock and by Roach J.A., that the indictment in the case at bar charges only one offence, a single conspiracy. I would accordingly answer questions 3 and 4 in the negative.\nAs to question 5, I agree with the reasons and conclusion of my brother Kellock.\nQuestions 6 and 7 may conveniently be dealt with together as the answers to them depend upon the interpretation of s. 498(1)(d) of the Criminal Code.\nIn approaching these questions it is convenient to consider first how they were dealt with in the Courts below. We must proceed upon the facts as found in those Courts. These are summarized in the following passages in the reasons of Roach J.A.[31]:\nOn all the evidence, the trial judge made specific findings of fact as follows:\n1. \u201c...that well before the year 1933 these seven accused companies [the Mills] and the J.R. Booth company had entered into a firm agreement to control and fix prices and deal with many other elements. and that agreement has continued from then until the end of the period charged in the indictment, the 31st October 1952\u201d. (O.R., p. 579.) (I should perhaps here state that the E.B. Eddy Company leased the assets of J.R. Booth Company on 1st January 1945 and purchased those assets, except certain Crown leases and water-rights, in April 1946.)\n2. \u201c...with the exception of some very unimportant merchants\u2026these accused merchants controlled all of the wholesale trade in fine paper in Ontario and Quebec. The co\u2011conspirator merchants occupied a similar position in the remainder of Canada, and the accused merchants and co-conspirator merchants through their membership in the Canadian Paper Trade Association engaged actively in agreeing amongst themselves as to the complete and absolute control of the wholesale paper trade in the Dominion of Canada.\u201d (O.R., p. 580.) 3. That the two groups came together through the agency of the Mills Relation Committee of the Merchants; \u201cthat the merchants and the mills on many occasions did make agreements and that those agreements were merely supplementary to and carrying out the main mill-merchant agreement to lessen competition in fine paper throughout the whole of Canada (O.R., p. 585); that the accused corporations [both Mills and Merchants] and Mr. Turgeon, were parties to the main agreement lessening competition, and that the accused Moffitt aided and abetted the original creation of that agreement and was, if anything, the most effective agent\u2014so far as the merchants were concerned\u2014in carrying out the agreement\u2026\u201d\n* * *\nIn my opinion the learned trial judge was right in holding that the Mills as a group and the Merchants as a group did conspire with one another to lessen or prevent competition in the fine paper industry in Canada; the Mills at the production level, the Merchants at the wholesale level. Within that broad, over-all, all-embracing agreement each group had its part to play in accomplishing their common purpose.\nThe Mills, pursuant to a common understanding between them and the Merchants, co\u2011operated with the Merchants to prevent, if possible, any inroads by others into the wholesale field in which the Merchants operated; and the Merchants in turn, pursuant to a common understanding between them and the Mills, co-operated with the Mills to prevent, if possible, any mill competition from the only source where it really existed, namely, foreign manufacturers.\nAt p. 733, Roach J.A. concludes that, on the evidence as to what happened in the case at bar, \u201cthe consumer or whoever buys from the wholesaler does not get the benefit of any competition at either the manufacturing or the wholesale level\u201d.\nThe learned trial judge having rightly held that the interpretation of s. 498(1)(d) and particularly of the word \u201cunduly\u201d is a matter of law proceeds to a careful review of most of the decisions of the Courts of this country which deal with the meaning of the section and, while he does not, in any one passage, formulate a positive interpretation of the clause, he reaches the conclusion which he expresses as follows[32]:\nTherefore I have come to the conclusion that in determining whether an agreement had as its object to lessen competition unduly, I must be guided by the interpretation of that adverb assigned in the decisions of the Courts to which I have referred, and in considering the evidence adduced I am not free to find that the lessening intended was not undue on the basis of any necessity of the industry, reasonableness of prices resulting or reasonableness of profits obtained. As to the meaning of the word \u201cunduly\u201d, the views expressed by Roach J.A. do not appear to me to differ in any matter of substance from those expressed by the learned trial judge. The learned Justice of Appeal deals with the matter as follows[33]:\nAs to what is meant by \u201cunduly\u201d, we can start with the decision of this Court in Rex v. Elliott (1905), 9 O.L.R. 648 at 657... Osler J.A. delivering the judgment of this Court said that competition is lessened or prevented \u201cunduly\u201d if it is lessened or prevented \u201cin an undue manner or degree, wrongly, improperly, excessively, inordinately\u201d.\nIn Weidman et al. v. Shragge (1912), 46 S.C.R. 1 at 37...Duff J., as he then was, said: \u201c... I have no hesitation in holding that as a rule an agreement having for one of its direct and governing objects the establishment of a virtual monopoly in the trade in an important article of commerce throughout a considerable extent of territory by suppressing competition in that trade, comes under the ban of the enactment\u201d.\nIn the same case at p. 42, Anglin J., as he then was, said: \u201c...the prime question certainly must be, does it, however advantageous or even necessary for the protection of the business interests of the parties, impose improper, inordinate, excessive, or oppressive restrictions upon that competition the benefit of which is the right of every one\u201d.\nWhat Duff J. and Anglin J. there said was quoted with approval later in Stinson-Reeb Builders Supply Company et al. v. The King, [1929] S.C.R. 276...\nIn Rex v. Container Materials Ltd. et al., 76 C.C.C 18 at 43...Robertson C.J.O. said: \u201cCompetition from which everything that makes for success is eliminated except salesmanship is not the free competition that s. 498 is mainly designed to protect\u201d.\nIn the same case in the Supreme Court of Canada, sub nom. Container Materials, Limited et al. v. The King, [1942] S.C.R. 147...Kerwin J., as he then was, with whom Hudson and Taschereau JJ. concurred, having first referred to the Stinson-Reeb case and Weidman et al. v. Shragge, continued: \u201cUnder the decision of the Stinson-Reeb case, the public is entitled to the benefit of free competition except in so far as it may be interfered with by valid legislation, and any party to an arrangement, the direct object of which is to impose improper, inordinate, excessive or oppressive restrictions upon that competition, is guilty of an offence,...the matter must be looked at in each case as a question of fact to be determined by the tribunal of fact upon a common sense view as to the direct object of the arrangement complained of\u201d.\nThe defence introduced evidence which was intended to show that the prices charged by the Mills were reasonable having regard to the necessities of the Mills. Such evidence, in my opinion, is no answer to a charge laid under s. 498 for the reason stated by Anglin J. in Weidman et al. v. Shragge, supra.\nApplying the test laid down in the cases to which I have referred the agreement between the two groups was one to lessen or prevent competition unduly. In the last sentence in this passage Roach J.A. appears to regard the decisions from which he has quoted as laying down a single test for he speaks of \u201cthe test laid down\u201d. I must confess that I have found difficulty in discerning just what that test is. As was pointed out by Anglin J., in Weidman et al. v. Shragge, supra, at p. 41, the conclusion is inescapable that Parliament contemplated that there may be agreements to prevent or lessen competition which do not fall within the prohibition of s. 498(1)(d); the intended prevention or lessening must be \u201cundue\u201d to render the agreement criminal. \u201cUndue\u201d and \u201cunduly\u201d are not absolute terms whose meaning is self-evident. Their use presupposes the existence of a rule or standard defining what is \u201cdue\u201d. Their interpretation does not appear to me to be assisted by substituting the adjectives \u201cimproper\u201d, \u201cinordinate\u201d, \u201cexcessive\u201d, \u201coppressive\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d, or the corresponding adverbs, in the absence of a statement as to what, in this connection, is proper, ordinate, permissible or right.\nThe conclusion of the learned trial judge in the case at bar, affirmed by the Court of Appeal, appears to me to be that because the purpose and effect of the agreement of the appellants was the virtual elimination or prevention of all competition which would otherwise have entered into wholesale dealings in the products in question in Canada, the object of the agreement is necessarily \u201cundue\u201d, and the making of it is criminal, even although it be affirmatively proved (a) that the prevention of competition intended to be brought about, and in fact brought about, was no more than was necessary to permit the industry to develop and survive in Canada, (b) that the participants derived only reasonable profits, and (c) that the prices charged to the purchasers of the products were at all times reasonable. I do not intend to imply that I regard these three matters as having been proved; the question of law is whether the Courts below were right in holding that, if proved, they would afford no answer to the charge, and in treating the evidence tendered to prove them as irrelevant. Had the matter been one with which we were called upon to deal unaided by earlier decisions which are binding upon us, I would have found this conclusion a surprising one. As was said by my brother Rand in Re The Farm Products Marketing Act[34]:\nThe provisions of the Combines Investigation Act and the Criminal Code envisage voluntary combinations or agreements by individuals against the public interest that violate their prohibitions.\nA similar view was expressed by Lord Atkin in Proprietary Articles Trade Association et al. v. Attorney-General for Canada et al.[35]\nHad the three matters mentioned above, which the learned trial judge regarded as irreleveant, been proved, I would have found it difficult to regard the agreement as being in either intention or operation \u201cagainst the public interest\u201d. But the matter is not res integra; and, in my view, the learned judges in the Courts below are right in interpreting the decisions to which they refer as supporting the conviction of the appellants on the findings of fact which are summarized in the passages quoted above from the reasons of Roach J.A.\nIn essence the decisions referred to appear to me to hold that an agreement to prevent or lessen competition in commercial activites of the sort described in the section becomes criminal when the prevention or lessening agreed upon reaches the point at which the participants in the agreement become free to carry on those activities virtually unaffected by the influence of competition, which influence Parliament is taken to regard as an indispensable protection of the public interest; that it is the arrogation to the members of the combination of the power to carry on their activities without competition which is rendered unlawful; that the question whether the power so obtained is in fact misused is treated as irrelevant; and that the Court, except I suppose on the question of sentence, is neither required nor permitted to inquire whether in the particular case the intended and actual results of the agreement have in fact benefited or harmed the public, In other words, once it is established that there is an agreement to carry the prevention or lessening of competition to the point mentioned, injury to the public interest is conclusively presumed, and the parties to the agreement are liable to be convicted of the offence described in s. 498(1)(d). The relevant question thus becomes the extent to which the prevention and limitation of competition are agreed to be carried and not the economic effect of the carrying out of the agreement. In each case which arises under the section the question whether the point described has been reached becomes one of fact.\nIn the case at bar, accepting the interpretation of s. 498(1)(d) set out above, to which I think the authorities bind us, the agreement made by the appellants appears to me, on the facts as found, to fall within the terms of the section.\nI conclude that questions 6 and 7 must be answered in the negative.\nNothing would be gained by my attempting to form an opinion as to whether the state of the law, brought about by the interpretation of the section to which I think we are bound, is a desirable one. If it should be that in construing the word \u201cunduly\u201d the Courts have failed to discern the true intention of Parliament it is, under the principle of stare decisis, too late for us to reopen the question, and the remedy, if one is required, lies in the hands of Parliament.\nIt follows from what I have said above that, in my opinion, the appeals should be dismissed.\nIn view of the dismissal of the appeals, the cross-appeal ceases to have any great importance. Having concluded for the reasons given above in dealing with questions 3 and 4 that the indictment, following as it does the words of s. 498(1)(d), charges only one offence, although it describes alternative modes of committing it, I am of opinion that the amendment of the conviction ordered by the Court of Appeal was not necessary and I concur in the disposition of the cross-appeal proposed by my brother Kellock.\nAppeals dismissed; cross-appeal allowed.\nAgents for the appellants\u2019 solicitors: Gowling, MacTavish, Osborne & Henderson, Ottawa.\nSolicitor for the respondent: F.P.

Firth (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nThe Western Life Assurance Company (Defendant) Respondent.\n1957: February 12, 13; 1957: May 13.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nInsurance\u2014Life\u2014Non-payment of renewal premium\u2014Days of grace\u2014Due date of premium falling on non-juridical day\u2014The Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 183, s. 146.\nA term policy of life insurance provided for payment of renewal premiums on April 13 in each year. April 13, 1952, was Easter Sunday and the following day, April 14, was a holiday. The insured died on May 14, the renewal premium for that year being then unpaid. The insurer repudiated liability under the policy on the ground that it had lapsed because of non\u2011payment of the renewal premium by May 13. The beneficiary contended that the death occurred within the days of grace allowed under the policy and under s. 146 of The Insurance Act.\nHeld (Rand and Cartwright JJ. dissenting): The action must fail. The \u201cdue date\u201d of the premium was April 13, and this was not affected by the fact that it was a Sunday. The days of grace ran from \u201cthe day on which the premium is due\u201d and therefore expired on May 13.\nPer Rand and Cartwright JJ., dissenting: The insurer could not legally have accepted payment of the premium on April 13 by reason of the provisions of the Lord\u2019s Day Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 171, particularly ss. 4 and 14. Had the policy contained no provision for a period of grace, the premium could have been paid as of right on April 14. It followed from this that the words \u201cthe day on which the premium is due\u201d in s. 146(1) of The Insurance Act meant April 14 and not April 13. The days of grace had therefore not expired when the insured died.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario (1) dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Spence J. (2). Appeal dismissed. T. Sheard, Q.C., and W.H. Powell, Q.C., for the appellant.\nC.F.H. Carson, Q.C., and J.B.S. Southey, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Taschereau and Abbott JJ. was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014This is an action on a term policy of insurance, dated April 13, 1951 (ex. 1), issued by the respondent on the application of Meridian Timber Co. Ltd. on the life of James G. White for a five-year period from its date. The appellant sues as assignee of the timber company. While a policy bearing the same date had been issued earlier it was found to be incorrect and there is, in my opinion, no doubt that the appellant must rest his case on the terms of ex. 1. The details in connection with both policies were explained to us and are set forth in the reasons for judgment of the trial judge[1] and of the Court of Appeal[2]. We are relieved from considering the claim (first advanced in the Court of Appeal) for rectification of the policy by substituting April 30 as being the date for payment of renewal premiums instead of April 13, since on the argument Mr. Sheard stated that he abandoned any such contention. The problem may therefore be viewed without regard to any of the attendant circumstances except those now mentioned.\nThe policy is dated April 13, 1951, and was made in consideration of the annual premium of $1,092 to be paid in advance to the respondent on the delivery of the policy and of the payment thereafter of a like amount on each succeeding 13th day of April in every year during the continuance of the contract. The first premium was paid on or about April 30, 1951. The insured died May 14, 1952, and after the receipt of information of that occurrence the appellant, with his solicitor, attended at the offices of the respondent about 7 o\u2019clock on the evening of that day with a certified cheque in favour of the respondent for $1,092. The offices were, of course, closed, but a letter, with the cheque, was put under the door, or in a letterbox, of the building in which the respondent\u2019s offices are located. This cheque was returned the following day with a letter, pointing out that the policy had lapsed prior to the receipt of payment.\nApril 13, 1952, was Easter Sunday and the appellant contends that, apart from any question of grace, he was entitled to pay the second premium on April 15, because of the 14th being Easter Monday.\nSection 146 of The Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 183, deals with days of grace and is as follows:\n146. (1) Where any premium, not being the initial premium, under any contract is unpaid, the insured, his assign or agent, or any beneficiary, may, within a period of grace of thirty days or, in the case of an industrial contract, four weeks from and excluding the day on which the premium is due, pay, deliver or tender to the insurer at its head office, or at its chief agency in the Province, or to its collector or authorized agent, the sum in default.\n(2) The payment may be made by sending a post office order or postal note, or a cheque payable at par and certified by a bank doing business in Canada under The Bank Act (Canada), or a draft of such bank, or a money order of an express company doing business in the Province, in a registered letter duly addressed to the insurer, and the payment, delivery or tender shall be deemed to have been made at the time of the delivery and registration of the letter at any post office.\n(3) Payment, delivery or tender as aforesaid shall have the same effect as if made at the due date of the premium.\n(4) The period of grace hereinbefore in this section mentioned shall run concurrently with the period of grace, if any, allowed by the contract for the payment of a premium or of an instalment of premium.\n(5) Upon the maturity of the contract during the period of grace and before the overdue premium is paid, the contract shall be deemed to be in as full force and effect as if the premium had been paid at its due date, but the amount of such premium with interest, not in excess of six per cent per annum, and the balance, if any, of the current year\u2019s premium, may be deducted from the insurance money.\n(6) Nothing in this section shall deprive the insured of the benefit of any period of grace allowed by the contract in excess of the period of grace allowed by this section.\nThe terms of the policy with reference to this question read:\nGRACE.\u2014In the payment of all renewal premiums hereunder, a grace of one month (of not less than 30 days) will be allowed from the actual due date of the premium herein stated. During the period of grace the Policy shall continue in force, but in the event of the Policy becoming a claim during the said period of grace, and before the overdue premium or deferred premiums, if any, of the current Policy year are paid, the amount of such premiums will in settlement of the claim be deducted from the sum insured. The appellant argues that under subs. (1) of s. 146 of The Insurance Act it cannot be said that the premium was \u201cdue\u201d on Sunday, April 13, 1952, because the respondent, being a company engaged in the insurance business, was prohibited from carrying on that business on the Lord\u2019s Day and that, in any event, the offices were closed. It is also contended that it could not be said that the premium was \u201cthe sum in default\u201d if it was not paid before Sunday, April 13. In my view, the subsection is quite clear and is not capable of that construction. All it provides for is a period of grace of 30 days and in the circumstances the dates fixed by the Act and by the policy are the same. Therefore, on Sunday, April 13, 1952, the second premium was unpaid. With respect to other views, it is beside the point to consider a case where a statute or the contract did not provide for a period of grace and the last day for paying a premium happened to expire on a Sunday, because we are not concerned with that problem and I find no assistance in Landrigan v. Missouri State Life Ins. Co.[3] or in general statements that days of grace are days allowed for making a payment after the time limited has expired. I agree with the Court of Appeal that, in this connection, there is no difficulty in the construction of subs. (1) of s. 146 of The Insurance Act.\nThe appellant then contends that, even if the above be the result under the Act, the grace provisions in the policy enlarged the rights of the appellant and that some meaning must be given to the word \u201cactual\u201d in the phrase \u201ca grace of one month (of not less than 30 days) will be allowed from the actual due date of the premium herein stated\u201d. Again, with respect, I have no difficulty in deciding that this word had not the effect of making April 14, 1952, the due date from which the period of grace is to be counted. It was so held by the Supreme Court of Texas in Aetna Life Ins. Co. of Hartford v. Wimberly[4] and, even if that case may be distinguished, as suggested by the appellant, I would have come to the same conclusion in the present appeal.\nThe second contention of the appellant is that even if the grace period began to run on April 14, 1952, the policy when properly interpreted gave 31 days of grace. I can find no substance in this argument. I agree with the Chief Justice of Ontario that the appellant was not entitled to a period of grace in excess of either one month or 30 days, whichever was the greater.\nFinally, I can find no ambiguity in the policy that would give rise to the application of the maxim contra proferentem. It is stated that this would be in direct conflict with the provisions of the policy stating that the premium is to be an annual one. Of course it is annual but the date for its payment was distinctly stated in the policy and the premium was not paid within the days of grace allowed. As to the so-called rule in McMaster v. New York Life Insurance Company[5], it is sufficient to say that the extent of its application has been canvassed in the Courts of the United States in later cases and has been considered in The Provident Savings Life Assurance Society of New York v. Mowat et al.[6] In my opinion, the policy is clear and under its terms the payment of the second annual premium, whether made on May 14 or May 15, 1952, was too late.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Rand and Cartwright JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[7] affirming a judgment of Spence J.[8] by which the appellant\u2019s action was dismissed. The relevant facts are fully stated in the reasons for judgment of the learned trial judge, and a brief summary will be sufficient to make clear the reasons for the conclusion at which I have arrived.\nThe action was brought on a policy issued by the respondent on the life of one James G. White, which was filed as ex. 1 at the trial. In the view that I take of the matter, the fact that this policy was issued in substitution for one which had been prepared and delivered earlier becomes irrelevant. It is conceded that, if the policy was still in force at the time of the death of White, the appellant is the person to whom the insurance moneys are payable. The policy is dated April 13, 1951; by its terms the respondent agrees to pay $100,000 immediately upon receipt and approval of proofs of the death of White, during the continuance of the contract, provided that his death occurs before April 13, 1956. The policy reads in part as follows:\nTHIS CONTRACT is made in consideration of the Application for this Policy, a copy of which is hereto attached, and of the statements and agreements therein contained, hereby made a part of this contract, and of the annual premium of One Thousand and Ninety-Two Dollars to be paid in advance to the Company, on the delivery of this Policy, and of the payment thereafter of a like amount on each succeeding Thirteenth day of April in every year during the continuance of this contract.\n* * *\nGRACE.\u2014In the payment of all renewal premiums hereunder, a grace of one month (of not less than 30 days) will be allowed from the actual due date of the premium herein stated. During the period of grace the Policy shall continue in force, but in the event of the Policy becoming a claim during the said period of grace, and before the overdue premium or deferred premiums, if any, of the current Policy year are paid, the amount of such premiums will in settlement of the claim be deducted from the sum insured.\nIt is common ground that the first premium of $1,092 was paid on or about April 30, 1951 and that no further premium was paid or tendered during the life of White. White died on May 14, 1952. The sole defence is that at the time of White\u2019s death the policy had lapsed for non\u2011payment of the annual premium claimed by the respondent to have been due on April 13, 1952. The last-mentioned date was a Sunday.\nI find it necessary to deal with only one of the grounds relied upon in support of the appeal. Counsel for the appellant contends that, under s. 146(1) of The Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 183, May 14 was the last day of the period of grace and consequently, by virtue of subs. (5) of the same section, the policy was in full force and effect when White died on that day. Whether or not this contention is sound depends on the construction of the words of the section. Counsel were unable to refer us to any decisions in which the precise point has arisen and I have found none. Section 146 reads in part as follows:\n146. (1) Where any premium, not being the initial premium, under any contract is unpaid, the insured, his assign or agent, or any beneficiary, may, within a period of grace of thirty days\u2026from and excluding the day on which the premium is due, pay, deliver or tender to the insurer at its head office, or at its chief agency in the Province, or to its collector or authorized agent, the sum in default.\n* * *\n(3) Payment, delivery or tender as aforesaid shall have the same effect as if made at the due date of the premium.\n(4) The period of grace hereinbefore in this section mentioned shall run concurrently with the period of grace, if any, allowed by the contract for the payment of a premium or of an instalment of premium.\n(5) Upon the maturity of the contract during the period of grace and before the overdue premium is paid, the contract shall be deemed to be in as full force and effect as if the premium had been paid at its due date, but the amount of such premium with interest, not in excess of six per cent per annum, and the balance, if any, of the current year\u2019s premium, may be deducted from the insurance money.\n(6) Nothing in this section shall deprive the insured of the benefit of any period of grace allowed by the contract in excess of the period of grace allowed by this section.\nIn 1952, April 13, the date stated in the policy for the payment of the second annual premium, fell on a Sunday. By reason of the provisions of the Lord\u2019s Day Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 171, particularly ss. 4 and 14, it would have been unlawful for the respondent to receive payment of the premium on that day, and its office was in fact closed. In these circumstances the cases cited by Mr. Sheard make it clear that, had the policy contained no provision for a period of grace, the insured or beneficiary would have been entitled as a matter of right to pay the premium on April 14. In my opinion, it follows from this that when applied to the circumstances of this case the words in subs. (1) \u201cthe day on which the premium is due\u201d mean April 14 and not April 13. The matter may be tested by supposing that the premium had in fact been paid on April 14. How, if this had happened, could it have been said to be \u201cthe sum in default\u201d, the words with which subs. (1) concludes? A party who pays a sum on the day on which he is by law entitled to pay it cannot be said to be in default. How could April 14 be properly described as a day of grace when if payment were made on that day it would be made as a matter of right and not of indulgence? As is pointed out by Daues J. giving the judgment of the Court in Landrigan v. Missouri State Life Ins. Co.[9], the term \u201cgrace\u201d is used in contradistinction to \u201cright\u201d. I find convincing the reasoning in the following passage in the judgment in that case, at p. 387:\nThe days of grace cannot begin at a time when the policy is alive and in force under the paid premium, but begins only when the policy has run its limit under the paid premium, and runs as days of grace above and beyond the time during which the policy was in force under the premium. The insured had insurance as a matter of right under the premium until September 17, 1918, and during the period that he had insurance as a matter of right he could not be given insurance as a matter of grace, for grace is used in contradistinction to right. Thirty-one days of grace was a time of indulgence granted, and it was not an indulgence until after the expiration of the insurance as a matter of right.\nThe following definition in Byrne\u2019s Law Dictionary (1923) p. 277 is, in my opinion, accurate:\nDays of grace are days allowed for making a payment or doing some other act after the time limited for that purpose has expired.\nIt would be anomalous to reckon as part of a period of grace allowed to a party a day upon which no grace was required.\nI find some further support for the view I have expressed in the fact that in subs. (1) the Legislature has used the word \u201cday\u201d rather than the word \u201cdate\u201d which is used in subs. (3) and in subs. (5).\nHaving concluded that April 14, 1952 was \u201cthe day on which the premium is due\u201d it follows that the period of \u201cthirty days from and excluding\u201d that day would include May 14, 1952, the day on which the life insured died. Consequently, the contract matured during the period of grace, the rights of the parties are governed by subs. (5), and the appellant is entitled to judgment for the sum of $100,000 less $1,092, that is $98,908, with interest at 5 per cent. from the date of the receipt by the respondent of proofs of the death of the life insured. If the parties are unable to agree as to the date from which interest should be computed the matter may be spoken to.\nI would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment in the Courts below and direct that judgment be entered for the appellant for $98,908 with interest as above set out. The appellant is entitled to his costs throughout.

A complaint was made to the executive board of the local and he was notified that an inquiry would be held and that, in the meantime, he was suspended. A letter was immediately written informing the plaintiff's employer that he had been temporarily suspended, whereupon he was discharged from his employment. An inquiry was thereafter held by the executive board, following which the board found the plaintiff guilty and in effect expelled him. A meeting of the union was called to consider the finding of the executive committee but no vote was taken. The plaintiff sued for damages claiming against the defendants both personally and as representing all other members of the local.\nHeld: The plaintiff was entitled to a declaration that he was still a member of the local because, under the constitution of the local and international unions, the action of the executive board required confirmation by the local and remained conditional until it received that confirmation. There was no authority whatever for a \"temporary suspension\" before the inquiry by the executive board. The plaintiff was also entitled to damages against the defendants in their personal but not in their representative capacity.\nPer Rand, Cartwright and Abbott JJ.: The rights of a member of a trade union are based upon contract and not upon status. The contract is with all other members of the union and not with the union as such. The union has no capacity to contract with a member and it follows a fortiori that a union as such cannot incur liability in tort. The acts of the defendants were clearly ultra vires, the original \"temporary\" suspension having been without a semblance of authority. The members of the executive board were individually responsible for those acts.\nPer Locke and Nolan JJ.: The statements made to the respondent's employer that he had been suspended by the union and that he had ceased to be a member were both false and were found to have been made maliciously with intent to injure him. Damage having resulted the individual members of the board were personally liable to the respondent in tort.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba 1 affirming the judgment of Williams C.J.Q.B. 2.\nH. G. H. Smith, Q.C., and C. L. Dubin, Q.C., for the appellants.\nL. St. G. Stubbs, Q.C., and Gerald Stubbs, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Rand, Cartwright and Abbott JJ. was delivered by\nRand J.:\u2014The appellants are a trade union and certain of its officers. The latter, as members of the executive board, and the union, as represented by them, are charged by the respondent, Tunney, with wrongfully purporting to suspend and expel him from membership and with wrongfully causing his employment to be terminated by an employer bound by a union shop agreement. A union shop is one in which an employee must as a condition of his employment be or become and continue to be a union member.\nA defence in limine is that the respondent, by the constitution and by-laws of the union to which he subscribed, is bound to exhaust the procedure of appeal to the tribunals of the union including those of the international organization with which the local union is affiliated, an appeal which admittedly he did not prosecute, and because of which, under the decision in White et al. v. Kuzych 3, it is said that the action is premature: and this must first be dealt with.\nSeveral answers are given: that no charge in writing as required by the regulations of the union was made and none furnished the respondent; that the executive board was not legally constituted; that the hearing was unfairly conducted; that the right of appeal to the general executive of the international union at Miami, Florida, was illusory and a virtual denial of the respondent's rights; and that by the regulations of the local union the finding of the executive board was subject to confirmation by a general meeting of the union, which it did not receive.\nI find it unnecessary to pass upon more than the last ground. Section 33 of the constitution and by-laws of the local union provides in part that\nThe Executive Board shall try all members against whom charges have been preferred, and report the findings at the next regular meeting of the union.\nand s. 45:\nAll decisions of the Executive Board shall be concurred in at a regular meeting of the union before becoming effective. The accused shall have the right to appeal to the General Executive Board.\nThe respondent was alleged to have made false statements to other members reflecting upon the manner in which the affairs of the union involving, among other things, financial features, had been conducted by the secretary-treasurer, the appellant Houle. Apparently a complaint had been made orally either to the president or to the executive board by Houle the gist of which was conveyed to the respondent by a letter notifying him that an inquiry would be held, and that in the meantime he was suspended. With the approval of the executive board and a vice-president of the international body, notice was at once sent by Houle to the employer of the respondent to the effect that he had been temporarily suspended from the union and, under the labour agreement, could not, during the suspension, be continued in the service. The employer thereupon notified him of that communication, paid him a week's wages in advance and ended his employment.\nAt the inquiry witnesses were called, three by Houle and two on behalf of the respondent; on the evidence given at the trial the statements made were, in substance, by one witness that the respondent had made remarks to him of the nature charged, and by the other four that no such remarks had been made to them. On this the board found Tunney guilty and, in the language of the minute, he was \"suspended from all rights, benefits and privileges\", language which it is accepted was intended to effect expulsion.\nShortly after this was announced and on the written request of a number of members a meeting of the union was convened for the purpose of considering the charges and \"the findings thereon at the trial thereof\". Tunney was excluded from the meeting and after a disorderly session during which it seems to have become apparent that an approval of the board's action was doubtful, the meeting ended without a vote being taken and the matter was given no further consideration. At this meeting, as well as on the inquiry and at another session of the executive board, the dominating as well as the domineering role of Houle was made plainly evident.\nThe effect of s. 45 is that the finding of the board remains conditional until by concurrence it becomes accomplished. Under art. XVIII, s. 20, of the international rules an appeal may be taken from the \"decision of the local executive board\" to the general executive board. In the absence of confirmation there was no decision and the condition of taking or enabling an appeal did not come into existence.\nMr. Smith urges that s. 45 conflicts with art. XVIII, s. 1(a) of the international constitution. By art. XXI, s. 1(a)\nEach Local Union shall have the right to make such by-laws as it may deem advisable, providing they do not conflict with the laws of the International Union.\nAnd by art. XVIII, s. 1(a):\nA member or officer of a local union, charged with any offense constituting a violation of this Constitution, shall, unless otherwise provided in this Constitution, be tried by the Local Executive Board. The local constitution and by-laws were approved on January 6, 1924, by the president of the international union, under the authority of art. VI, s. 5, of the international constitution:\nThe General President shall assist and advise local unions, draft agreements when called upon, and approve local by-laws.\nPresidential approval is, I should say, sufficient to raise a presumption of the absence of such a conflict. The president is the highest executive officer of a vast organization, invested with the widest authority, and his approval of s. 45 can be taken to be a matter of ordinary administration. But on the true construction of art. XXI, s. 1(a), there is no conflict. The finding, when confirmed, remains the decision of the board, the trial tribunal. So far from conflicting with the spirit and the prescriptions of the international constitution, the by-law serves them in preventing local controversies from encumbering with petty matters the work of the general executive. That was in the mind of vice-president O'Laughlin when in the meeting of the local executive board called to consider a series of charges made against Houle arising indirectly out of this dispute, he rasped,\n\u2026 There are grounds for the General President not answering your communications before. He is now in Frisco and he is certainly not going to be bothered with the trials and tribulations of a little local union\u2014(Loud protests) I will qualify that,\u2014when he is at a convention involving one million members.\nThe approval is also a protection against arbitrary and dictatorial action of local officers, the need for which, in the interests of the local union, has been convincingly demonstrated here.\nThe initial suspension was conceded to have been wholly unauthorized. From its commencement until the trial, the respondent had suffered financially while seeking and engaging in other work and may in the future be seriously prejudiced in employment whether he remains a union member or not. His actual pecuniary loss does not seem to have been calculated but the evidence indicates it to have been not less than $700 and he was able ultimately to obtain employment only with a non-union employer. In that situation to what, if any, relief is he entitled and against whom? In the absence of incorporation or other form of legal recognition of a group of persons as having legal capacity in varying degrees to act as a separate entity and in the corporate or other name to acquire rights, incur liabilities, to sue and be sued, the group is classified as a voluntary association. There are many varieties of this class ranging from business partnerships, labour unions, professional, fraternal and religious societies to social clubs, in the latter of which personal relations are the main objects, and in the descending or ascending scale the difference in the interests would seem to be proper to be reflected in the legal significance, if any, attributable to them.\nMost of their purposes in some form or other touch property; and as their economic character grows that contact is correspondingly enlarged. In a degree depending upon the nature of their objects, they have been left largely to their own government on the ground, probably, that it is better to let family affairs settle themselves; but as they have evolved and membership has taken on greater economic importance resort to the Courts has become more frequent and the warrant for juridical interposition to prevent injustice has called for a more critical analysis of the jural elements involved.\nOrganizations of workmen to promote interests primarily economic have already become of impressive importance to the individual member in his relations with fellow-workmen and employer. In this country, apart from removing from them all taint of illegality as combinations, legislation, generally speaking, has been limited to arrangements with employers. In Manitoba The Labour Relations Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 132, provides the usual machinery for the certification of unions as bargaining agents, for the conciliation of labour disputes looking to the elimination of strikes, for the negotiation of labour agreements, and for ancillary matters such as unfair labour practices.\nIn the protection of its interests, the ranks of labour are looked upon as marshalled against a compact order of private capital and there tends to be demanded of members an unquestioning loyalty. By its nature, certainly in its earlier stages, the organization lends itself to the domination of strong personalities and the corruptions of power. There has resulted an increasing use of the device of either union or closed shop. With only self-determined disciplinary procedure restraining action by officials, the ordinary member must at times either submit to dictatorial executive action or run the risk of being outlawed from the employable ranks of his trade or labour class.\nFollowing the enactment in England of the Trade Union Acts, 1871 and 1876, one of the main objects of which was to abrogate the condemnation of unions, in most cases, as combinations in restraint of trade, the ground on which the jurisdiction in equity was grounded is generally taken to have been declared in Rigby v. Connol 4, to be the protection of interests in property. In Taff Vale Railway Company v. The Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants 5, the House of Lords, interpreting the legislation as recognizing a labour union to be capable of owning and exercising the power of property and of acting by agents, held an action in tort to lie against the union in its registered name for illegal acts committed by its authorized agents. This was followed five years later by an amendment to the statute which specifically denied such an action.\nIn the course of elaborating, in the light of this legislation, the legal relations between members of a union, the Courts of England in the earlier stages distinguished between the remedies that were open. In Kelly v. National Society of Operative Printers 6, the Court of Appeal upheld an injunction against a certified trade union from acting upon an illegal expulsion, but dismissed a claim for damages as for a breach of contract. Swinfen Eady L.J., at p. 1058, puts it thus:\nI am not aware of any authority for the proposition that a member of a voluntary unincorporated association can recover general damages against the association as such, for a breach of the rules, or of the contract contained in the rules. The committee of the society is the agent of all the members of the society, but one member cannot recover from the other members damages for the acts of the committee.\nPhillimore L.J. at p. 1060 says:\nThese damages can only be supported as damages for breach of contract. With whom did the plaintiff contract? Not, I think, with the trade union, which, as Lord Macnaghten says in Russell's case 7, is merely an unincorporated society of individuals. I think that the plaintiff contracted with each and every of the members, and if anybody has broken any contract with him it is each and every member. Further, the officers of the society are agents for him quite as much as for the other members. And if he sues the trade union for what it has done, he is suing himself among others.\nand Bankes L.J. at p. 1062:\nHere the contract relied on is that contained in the rules. These rules do, in my opinion, constitute a contract as between the plaintiff and the other members of his trade union. \u2026 Further than this, the very ground on which the plaintiff succeeds in obtaining an injunction is fatal to his claim for damages. He succeeds in that claim because he has established that the London committee and the executive committee in expelling him from the society acted without authority and in defiance of the rules. Having established that fact, it is not possible to contend that they were at the same time the authorised agents of his fellow-members to do the acts which he complains of as constituting breaches of his contract.\nIn Bonsor v. Musicians' Union 8, before the House of Lords, in which a similar question of damages was raised, Kelly, supra, was expressly overruled, and a registered union held liable in contract for the wrongful expulsion of a member. The issue called for an examination of the reasons in Taff Vale going to the character of the contractual relations involved in the union. On that question there was a difference of opinion ; Lord Morton of Henryton and Lord Porter viewed them clearly and Lord Keith of Avonholm somewhat elusively as existing between the union as such and the member; Lord MacDermott and Lord Somervell of Harrow, as between the members. The latter associated themselves with Lord Macnaghten and Lord Lindley to whom, in Taff Vale, the use of the union name in the action was a procedural feature only which did not change the internal legal structure of the association.\nBefore pursuing that question, a contention which in Canada, at least, seems to be raised here for the first time, should be examined. It was argued that union membership had by its characteristics attained the stage of status, and that rights arising from it in the respondent had been infringed. It was on this ground that the judgment of Tritschler J. in the Court of Appeal proceeded. I am unable to assent to that contention. There are few, if any, more ill-defined ideas in law than that of status. We have examples which are clear in legal features, such as marriage, but the difficulty of bringing them under a general conception or principle is demonstrated in the comprehensive exposition given the subject by Dr. Carleton K. Allen in (1930), 46 L.Q.R. 277.\nReducing it to its more concrete forms, status in its strict sense appears a condition of one or more persons between or toward whom and another or others distinctive legal relations exist to which by the domestic law special rights, duties, capacities and incapacities are annexed. Generally, at least, status embodies personal elements and is recognized by foreign states, although, in them, its incidents may or may not be accorded enforcement. Its creation may involve a voluntary or contractual assumption of the condition, but the incidents are determined by law. Thus while the right of the master in England over the personal freedom of the slave was denied by Lord Mansfield in Somerset v. Stewart 9, property interests arising from the status might properly have been regarded differently. Probably the most significant of the characteristics is the effect upon the legal capacities or incapacities of the parties.\nI cannot bring the relations of a member with his immediate union within such a condition. With or without international affiliation these groups, as yet, are local to their own political jurisdictions or other geographical areas and are intended to be so; what special rights or capacities can be predicated of membership which to foreign employment or law, or to our own present law, would be matter for any form of recognition? What is vital to a member is his right as such to protection in employment; that would be an incident of the status; and the conclusive answer seems to be that on the assumption that the group is bound by an underlying agreement the incidents are already furnished by the parties themselves. To declare a contractual provision to be an incident of a newly-recognized status would be an unnecessary act of legislation; to extend it to an element beyond the contract would be to embark upon legislative policy in an unwarranted manner.\nThere is no legislation in Manitoba similar to that of the Trade Union Acts, 1871-1876; and it was not argued that The Labour Relations Act, supra, had any wider effect than as already stated. Apart, then, from statute, that a union is held together by contractual bonds seems obvious; each member commits himself to a group on a foundation of specific terms governing individual and collective action, a commitment today almost obligatory, and made on both sides with the intent that the rules shall bind them in their relations to each other. That means that each is bound to all the others jointly. The terms allow for the change of those within that relation by withdrawal from or new entrance into membership. Underlying this is the assumption that the members are creating a body of which they are members and that it is as members only that they have accepted obligations: that the body as such is that to which the responsibilities for action taken as of the group are to be related.\nBy the contract, therefore, liabilities incurred in group action are group liabilities and it is this unexpressed assumption that warrants the conclusion of several of the Lords in Taff Vale and in Bonsor in limiting execution of the judgments in those cases recovered to the property of the union. That such a limitation can be effected contractually as between the parties is undoubted and its attribution to the agreement is simply making explicit what is implicit in their act of organization. The contractual rights of a member are, then, with all members except himself, otherwise it would be the group as one that contracts; and what ordinarily is complained of as a breach toward a member must, in the light of the rules and the agreement to be bound by a majority, be such as at the same time is a violation in respect of all the other members and not of one or more only. Not having contractual capacity, it follows, a fortiori, that a union as such cannot incur liability in tort.\nThis contractual condition gives rise to a right to engage in all work for which the union mark is a requisite; and when a union or a closed shop agreement is entered into with an employer, union membership secures to each member the right to continue in that employment free from improper interference on the part of the union or its officers. Membership is the badge of admission and continuance and, vis-\u00e0-vis the employer, to remove the badge is directly and immediately to defeat the right.\nThe executive board here is vested with authority to require the employer to comply with the terms of the union contract, including the feature of the closed or union shop. The board, purporting to act within the scope of its authority, may, by way of analogy with a corporation, commit either an ultra vires act, that is, one that does not become an act of the membership body, or an act intra vires that brings about a breach of contract through an improper exercise of authority.\nThat distinction is pointed out by Farwell J. in Taff Vale, supra, where at p. 433 he uses the following language:\nI have already held that the society are liable for the acts of their agents to the same extent that they would be if they were a corporation, and it is abundantly clear that a corporation under the circumstances of this case would be liable. See, for example, Ranger v. Great Western Ry. Co. (1854), S H.L.C. 86, where Lord Cranworth points out that, although a corporation cannot in strictness be guilty of fraud, there can be no doubt that if its agents act fraudulently, so that if they had been acting for private employers the persons for whom they were acting would have been affected by their fraud, the same principles must prevail where the principal under whom the agent acts is a corporation. It is not a question of acting ultra vires, as in Chapleo v. Brunswick Permanent Building Society (1881), 6 Q.B.D. 696, but of improper acts in the carrying out of the lawful purposes of the society.\nThis is as applicable to the labour union here as it was to the partly recognized society with which he was dealing.\nThat the original suspension here was without a semblance of authority is not disputed; it was an ultra vires act for which the members of the executive were individually responsible. By that act, their notification under the cloak of apparent authority to the employer, and their action on the inquiry, they brought about, as they intended to do, a nullification of the respondent's legal right as a union member to continue in the employment specifically of the employer, a dairy company, and generally of a union shop. This was a direct infringement of or trespass upon that right which of itself gave rise to a cause of action against those committing it: Ashby v. White et al. 10, an action brought by a person entitled to vote at an election for members of Parliament against the returning officer for refusing to admit his vote. In the Queen's Bench on a motion in arrest of judgment, it was held, Holt C.J. dissenting, that the action did not lie, but on appeal to the House of Lords the judgment was reversed. In his reasons, the Chief Justice used the following well-remembered language, at pp. 953-5:\nIf the plaintiff has a right, he must of necessity have a means to vindicate and maintain it, and a remedy if he is injured in the exercise or enjoyment of it; and indeed it is a vain thing to imagine a right without a remedy; for want of right and want of remedy are reciprocal\u2026 .\nAnd I am of opinion, that this action on the case is a proper action. My brother Powell indeed thinks, that an action upon the case is not maintainable, because here is no hurt or damage to the plaintiff; but surely every injury imports a damage, though it does not cost the party one farthing, and it is impossible to prove the contrary; for a damage is not merely pecuniary, but an injury imports a damage, when a man is thereby hindred of his right.\nNo reasons appear to have been given by the Lords but those of the Chief Justice were undoubtedly upheld.\nTo the same effect was Marzetti v. Williams et al. 11.\nThe steps so taken by the board and the subsequent action were found by the Courts below to have been wilful and without justification or excuse. Acting in an ultra vires course they were not representing the union; their acts were those of third persons; and they cannot be heard to say, nor was it argued, that what they did was done as legitimate measures in advancing the interests of their organization.\nThe cause of action alleged against the individual appellants in tort is then well founded. The relief allowable against the union is limited to the declaration of the respondent's continued membership and the injunction against interfering with him as a member. And I am unable to say that the damages awarded, considering the possible consequences in the future, are excessive. I would, therefore, allow the appeal and modify the judgment below to the extent of striking out the last sentence of para. 4 of the formal judgment so that the paragraph will read:\nThis Court did Further Order and Adjudge that the Order and Judgment of the learned trial Chief Justice, set out in paragraph 4 of the formal judgment under appeal, whereby it was Ordered and Adjudged that the plaintiff do have judgment for damages of $5,000 against the defendant members of the said executive board of the defendant Local Union No. 119 in their individual capacities, and also against the defendant Local Union No. 119 as represented by the members of the said executive board, be Varied to read that the plaintiff do have judgment for damages of $5,000 against the individual defendants personally.12\nIn other respects the judgment is affirmed. The respondent will be entitled in this Court to his costs against the appellants in their individual capacities and to one-half of his costs against them in their representative capacity.\nThe judgment of Locke and Nolan JJ. was delivered by\nLocke J.:\u2014While there is a very extensive record in this case, much the greater part of it relates to matters which are no longer the subject of dispute. In addition to the damages awarded against the individual plaintiffs and against them in their representative capacity at the trial, further relief by way of a direction for an accounting was given against the appeallant Houle. This latter portion of the judgment was varied in the judgment of the Court of Appeal, certain of the claims for an accounting being set aside, and there is no cross-appeal as to these matters \"by the respondent.\nThe appeal taken to this Court is from that part of the judgment of the Court of Appeal which declared that the respondent was at all relevant times a member in good standing of Local Union No. 119 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America: that the action taken by the executive board of the union in suspending the respondent from his rights as a member was null and void: restraining the executive board and the union from enforcing the suspension of the respondent and interfering with the exercise of his rights as a member and awarding judgment for damages in the sum of $5,000 against the individual appellants and against all other members of Local Union 119 to the extent of their interest in its funds, and granting to the respondent his costs on the terms of the judgment at the trial.\nThe facts to be considered in dealing with these issues are few and not in dispute.\nThe respondent had become a member of the local union at Winnipeg in the year 1935, at which time he was in the employ of the Crescent Creamery Co. Ltd. as a salesman. He continued in the employ of that company and as a member of the union until 1940, when he enlisted for service in the navy. On his discharge in 1945, after a short delay, he re-entered the service of the creamery company and again became a member of the union. This state of affairs continued until the occurrence of the events which gave rise to this litigation.\nThe union had for an undisclosed period of time prior to 1947 represented the salesmen employed by Crescent Creamery Co. Ltd. and, as their bargaining agent, had entered into a series of collective agreements with them and other dairy companies, dealing, inter alia, with wages, hours and other conditions of employment and providing for a union shop obligating the employer to engage members of the union as salesmen. Membership in the union was prescribed as a condition of continued employment. Such a collective agreement which, by its terms, was to continue in effect from April 1, 1947, until October 31, 1948, was in force on July 18, 1947, when a letter was addressed by the appellant Houle, in his capacity as secretary-treasurer and business agent of the union, to the general manager of Crescent Creamery Co. Ltd., notifying the company that the respondent\nhas been temporarily suspended by the Executive Board of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers, Local 119, as of July 18th, 1947 and under the terms of Agreement between your Company and the Union, J. Tunney cannot remain in your employment till his suspension is cancelled\nand requesting the company to comply with the agreement.\nOn receiving this, the company laid Tunney off work and his remuneration ceased. By letter dated July 21, 1947, the appellant Orchard wrote Tunney advising him that he had been charged under a clause in the constitution of the union with saying on several occasions that he had \"the goods\" on the secretary obtained by making investigations, and insinuating that discrepancies existed in the affairs of the union. The letter asserted that such statements were detrimental to the welfare of the union, stated that the trial of the charges would be held in the Labour Temple in Winnipeg on August 4 at 7 p.m., and informed Tunney that he was suspended \"from all benefits of the local\" until the trial was disposed of.\nA hearing took place at the time stated and on August 7, 1947, Orchard again wrote Tunney advising him that he had been found guilty of the charge by the executive of the local and:\nIn accordance with Section 5, Clause 10, you are hereby suspended from all rights, benefits and privileges as contained in the Constitution and Laws of our Brotherhood, as from August 4th, 1947.\nThe respondent endeavoured to get other employment with another dairy company which was a party to the collective agreement with the union but, by reason of his suspension, they would not employ him. Thereafter, he engaged for a while in a different type of employment, eventually obtaining employment as a salesman with a dairy company which did not employ union labour.\nOn September 30, 1947, the Crescent Creamery Co. Ltd. wrote the respondent informing him that, as they had been notified that he was no longer a member of Local 119, they could no longer employ him as a driver salesman. A cheque for $36, being a week's wages, in lieu of notice, was enclosed. The respondent had not been re-employed by the Crescent company up to the time of the trial which was held at Winnipeg in April 1950.\nThe constitution of the local union provided by s. 33 that the executive board should try all members against whom charges had been preferred and report the findings at the next regular meeting of the union. Section 45 required that all decisions of the executive board should be concurred in at a regular meeting of the union before becoming effective and that the accused should have the right to appeal to the general executive board. The latter body is appointed under the provisions of the constitution of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America, with which Local 119 was affiliated.\nIt was admitted on the hearing before the Court of Appeal that the executive board of the local union had no power to suspend a member before the trial of charges preferred against him under the provisions of the constitution, and the contrary was not asserted in this Court. The statement in the notification sent to the Crescent Creamery Co. Ltd. on July 18, 1947, by the appellant Houle that Tunney had been temporarily suspended was untrue.\nThe learned trial judge and all of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal have expressed the opinion that the order of the executive board of which Orchard advised Tunney by the letter of August 7, 1947, was made without jurisdiction. With this conclusion I respectfully agree, and this whether the procedure to be followed was governed by the provisions of the constitution of the local union or that of the international brotherhood.\nAn order or decision such as this, made without jurisdiction, is a nullity: Macfarlane et al. v. Leclaire et al. 13; McLeod v. Noble et al. 14. As the learned trial judge has pointed out, there was no effective decision of the executive board from which to appeal or which might be concurred in at a regular meeting of the union before becoming effective under s. 45. The appeal provisions were, accordingly, inapplicable and the contention based upon the decision of the Judicial Committee in White et al. v. Kuzych 15, that the respondent did not exhaust his remedies under the constitution before commencing his action must be rejected.\nThe respondent not having been suspended in accordance with the requirements of the constitution, the appeal against that portion of the judgment declaring him to have been a member in good standing of Local Union 119 at all relevant times must fail. There remains the question as to the nature of the respondent's remedy for the damages he has unquestionably sustained.\nThere is no legislation in Manitoba similar to the Trade Union Act of 1871 or the Act of 1876, considered in Taff Vale Railway Company v. The Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants 16, nor to the Trade Disputes Act of 1906 (6 Edw. VII, c. 47) which was passed in England in consequence of the Taff Vale decision. Section 4 of the latter statute prohibits actions in tort against trade unions in respect of any tortious acts alleged to have been committed by them or on their behalf. A trade union in Manitoba not having the status, however, of such organizations in England to which the legislation of 1871 and 1876 applied and not being a corporate entity, a representation order was made in the present action by the Court of Appeal in advance of the trial. By that order, the persons who are the individual appellants in the present case were ordered to represent and defend the action on behalf of all other members of Local Union No. 119, except the present respondent, as well as on their own behalf.\nThe judgment at the trial, in addition, inter alia, to awarding damages of $5,000 against the members of the executive board in their individual capacities, gave judgment in that amount against Local Union No. 119 as represented by the members of the said Board. By the judgment of the Court of Appeal this portion of the judgment was varied by directing that the plaintiff have judgment in the said amount\nagainst the individual defendants personally and against all other members of Local Union No. 119 (except the Plaintiff) to the extent of their interest in the funds of the local union.\nIt was alleged in the statement of claim that the actions of the executive board complained of were actuated by indirect and improper motives and that they had acted maliciously in order to injure the plaintiff. The learned trial judge held that the purported expulsion of the plaintiff was done in bad faith and all of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal were in agreement that the actions complained of were done maliciously with intent to injure him.\nFor the appellants it was alleged that the respondent's remedy, if any, was damages for breach of contract only, this on the footing that the relationship existing between the respondent and the other members of the local union was contractual, the terms of the contract being as defined in the rules applicable to the organization. This was recently held to be so in the case of the members of a registered trade union in England in Bonsor v. Musicians' Union 17. The point is that, if the cause of action was in contract rather than in tort, the damages would be assessable upon the principle defined in Hadley et al. v. Baxendale et al. 18. If this rule applied, it might well be that the damages proven were insufficient to justify the award of $5,000 made at the trial.\nIn my opinion, the cause of action for damages against the individual defendants was in tort. I further consider that as against the defendants, made so by the representation order, the only enforceable claim was for a declaration that the plaintiff was a member of the union in good standing.\nTunney's situation in July of 1947 was that he had steady employment with a large dairy company by which he had been employed for an aggregate of approximately 7 years, drawing a substantial weekly salary and apparently assured of indefinite employment so long as his services were satisfactory to his employer, and the union of which he was a member remained the bargaining agent for the salesmen and he remained a member in good standing. As a member of the union he was entitled to the benefits of the agreement that had been made by the union as bargaining agent for the salesmen.\nThe action of the individual appellants who have been found to have acted in concert in notifying his employer, first, that he had been suspended, and secondly, that he was no longer a member of the union, were wrongful acts. Both of these statements were false and caused immediate damage to the respondent in that he at once lost his employment and was unable to obtain work from any of the other dairy companies in Winnipeg who were parties to the collective agreement and all the other benefits and advantages to which membership in the union entitled him.\nThis is not such a case as Lumley v. Gye 19, where the cause of action was for inducing a breach of a contract of employment. The actions of the individual appellants did not result in the Crescent Creamery Co. Ltd. breaking its contract of employment with Tunney. Since the bargaining agent authorized to act on his behalf had agreed that membership in the union was to be a condition of his continued employment, the action of the employer in, first, suspending, and then dismissing him, with payment of a week's wages in lieu of notice, did not involve any breach of contract on its behalf. However, in my opinion, similar principles are applicable in determining the question of liability.\nThe members of the executive board were in a particularly advantageous position if they wished to injure Tunney in this manner. The employer was bound by its agreement to employ only members of the union and could not be expected to enquire into the regularity of the proceedings resulting in Tunney's alleged suspension or in his having thereafter ceased to be a member. The board were in a position to exert pressure upon the employer since a breach on its. part of the covenant to employ only union men might well precipitate a strike.\nIn Quinn v. Leathem 20, Lord Macnaghten said, at p. 510:\nSpeaking for myself, I have no hesitation, in saying that I think the decision [Lumley v. Gye, supra] was right, not on the ground of malicious intention\u2014that was not, \u00cf think, the gist of the action\u2014but on the ground that a violation of legal right committed knowingly is a cause of action, and that it is a violation of legal right to interfere with contractual relations recognised by law if there be no sufficient justification for the interference. Lord Lindley at pp. 534-5 said:\nAs to the plaintiff's rights. He had the ordinary rights of a British subject. He was at liberty to earn his own living in his own way, provided he did not violate some special law prohibiting him from so doing, and provided he did not infringe the rights of other people. This liberty involved liberty to deal with other persons who were willing to deal with him. This liberty is a right recognised by law; its correlative is the general duty of every one not to prevent the free exercise of this liberty, except so far as his own liberty of action may justify him in so doing. But a person's liberty or right to deal with others is nugatory, unless they are at liberty to deal with him if they choose to do so. Any interference with their liberty to deal with him affects him. If such interference is justifiable in point of law, he has no redress. Again, if such interference is wrongful, the only person who can sue in respect of it is, as a rule, the person immediately affected by it; another who suffers by it has usually no redress; the damage to him is too remote, and it would be obviously practically impossible and highly inconvenient to give legal redress to all who suffered from such wrongs. But if the interference is wrongful and is intended to damage a third person, and he is damaged in fact\u2014in other words, if he is wrongfully and intentionally struck at through others, and is thereby damnified\u2014the whole aspect of the case is changed: the wrong done to others reaches him, his rights are infringed although indirectly, and damage to him is not remote or unforeseen, but is the direct consequence of what has been done. Our law, as I understand it, is not so defective as to refuse him a remedy by an action under such circumstances.\nIn Giblan v. National Amalgamated Labourers' Union of Great Britain and Ireland 21, Romer L.J. said in part:\nIn my judgment, if a person who, by virtue of his position or influence, has power to carry out his design, sets himself to the task of preventing, and succeeds in preventing, a man from obtaining or holding employment in his calling, to his injury, by reason of threats to or special influence upon the man's employers, and the design was to carry out some spite against the man, \u2026 then that person is liable to the man for the damage consequently suffered. The conduct of that person would be, in my opinion, such an injustifiable molestation of the man, such an improper and inexcusable interference with the man's ordinary rights of citizenship, as to make that person liable in an action.\nThere is an exhaustive review of the authorities in Pratt et al. v. British Medical Association et al. 22, where McCardie J., at p. 260, expressed the opinion that it is an actionable wrong for a single person or a body of persons to inflict actual pecuniary damage upon another by the intentional employment of unlawful means to injure that person's business, even though the unlawful means may not comprise any act which is per se actionable, and that fraud fell within the expression \"unlawful means\". It was the false statements made by Houle and Orchard which led to Tunney's dismissal and, whether or not malice is of the gist, malice has in the present case been expressly found.\nIllustrations of the application of the principle above referred to are to be found in the judgment of this Court in The Manitoba Free Press Company v. Nagy 23, and in National Phonograph Company, Limited v. Edison-Bell Consolidated Phonograph Company, Limited 24.\nI see no ground for any interference with the judgment for damages against the individual appellants.\nSince, however, it has been found that the actions of the executive board were ultra vires and were done maliciously with intent to injure the respondent, in my opinion the judgment against them in their representative capacity as representing all the other members of the union cannot be sustained. The individual appellants had no authority from their fellow members to act in the manner complained of, either by the constitution of the union or by any course of conduct of the other members. As the evidence shows, very considerable numbers of the members protested vigorously against what had been done and disapproved of the actions of the executive board. The directors of a limited company cannot impose liability upon it by entering into transactions on its behalf which are beyond its corporate powers and I think, upon the same principle, the members of this union are not, even to the extent of their interest in the funds of the union, liable for acts done wholly beyond those powers entrusted to the individual appellants.\nI agree that the judgment should be varied in the manner directed by my brother Rand and with his proposed order as to costs.\nJudgment varied.\nSolicitors for the defendants, appellants: Thompson, Shepard, Dilts & Jones, Winnipeg.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Stubbs, Stubbs & Stubbs, Winnipeg.\n1 15 W.W.R. 49, [1955] 3 D.L.R. 15.\n2 9 W.W.R.

Held: The effect of this reservation was to give the vendor and his ayants cause a right of property in the mines and minerals rather than a mere personal right. The parties to a contract were not to be presumed to have given to the words and expressions they used a meaning different from that given to them by the law on which, in the last analysis, the protection of validly made contracts depended, and under the legislation in force at the time and place of the deed this was the effect of the reservation. The right so reserved could not, therefore, be the object of extinctive prescription. Stevenson v. Wallingford et al.; Wallingford v. Hotchkiss (1894), 6 Que. S.C. 183, approved. Nor, in the circumstances of this case, could it be the object of acquisitive prescription.\nHusband and wife\u2014Covenants in marriage contract\u2014Limits of application of Civil Code, art. 1265.\nArticle 1265 of the Civil Code does not apply so as to prevent the correction of a clerical error in a marriage contract, such as the giving of wrong numbers to lots conveyed by the contract.

Appeal dismissed.\nEdouard Masson, Q.C., and M. Lattoni, Q.C., for the defendant, appellant.\nLucien Tremblay, Q.C., and Carrier Fortin, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nFauteux J.:\u2014All\u00e9guant \u00eatre propri\u00e9taires d'au moins 50 pour cent des mines et minerais situ\u00e9s dans les lots 20-c et 21-c du rang 3 du canton Ham, dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, les intim\u00e9s ont, par action p\u00e9titoire, requis l'affirmation judiciaire de ce droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9 par l'appelante et joint \u00e0 leur action une demande d'injonction assurant la suspension des travaux d'exploitation de ces mines et minerais, par l'appelante, jusqu'\u00e0 \u00e9tablissement et partage de ces droits suivant la loi.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a fait droit \u00e0 ces demandes et son jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par une d\u00e9cision unanime de la Cour d'Appel.\nNonobstant l'habile argument du procureur de l'appelante, le non-fond\u00e9 des griefs soulev\u00e9s \u00e0 l'encontre de ce jugement est apparu \u00e0 l'audition et a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par une consid\u00e9ration ult\u00e9rieure des questions dans la cause. En substance, ces griefs portent sur des questions de droit et sont relatifs (i) au droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des intim\u00e9s \u00e0 ces mines et minerais, et (ii) \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure.\nPour disposer des diverses pr\u00e9tentions au premier titre, il n'est plus n\u00e9cessaire, \u00e0 ce stage des proc\u00e9dures, de refaire ici la chronologie des actes et faits juridiques \u00e9tablissant le titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des intim\u00e9s. Il suffira de ne r\u00e9f\u00e9rer qu'\u00e0 ceux dont la consid\u00e9ration est pertinente \u00e0 l'appr\u00e9ciation des moyens qu'il y a lieu de consid\u00e9rer.\nLe droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 aux mines et minerais dont les intim\u00e9s ont obtenu la reconnaissance en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et Cour d'Appel, se fonde sur une r\u00e9serve du \"droit de mine\" stipul\u00e9e par Isa\u00efe Comtois fils dans une convention sous seing priv\u00e9, intervenue le 30 septembre 1889 et aux termes de laquelle il vendait \u00e0 Clovis Richer partie des lots vingt(20) et vingt et un(21). C'est sur l'interpr\u00e9tation de l'expression \"droit de mine\" que les parties se sont divis\u00e9es. Aux vues de l'appelante, le \"droit de mine\" n'est qu'un droit d'exploitation, un droit personnel, immobilier et incorporel; en somme, ce serait une simple cr\u00e9ance qu'en l'esp\u00e8ce, le cr\u00e9ancier aurait perdue par prescription extinctive et que l'appelante aurait acquise par prescription acquisitive. D'autre part, et suivant l'interpr\u00e9tation des intim\u00e9s, ce \"droit de mine\", r\u00e9serv\u00e9 lors de la disposition de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de ces lots, est un droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 aux mines et minerais; un tel droit ne peut \u00eatre l'objet d'une prescription extinctive et la prescription acquisitive n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 ni all\u00e9gu\u00e9e ni prouv\u00e9e par l'appelante. Pour d\u00e9cider du sens de l'expression \"droit de mine\", il convient, comme d'ailleurs l'art. 1016 du Code Civil l'autorise, de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer au sens que, suivant l'usage, on donnait \u00e0 l'expression, aux temps et lieu de la convention pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e puisque celle-ci n'apporte aucune autre pr\u00e9cision sur l'objet de la r\u00e9serve.\nLes parties \u00e0 une convention ne sont pas pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es vouloir assigner aux mots et expressions y employ\u00e9s un sens autre que celui y attach\u00e9 par la loi dont d\u00e9pend, en derni\u00e8re analyse, la protection des contrats validement consentis. Une r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislation en vigueur aux temps et lieu de la convention entre Comtois fils et Richer, indique clairement que le \"droit de mine\" n'est pas une pure cr\u00e9ance personnelle mais un droit r\u00e9el, un droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 aux mines et minerais. Ainsi, par la loi 24 Vict., c. 31, adopt\u00e9e en 1861 pour le Bas-Canada, afin de dissiper certains doutes \u00e9lev\u00e9s sur les titres des acqu\u00e9reurs de privil\u00e8ges et de droits touchant l'exploitation des mines, distincts du sol, la L\u00e9gislature du Canada a statu\u00e9 que:\nLa vente \u2026 par le propri\u00e9taire ou concessionnaire de l'immeuble, d'un droit de mine ou d'un privil\u00e8ge d'exploration de toute mine, minerai \u2026, avec ou sans la facult\u00e9 d'exploiter la mine, si elle est d\u00fbment enregistr\u00e9e au bureau d'enregistrement de la division d'enregistrement dans laquelle l'immeuble en question est situ\u00e9, en conf\u00e9rera la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l'acqu\u00e9reur, suivant son rang et droit de priorit\u00e9 \u2026\nEn 1880, la L\u00e9gislature de Qu\u00e9bec adoptait la loi 43-44 Vict., c. 12, et d\u00e9cr\u00e9tait ce qui suit, aux arts. 3 et 4:\n3. Il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire, \u00e0 l'avenir, de faire mention dans les lettres-patentes de terres octroy\u00e9es pour fins agricoles, de la r\u00e9serve des droits de mines, laquelle r\u00e9serve est toujours cens\u00e9e exister, suivant les dispositions du pr\u00e9sent acte.\n4. Toute personne qui, jusqu'\u00e0 ce moment, a obtenu par lettres-patentes, pour fins agricoles, mais avec r\u00e9serve du droit de mines par le gouvernement, un lot de terre quelconque faisant partie des terres publiques de cette province, peut, si lui ou son repr\u00e9sentant l\u00e9gal, d\u00e9couvre et veut exploiter une mine, acheter le droit de mines ainsi r\u00e9serv\u00e9 par le gouvernement, en payant comptant, au commissaire des terres de la couronne, en sus du prix d\u00e9j\u00e0 pay\u00e9 pour le dit lot de terre, une somme additionnelle suffisante pour atteindre la somme de deux piastres l'acre, s'il s'agit de l'or ou de l'argent; et de une piastre l'acre, s'il s'agit du cuivre, du fer, du plomb ou autres m\u00e9taux inf\u00e9rieurs.\nEnfin, aux Statuts Refondus de Qu\u00e9bec, 1888, vol. 1, le para. 2 de l'art. 1424, concernant la Loi des mines de 1888, \u00e9dicte que:\n2. Au cas o\u00f9 un particulier devenu propri\u00e9taire de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 superficiaire et souterraine \u00e0 quelque titre que ce soit, avant le 10 juin 1884, vend, hypoth\u00e8que, loue ou affecte le droit de mine sur telle propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 un autre particulier en conformit\u00e9 de l'article 2099 du code civil du Bas Canada, ces propri\u00e9t\u00e9s superficiaire et souterraine redeviennent deux propri\u00e9t\u00e9s parfaitement distinctes et ind\u00e9pendantes l'une de l'autre, \u00e0 toutes fins que de droit, comme elles l'\u00e9taient lorsqu'elles \u00e9taient en la possession de la couronne; en sorte que la vente de l'une de ces propri\u00e9t\u00e9s, faite judiciairement ou autrement, n'affecte l'autre en aucune mani\u00e8re que ce soit.\nDans Stevenson v. Wallingford et Canadian Pacific Ry. Co.; Wallingford v. Hotchkiss et al. 2, la Cour de Revision confirme un jugement rendu par le Juge Gill o\u00f9 un sens identique est assign\u00e9 \u00e0 l'expression \"droit de mine\". Il convient d'en citer les extraits suivants:\nAttendu que le demandeur principal, all\u00e9guant qu'il est propri\u00e9taire des droits de mines dans le lot de terre \u2026 revendique par sa pr\u00e9sente demande la dite quantit\u00e9 de phosphate comme \u00e9tant sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u2026\nConsid\u00e9rant que par la loi en force, lors de la dite vente pour taxe et vente du sh\u00e9rif, 47 Vict., c. 22, s. 1, les droits de mines et le droit \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 superficiaire d'un terrain sont distincts les uns des autres, que les droits miniers n'\u00e9taient pas tax\u00e9s come tels, mais que le lot superficiaire seul \u00e9tait tax\u00e9, ladite compagnie mini\u00e8re alors investie du droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des mines qui pouvaient se trouver dans le lot de terre, n'\u00e9tait pas port\u00e9e au r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation municipale, que par cons\u00e9quent la vente municipale ne comprenait pas les droits de mines, et que c'est bien le demandeur principal en vertu de son titre du sh\u00e9rif qui est le seul et v\u00e9ritable propri\u00e9taire des droits de mines dans le dit lot de terre.\nConsid\u00e9rant que le dit demandeur principal est bien encore propri\u00e9taire du minerai que le d\u00e9fendeur principal a extrait du dit lot de terre \u2026\nCes r\u00e9f\u00e9rences suffisent, je crois, pour \u00e9tablir que le \"droit de mine\" \u00e9tait, aux temps et lieu de la convention pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, compris comme un droit in re et non pas comme un droit ad rem, i.e., comme un droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 aux mines et minerais et non pas comme une simple cr\u00e9ance sujette \u00e0 extinction par prescription. Dans ces vues, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de consid\u00e9rer les pr\u00e9tentions de l'appelante qui invoque la prescription extinctive ou lib\u00e9ratoire laquelle, \u00e9tant une fin de non recevoir qu'un d\u00e9biteur peut opposer \u00e0 l'action de son cr\u00e9ancier lorsque celui-ci a n\u00e9glig\u00e9 de l'exercer pendant un temps d\u00e9termin\u00e9, ne saurait ici trouver d'application. Quant \u00e0 la prescription acquisitive, permettant l'acquisition d'un fonds par une possession prolong\u00e9e pendant un certain temps, elle ne peut davantage \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e avec succ\u00e8s par l'appelante. La propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du sol que poss\u00e9derait l'appelante dans ces lots est, dans l'esp\u00e8ce, une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 distincte de celle des mines et minerais; la possession de la premi\u00e8re est donc ind\u00e9pendante de celle de la seconde et ne peut, par elle-m\u00eame, pour cette raison, donner ouverture au jeu de la prescription acquisitive. D'ailleurs, la prescription acquisitive aussi bien que les faits qui en conditionnent l'op\u00e9ration n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 all\u00e9gu\u00e9s par l'appelante. Cette derni\u00e8re a, de plus, admis qu'ant\u00e9rieurement au mois de f\u00e9vrier 1953, l'ann\u00e9e o\u00f9 la pr\u00e9sente action fut institu\u00e9e, il n'y avait jamais eu de mine ouverte ni de \"droit de mine\" exerc\u00e9, soit sur les lots 20 et 21, ou 20-c et 21-c du rang 3 du canton mentionn\u00e9. Cette premi\u00e8re pr\u00e9tention de l'appelante doit donc \u00eatre \u00e9cart\u00e9e.\nLes faits suivants ont fourni \u00e0 l'appelante une seconde objection au titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des intim\u00e9s. Ce \"droit de mine\" r\u00e9serv\u00e9 par Isa\u00efe Comtois fils, ce dernier l'avait acquis \u00e0 l'occasion de son mariage, alors que Isa\u00efe Comtois p\u00e8re est intervenu au contrat de mariage pass\u00e9 le 13 avril 1885, pour donner exclusivement \u00e0 son fils, ce acceptant, une terre faisant partie des lots en question, tout en se r\u00e9servant la moiti\u00e9 des mines et minerais, abandonnant ainsi \u00e0 son fils l'autre moiti\u00e9. Quatre ans plus tard, toutes les parties \u00e0 ce contrat de mariage ont, par acte authentique subs\u00e9quemment enregistr\u00e9, constat\u00e9, reconnu et corrig\u00e9 une erreur cl\u00e9ricale qui s'\u00e9tait gliss\u00e9e \u00e0 ce contrat alors que les lots 20 et 21 dont la terre donn\u00e9e faisait partie, avaient erron\u00e9ment \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant les lots 19 et 20. En raison de ces faits, on a fait la correction et Isa\u00efe Comtois p\u00e8re a r\u00e9affirm\u00e9 donner \u00e0 Isa\u00efe Comtois fils, acceptant, la m\u00eame terre dont la d\u00e9signation fut ainsi corrig\u00e9e. Cette correction, dit l'appelante, constitue une violation des dispositions de l'art. 1265 du Code Civil, lequel se lit comme suit:\n1265. Apr\u00e8s le mariage, il ne peut \u00eatre fait aux conventions matri moniales contenues au contrat, aucun changement [pas m\u00eame par dor usuel d'usufruit, lequel est aboli.]\nLes \u00e9poux ne peuvent non plus s'avantager entre vifs si ce n'est conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de la loi qui permettent au mari, sous certaines restrictions et conditions, d'assurer sa vie pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de sa femme et de ses enfants.\nCet article consacre le principe de l'immutabilit\u00e9 des conventions matrimoniales. Mais vise-t-il simplement les conventions matrimoniales proprement dites ou \u00e9galement celles qui sont susceptibles d'existence ind\u00e9pendamment du contrat de mariage, comme c'est le cas de cette convention de lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 intervenue exclusivement entre Comtois p\u00e8re et son fils? Il ne para\u00eet pas n\u00e9cessaire de s'arr\u00eater \u00e0 la question. On notera cependant qu'une telle distinction a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite dans Dufresne v. dame Dufresne 3, et qu'elle a donn\u00e9 lieu au maintien d'une convention de lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 apparaissant dans un contrat de mariage dont la nullit\u00e9 fut reconnue. Ce qui est certain, c'est que si le principe d'immutabilit\u00e9 consacr\u00e9 par l'art. 1265 couvre cette donation de biens pr\u00e9sents faite, par acte authentique, par Isa\u00efe Comtois p\u00e8re exclusivement \u00e0 son fils acceptant, la correction de l'erreur cl\u00e9ricale d\u00e9nonc\u00e9e par toutes les parties au contrat n'offense pas mais satisfait plut\u00f4t le principe de l'immutabilit\u00e9. En faisant cette correction, l'intention et la volont\u00e9 des parties \u00e0 cette donation apparaissant au contrat de mariage, ont re\u00e7u la pl\u00e9nitude de leur ex\u00e9cution. En fait, l'objet r\u00e9el de la donation n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 chang\u00e9, mais sa description en a \u00e9t\u00e9 simplement corrig\u00e9e. Cette autre objection ne peut valoir.\nL'appelante, se r\u00e9f\u00e9rant \u00e0 un avis donn\u00e9 au r\u00e9gistrateur par Isa\u00efe Comtois fils, suivant les dispositions de l'art. 2172 C.C., veut y voir l'aveu que ce dernier n'\u00e9tait plus propri\u00e9taire du \"droit de mine\". Aux vues de l'appelante, cet aveu d\u00e9coulerait n\u00e9cessairement du fait que Comtois fils ne fait en cet avis aucune r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au \"droit de mine\". Dans cet avis, ce dernier d\u00e9clare que les lots 20-c et 21-c appartiennent \u00e0 Clovis Richer en vertu de l'acte de vente du 24 septembre 1889, et qu'il donne cet avis pour renouveler l'enregistrement de tous les droits r\u00e9els et de toutes les hypoth\u00e8ques lui r\u00e9sultant de cette vente. Comtois fils avait int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 donner cet avis; il restait une balance de prix de vente et l'hypoth\u00e8que l\u00e9gale du vendeur non pay\u00e9 demeurait. Dans ces termes, la derni\u00e8re partie de l'avis couvrant les droits r\u00e9els n'exclut pas le droit aux mines et minerais. D'ailleurs, sur ces derniers, Comtois fils avait un droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et la conservation du droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 n'\u00e9tait pas assujettie \u00e0 la formalit\u00e9 du renouvellement de l'enregistrement du titre apr\u00e8s la mise en vigueur du cadastre: Duchaine v. The Matamajaw Salmon Club (Lted.) 4; Goldstein v. Allard et vir. 5. Aussi bien, si l'on peut dire que Comtois a fait plus que satisfaire aux exigences de l'art. 2172, il n'a pas, pour cette raison, perdu ses droits. Il n'y a pas, dans cette d\u00e9claration, l'aveu qu'on pr\u00e9tend y voir.\nAu titre de la proc\u00e9dure, il n'y a, je crois, qu'un grief \u00e0 retenir. Le procureur de l'appelante a soumis que l'intim\u00e9 Flintkote Mines Limited ne saurait de toutes fa\u00e7ons, \u00e0 l'instar des intim\u00e9s Comtois, \u00eatre, avec eux, d\u00e9clar\u00e9 copropri\u00e9taire indivis d'au moins 50 pour cent des mines et minerais en question, les droits de cette compagnie se limitant \u00e0 ceux lui r\u00e9sultant d'une option \u00e0 elle consentie, en juin 1953, par les intim\u00e9s Comtois. A mon avis, l'appelante ne peut utilement soulever ce moyen. Les relations juridiques existant entre les Comtois et Flintkote Mines Limited sont, en ce qui concerne l'appelante, res inter alios acta.\nL'appelante n'a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que le jugement de la Cour d'Appel est mal fond\u00e9 et, en cons\u00e9quence, son appel \u00e0 cette Cour doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the defendant, appellant: Edouard Masson, Montreal.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, respondents: Desruisseaux & Fortin, Sherbrooke.\n1 [1957] Que.

Judicial sales\u2014Validity\u2014Nullity of sale based on invalid judgment\u2014 How asserted\u2014Opposition to judgment\u2014Code of Civil Procedure, arts. 781, 784.\nDeeds and Documents\u2014Invalidity\u2014When inscription en faux required\u2014 Forgery of bail bond.\nOne P, charged with theft, was admitted to bail on a bond signed by him and by an unknown person who signed the plaintiff's name and pledged property in Montreal belonging to the plaintiff. P did not appear; the bail was forfeited and judgment was pronounced against P and the plaintiff for $3,000. P instructed an attorney to present a requ\u00eate civile and this was done in the names of P and the plaintiff, but the attorney was not instructed by the plaintiff. The requ\u00eate civile was dismissed and, eventually, the plaintiff's lands were sold by the sheriff to D.\nSome three months after the sale, the plaintiff learned, for the first time, of the proceedings and immediately filed an opposition to the judgment against him, asking that the judgment and sale be set aside.\nHeld: The plaintiff was entitled to succeed on his opposition, notwithstanding the fact that he had not taken proceedings en d\u00e9saveu under art. 251 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\nPer Taschereau, Cartwright, Fauteux and Abbott JJ.: Article 251 makes a requ\u00eate en d\u00e9saveu essential in the case of an attorney ad litem who has exceeded his powers, i.e., an attorney who has been retained but has gone beyond the terms of his retainer. Where, however, the attorney has acted without instructions from the party, proceedings in disavowal are optional, since the article expressly provides that the rights of the party are not prejudiced if he does not take such proceedings. Cooke v. Caron et al. (1884), 10 Q.L.R. 152; 11 Q.L.R. 268, approved. Article 251, in this respect, differs from the corresponding article of the French code of procedure and the French decisions are therefore inapplicable.\nThe plaintiff was not required to proceed by inscription en faux to set aside the bail bond. Such an inscription was essential where the good faith of the public officer was attacked but where, as here, the prothonotary had recorded exactly what took place before him, and the cause of nullity was the fraud of the unknown person who had signed the plaintiff's name, such an inscription was not required.\nAlthough D had, in good faith, obtained a title from the sheriff, the sale could nevertheless be invalidated where there had been illegality in obtaining it. A petition in nullity under art. 784 of the Code of Civil Procedure was not the only remedy available and a direct action or an opposition to judgment was equally available. Since the judgment was completely invalid because of the personation, the sale must also be set aside, reserving, however, D's right to recover the amount he had paid to the sheriff.\nPer Rand and Cartwright JJ.: The absence of disavowal, under art. 251, in order to constitute a bar to an opposition to judgment, must be in relation to the very proceeding attacked by the opposition. These proceedings were brought for the annulment of the original judgment, which was pronounced ex parte, and the requ\u00eate civile was a subordinate proceeding. If the judgment was set aside, everything depending on it automatically fell. Since it was only the original judgment with which the opposition was concerned, no question of disavowal could arise. Since the judgment must be declared to be a nullity, the judicial sale based on it was equally null.

Ce cautionnement, sign\u00e9 par Perreault et par un nomm\u00e9 Roland Boileau, a \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9 sur une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 portant le num\u00e9ro cadastral 299 du quartier St-Louis, et dont les num\u00e9ros civiques sont 1215-1217 de la ru\u00e9 St-Dominique \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. Il est certain que cet immeuble \u00e9tait la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'appelant, dont le nom appara\u00eet comme ayant fourni le cautionnement, mais il est \u00e9galement certain que ce n'est pas l'appelant qui a appos\u00e9 sa signature. Cette autre personne qui l'aurait appos\u00e9e n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 identifi\u00e9e. Le protonotaire devant qui le cautionnement a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 a jur\u00e9 que celui qui l'a sign\u00e9 n'est pas l'appelant, et tout le reste de la preuve est au m\u00eame effet.\nLe jour du proc\u00e8s de Perreault, soit le 21 octobre 1953, ce dernier a fait d\u00e9faut de compara\u00eetre, et le 30 d\u00e9cembre 1953, par jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, le cautionnement a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 confisqu\u00e9 au profit de la Couronne, et Perreault et l'appelant ont \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9s conjointement et solidairement \u00e0 payer la somme de $3,000.\nLe 7 janvier 1954, Frank Perreault qui se trouvait en prison a donn\u00e9 instructions \u00e0 Me Paul Demers, avocat de Victoriaville, de pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate civile pour faire surseoir \u00e0 la vente des immeubles, et pour faire annuler le jugement rendu le 30 d\u00e9cembre 1953. A la requ\u00eate, le nom de l'appelant Roland Boileau a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9 comme requ\u00e9rant avec celui de Frank Perreault. Le 15 mars 1954, l'honorable Juge Alfred Savard a rendu jugement, rejetant la requ\u00eate civile avec d\u00e9pens, et de ce jugement il n'y a pas eu d'appel.\nMe Paul Demers, entendu comme t\u00e9moin, a jur\u00e9 qu'il a re\u00e7u ses instructions de Perreault seul, et qu'il n'a jamais rencontr\u00e9 l'appelant Boileau malgr\u00e9 qu'il ait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Perreault de communiquer avec lui. Ce n'est qu'\u00e0 l'audition de l'opposition \u00e0 jugement, qui fait l'objet du pr\u00e9sent appel, que Me Demers a vu Boileau pour la premi\u00e8re fois. Ce dernier n'a donc jamais donn\u00e9 aucune instruction \u00e0 personne d'agir en son nom pour loger cette requ\u00eate civile.\nDans le cours du mois de mai 1954, un huissier de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 un bref de fieri facias contre les biens mobiliers de l'appelant, situ\u00e9s \u00e0 1217 St-Dominique, mais comme il n'a pu trouver l'appelant, il a laiss\u00e9 une copie du bref au bureau du protonotaire de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, et le m\u00eame jour il a fait un rapport de nulla bona. Les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s ont en cons\u00e9quence \u00e9t\u00e9 saisies le m\u00eame jour en ex\u00e9cution du jugement ant\u00e9rieurement rendu par le protonotaire. En juillet 1954, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 vendue par le sh\u00e9rif, et adjug\u00e9e au mis-en-cause Jean Desloges, pour la somme de $1,700.\nLe 16 ao\u00fbt 1954, l'appelant Roland Boileau a fait opposition au jugement rendu par le protonotaire le 30 d\u00e9cembre 1953, qui le condamna \u00e0 payer $3,000 \u00e0 la Couronne, et demanda que ledit jugement et que la vente de sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en ex\u00e9cution de ce m\u00eame jugement par le sh\u00e9rif au mis-en-cause Desloges en date du 9 juillet 1954, soient annul\u00e9s \u00e0 toutes fins que de droit. La Couronne a contest\u00e9 cette opposition en disant que l'appelant connaissait le jugement du 30 d\u00e9cembre 1953, d\u00e8s le moment o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu, et soutient cette pr\u00e9tention par le fait que le 12 janvier 1954 il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate civile. Or, l'on sait qu'une opposition \u00e0 jugement, en vertu des termes du Code de proc\u00e9dure civile, doit \u00eatre produite dans les quinze jours de la signification du jugement (C.P. arts. 1166 et 1167).\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a maintenu l'opposition de l'appelant, a annul\u00e9 le jugement rendu par le protonotaire pour confiscation de cautionnement rendu par d\u00e9faut contre lui, le 30 d\u00e9cembre 1953; a cass\u00e9 et annul\u00e9 toutes les proc\u00e9dures d'ex\u00e9cution \u00e9mises contre l'appelant, et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 nulle la vente par le sh\u00e9rif au mis-en-cause Desloges. La Cour d'Appel a fait droit \u00e0 l'appel et a rejet\u00e9 l'opposition avec d\u00e9pens, M. le juge S. McDougall dissident.\nIl faut en premier lieu retenir de toute la preuve qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 offerte, que l'appelant Boileau n'a jamais sign\u00e9 le cautionnement qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9 sur sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9, et qu'il n'a pas plus autoris\u00e9 Me Demers \u00e0 instituer en son nom des proc\u00e9dures en requ\u00eate civile pour faire r\u00e9voquer le jugement de confiscation de cautionnement en date du 30 d\u00e9cembre 1953. Il ignorait aussi totalement que sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 vendue par le sh\u00e9rif, et ce n'est que lorsqu'il a voulu percevoir ses loyers, ce qu'il faisait d'une fa\u00e7on tr\u00e8s irr\u00e9guli\u00e8re, qu'on lui a appris que les locataires avaient pay\u00e9 au nouveau propri\u00e9taire, le mis-en-cause. C'est alors qu'il se rendit, le 6 ao\u00fbt 1954, au greffe de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure du district d'Arthabaska, et qu'il a su d\u00e9finitivement que son immeuble avait \u00e9t\u00e9 vendu en satisfaction du jugement rendu par le protonotaire. Le 16 ao\u00fbt, par cons\u00e9quent dans les d\u00e9lais pr\u00e9vus au Code de proc\u00e9dure civile, il produisit son opposition \u00e0 jugement. La pr\u00e9tention de l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 l'effet qu'il \u00e9tait au courant de ce jugement lorsqu'il a produit sa requ\u00eate civile ne peut \u00eatre accueillie. La preuve me semble concluante qu'il n'a jamais autoris\u00e9 personne \u00e0 instituer ces proc\u00e9dures, qu'il n'a jamais parl\u00e9 de cette affaire \u00e0 qui que ce soit, et son opposition n'est donc pas tardive.\nL'intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend aussi que si l'appelant n'a pas autoris\u00e9 la production de la requ\u00eate civile, son seul recours \u00e9tait une requ\u00eate en d\u00e9saveu (art. 251 C.P.), et qu'\u00e0 d\u00e9faut de se pr\u00e9valoir de ce moyen, les effets de la requ\u00eate civile subsistent. Avec d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, je ne crois pas ce moyen fond\u00e9. L'article 251 C.P. se lit ainsi:\n251. La partie peut d\u00e9savouer le procureur ad litem qui exc\u00e8de ses pouvoirs. Elle peut \u00e9galement d\u00e9savouer celui qu'elle n'a pas constitu\u00e9, sans pr\u00e9judice de ses droits si elle ne le fait pas.\nOn a cit\u00e9 une nombreuse jurisprudence et des autorit\u00e9s pour \u00e9tablir qu'en France le d\u00e9saveu est d'une imp\u00e9rieuse n\u00e9cessit\u00e9, et qu'\u00e0 d\u00e9faut de s'en pr\u00e9valoir, la proc\u00e9dure non d\u00e9savou\u00e9e demeure et ne peut \u00eatre r\u00e9pudi\u00e9e.\nMais en France, le Code de proc\u00e9dure ne fait pas la distinction que fait le n\u00f4tre d'une fa\u00e7on non \u00e9quivoqe. Cheznous, le l\u00e9gislateur a clairement divis\u00e9 le cas du procureur qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 constitu\u00e9 ad litem et qui, dans l'exercice de son mandat, exc\u00e8de ses pouvoirs, et celui de cet autre procureur qui n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 constitu\u00e9, n'ayant re\u00e7u aucun mandat. En vertu de l'art. 251 de notre Code, dans le premier cas, il faut avoir recours au d\u00e9saveu pour r\u00e9pudier des actes non autoris\u00e9s. Dans le second cas, cette proc\u00e9dure est \u00e9galement permise, mais n'est pas de rigueur, et si la partie juge \u00e0 propos de ne pas s'en pr\u00e9valoir, ce sera sans pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 ses droits. C'est-\u00e0-dire que d'autres recours lui sont donn\u00e9s, comme ceux qui appartiennent \u00e0 une personne qui veut r\u00e9pudier les actes de celui qui, sans autorisation, a assum\u00e9 le r\u00f4le de mandataire.\nLa jurisprudence de Qu\u00e9bec n'est pas riche sur ce point, et je crois que la cause qui se rapproche davantage de celle que nous avons \u00e0 d\u00e9cider est celle de Cooke v. Caron et al., jug\u00e9e en premier lieu par la Cour de Revision 2 et en second lieu par la Cour du Banc de la Reine 3. Dans cette cause il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le d\u00e9saveu par requ\u00eate n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire parce que les procureurs ad litem d\u00e9savou\u00e9s avaient produit une admission \u00e9crite de leur part qu'ils n'\u00e9taient pas autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 produire une comparution. Dans le cas qui nous occupe, Me Demers a admis, comme dans la cause de Cooke v. Caron et al. que j'ai cit\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, qu'il n'avait re\u00e7u aucune instruction de l'appelant.\nIl y a donc similitude entre les deux cas. De plus, M. le Juge Casault, l'un des juges qui a si\u00e9g\u00e9 en Cour de Revision, s'exprime de la fa\u00e7on suivante \u00e0 la page 155:\nDans ce cas, il y a mandat, et le mandant ne peut d\u00e9savouer et r\u00e9pudier que ce qui n'\u00e9tait pas compris dans le pouvoir g\u00e9n\u00e9ral que le mandat conf\u00e9rait au mandataire ou qui n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 sp\u00e9cialement autoris\u00e9; mais, lorsqu'il n'y a aucun mandat quelconque et que celui qui a comparu n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 constitu\u00e9 par la partie, il n'y a pas eu de repr\u00e9sentation valable de la partie; la nullit\u00e9 est, par l\u00e0-m\u00eame, radicale, et tout ce que la pr\u00e9sence d'un procureur la repr\u00e9sentant a pu autoriser, permettre ou valider est un consentement non autoris\u00e9 qui, apr\u00e8s jugement, donne lieu \u00e0 la requ\u00eate civile.\nJe crois donc que les auteurs fran\u00e7ais qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9s ne peuvent jeter aucune lumi\u00e8re sur le cas qui nous occupe, pas plus que les jugements de la province de Qu\u00e9bec dans Courchaine v. Courchaine et al. 4; Dorion v. Dorion 5, et Fournier et vir v. Tr\u00e9panier et Paradis 6. Dans ces derni\u00e8res causes, il s'agissait de cas o\u00f9 le procureur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 effectivement constitu\u00e9, mais avait d\u00e9pass\u00e9 les limites du mandat qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9. On a donc justement appliqu\u00e9 les principes contenus dans la premi\u00e8re partie de l'art. 251 C.P.\nL'intim\u00e9 soutient aussi que l'authenticit\u00e9 du cautionnement fourni par l'appelant ne pouvait \u00eatre attaqu\u00e9e qu'au moyen d'une inscription en faux. Sa pr\u00e9tention est que le cautionnement qu'il a donn\u00e9 est un acte authentique (C.C. 1207) qui, en vertu de l'art. 1211 du Code Civil, ne peut \u00eatre mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9 en tout ou en partie, qu'en suivant les prescriptions des arts. 225 et suivants du Code de proc\u00e9dure civile.\nLa jurisprudence sur la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de se pourvoir par inscription en faux est bien \u00e9tablie, et on doit avoir recours \u00e0 ce moyen lorsque la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 de l'officier public est mise en question. Lorsque ce dernier a fid\u00e8lement relat\u00e9 ce qu'il a vu et entendu, la proc\u00e9dure par inscription en faux n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire. Comme le dit M. le Juge Archambault dans une cause de T\u00e9treault v. Desserres 7:\n\u2026 l'acte authentique ne peut \u00eatre contredit et mis \u00e0 n\u00e9ant comme faux en tout ou en partie que sur inscription en faux, \u2026 en la mani\u00e8re prescrite au Code de proc\u00e9dure \u2026 Du moment que l'on n'attaque pas la validit\u00e9 ou la sinc\u00e9rit\u00e9 de l'officier public, du notaire devant qui l'acte a \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9, l'inscription en faux n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire, mais lorsqu'il s'agit d'un fait que l'officier public a constat\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame, la preuve contraire sans une inscription en faux lorsqu'une objection formelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite \u2026 doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e \u2026\nOn pourra consulter \u00e9galement au m\u00eame effet, Langelier, De la Preuve (1894), p. 168; Anderson v. Pr\u00e9vost et al. 8; Cloutier v. Baron 9; Phoenix Assurance Company Limited, of London, England v. Lagueux 10; Doyon v. Doyon 11.\nDans le cas qui nous occupe, la sinc\u00e9rit\u00e9 du protonotaire n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en doute et, en cons\u00e9quence, il n'\u00e9tait nullement n\u00e9cessaire de proc\u00e9der par inscription en faux.\nLe dernier moyen invoqu\u00e9 est que l'adjudicataire de l'immeuble et mis-en-cause Desloges a obtenu de bonne foi un titre du sh\u00e9rif et que, dans l'occurrence, la nullit\u00e9 du d\u00e9cret ne peut \u00eatre prononc\u00e9e au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de l'appelant. On sait qu'en vertu des dispositions de l'art. 781 du Code de proc\u00e9dure civile, le d\u00e9cret purge tous les droits r\u00e9els non compris dans les conditions de la vente, sauf quelques exceptions qui y sont mentionn\u00e9es. En vertu de l'art. 784, le d\u00e9cret peut \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9 nul \u00e0 la poursuite du saisi ou de ' tout cr\u00e9ancier ou autre int\u00e9ress\u00e9, s'il y a eu dol ou artifices \u00e0 la connaissance de l'adjudicataire pour \u00e9carter les ench\u00e8res; ou encore si les conditions et formalit\u00e9s essentielles prescrites pour la vente n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 observ\u00e9es.\nDans le cas qui nous occupe, le saisi, appelant dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, n'a pas proc\u00e9d\u00e9 par voie de requ\u00eate en nullit\u00e9 de d\u00e9cret mais par voie d'opposition. La requ\u00eate en nullit\u00e9 de d\u00e9cret mentionn\u00e9e \u00e0 cet art. 784 n'est pas le seul rem\u00e8de qui appartienne \u00e0 une partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e, et le d\u00e9cret peut \u00e9galement \u00eatre mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9 si le recours est exerc\u00e9 par action directe. Dans une cause de La Corporation de la Partie Sud de la Paroisse du Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur-de-Marie v. Barquin et Fontaine et al. 12, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'une demande en nullit\u00e9 de d\u00e9cret peut \u00eatre poursuivie par voie d'action directe, pourvu que cette action contienne tout ce qui est essentiel \u00e0 la requ\u00eate. Vide \u00e9galement Paul v. Giroux et McNamara et al. 13, et Lizotte v. Gasse 14. Dans Trudeau et al. v. Devost 15, cette Cour a aussi d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'une action comprend n\u00e9cessairement une requ\u00eate, et que le fait d'annexer \u00e0 une demande un bref de sommation ne peut avoir pour effet d'invalider la proc\u00e9dure. Je suis en outre d'opinion que si le recours en nullit\u00e9 de d\u00e9cret peut \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 par action directe, il peut \u00e9galement l'\u00eatre par opposition \u00e0 jugement, comme dans le pr\u00e9sent cas, o\u00f9 les proc\u00e9dures par opposition ont \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9es moins de six semaines apr\u00e8s la date de la vente par le sh\u00e9rif au mis-en-cause Desloges.\nLe titre consenti par le sh\u00e9rif est \u00e9videmment un titre auquel on ne doit toucher qu'avec une extr\u00eame prudence. Mais il y a des cas o\u00f9 le d\u00e9cret a \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9 m\u00eame pour des raisons non mentionn\u00e9es sp\u00e9cifiquement \u00e0 l'art. 784 C.P. A part des cas fr\u00e9quents, o\u00f9 le titre du sh\u00e9rif a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 nul parce que la vente avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite super non domino, con- trairement aux dispositions de l'art. 699 C.P.C. (Patton v. Morin 16; Dufresne et al. v. Dixon 17), il y en a d'autres o\u00f9, par exemple, la Cour a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 nuls le jugement sur action hypoth\u00e9caire obtenu contre un d\u00e9fendeur, et le d\u00e9cret qui s'en est suivi, parce que le d\u00e9fendeur n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e9galement assign\u00e9 devant le tribunal: Legault v. Surprenant; Faquin v. Surprenant 18. Dans ses raisons, l'honorable Juge Dorion cite la cause de Turcotte v. Dansereau 19, o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'un jugement obtenu sur une signification fausse \u00e9tait invalide et de nul effet. Si un jugement obtenu apr\u00e8s au faux rapport de signification d'un huissier doit \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9 invalide, ainsi en est-il du cas o\u00f9 la pr\u00e9tendue cr\u00e9ance contre le d\u00e9biteur saisi est repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par un jugement qui est nul, parce que bas\u00e9 sur un faux document. Le saisi ne devait rien, n'\u00e9tait d\u00e9biteur de personne, et il ignorait cette saisie et cette vente. Il serait inconcevable qu'un rem\u00e8de ne puisse \u00eatre apport\u00e9 \u00e0 une semblable injustice.\nLe mis-en-cause \u00e9tait \u00e9videmment de bonne foi. Il s'est port\u00e9 adjudicataire de cet immeuble, a pay\u00e9 la somme de $1,700 et a obtenu un titre du sh\u00e9rif. Aussi importe-t-il de ne lui imposer aucuns frais, et de lui r\u00e9server tous les recours qu'il peut avoir de r\u00e9p\u00e9ter le montant qu'il a pay\u00e9. La m\u00eame r\u00e9serve doit \u00e9galement \u00eatre faite en faveur de l'appelant pour le recouvrement des loyers \u00e9chus et per\u00e7us depuis l'adjudication.\nL'appel doit donc \u00eatre maintenu avec d\u00e9pens de toutes les Cours contre l'intim\u00e9. Le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure doit \u00eatre modifi\u00e9 en y ajoutant que les droits que peut avoir le mis-en-cause Desloges, de recouvrer la somme de $1,700 qu'il a pay\u00e9e pour le prix d'adjudication lui sont r\u00e9serv\u00e9s, de m\u00eame que ceux de l'appelant en ce qui concerne les loyers qu'il n'a pas per\u00e7us. Il n'y aura pas d'ordonnance quant aux frais contre les mis-en-cause.\nRand T.:\u2014The material facts in this appeal can best be appreciated by stating them chronologically. In April 1953 a man named Perreault was accused of theft and placed under arrest. In the same month he was released on bail in the sum of $3,000 under a bond signed by himself and as surety by one whose signature was in the name Roland Boileau. As an additional security the latter purported to hypothecate a lot of land bearing nos. 1215-1217 St. Dominique Street, Montreal. Perreault failed to appear in court on October 21, 1953, the appropriate day, and the bond was declared forfeited. On December 30, 1953, in the Superior Court, judgment was entered by the prothonotary against both Perreault and Boileau for the sum of $3,000 with interest and costs. On January 7, 1954, an application was made by an attorney on behalf of Perreault and purportedly of Boileau by way of requ\u00eate civile to recall the judgment on the ground, in substance, that there had been no default in the condition of the bond, and on March 16, 1954, this was rejected. On April 9, 1954, execution was issued and after a return of nulla bona the property at 1215-1217 St. Dominique Street was on May 6 levied on and on July 9, 1954, sold for $1,700.\nIn this I am assuming the facts to indicate that the name on the bond was intended to designate the appellant. The attorney, acting on the requ\u00eate civile, clearly intended to act not for the appellant as owner of the property, but for the person, whoever he was, who signed the bond as surety. The same can be said of the intention of the officer entering judgment. I put all that aside, however, and treat the plaintiff, personally unknown to both the attorney and the representative of the Crown, to have been the person against and on behalf of whom the various steps were intended to be taken.\nThe property consisted of a lodging-house and on or about August 7, 1954, Boileau, in course of collecting the rents from a woman in charge, was told that they had been paid to another who had become owner. As a result of what he subsequently learned, on August 16, 1954, the present proceedings by way of opposition to judgment were commenced.\nThe ground on which they are based is that the appellant, the owner of the property described, was not the person who signed or authorized the signature to the bond, that so far as the name can be taken to designate him, the signature was a forgery.\nAt the trial the appellant and the attorney who had initiated the requ\u00eate civile were witnesses. It was admitted by the latter that, realizing the application would have to be made on behalf of both parties to the bond, he intended to represent not only Perreault who instructed him, but also the person who signed the bond, but that he did not know who that man was and had no communication with him, neither is it suggested by him or by anything brought before the Court that Perreault did more than, on his own behalf, request the attorney to try to have the judgment revoked.\nEdge J. in the Superior Court found as a fact that the signature was not that of the appellant and that there was no authorization by him to anyone to sign the bond and that the case was a simple one of forgery by a person unknown who with Perreault had conspired to bring about a fraud on the Court. He thereupon allowed the action, set aside the judgment and declared all the proceedings taken on it to be void.\nIn the Court of Queen's Bench the question that assumed controlling importance was this: by art. 251 of the Code of Civil Procedure provision is made for the disavowal of an attorney ad litem who has exceeded his powers or has acted without any authority whatever. This disavowal under the settled rules must be asserted by an independent proceeding instituted against the attorney and the issue of authority or not must be decided before the action in which it is raised, such as the opposition to judgment here, can be carried to adjudication.\nApplying this article to the requ\u00eate civile, it was held, McDougall J. dissenting, that no step in disavowal having been taken against the attorney in respect of the judgment of rejection of March 16, 1954, there was a fatal omission of a condition precedent to the present proceeding and that the judgment of Edge J. must be set aside.\nMartineau J. in a thorough examination of the question reviewed the law of France and Quebec and there is no doubt that the general principle enunciated in the authorities cited is well established. In the second paragraph of art. 251, which deals with the case of a total absence of authority, the failure of a disavowal is declared to be \"without prejudice to [the] rights [of the party]\". This proviso, I agree, is somewhat obscure, but in any consideration of it the fact should not be overlooked that there is no such reservation in the corresponding article of the Code of Procedure of France.\nWith the greatest respect, however, an examination of the articles which elaborate the rule of disavowal makes it, I think, abundantly clear that the failure of disavowal must be in relation to the judgment or other act which is the object of attack in the proceeding in opposition. For instance, art. 253 limits the disavowal to the party or his attorney under a special power and the party himself must declare \"that he did not authorize the proceeding which he repudiates\"; art. 254 follows this in using the language \"a declaration that the party disavows the act in question as never having authorized the same\"; art. 258 declares that \"if the disavowal is maintained, the acts disavowed are annulled\".\nWhat, then, was the act for the annulment of which these proceedings were brought? It was obviously the original judgment which was entered under the authority of s. 1115 of the former Criminal Code. That was done ex parte, and in the absence of both of the parties to the bond and of any person representing either of them. The application made in January to set aside that judgment is a subordinate proceeding, the validity of which, by the challenge now made, rests entirely upon the validity of the former; if that is set aside, everything depending on it automatically falls.\nThis was the view taken by the parties in the pleadings. The opposition makes no mention of the requ\u00eate but goes straight to the judgment as having been signed without jurisdiction over the appellant. The defence raised the matter of the application but not for the purpose of showing that disavowal proceedings had not been taken; it was raised expressly for the purpose of showing knowledge in the appellant of the bail bond and of the original proceedings at least as early as January 1954, and that he had by that step acknowledged himself to be the surety named. Since, then, it is the original judgment alone with which the opposition is concerned, no question of disavowal arises. The requ\u00eate proceeding, apart from its evidential value of notice or of admission, is not in issue; its validity is wrapped up in that of the original judgment; and the question on which the Court of Queen's Bench proceeded does not arise.\nThe findings of fact by Edge J. seem to me to follow necessarily from the evidence ; and they show that Boileau, the appellant, had no connection with any of the steps taken in his name, that the Court never had jurisdiction over him, and that the entire proceedings are a nullity.\nA question remains of the position of the mis-en-cause. I agree with my brother Taschereau that where what bears the form of a judgment is declared to be a nullity, a judicial sale based on it, as in this case, is equally null. The contrary was not seriously urged before us. I agree also with the reservations proposed by him to be embodied in the judgment as to both the mis-en-cause and the appellant. There will be no costs in any court against the mis-en-cause and the appellant will have his costs against the respondent throughout.\nCartwright J.:\u2014I agree with the reasons of my brother Taschereau and those of my brother Rand, and would accordingly dispose of the appeal as proposed by my brother Taschereau.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Hyde & Ahem, Montreal.\nSolicitor for the respondent : Raymond Beaudet, Victoriaville.\n1 [1956] Que.

Mis-En-Cause.\n1957: February 7, 8, 11, 12; 1957: May 13.\nPresent: Taschereau, Kellock, Fauteux, Abbott and Nolan JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nTaxation\u2014Municipal land taxes\u2014\"Immoveables\"\u2014Machinery placed in a building and used in the operation of an industry\u2014Whether immoveable by destination\u2014Meaning of \"\u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure\"\u2014Cities and Towns Act, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 233, s. 488\u2014Civil Code, arts. 379, 380.\nThe plaintiff sought to have included in the assessment roll of the defendant city as a taxable immoveable under s. 488 of the Cities and Towns Act, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 233, certain machinery owned and used by the defendant companies in the operation of their industries, on the ground that it had become immoveable by destination. The Courts below found as a fact that none of the machinery was actually incorporated into the buildings. The trial judge held the machinery to be moveable but this judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld: The machinery had become immoveable by destination and was therefore taxable under s. 488 of the Cities and Towns Act.\nPer Taschereau, Fauteux and Abbott JJ.: In France, there are two ways by which a moveable object can become immoveable by destination: (i) when the object is placed on an immoveable for its service even without any physical attachment and without any necessity of permanency; and (ii) when it is physically attached to the immoveable \"\u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure\". The same two means of immobilization exist in the Quebec law, but with the difference that here the moveable must be placed \"\u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure\" in both cases. The French doctrine of industrial and agricultural immobilization exists in the Quebec law if the object is placed permanently, that is to say, with the intention to keep it there so long as it remains useful, but not excluding the possibility of replacement or even removal in the future. Article 379 of the Civil Code, which merely requires that the moveable be placed permanently and which is not limitative, is sufficient to immobilize by destination, without the necessity of referring to art. 380, which creates only a presumption juris tantum of immobilization when the moveables are physically attached to an immoveable. In the case at bar, the machinery was placed for a permanency within the meaning of art. 379 in the building for the purpose of industry, it was indispensable for the operation of the industry and was an essential accessory to the buildings in which it was placed \"\u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure\". This rendered the machinery immoveable under art. 379 and it was not necessary to resort to art. 380 to complete the immobilization.\nPer Kellock and Nolan JJ.: If the proprietor of a building suitable for an industrial process places in it machinery for the purpose of carrying on that process permanently and not merely temporarily, such machinery becomes immobilized under art. 379 of the Civil Code, whether or not any part of it falls within the first paragraph of art. 380. It does not matter if the same building could be devoted equally well to some other industrial purpose; nor will its nature be changed merely by some happening that results in the abandonment of the intention to carry on permanently. The evidence of the proprietor as to his intention is, at the least, admissible evidence.\nThe word \"attached\" in art. 380 does not mean \"physically attached\", but rather \"joined\" or \"united\" or \"annexed\" or \"appropriated (affect\u00e9)\" to the realty.\nThe words \"\u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure\" must have the same meaning in both arts. 379 and 380 of the Code. If the moveable is fastened in a durable manner, or if it is not removable without breakage or without destruction or deterioration, or if it serves to complete or perfect the realty, then it is placed \"\u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure\". What is envisaged by para. 2 of art. 379 is a building designed for the carrying on of the enterprise therein mentioned. In the case at bar, the machinery was placed upon the premises to complete them.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec 1, reversing the judgment of Marchand J.

The judgment of Taschereau, Fauteux and Abbott JJ. was delivered by\nTaschereau J.:\u2014Le litige qui nous est soumis pr\u00e9sente de tr\u00e8s s\u00e9rieuses difficult\u00e9s l\u00e9gales, et sa solution aura sans doute une influence consid\u00e9rable sur l'\u00e9conomie industrielle et sur le pouvoir de taxation des cit\u00e9s et villes.\nA Sherbrooke, comme dans bien d'autres endroits de la province, la ville doit pr\u00e9parer le r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation, qui sert \u00e9galement de base \u00e0 la taxe scolaire. Pour l'ann\u00e9e 1954, des experts nomm\u00e9s par la ville, ont \u00e9valu\u00e9 les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s imposables, mais, avec l'assentiment du conseil, et malgr\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sentations oppos\u00e9es, certaines machineries propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de 265 manufactures et industries, n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9es au r\u00f4le. La pr\u00e9tention \u00e9tait, comme elle l'est encore, que ces machineries, n'\u00e9tant pas immeubles, mais bien des effets mobiliers, n'\u00e9taient pas assujetties \u00e0 la taxation fonci\u00e8re. Le r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation fut donc homologu\u00e9, sans mention de ces machineries, dont la valeur \u00e9tait de $4,706,446.85.\nLa commission scolaire, intim\u00e9e dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, et dont le budget se trouvait s\u00e9rieusement affect\u00e9 par cette omission, s'autorisant d'un amendement apport\u00e9 \u00e0 la loi, par la L\u00e9gislature de Qu\u00e9bec, institua alors des proc\u00e9dures l\u00e9gales qui ont abouti jusqu'\u00e0 cette Cour.\nLe bureau des commissaires porta plainte devant le bureau de revision, et ce dernier, all\u00e9guant absence de juridiction, refusa d'entendre la plainte. L'affaire fut alors r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e au conseil municipal de la cit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke, qui en vint \u00e0 la conclusion que les biens en question n'\u00e9taient pas des immeubles, et, en cons\u00e9quence, maintint le r\u00f4le tel que pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par les estimateurs, et rejeta le prot\u00eat de la commission scolaire catholique romaine de Sherbrooke.\nLe bureau des commissaires en appela \u00e0 la Cour de magistrat du district de Saint-Fran\u00e7ois, et M. le juge Marchand, le 30 mai 1955, confirma la d\u00e9cision du conseil de la cit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke, maintint le r\u00f4le tel que pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par les estimateurs, et rejeta \u00e9galement le prot\u00eat de la commission scolaire de Sherbrooke. La Cour du Banc de. la Reine fut saisie \u00e0 son tour de la question et le 28 mars 1956, maintint l'appel 2 de la commission scolaire, et ordonna \u00e0 la cit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke d'ajouter \u00e0 son r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation la valeur de la machinerie apparaissant \u00e0 la liste appel\u00e9e \"machineries suppl\u00e9mentaires\", et appartenant aux mis-en-cause.\nLes parties ne contestent pas les faits tels qu'ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablis par M. le juge Marchand. Le magistrat s'exprime dans les termes suivants:\nComme r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la preuve, on peut dire que les mis-en-cause, \u00e0 l'exception de deux sont propri\u00e9taires d'\u00e9tablissements ou b\u00e2tisses que l'on a qualifi\u00e9s d'industriels ou commerciaux, et que ladite machinerie \"Supplementary Machinery\" se trouve dans les dits \u00e9tablissements et est utilis\u00e9e pour les fins de l'industrie ou du commerce y exploit\u00e9s. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli en outre que cette machinerie se trouve dans les dits \u00e9tablissements pour un temps ind\u00e9fini, en ce sens que ladite \"machinerie, en autant que les mis-en-cause maintiendront leurs op\u00e9rations actuelles, sera utilis\u00e9e tant qu'elle sera en \u00e9tat de fonctionner ou tant qu'elle ne sera pas remplac\u00e9e par une autre machinerie plus moderne ou plus apte \u00e0 donner un meilleur rendement, mais sans qu'il puisse \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9 actuellement \u00e0 quelle \u00e9poque la machinerie peut \u00eatre ainsi remplac\u00e9e. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli \u00e9galement que la presque totalit\u00e9 de ladite machinerie est retenue \u00e0 des planchers de ciment ou de bois par vis ou 'lag-screws', soit pour emp\u00eacher ou diminuer la vibration, soit pour la maintenir en alignement\".\nIl s'agit donc de d\u00e9terminer la nature de ces machineries. Si ce sont des immeubles, le jugement de la Cour du Banc de la Reine doit \u00eatre confirm\u00e9; si ce sont des biens mobiliers, le jugement de M. le juge Marchand est bien fond\u00e9, et doit \u00eatre r\u00e9tabli.\nLes articles de la Loi des cit\u00e9s et villes, S.R.Q. 1941, c. 233, qu'il est n\u00e9cessaire de consid\u00e9rer pour arriver \u00e0 la d\u00e9termination de la pr\u00e9sente cause, sont les suivants:\n485. Il est du devoir des estimateurs de faire, chaque ann\u00e9e, au temps et en la mani\u00e8re ordonn\u00e9s par le conseil, l'\u00e9valuation des biens imposables de la municipalit\u00e9, suivant leur valeur r\u00e9elle.\n488. Les immeubles imposables dans la municipalit\u00e9 comprennent les terrains, les constructions et les usines qui y sont \u00e9rig\u00e9es et toutes am\u00e9liorations qui y ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites, de m\u00eame que les machineries et accessoires qui sont immeubles par destination ou qui le seraient, s'ils appartenaient au propri\u00e9taire du fonds. La valeur r\u00e9elle du tout est port\u00e9e au r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation au nom du propri\u00e9taire du fonds; mais si ce dernier prouve aux estimateurs que des machineries ou accessoires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9s par un locataire ou autre occupant, la valeur de ces machineries et accessoires est port\u00e9e au nom du locataire ou occupant qui les poss\u00e8de et qui, \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, est trait\u00e9 comme un propri\u00e9taire d'immeubles imposables.\n521. Le conseil peut imposer et pr\u00e9lever annuellement, sur tout immeuble dans la municipalit\u00e9, une taxe n'exc\u00e9dant pas deux pour cent de la valeur r\u00e9elle, telle que port\u00e9e au r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation. La seconde question est de savoir si les machineries qui n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9es au r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation, si elles ne sont pas des biens mobiliers, sont ou ne sont pas des immeubles par destination. C'est en cons\u00e9quence au Code civil qu'il faut avoir recours pour solutionner la question et particuli\u00e8rement aux arts. 379 et 380 qui se lisent ainsi:\n379. Les objets mobiliers que le propri\u00e9taire a plac\u00e9s sur son fonds \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure, ou qu'il y a incorpor\u00e9s, sont immeubles par destination tant qu'ils y restent.\nAinsi sont immeubles, sous ces restrictions, les objets suivants et autres semblables:\n1. Les pressoirs, chaudi\u00e8res, alambics, cuves et tonnes;\n2. Les ustensiles n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 l'exploitation des forges, papeteries et autres usines.\nSont aussi immeubles par destination les fumiers ainsi que les pailles et autres substances destin\u00e9es \u00e0 le devenir.\n380. Sont cens\u00e9s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 attach\u00e9s \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure les objets plac\u00e9s par le propri\u00e9taire qui tiennent \u00e0 fer et \u00e0 clous, qui sont scell\u00e9s en pl\u00e2tre, \u00e0 chaux ou \u00e0 ciment, ou qui ne peuvent \u00eatre enlev\u00e9s sans \u00eatre fractur\u00e9s, ou sans briser ou d\u00e9t\u00e9riorer la partie du fonds \u00e0 laquelle ils sont attach\u00e9s.\nLes glaces, les tableaux et autres ornements sont cens\u00e9s mis \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure, lorsque, sans eux, la partie de l'appartement qu'ils couvrent demeurerait incompl\u00e8te ou imparfaite.\nIl ne fait pas de doute que le Code civil de la province de Qu\u00e9bec et le Code Napol\u00e9on, en ce qui concerne \"les immeubles par destination\", diff\u00e8rent sous certains aspects. Les articles suivants du code fran\u00e7ais, qui, sans \u00eatre identiques aux n\u00f4tres, reconnaissent aussi l'immobilisation par destination, peuvent sans doute nous aider \u00e0 solutionner le probl\u00e8me qui nous int\u00e9resse. Ce sont les arts. 524 et 525 C.N. qui se lisent ainsi:\n524. Les objets que le propri\u00e9taire d'un fonda y a plac\u00e9s pour le service et l'exploitation de ce fonds, sont immeubles par destination.\nAinsi, sont immeubles par destination, quand ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9s par le propri\u00e9taire pour le service et l'exploitation du fonds:\nLes animaux attach\u00e9s \u00e0 la culture;\nLes ustensiles aratoires;\nLes semences donn\u00e9es aux fermiers ou colons partiaires;\nLes pigeons des colombiers;\nLes lapins des garennes;\nLes ruches \u00e0 miel;\nLes poissons des \u00e9tangs;\nLes pressoirs, chaudi\u00e8res, alambics, cuves et tonnes;\nLes ustensiles n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 l'exploitation des forges, papeteries et autres usines;\nLes pailles et engrais.\nSont aussi immeubles par destination, tous effets mobiliers que le propri\u00e9taire a attach\u00e9s au fonds \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure. 525. Le propri\u00e9taire est cens\u00e9 avoir attach\u00e9 \u00e0 son fonds des effets mobiliers \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure, quand ils y sont scell\u00e9s en pl\u00e2tre ou \u00e0 chaux ou \u00e0 ciment, ou lorsqu'ils ne peuvent \u00eatre d\u00e9tach\u00e9s sans \u00eatre fractur\u00e9s et d\u00e9t\u00e9rior\u00e9s, ou sans briser ou d\u00e9t\u00e9riorer la partie du fonds \u00e0 laquelle ils sont attach\u00e9s.\nLes glaces d'un appartement sont cens\u00e9es mises \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure, lorsque le parquet sur lequel elles sont attach\u00e9es fait corps avec la boiserie.\nIl en est de m\u00eame des tableaux et autres ornements.\nQuant aux statues, elles sont immeubles lorsqu'elles sont plac\u00e9es dans une niche pratiqu\u00e9e expr\u00e8s pour les recevoir, encore qu'elles puissent \u00eatre enlev\u00e9es sans fracture ou d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration.\nA la lecture des articles ci-dessus, il ressort qu'en France, l'immobilisation, sans la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 \"de placement \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure\", est compl\u00e8te, et rend immeubles, les objets qui sont meubles par nature, si les choses ainsi plac\u00e9es sur un fonds, m\u00eame sans attaches mat\u00e9rielles, sont affect\u00e9es au service de l'immeuble, ou d'une entreprise agricole, industrielle, commerciale ou artisanale. En cons\u00e9quence, en vertu des dispositions de l'art. 524, peuvent devenir immeubles par destination, des biens de nature mobili\u00e8re, que par une fiction de la loi celle-ci d\u00e9clare immobiliers, simplement par un lien intellectuel, parce qu'ils se rattachent \u00e0 l'immeuble \u00e0 titre d'accessoire. Ainsi \u00e9vite-t-on la dissociation de biens qui \u00e9conomiquement forment un tout, et deviennent soumis au m\u00eame r\u00e9gime juridique, en cas de saisie, de constitution d'hypoth\u00e8que, de partage, de legs, ou pour l'application des r\u00e8gles des r\u00e9gimes matrimoniaux. Vide: Dalloz, Nouveau R\u00e9pertoire, vol. I, p. 371. Deux conditions seulement sont requises. Il faut, en premier lieu, que le meuble et l'immeuble appartiennent \u00e0 la m\u00eame personne, et, en second lieu, il faut n\u00e9cessairement qu'il existe un rapport de destination entre les deux objects: Planiol et Ripert, 2e ed. 1952, vol. 3, p. 81; Pandectes fran\u00e7aises, vol. 13, p. 55, n\u00b0 151. Mais l'\u00e9num\u00e9ration que l'on trouve dans l'art. 524 n'a rien de limitatif, et elle ne contient que des exemples que donne le l\u00e9gislateur. M\u00eame en dehors de cette \u00e9num\u00e9ration, tout ce qui est plac\u00e9 sur un fonds par le propri\u00e9taire pour le service et l'exploitation de son fonds, est immeuble par destination: Planiol et Ripert, vol. 3, 2e ed. 1952, p. 84; Dalloz-Encyclop\u00e9die vol. I, p. 452, n\u00b0 116; Pandectes fran\u00e7aises, vol. 13, p. 57, nos 173, 174, 175; Fuzier-Herman, Code civil annot\u00e9 1935, vol. 1, p. 625, nos 65, 66, 67. Mais le Code fran\u00e7ais reconna\u00eet deux moyens d'immobilisation des effets mobiliers: le premier que je viens d'exposer, o\u00f9 un lien intellectuel sert \u00e0 l'affectation du meuble au service de l'immeuble, ou d'une entreprise agricole, industrielle, commerciale ou artisanale qui y est exploit\u00e9e; et le second qui consiste en un lien mat\u00e9riel lorsqu'on attache le meuble \u00e0 l'immeuble, \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure. En ce cas, pour que l'immobilisation devienne parfaite, il faut, suivant les dispositions de l'art. 525 C.N., que les effets immobiliers soient scell\u00e9s en pl\u00e2tre, \u00e0 chaux ou \u00e0 ciment, ou qu'ils ne puissent \u00eatre d\u00e9tach\u00e9s sans \u00eatre fractur\u00e9s et d\u00e9t\u00e9rior\u00e9s, ou sans pour les enlever, que l'on brise ou d\u00e9t\u00e9riore la partie du fonds \u00e0 laquelle ils sont attach\u00e9s. Mais comme le signalent Planiol et Ripert, Droit civil, vol. 3, p. 92, les modes d'adh\u00e9rence que mentionne l'art. 525 C.N., sont \u00e9nonciatifs seulement et non limitatifs, et les arr\u00eats admettent l'efficacit\u00e9 de toute autre marque d'adh\u00e9rence indicative d'une destination \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure. L'article 525 C.N. donne comme exemple les glaces d'un appartement: elles sont cens\u00e9es mises \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure, lorsque le parquet sur lequel elles sont attach\u00e9es fait corps avec la boiserie. Le Code y assimile des statues plac\u00e9es dans une niche pratiqu\u00e9e pour les recevoir, encore qu'elles puissent \u00eatre enlev\u00e9es sans d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration. La raison \u00e9vidente de cette derni\u00e8re disposition est que l'appartement serait incomplet si on y enlevait la statue.\nLa fixation \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure est ainsi un second moyen d'immobilisation par destination pour des objets mobiliers qui, n'\u00e9tant pas n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 l'exploitation, se trouvent cependant rattach\u00e9s au fonds par un signe ext\u00e9rieur, une attache mat\u00e9rielle: Dalloz-Encyclop\u00e9die Droit civil, vol. I, p. 458, n\u00b0 283. De cet art. 525 C.N. il r\u00e9sulte que par cela seul que des choses mobili\u00e8res attach\u00e9es \u00e0 un fonds par le propri\u00e9taire y sont scell\u00e9es en pl\u00e2tre, \u00e0 chaux ou \u00e0 ciment, elles participent de la nature de l'immeuble sans' qu'il y ait \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer quel peut \u00eatre leur degr\u00e9 d'utilit\u00e9 ou d'inutilit\u00e9 par rapport au service de cet immeuble. On verra que, par les diff\u00e9rentes applications que la loi fait par l'art. 525 C.N. du principe pos\u00e9 par le dernier alin\u00e9a de l'art. 524 C.N., il faut conclure que le fait mat\u00e9riel d'une adh\u00e9rence apparente et durable donne \u00e0 un meuble le caract\u00e8re d'un immeuble par destination; l'intention du propri\u00e9taire de l'immeuble garni par le meuble est \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard sans influence: Civ. 5 f\u00e9vrier 1878, D.P. 78.1.156. C'est cette distinction qui cr\u00e9e la diff\u00e9rence fondamentale qui existe entre ces deux arts. 524 et 525 du Code Napol\u00e9on.\nCes dispositions du Code fran\u00e7ais concernant l'immobilisation par destination tirent leur origine de la Coutume de Paris. L'article 90 de la Coutume de Paris \u00e9tait con\u00e7ue en ces termes:\nUstensiles d'h\u00f4tel, qui se peuvent transporter sans fraction et d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration, sont r\u00e9put\u00e9s meubles; mais s'ils tiennent \u00e0 fer et \u00e0 clous, et sont scell\u00e9s en pl\u00e2tre, et sont mis pour perp\u00e9tuelle demeure, et ne peuvent \u00eatre transport\u00e9s sans fraction et d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration, sont cens\u00e9s et r\u00e9put\u00e9s immeubles.\nCependant, comme le remarquent Planiol et Ripert, Droit civil, vol. 3, p. 92, Pothier avait montr\u00e9 que cette circonstance d'attaches mat\u00e9rielles et de la difficult\u00e9 qu'on pouvait avoir \u00e0 d\u00e9placer l'objet \u00e9tait en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 indiff\u00e9rente: car, disait-il, il y a des choses qui, sans \u00eatre attach\u00e9es \u00e0 fer et \u00e0 clous, sont cens\u00e9es faire partie de la maison, et d'autres qui, quoique attach\u00e9es \u00e0 fer et \u00e0 clous, ne sont pas cens\u00e9es en faire partie: Pothier, Trait\u00e9 de la Communaut\u00e9, nos 47 et suivants. Planiol et Ripert ajoutent que la critique de Pothier est aussi juste sous le droit nouveau que sous l'ancien; les auteurs du Code auraient peut-\u00eatre mieux fait, continuent les savants auteurs, de ne pas s'arr\u00eater \u00e0 la consid\u00e9ration de l'attache mat\u00e9rielle puisque l'immobilisation est possible sans elle, et qu'elle-m\u00eame ne r\u00e9ussit pas toujours \u00e0 immobiliser un objet. On avait nul besoin, dit-on, de ces dispositions, et la formule g\u00e9n\u00e9rale par laquelle d\u00e9bute l'art. 524 suffisait pour tous les cas possibles d'immobilisation par destination. Mais \u00e9videmment les codificateurs du Code Napol\u00e9on et les l\u00e9gislateurs de 1804 en ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 autrement, et ont pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 y inclure les dispositions de l'art. 525 C.N. Ils ont voulu souligner qu'il existe en droit fran\u00e7ais deux moyens d'immobilisation: celui qui r\u00e9sulte du fait de placer des objets sur un fonds pour son exploitation, sans liens mat\u00e9riels; et celui qui consiste \u00e0 attacher d'une fa\u00e7on durable un meuble \u00e0 un immeuble, par nature, m\u00eame sans utilit\u00e9 pour le fonds lui-m\u00eame. La r\u00e9daction de l'art. 524 C.N. exclut, contrairement \u00e0 l'art. 525 C.N.. toute id\u00e9e de liens mat\u00e9riels. Les articles 379 et 380 du Gode de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, ont beaucoup de similitude avec les arts. 524 et 525 C.N. Les deux codes ont en effet des origines communes, et ces r\u00e8gles d'immobilisation des biens mobiliers par destination, nous font voir les influences identiques qui ont d\u00e9termin\u00e9 les l\u00e9gislateurs des deux pays, comme dans bien d'autres cas, \u00e0 condenser dans des textes les doctrines fondamentales des anciens jurisconsultes.\nPour les fins de la pr\u00e9sente cause, il est important de remarquer surtout, la diff\u00e9rence qui existe entre l'art. 524 C.N. et l'art. 379 du Code civil de Qu\u00e9bec. C'est qu'en France, en vertu de 524 C.N., tel que je l'ai signal\u00e9 d\u00e9j\u00e0, les effets mobiliers que le propri\u00e9taire d'un fonds y a plac\u00e9s pour le service et l'exploitation de ce fonds sont immeubles par destination. La perp\u00e9tuelle demeure n'est pas un \u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel \u00e0 cette immobilisation. Cependant, dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, en vertu de l'art. 379 C.C., trois conditions sont requises pour qu'il y ait immobilisation par destination. La premi\u00e8re est que celui qui place un objet mobilier sur un immeuble doit \u00eatre le propri\u00e9taire des deux; il faut, en outre, que cet objet soit plac\u00e9 \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure ou incorpor\u00e9, et alors l'objet tant qu'il y reste est immeuble par destination. Par la volont\u00e9 du propri\u00e9taire il est alors destin\u00e9 \u00e0 l'immobilisation.\nToute la pr\u00e9sente cause repose donc sur l'interpr\u00e9tation des mots plac\u00e9s \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure, et il importe de se demander quelles sont les exigences de la loi de Qu\u00e9bec, pour que cette condition soit remplie.\nC'est la pr\u00e9tention des appelants que ces mots \"perp\u00e9tuelle demeure\" sont qualifi\u00e9s par les dispositions de l'art. 380 C.C. Ainsi, d'apr\u00e8s eux, pour qu'un meuble devienne immeuble par destination sous l'empire de l'art. 379, il faudrait n\u00e9cessairement qu'il fut attach\u00e9 au fonds, tel que le stipule l'art. 380, \u00e0 fer et \u00e0 clous, qu'il soit scell\u00e9 en pl\u00e2tre, \u00e0 chaux ou \u00e0 ciment, ou qu'il ne puisse \u00eatre enlev\u00e9 sans \u00eatre fractur\u00e9, ou sans briser ou d\u00e9t\u00e9riorer la partie du fonds \u00e0 laquelle il est attach\u00e9. C'est \u00e0 cette seule condition qu'un objet mobilier pourrait \u00eatre immobilis\u00e9 par destination.\nAvec respect pour ceux qui entretiennent cette opinion, je ne puis accepter cette interpr\u00e9tation restrictive de l'art. 379. Ce serait ne pas faire donner au l\u00e9gislateur le maximum de sa pens\u00e9e, et ce serait tomber dans une interpr\u00e9tation beaucoup trop \u00e9clectique qui, je crois, n'est pas conforme aux textes, et est contraire \u00e0 la jurisprudence et \u00e0 l'enseignement des auteurs.\nA mon sens, il y a dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, comme en France, deux moyens bien distincts d'immobilisation de biens mobiliers par destination, et, les arts. 379 et 380 du Code civil, se distinguent entre eux comme se distinguent, en France, les arts. 524 et 525.\nC'est d'ailleurs ce que Mignault signalait, il y a au del\u00e0 de 50 ans, quand il \u00e9crivait, Droit civil, vol. 3, p. 412: \"La loi appelle immeuble par destination les objets mobiliers qui prennent la nature d'un fonds auquel ils sont unis, soit par une attache purement morale, soit par une attache physique ou mat\u00e9rielle\".\nMignault souligne \u00e9galement que l'art. 524 C.N. est plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ral que le n\u00f4tre, 379 C.C., et que son \u00e9num\u00e9ration d'exemples est plus compl\u00e8te. Ainsi, le Code fran\u00e7ais ne pr\u00e9voit pas la cessation de l'immobilisation par l'enl\u00e8vement de l'objet immobilis\u00e9 car, il est clair que ceci va de soi; il est aussi \u00e9vident que l'\u00e9num\u00e9ration de l'art. 524 C.N., comme le n\u00f4tre, n'est qu'\u00e0 titre d'exemples, et n'est pas limitatif mais seulement \u00e9nonciatif.\nMignault conclut, en tenant compte de toutes les diff\u00e9rences qu'il y a entre les textes qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois et fran\u00e7ais, qu'il y a chez nous, dans le cas de l'art. 379 C.C., deux classes d'immeubles par destination: premi\u00e8rement, les meubles plac\u00e9s par le propri\u00e9taire sur son fonds \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure, et, deuxi\u00e8mement, les meubles qu'il a incorpor\u00e9s. Nous avons vu pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment qu'en France, la destination agricole ou industrielle est suffisante pour l'immobilisation par destination. Je suis d'opinion que cette destination agricole, ainsi que la destination industrielle, lorsqu'elles sont \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure, existent aussi dans notre droit. Comme le signale Mignault, vol. 2, p. 416, la destination industrielle est repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par les deux premiers exemples de l'art. 379(a), et la destination agricole par le dernier paragraphe de cet article. Mignault insiste sur la diff\u00e9rence qu'il faut signaler entre les mots \"immobilisation \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure\" et \"incorpor\u00e9\". Il s'exprime ainsi \u00e0 la page 419, vol. 2:\nBien que les mots \"\u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure\" ne s'appliquent, dans la r\u00e9daction de l'article 379, qu'aux meubles plac\u00e9s sur le fonds, il va sans dire que la destination doit \u00eatre permanente pour immobiliser un meuble incorpor\u00e9 \u00e0 un immeuble. L'id\u00e9e m\u00eame de l'incorporation suppose la permanence de la destination du propri\u00e9taire et ce serait presque un pl\u00e9onasme que de dire \"incorpor\u00e9 \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure\".\nLes mots \"ou incorpor\u00e9\" que l'on trouve \u00e0 l'art. 379 C.G., sugg\u00e8rent l'id\u00e9e qu'il existe un moyen d'immobilisation sans incorporation, mais uniquement par un lien intellectuel, sans les attaches dont je parlais tout \u00e0 l'heure. D'ailleurs, les mots employ\u00e9s par le l\u00e9gislateur \"plac\u00e9s \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure\", et 1'\u00e9num\u00e9ration (non limitative) que l'on fait des pressoirs, des chaudi\u00e8res, des alambics, des cuves et des tonnes, comme des ustensiles n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 l'exploitation des forges, doivent \u00e9videmment \u00e9carter toute id\u00e9e de liens physiques.\nIl faut de toute n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 attribuer aux mots \"perp\u00e9tuelle demeure\" le m\u00eame sens qu'on lui attribue en France, et que l'on trouve au dernier paragraphe de l'art. 524 C.N. et au premier de 525 C.N. Il ne faudrait pas croire, cependant, que ces expressions comportent une id\u00e9e qui exclurait l'immobilisation, si on pouvait pr\u00e9voir un temps o\u00f9 une machine plac\u00e9e dans une usine, cessait d'avoir son utilit\u00e9. L'usure de la machine, les changements industriels, les conditions \u00e9conomiques variables, et bien d'autres facteurs, sont autant d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments dont il faut tenir compte pour la dur\u00e9e du temps o\u00f9 une machine doit \u00eatre employ\u00e9e. Ce qui est important, c'est que la machine soit plac\u00e9e dans l'usine pour l'exploitation du fonds, pour un temps que l'on ne conna\u00eet peut-\u00eatre pas, mais avec l'intention de la laisser tant qu'elle sera en \u00e9tat de fonctionner, ou tant qu'elle n'aura pas \u00e9t\u00e9 remplac\u00e9e par une autre machine plus moderne ou plus apte \u00e0 donner un rendement plus efficace.\nDe tous temps, dans notre province, cette doctrine d'immobilisation sans attaches mat\u00e9rielles a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnue par nos tribunaux. Ainsi, dans la cause de The Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada v. The Eastern Townships Bank 3, cause entendue avant la codification, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le \"rolling stock\" d'un chemin de fer est un immeuble par destination, et comme tel ne peut faire l'objet d'une saisie de bonis. Et, pourtant, il n'y a rien par nature de plus \"meuble\" que des locomotives ou des wagons de chemin de fer. Le jugement formel et unanime de la Cour du Banc de la Reine (Division d'Appel) est le suivant (p. 18):\nConsidering that the locomotive engine seized in this cause forms part of the rolling stock of the Grand Trunk Railway Company; considering that the said locomotive engine is an indispensable portion of the realty forming the said road and is in law an immoveable (immeuble par destination), the Court here doth reverse and set aside the judgment rendered in the Court below; and proceeding to pronounce the judgment the Court below ought to have rendered, doth maintain the opposition of the said Grand Trunk Railway Company, and doth order that main lev\u00e9e be granted to them of the said seizure, the whole with costs in both Courts.\nDans la cause de Budden v. Knight 4, M. le juge Stuart de la Oour Sup\u00e9rieure s'exprime de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\nThe puncheons, casks, etc., supplied by the owner and necessary to carry on a brewery, and the hammers, pinchers, etc., necessary to work a forge, are immoveable though in no way incorporated with the immoveable\u2014and they by law are accessory and form part of the immoveable upon which they have been placed for a permanency.\nApr\u00e8s la codification, en 1877, dans Binks v. The Rector & Church Wardens of the Parish of Trinity and the Trust and Loan Company of Canada 5, on a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'une orgue plac\u00e9e dans une \u00e9glise, sans \u00eatre attach\u00e9e \u00e0 fer et \u00e0 clous, est immeuble par destination et le juge Papineau s'exprime de la fa\u00e7on suivante \u00e0 la p. 259:\nLe placement \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure ne se reconna\u00eet donc pas toujours par ces moyens d'attachement corporel des objets mobiliers au fonds; c'est plut\u00f4t un effet de la volont\u00e9 puisqu'ils deviennent immeubles par la seule destination.\nDans Philion v. Bisson 6, M. le juge Bourgeois donne ainsi son opinion:\nLa b\u00e2tisse o\u00f9 la saisie a \u00e9t\u00e9 pratiqu\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9rig\u00e9e pour en faire un moulin, et il nous importe peu de savoir comment les machines y ont \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9es, si on a employ\u00e9 des clous, du fer ou du plomb pour les attacher \u00e0 l'entreprise, il suffit de savoir (et ce fait est incontestablement prouv\u00e9) que les choses saisies bien que meubles de leur nature ont \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9es \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure dans le moulin en question par le propri\u00e9taire, et qu'elles sont ustensiles n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 l'exploitation de l'usine \u00e9tablie par le d\u00e9fendeur sur le fonds achet\u00e9 par lui de l'opposant. Article 379 c.c. M. le juge Jett\u00e9, Revue du Droit, vol. V., p. 605, \u00e9crit ce qui suit:\nMais lorsqu'il s'agit de machines, de chaudi\u00e8res, fourneaux, forges, etc., \u00e9tablis dans une usine, est-il juste, est-il bon que ces objets soient immobilis\u00e9s? La loi fait une distinction, ont-ils \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9s ou \u00e9tablis par le propri\u00e9taire du fonds, ces objets en prennent la nature, parce que lui servant d'auxilliaires, ils se confondent avec lui, dans les mains du propri\u00e9taire. Leur immobilisation est donc indiqu\u00e9e par la nature m\u00eame des choses.\nDans Barker v. The Central Vermont Railway Co. and Hays et al. 7, M. le juge Loranger a d\u00e9cid\u00e9:\nDes locomotives et chars affect\u00e9s \u00e0 l'exploitation d'un chemin de fer sont immeubles par destination\u2014alors m\u00eame qu'ils se trouvent momentan\u00e9ment sur des voies ferr\u00e9es qui, sans appartenir \u00e0 la compagnie, font partie de son syst\u00e8me\u2014et sont r\u00e9gis par la loi du pays o\u00f9 ce chemin de fer est situ\u00e9; partant ils ne sont pas susceptibles de saisie mobili\u00e8re.\nEn 1890, dans une cause de Wallbridge v. Farwell 8, M. le juge Taschereau disait: \"It is well established jurisprudence that the rolling stock of a railway is immoveable property and part of the freehold.\"\nDans une autre cause de P\u00e9loquin v. Bilodeau 9, M. le juge Lemieux, rendant le jugement majoritaire de la Cour de Revision, dit ceci:\nDans la premi\u00e8re cat\u00e9gorie des immeubles par destination de notre code, c'est-\u00e0-dire le cas o\u00f9 le propri\u00e9taire a plac\u00e9 sur son fonds, \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure, un meuble de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 le convertir en immeuble, la loi n'exige pas d'adh\u00e9rence ou d'incorporation du meuble \u00e0 l'immeuble, et elle a pris soin de la dire en se servant du verbe placer, c'est-\u00e0-dire mettre sur ou dans et suivant la version anglaise, to place on.\nCes termes: \"placer ou mettre sur un immeuble\" n'ont rien d'ambigu ni d'\u00e9quivoque, et ne comportent nullement l'id\u00e9e de fixit\u00e9 ou d'incorporation. A notre avis, il faut un effort d'imagination pour arriver \u00e0 une conclusion contraire.\nLes mots, termes et expressions d'une loi doivent avoir le sens, la signification et l'application qui leur sont propres.\nL\u00e0-dessus, le code donne des exemples d'immeubles, et dans chacun de ces cas, il parle d'objets mobiliers qui sont ou peuvent rester distincts de l'immeuble et non attach\u00e9s, qui restent mobiliers de leur nature et ne deviennent immeubles que par la volont\u00e9 du propri\u00e9taire, toujours \u00e0 la condition qu'il y ait destination \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuit\u00e9 au fonds et pour l'avantage du fonds.\nSi d'autres autorit\u00e9s sont n\u00e9cessaires pour compl\u00e9ter cette \u00e9num\u00e9ration qui illustre l'unanimit\u00e9 de la jurisprudence, on peut r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 Cloutier v. Cloutier 10 ; Ville de Longueuil v. Crevier 11 ; Donohue Brothers Registered v. La Corporation de la Malbaie 12; Anderson v. Poirier 13 ; Nadeau v. Rousseau 14, notes de Rivard J.; St-Pierre v. Shugar 15 ; Diamond Shoe v. Turcotte 16.\nLes appelants ont invoqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appui de leurs pr\u00e9tentions, l'arr\u00eat de M. le Juge en chef Tyndale rendu dans la cause de Baum v. St-Casimir Lumber and Manufacturing Co. Ltd 17, o\u00f9 le jug\u00e9 est le suivant:\nMachinery in a sawmill cannot be considered as immoveable by destination if it appears that the machines which were attached to the ground floor were so attached by bolts penetrating into the cement, that they could be removed without damage to the machines and without damage to the floor except that holes were left in the cement.\nThe same applies to machines attached to the upper floor by bolts which passed through the wooden floor and were fastened on the other side by nuts screwed on to the bolts. These machines could also be removed without damage to themselves and without damage to the floor except that the holes made by the bolts, remained.\nA la page 393, M. le juge Tyndale dit:\nIt is, however, now well settled by our jurisprudence that the machines cannot, for that reason alone, be considered as immoveables by destination : Roy v. Lamontagne (1936, 60 K.B. 134). They must also be attached to the premises by the proprietor for a permanency, within the meaning of art. 380 C.C.\nOn voit donc que le savant juge base sa d\u00e9cision sur le jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi dans Roy v. Lamontagne 18, o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 ce qui suit:\nUtensils employed in the making of maple sugar (gr\u00e9ment de sucrerie) are moveables and they cannot be treated as immoveables by destination, unless it is established that they were converted into immoveables, by attachment for a permanency according to the terms of article 380 C.C.\nLe jug\u00e9 de cette cause, tel que d\u00e9termin\u00e9 par l'arr\u00eatiste, peut, en effet, induire en erreur, mais l'analyse des raisons donn\u00e9es par les divers juges de la Cour d'Appel, doit, je crois, laisser des doutes sur la v\u00e9ritable port\u00e9e de ce jugement. Le d\u00e9fendeur r\u00e9clamait des ustensiles employ\u00e9s \u00e0 la fabrication du sucre d'\u00e9rable, et all\u00e9guait qu'ils \u00e9taient des immeubles par destination, et ne pouvaient \u00eatre l'objet d'une saisie de bonis. Mais, dans cette cause, aucune preuve n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 offerte, et c'est sur une admission de faits, \u00e9videmment incompl\u00e8te, que le jugement de la Cour a \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9. Il manquait un \u00e9l\u00e9ment, que les juges signalent et qui semble \u00eatre la cause d\u00e9terminante de leur d\u00e9cision, c'est l'intention de fixer ces ustensiles \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure.\nLe juge Walsh dit, en effet, \u00e0 la page 136:\nThere is nothing in the submitted facts to indicate that the seized moveables were placed on this land for a permanency. These objects are, by their nature, moveables; the intention of the owner to convert them has to be deduced from circumstances. They did not adhere to lands or tenements. The seized effects do not fall into the category of objects submitted by the Code (379 C.C.) to illustrate the principle of permanency that the Code emphasises.\nA la page 151, M. le juge Saint-Jacques dit ce qui suit:\nSi le dossier contenait une description de placement dans la cabane \u00e0 sucre des objets mobiliers qui sont utilis\u00e9s pour la conversion de l'eau d'\u00e9rable en sirop et sucre, peut-\u00eatre pourrait-on en conclure que le propri\u00e9taire a entendu les immobiliser, parce qu'il les aurait plac\u00e9s \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure, ou incorpor\u00e9s \u00e0 cet \u00e9difice qui s'appelle \"la cabane \u00e0 sucre\".\nEn l'absence d'une telle preuve, je dois mettre sur le m\u00eame pied tous les objets revendiqu\u00e9s qui, de leur nature, sont essentiellement mobiliers. Ils ont gard\u00e9 leur caract\u00e8re tant et aussi longtemps qu'ils sont rest\u00e9s entre les mains du demandeur et ils ne l'avaient pas perdu lorsque l'immeuble a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi et vendu par le sh\u00e9rif, le 9 octobre 1934. Le d\u00e9fendeur ne les a point acquis en se portant ench\u00e9risseur et adjudicataire de cet immeuble. Ces objets sont rest\u00e9s la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du demandeur, et c'est \u00e0 bon droit qu'il en fait la revendication.\nDans cette cause, M. le juge Galipeault a concouru dans les raisons donn\u00e9es par M. le juge Saint-Jacques. Dans l'appr\u00e9ciation de ce jugement de Roy v. Lamontagne M. le juge Gagn\u00e9, dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, dit ce qui suit \u00e0 la p. 650:\nIl faut remarquer aussi, quant \u00e0 Roy v. Lamontagne, que cette cause est d\u00e9cid\u00e9e sur une admission de faits ainsi r\u00e9dig\u00e9e. Je ne trouve que le texte anglais dans les notes de M. le juge Walsh :\nThe seized effects were in the sugar-shanty at the time of the sheriff's sale; there they have remained; they are utensils used in the operation of collecting and reducing maple sap.\nComme on le voit, il n'est aucunement question de placement sur les lieux, \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure, ni d'objets n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la pr\u00e9paration du sucre d'\u00e9rable. Mm. les juges Dorion et St-Jacques le signalent. Lorsqu'ils ajoutent que ces objets mobiliers doivent \u00eatre attach\u00e9s au fonds pour devenir immeubles par destination, ils expriment une opinion qui n'est pas essentielle \u00e0 la solution du litige.\nOn peut se demander, je crois, si la Cour n'e\u00fbt pas prononc\u00e9 autrement dans un cas d'immobilisation industrielle comme celui qui nous est soumis.\nQuelques autres d\u00e9cistions de cette Cour et du Conseil Priv\u00e9, et qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9es lors de l'audience, m\u00e9ritent aussi quelques consid\u00e9rations. Cependant, je dois signaler qu'\u00e0 mon sens elles n'ont aucune application. Ainsi, dans la cause de The Lower St. Lawrence Power Company v. L'immeuble Landry, Limit\u00e9e 19, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que les tuyaux, les poteaux, les fils et les transformateurs compris dans un syst\u00e8me d'\u00e9clairage \u00e9lectrique, \u00e9rig\u00e9 dans les rues d'une municipalit\u00e9 sont immeubles. Cette immobilisation ne l'est pas en vertu des arts. 379 et 380, mais elle l'est en vertu de l'art. 376, \u00e9tant des immeubles par nature. La m\u00eame r\u00e9flexion doit s'appliquer au sujet de la cause de Montreal Light, Heat and Power Consolidated and others v. The City of Outremont 20. Cette cause fut aussi d\u00e9cid\u00e9e en vertu de l'art. 376 C.C. et se rapportait aux tuyaux conduisant le gaz \u00e0 \u00e9clairage dans les rues de la ville d'Outremont. Ces tuyaux furent aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9s des immeubles par nature.\nLa cause du Bell Telephone Company of Canada v. Ville St. Laurent 21 fut aussi d\u00e9cid\u00e9e sous l'empire de l'art. 376 C.C. Le Conseil Priv\u00e9 a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'un standard t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique appartenant au Bell Telephone dans un immeuble dont la compagnie n'\u00e9tait pas le propri\u00e9taire, n'\u00e9tait pas un immeuble par nature. Il n'a pas, par cons\u00e9quent, \u00e9t\u00e9 question de d\u00e9terminer si ce standard t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique \u00e9tait immeuble par destination, vu que la condition essentielle de l'immobilisation par destination ne se pr\u00e9sentait pas, vu que la compagnie n'\u00e9tait pas propri\u00e9taire \u00e0 la fois du standard et de la b\u00e2tisse o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait situ\u00e9. Voici ce que dit Lord Thankerton, \u00e0 la page 79:\nAs already stated, the appellant is only a tenant of the premises.\nAccordingly, the respondent's claim is rested solely on Article 376 of the Code and on the view that the switchboard is an integral part of that which is admittedly immoveable\u2014namely, the poles, wires and cables of the appellant.\nDe l'ensemble de toute cette jurisprudence il me para\u00eet ressortir que l'art. 379 C.C, qui n'exige que le placement d'un objet \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure sur un fonds, et qui n'est pas limitatif, dans les exemples qu'il donne, est suffisant par lui-m\u00eame pour immobiliser un meuble par destination, sans qu'il soit n\u00e9cessaire d'avoir recours \u00e0 l'art. 380 pour d\u00e9terminer le mode d'immobilisation. Ce dernier article, comme d'ailleurs l'art. 525 C.N., cr\u00e9e une pr\u00e9somption juris tantum d'immobilisation pour les objets que l'on attache \u00e0 un fonds, sans n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 aucune pour l'exploitation de ce fonds. Ces deux arts. 379 et 380 envisagent donc des situations diff\u00e9rentes.\nJe crois que la question est parfaitement r\u00e9sum\u00e9e par deux auteurs modernes. M. Marier dans \"Law of Real Property\" (1932), p. 7, dit avec raison ce qui suit:\nHow are we to know with what intention a movable was placed by the land-owner on his land? Can he say that a movable placed on his land is or is not immovable? If he can, can he not change his mind? We cannot conceive it to be in the power of any person to determine at his pleasure a movable so placed to be movable or immovable, to say that it is immovable if seized as a movable, or vice-versa. His intention is not to be gathered from what he may say, even in the most formal manner, but from the mode of its attachment to his land, or if it is not attached at all, but simply rests on it by its own weight, or if very lightly attached or capable of being removed without breakage, from the purpose for which it has been placed on his land. But more is necessary. For whatever purpose it was placed on his land, the intention to place it there for a permanency, must be manifest, and, as we have to exclude any verbal expression, we have to look to the thing itself for the evidence of such intention.\nIt may be added that the attachment must be for the purpose for which the land is destined, or in the quaint French of the year-book, pour le profit de l'inh\u00e9ritance.\n\"The mode of annexation is of a comparatively small moment, the purpose of the annexation and the intent with which it was made being, in most cases, the important consideration. Physical annexation is not indispensable, provided the article is of an accessory character and, in some way in actual or constructive union with the principal subject and not merely brought upon it. It is true the mode of annexation, in the absence of other proof of intent, may become controlling, as where it is in itself so inseparable and permanent as to render the article necessarily a part of the realty, and even in the case of a less thorough method, the manner of attachment may still afford convincing evidence that the intention was to make the article a permanent accession. Still, there is no unvarying test; and neither the mode of annexation nor the manner of use can ever be said to be entirely conclusive.\" This is the American doctrine (Warvelle, Real Property), and it is similar in that respect to our own.\nM. le professeur Beaudoin, \u00e0 son tour, r\u00e9sume ainsi le probl\u00e8me dans son Droit Civil de la Province de Qu\u00e9bec, et \u00e0 la page 360, il exprime ainsi ses vues:\nLa jurisprudence qu\u00e9becoise a semble-t-il d\u00e9bord\u00e9 les cadres de l'article 379 C.C. Bien que n'adoptant pas une ligne de conduite aussi lib\u00e9rale qu'en France, le texte s'y opposant, elle a tout de m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s loin dans l'extension de l'art. 379 dont l'\u00e9num\u00e9ration n'est pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme limitative, ne pouvant \u00e9tayer son interpr\u00e9tation sur la notion de service et d'exploitation du fonds, elle a donn\u00e9 un sens tr\u00e8s large \u00e0 l'expression \"objets et autres choses semblables\" vis\u00e9e au texte. Elle a d'autre part con\u00e7u la notion de perp\u00e9tuelle demeure comme une notion moins mat\u00e9rielle qu'intentionnelle rejoignant ainsi l'attitude de la jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise dont elle s'est visiblement inspir\u00e9e. Dans les cas o\u00f9 elle ne pouvait faire appel \u00e0 l'incorporation, elle a invoqu\u00e9 la notion de perp\u00e9tuelle demeure qui joue donc ici un r\u00f4le presque identique \u00e0 celui du service ou de l'exploitation du fonds du droit fran\u00e7ais.\n(Ce sont mes italiques partout.)\nIl est int\u00e9ressant \u00e9galement de lire le jugement rendu par la Cour d'Appel dans la Compagnie de T\u00e9l\u00e9phone Saguenay-Qu\u00e9bec v. La Ville de Port Alfred et les Commissaires d'\u00e9coles pour la municipalit\u00e9 de Port Alfred 22. Dans cette cause, on a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'un standard t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique plac\u00e9 dans une maison appartenant \u00e0 la compagnie de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone Saguenay-Qu\u00e9bec, est un immeuble par destination, s'il est plac\u00e9 \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure suivant les exigences de l'art. 379 C.C. Dans cette cause, M. le juge Pratte, avec qui s'accorde M. le juge Galipeault, dit \u00e0 la page 860:\nA mon avis, la raison de la r\u00e8gle pos\u00e9e par l'art. 379 C.C. est que, dans l'esprit du propri\u00e9taire, certains objets mobiliers sont n\u00e9cessaires pour compl\u00e9ter le fonds sur lequel ils sont plac\u00e9s, en le rendant tel que le propri\u00e9taire veut qu'il soit. Or, dans l'esp\u00e8ce, il ne fait pas doute que le standard t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 install\u00e9 provisoirement, mais pour former avec le b\u00e2timent qui l'abrite une centrale t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique. Sans ce standard, l'immeuble ne serait pas ce que la demanderesse a voulu qu'il f\u00fbt.\nEnfin, dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, je m'accorde avec les remarques suivantes de M. le juge McDougall, de M. le juge Martineau et de M. le juge Gagn\u00e9. M. le juge McDougall dit 23 :\nIn the light of the foregoing it cannot be said that the machinery in question was placed in the building for a temporary purpose. It is quite clear that it was intended that it should remain certainly indefinitely, and as long as each machine could serve the purpose of the industry. Without further labouring the case, I may say that, in my opinion, insofar as such things can be permanently used they were so placed in the present case. In consequence the answer to the final question is in the affirmative, namely that the machines became immobilized by destination.\nM. le juge Martineau s'exprime ainsi 24:\nJe ne crois pas que tel soit l'effet de cet article 380 C.C qui me semble tout simplement vouloir dire que, dans les cas qu'il mentionne, il devra \u00eatre pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 que les objets ainsi attach\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9s par le propri\u00e9taire sur son fonds \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure. Il dit \u00e9galement 25:\nCeci ne veut pas dire qu'il suffirait \u00e0 un propri\u00e9taire de placer des objets sur son fonds, sans intention arr\u00eat\u00e9e de les enlever un jour, pour les rendre immeubles par destination, car alors la plupart des meubles meublant les maisons d'habitation occup\u00e9es par leur propri\u00e9taire seraient ainsi immeubles. Il faut de plus qu'ils soient des accessoires indispensables de l'immeuble. Il faut qu'il y ait entre eux et le fonds un rapport de destination, c'est-\u00e0-dire qu'ils soient affect\u00e9s au service de l'immeuble, pour me servir des expressions de Planiol et Ripert. J'ajouterai que ce rapport de destination peut \u00eatre aussi entre ces objets et l'utilisation du fonds, ainsi qu'il appara\u00eet clairement des deux cat\u00e9gories d'objets mentionn\u00e9s au deuxi\u00e8me paragraphe de l'article 379 C.C.\nEt, enfin, M. le juge Gagn\u00e9 est tr\u00e8s cat\u00e9gorique dans son opinion 26:\nExiger que tous ces objets soient attach\u00e9s au fonds, c'est-\u00e0-dire leur appliquer l'article 380 pour qu'ils deviennent immeubles par destination, serait rendre inutile et inapplicable ce texte de la loi qui est pourtant tr\u00e8s clair.\nOn reconna\u00eet que la perp\u00e9tuelle demeure est une question d'intention du propri\u00e9taire mais que la preuve de cette intention doit r\u00e9sulter des faits mat\u00e9riels constat\u00e9s et non pas de d\u00e9clarations que peut faire le manufacturier. Ceci, je crois, est \u00e9vident.\nIl me semble que lorsqu'un propri\u00e9taire d'usine installe dans cette usine les machines et l'outillage qui sont n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 son exploitation, il en r\u00e9sulte une pr\u00e9somption tr\u00e8s forte d'installation \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure, surtout lorsqu'il s'agit de manufactures aussi importantes que celles poss\u00e9d\u00e9es par les mis en cause. Il lui appartient de prouver que ces machines et cet outillage y \u00e9taient plac\u00e9s temporairement, mais il ne lui suffit pas de le dire.\nJe dois ajouter que les machines, dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, sont attach\u00e9es au sol, pour emp\u00eacher, dit-on, la vibration. M\u00eame si ces attaches mat\u00e9rielles ne sont pas suffisantes pour satisfaire les exigences de l'art. 380, elles r\u00e9v\u00e8lent s\u00fbrement l'intention de la perp\u00e9tuelle demeure, que requiert 379 C.C. C'est, d'ailleurs, l'id\u00e9e exprim\u00e9e par M. Marier, supra, quand il dit: \"The manner of attachment may still afford convincing evidence that the intention was to make the article a permanent accession.\"\nPour conclure, je suis d'opinion que la liste des machines, dite \"liste suppl\u00e9mentaire\", \u00e9num\u00e8re des immeubles par destination, qui doivent en cons\u00e9quence \u00eatre port\u00e9s au r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation. Ces machines sont en effet plac\u00e9es sur le fonds pour l'exploitation des industries; elles y sont indispensables, n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 leurs op\u00e9rations, et sont des accessoires essentiels aux immeubles o\u00f9 elles sont plac\u00e9es \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure. Ceci satisfait compl\u00e9tement les exigences de l'art. 379 C.C. sans qu'il soit n\u00e9cessaire de recourir \u00e0 l'art. 380 C.C. pour compl\u00e9ter l'immobilisation.\nEn r\u00e9sum\u00e9, je crois que le Code civil de la province de Qu\u00e9bec et le Code fran\u00e7ais en ce qui concerne l'immobilisation par destination, diff\u00e8rent sous certains aspects. En France, cette immobilisation sans la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de \"placement \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure\" est compl\u00e8te, si les objets mobiliers sont affect\u00e9s au service de l'immeuble. Mais \u00e0 part ce lien intellectuel qui sert \u00e0 l'affectation du meuble au service de l'immeuble, il existe aussi une immobilisation par un lien mat\u00e9riel, lorsque le meuble est attach\u00e9 \u00e0 l'immeuble \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure, conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions du Code.\nLes articles 379 et 380 C.C, de la province ont plusieurs points de similitude avec les articles du Code fran\u00e7ais. Ici cependant, la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de la perp\u00e9tuelle demeure est imp\u00e9rieuse pour destiner un meuble \u00e0 l'immobilisation. On reconna\u00eet \u00e9galement ici l'immobilisation par attaches physiques, comme en France d'ailleurs, mais ces attaches ne cr\u00e9ent qu'une pr\u00e9somption juris tantum.\nLes mots \"\u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure\" n'excluent pas n\u00e9cessairement la possibilit\u00e9 du remplacement ou de l'enl\u00e8vement de la machine. Une machine, comme dans le pr\u00e9sent cas, plac\u00e9e pour l'exploitation d'un fonds, avec l'id\u00e9e de la laisser tant qu'elle sera en \u00e9tat de fonctionner de fa\u00e7on utile ou profitable, malgr\u00e9 que l'on puisse pr\u00e9voir un temps o\u00f9 elle sera d\u00e9su\u00e8te, ne cesse pas pour cette raison d'\u00eatre affect\u00e9e \u00e0 l'immeuble \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure au sens l\u00e9gal de cette expression.\nJe crois donc que les appels doivent \u00eatre rejet\u00e9s avec d\u00e9pens contre les appelants devant toutes les Cours. Cependant, il n'y aura pas d'ordonnance quant aux frais contre la cit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke devant cette Cour.\nThe judgment of Kellock and Nolan JJ. was delivered by\nKellock J.:\u2014This appeal involves the interpretation of arts. 379 and 380 of the Civil Code, the particular question for decision being whether machinery in use in premises of the various appellants is immoveable within the meaning of these articles, and thus taxable under the provisions of the Cities and Towns Act, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 233, as amended. It having been found as a fact by both Courts below that there was no actual incorporation of any of the machinery into the various buildings, the question resolves itself into one of the proper interpretation of the words \"\u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure\" in these articles. I therefore leave \"incorporation\" out of the discussion.\nThe Court of Appeal 27 has held that these words ought to be construed in the sense of \"indefinitely\" but that the intention to place \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure\n\u2026 must appear from the circumstances of the placing. The owner\u2014or in this case the operator of the industry\u2014may not by his mere declaration immobilize a moveable,\nto quote the language of McDougall J. at p. 645. Gagn\u00e9 J. expressed the same view as follows at p. 650:\nOn reconna\u00eet que la perp\u00e9tuelle demeure est une question d'intention du propri\u00e9taire mais que la preuve de cette intention doit r\u00e9sulter des faits mat\u00e9riels constat\u00e9s et non pas de d\u00e9clarations que peut faire le manufacturier. Ceci, je crois, est \u00e9vident.\nIn determining the question of intention, however, these two members of the Court had resort exclusively to the evidence as to what had in fact been in the minds of the officers of the various appellants when the machinery was installed, thus violating the principle they had just laid down. McDougall J. said at p. 646:\nUpon an examination of the testimony of the Superintendent (Mills) of Dominion Textile Company, it would appear that all the machines are placed in their plants to remain there indefinitely, to be removed only under certain conditions such as obsolescence, change of demand for products for which certain machines are used, improved machines to replace old machines and other analogous reasons.\nGagn\u00e9 J., who agreed with McDougall J., said at p. 650:\nOr, le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la preuve que donne le juge de premi\u00e8re instance et que reproduit M. le juge McDougall d\u00e9montre parfaitement que toute la machinerie dont on demande la mention au r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation, comme immeuble, \u00e9tait bien plac\u00e9e dans cette usine non pas temporairement mais pour aussi longtemps qu'elle serait utile.\nArticles 379 and 380 contain no express definition of the expression \"\u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure\", which is derived from the French law existing in Lower Canada when the Code was drafted in 1866. Its meaning at that time is, moreover, not doubtful. Pothier, in his Trait\u00e9 de la Communaut\u00e9, nos. 47 and following, to which the codifiera refer, in discussing art. 90 of the Custom of Paris, points out that it imperfectly expressed the existing law in that there were things which, without being attached \"\u00e0 fer et \u00e0 clous\", were considered \"faire partie\" of a building, and others which although attached \"\u00e0 fer et \u00e0 clous\", were not to be so considered. The author states at no. 35 that vine props, although lightly attached to the land and taken out in the winter time, are considered as part of the land\nparce qu'ils y sont plac\u00e9s pour perp\u00e9tuelle demeure, et destin\u00e9s \u00e0 y servir \u00e0 cet usage jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'ils soient enti\u00e8rement us\u00e9s, et qu'ils ne puissent plus servir.\nIn no. 36, he states that a windmill is considered to constitute part of the land upon which it is placed because it is placed \"pour perp\u00e9tuelle demeure\" although it is not attached at all. The meaning of these words comes out very clearly in these references and also in no. 48, where Pothier contrasts the situation where things that are placed \"n'y sont que pour un temps.\"\nNo. 61 contains a further illustration, namely, artillery in a chateau or a fortress which, although not physically attached\nest cens\u00e9e y \u00eatre pour perp\u00e9tuelle demeure, et en faire partie: car elle sert \u00e0 compl\u00e9ter ce ch\u00e2teau ou cette forteresse, qui ne peut \u00eatre ch\u00e2teau ou forteresse sans artillerie.\nAs a further illustration the author cites things which are necessary for the celebration of divine service in a chapel. They are considered to be immoveables because they serve to complete the chapel which would not be a chapel without them. He distinguishes the case where these things are not in a chapel but in the mansion house of the seigneur in Paris. In such case they are moveables as the house is not \"\u00e9tabli chapelle pour toujours\".\nThe corresponding English expression \"for a permanency\" must be interpreted on the same footing as the words \"\u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure\". Its meaning is well brought out in the Oxford Dictionary where \"a permanent way\" is defined as \"the finished road-bed of a railway, as distinguished from a contractor's temporary way\". In the Court below both McDougall and Gagn\u00e9 JJ. would have construed the words \"\u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure\" in the sense I have referred to above had they not been misled as to the effect of the words \"tant qu'ils y restent\" in art. 379. They excluded this meaning by reason of the presence of the words \"tant qu'ils y restent\". These words are merely declaratory. They do not operate to affect the meaning of the words \"\u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure\". In Baudry-Lacantinerie, Droit Civil, 3rd ed. 1905, vol. 6, p. 84, no. 92, the authors state:\nL'immobilisation par destination, \u00e9tant cr\u00e9\u00e9e par la volont\u00e9 du propri\u00e9taire, peut cesser par une volont\u00e9 contraire, c'est-\u00e0-dire d\u00e8s que cesse la cause qui avait produit l'immobilisation.\nSimilarly, Beudant, vol. 4, p. 125, no. 124:\nPour mettre fin \u00e0 l'immobilisation il suffit que le propri\u00e9taire supprime le rapport de destination qui reliait l'objet mobilier au fonds.\nWhile, as already stated, arts. 379 and 380 contain no express definition of the expression \"\u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure\", they do contain illustrations of what is involved. Article 379 provides that \"moveable things which a proprietor has placed on his real property for a permanency\" (\u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure) or which he has \"incorporated therewith\" are immoveable by their destination, so long as they remain there. The article proceeds to provide: \"Thus, within these restrictions\" certain described classes of objects become immoveable, i.e., by being placed on the land \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure or by incorporation.\nThe last paragraph of the article reads:\nSont aussi immeubles par destination les fumiers ainsi que les pailles et autres substances destin\u00e9es \u00e0 le devenir.\nManure, and the straw and other substances intended for manure, are likewise immoveable by destination.\nOne of the sources in the old law to which the codifiers point in the case of this particular provision is Pothier, Commentaires, supra, no. 40, which reads in part as follows:\nLes pailles qui sont n\u00e9es dans une terre, et les fumiers qui y sont faits par les animaux qui servent \u00e0 son exploitation, \u00e9tant d\u00e8s leur naissance destin\u00e9s \u00e0 demeurer toujours dans cette terre, \u00e0 y \u00eatre enterr\u00e9s pour la fumer, et \u00e0 \u00eatre par l\u00e0 en quelque fa\u00e7on identifi\u00e9s avec cette terre, sont r\u00e9put\u00e9s en faire partie \u2026\nComme c'est cette destination qui fait regarder les pailles et fumiers comme faisant partie de la terre, il faudrait d\u00e9cider autrement si l'usage du p\u00e8re de famille \u00e9tait de les vendre plut\u00f4t que de les employer \u00e0 fumer sa terre: ils seraient en ce cas r\u00e9put\u00e9s meubles, \u2026 Manure and straw intended for manure became immoveable by destination under the old law if the intention of the proprietor was to use them to fertilize his lands rather than to sell them. The last paragraph of art. 379 reflects that law clearly.\nIt may be relevant to point out that the intention of the Provincial Legislature in 1866 was as stated in 20 Vict., c. 43, ss. 4 and 6, which read:\n4. The said Commissioners shall reduce into one Code, to be called the Civil Code of Lower Canada, those provisions of the Laws of Lower Canada which relate to Civil Matters and are of a general and permanent character \u2026\n6. In framing the said Code(s), the said Commissioners shall embody therein such provisions only as they hold to be then actually in force, and they shall give the authorities on which they believe them to be so; they may suggest such amendments as they think desirable, but shall state such amendments separately and distinctly, with the reasons on which they are founded.\nThe codifiera did not anywhere state that arts. 379 and 380 included any amendment of the existing law.\nAccordingly, the last paragraph of art. 379 provides an example of things which \"likewise\" become immoveable, i.e., in the same manner as other moveables by being placed on land \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure or by incorporation. In my opinion the word \"likewise\" brings out the meaning of \"aussi\" in the French version, which is \"most consistent with the provisions of the existing laws on which the article is founded\": art. 2615.\nBefore considering the terms of the first paragraph of art. 380, it is convenient to consider its last paragraph, which reads:\nLes glaces, les tableaux et autres ornements sont cens\u00e9s mis \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure, lorsque, sans eux, la partie de l'appartement qu'ils couvrent demeurerait incompl\u00e8te ou imparfaite.\nMirrors, pictures and other ornaments are considered to have been placed permanently when without them the part of the room they cover would remain incomplete or imperfect.\nWhat is meant by \"incomplete\" and \"imperfect\" in this context can be fully understood only by reference to the former law. The codifiera refer, inter alia, in this connection to Pothier, Commentaires, supra, nos. 47 et seq., where the author lays down certain rules as to the interpretation of art. 90 of the Custom of Paris. It will be sufficient to quote parts of nos. 53 and 55 :\n53. Troisi\u00e8me r\u00e8gle.\u2014Les choses qui peuvent facilement \u00eatre d\u00e9plac\u00e9es du lieu o\u00f9 elles sont, ne laissent pas d'\u00eatre cens\u00e9es faire partie de la maison, lorsqu'elles y servent \u00e0 compl\u00e9ter la partie de la maison o\u00f9 elles sont plac\u00e9es, quum posita sunt ad integrandam domum : mais, si elles n'y servent que d'ornement et d'ameublement, ou pour l'exercice du m\u00e9tier de la personne qui habite la maison, si posita sunt ad instruendam jomum, elles ne sont pas cens\u00e9es faire partie de la maison, et sont de simples meubles.\n55. A l'\u00e9gard des glaces et des tableaux qui sont encadr\u00e9s dans une chemin\u00e9e ; si ce qui est derri\u00e8re la glace on le tableau, sont les briques de la chemin\u00e9e, ou quelque planche qui ne soit pas de m\u00eame parure que le reste de la chemin\u00e9e, en ce cas la glace ou le tableau para\u00eet \u00eatre mis pour compl\u00e9ter cette partie de la maison: car la chemin\u00e9e serait imparfaite, et il manquerait quelque chose, si derri\u00e8re le tableau ou la glace il n'y avait que les briques, ou quelque planche de parure diff\u00e9rente du reste de la chemin\u00e9e. Le tableau ou la glace \u00e9tant donc en ce cas mis ad integrandam domum, il est cens\u00e9 en faire partie: Quae tabulae pictae pro tectorio includuntur, aedium sunt; L. 17, f. 3, ff. de Act. empt.\nAu contraire, si ce qui est derri\u00e8re la glace ou le tableau, est de m\u00eame parure que le reste de la chemin\u00e9e, en ce cas la chemin\u00e9e ayant toute sa perfection ind\u00e9pendamment de la glace qu'on y a attach\u00e9e, on ne peut pas dire, en ce cas, que la glace serve ad integrandam domum; elle ne sert que ad instruendam domum, et elle ne doit pas, suivant notre principe, \u00eatre cens\u00e9e faire partie de la maison, mais elle doit \u00eatre regard\u00e9e comme un meuble.\nRead against the background of the existing law, the intent of the last paragraph of art. 380 is quite plain. Removal of an object will, by reason of the condition of the wall behind it, demonstrate whether or not it was placed \"\u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure\".\nThat this paragraph is merely another example of the application of a principle which is not limited to ornaments is, I think, quite clear. It could not be contended merely because it is not an \"ornament\" that a travelling crane, such as is to be seen in any steel-fabricating plant, is not as much a part of the entire immoveable as are the steel uprights which are embedded in the earth and support the tracks upon which the crane rests and travels back and forth in the course of its operation. The crane serves to complete the rest of the structure which would be not only imperfect but useless without it.\nThe first paragraph of art. 380 is as follows:\n380. Sont cens\u00e9s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 attach\u00e9s \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure les objets plac\u00e9s par le propri\u00e9taire qui tiennent \u00e0 fer et \u00e0 clous, qui sont scell\u00e9s en pl\u00e2tre, \u00e0 chaux ou \u00e0 ciment, ou qui ne peuvent \u00eatre enlev\u00e9s sans \u00eatre fractur\u00e9s, ou sans briser ou d\u00e9t\u00e9riorer la partie du fonds \u00e0 laquelle ils sont attach\u00e9s.\n380. Those things are considered as being attached for a permanency which are placed by the proprietor and fastened with iron and nails, imbedded in plaster, lime or cement, or which cannot be removed without breakage, or without destroying or deteriorating that part of the property to which they are attached.\nThis paragraph provides another means of ascertaining whether the intention of the owner was to place \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure. In this instance it is from the durable nature of the bond by which the moveable has been fastened to the realty that the intention is to be gathered.\nIt is clear from the above discussion that, contrary to the contention of the appellants, this paragraph does not provide the exclusive rule by which the intention to place \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure is to be determined. The opening language of art. 379 is the governing language. It is the\nMoveable things which a proprietor has placed on his real property for a permanency or which he has incorporated therewith\nwhich become immoveables. Both paragraphs of art. 380 merely furnish objective means by which the intention of the proprietor may be ascertained.\nMoreover, I do not think the word \"attached\" in the early part of art. 380 means \"physically\" attached. One would hardly say of a thing that it will be \"considered\" as being \"physically attached\" to realty if it is \"actually fastened\" thereto by a visible bond. That would be pure tautology. Rather it would be said that a thing is to be considered as being \"joined\" or \"united\" or \"annexed\" or \"appropriated\" (affect\u00e9) to the realty when fastened to it by a material tie. It is in that sense, in my opinion, that the word \"attached\" is used in art. 380.\nIn commenting on the meaning of arts. 524 and 525 C.N., Dalloz, Repertoire, vol. 6, vo. Biens, no. 108, says:\nOr, qu'est-ce qu'entend l'art. 524 par un effet mobilier attach\u00e9 \u00e0 un fonds? Exige-t-il une union physique, une incorporation mat\u00e9rielle? Non, la preuve s'en trouve dans l'article 524 lui-m\u00eame, puisqu'il d\u00e9clare immeubles les animaux attach\u00e9s \u00e0 la culture; d'o\u00f9 il r\u00e9sulte assez manifestement sans doute que, dans les dispositions qui nous occupent, le mot attach\u00e9 doit s'entendre m\u00eame d'une union purement morale, et qu'en d'autres termes, un objet est attach\u00e9 \u00e0 un immeuble d\u00e8s qu'il y a \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9 pour son service ou son agr\u00e9ment, d\u00e8s qu'il y a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9. Ainsi donc, pour que la premi\u00e8re condition d'immobilisation soit remplie, il est n\u00e9cessaire, il est indispensable que l'effet mobilier ait \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 de fait et non pas seulement d'intention \u00e0 un immeuble; mais il n'est point exig\u00e9 qu'il y ait entre l'un et l'autre un lien mat\u00e9riel.\nWhether or not the author's view is to be taken as correctly interpreting the provisions of arts. 524 and 525 C.N., it does, in my opinion, express by analogy the correct approach to the first paragraph of art. 380, namely, as illustrative of one type of evidence from which the intention of the proprietor is to be gathered.\nBefore considering the effect of paragraphs numbered \"1\" and \"2\" of art. 379 C.C., it should be observed that while these two provisions are expressed in the same language found in the first part of art. 524 C.N., the objects thereby described become immobilized under the French Code merely by being placed upon land \"pour le service et l'exploitation de ce fonds\" and not \"\u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure\". This should be clear merely by comparing the language of the two articles, but two commentators upon the French Code may be cited: Baudry-Lacantinerie, Droit Civil, 3rd ed. 1905, vol. 6, p. 78, no. 85; Colin-Capitant (1953), vol. 1, p. 833, no. 1447(c).\nIt follows that the view given effect to in a number of decisions in the provincial Courts that the doctrine of \"industrial\" or \"agricultural\" immobilization provided for by the first part of art. 524 C.N. also obtains under art. 379 C.C., is erroneous. That contention was negatived as long ago as 1877 in Wyatt v. Levis & Kennebec R. R. Co. 28, where Meredith C.J., in delivering the judgment of the majority, called attention to the difference in the two Codes and said, at p. 226:\nI therefore find it impossible to agree in the opinion that as to the matter under consideration in this case, the provision of the French code, and of our code are in principle the same. On the contrary I think that the realization [immobilization] of moveables by reason of their being placed upon a property of a particular kind for its service et exploitation, which is expressly allowed by the French code, is wholly unknown to our law, \u2026 There have been other judicial expressions to the same effect since that time.\nWhile the codifiers were instructed by s. 7 of the provincial statute, 20 Vict., c. 43, that the Code should be framed upon the same general plan and should contain, as nearly as might be found convenient, the like amount of detail upon each subject as the French Code, and while they point out, at p. 141 of their second report, that the similarity between the law of Lower Canada and that of France at the time of the codification in France might have made it possible for the Provincial Legislature to have permitted the adoption of the Code Napol\u00e9on, yet:\n\u2026 the legislature has willed otherwise. It has in truth indicated the French code as a model with respect to the plan to foe followed, as to the division of subjects and as to the details to be furnished on each; but all that is. only accessory and regards the form; as to the substance, it is declared that the code to be made shall be composed exclusively of our own laws. What is law in force should be included, what is not must be excluded, and can, at most, only be proposed apart as an admissible alteration.\nProvincial legislation in Quebec in recent years has emphasized that immobilization by \"industrial exploitation\" is not to be equated with immobilization by destination under the Civil Code. In 1941 the relevant section of the Cities and Towns Act, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 233, s. 488, was as follows:\n488. Les immeubles imposables dans la municipalit\u00e9 comprennent les terrains, les constructions et les usines qui y sont \u00e9rig\u00e9es et toutes am\u00e9liorations qui y ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites, de m\u00eame que les machineries et accessoires qui sont immeubles par destination ou qui le seraient, s'ils appartenaient au propri\u00e9taire du fonds \u2026\nIn 1943, by c. 37, s. 5, s. 488 was repealed and the following substituted:\n488. Les immeubles imposables dans la municipalit\u00e9 comprennent les terrains, les constructions et les usines qui y sont \u00e9rig\u00e9es et toutes am\u00e9liorations qui y ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites, de m\u00eame que les machineries et leurs accessoires plac\u00e9s dans les usines et servant \u00e0 leur exploitation, quel que soit le propri\u00e9taire de ces machineries et accessoires \u2026\nIn 1945, by c. 53, s. 1, the section as enacted by the statute of 1943 was repealed and the section as it read in the revised statutes of 1941 was restored.\nIt is therefore plain that in the view of the Legislature, the doctrine of industrial exploitation does not exist under art. 379 C.C. In this situation there is nothing, in my opinion, to be gained by saying that, by reason of the inclusion in art. 379 of paras. \"1\" and \"2\" and the last paragraph, which deals with fertilizers, the article recognizes a limited industrial and agricultural immobilization provided the objects in question have been placed on the land \"\u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure\". That a thing has been placed on his land by the proprietor \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure is the sole requirement, in the absence of incorporation. In my opinion, therefore, only confusion can result from the employment of such terms, and some of the decided cases illustrate that such confusion has resulted.\nReturning then to the general rule enunciated in the opening paragraph of art. 379, the words \"\u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure\" must receive the same meaning as applied to the classes of things described in the paragraphs numbered \"1\" and \"2\" as elsewhere in that article and in art. 380. Was the intention at the time of placing, as in the case of manure or straw intended for manure, that they should remain \"toujours\"? If fastened in a durable manner, as described in the first paragraph of art. 380 or if not removable without breakage or without destruction or deterioration, or if they serve to complete or perfect the realty, the question must be answered in the affirmative.\nIt will be convenient to set out the numbered paragraphs in their context, as follows :\n379. Les objets mobiliers que le propri\u00e9taire a plac\u00e9s sur son fonds \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure, ou qu'il y a incorpor\u00e9s, sont immeubles par destination tant qu'ils y restent.\nAinsi sont immeubles, sous ces restrictions, les objets suivants et autres semblables:\n1. Les pressoirs, chaudi\u00e8res, alambics, cuves et tonnes;\n2. Les ustensiles n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 l'exploitation des forges, papeteries et autres usines.\nSont aussi immeubles par destination les fumiers ainsi que les pailles et autres substances destin\u00e9es \u00e0 le devenir.\n379. Movable things which a proprietor has placed on his real property for a permanency or which he has incorporated therewith, are immoveable by their destination so long as they remain there.\nThus, within these restrictions, the following and other like objects are immovable:\n1. Presses, boilers, stills, vats and tuns;\n2. All utensils necessary for working forges, papermills, and other manufactories.\nManure, and the straw and other substances intended for manure, are likewise immoveable by destination. Paragraphs \"1\" and \"2\" are again, and expressly so, illustrations of the general rule. Presses, boilers, utensils, etc., are immoveable \"sous ces restrictions\", i.e., if placed ' \"\u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure\".\nIn the case at bar it is paragraph numbered \"2\" which is the relevant paragraph.\nAccording to the finding of the learned trial judge, confirmed by the Court of Appeal, the machinery here in question is not in any way fastened to the realty so as to come within the description contained in the first paragraph of art. 380. It was, however, placed in the respective manufacturing plants with the intention that it should not be removed until necessitated by \"obsolescence, change of demand for products for which certain machines are used, improved machines to replace old machines and other analogous reasons\", to quote from McDougall J. at p. 646. This is to say of the machinery what was said by Pothier in the passage already quoted, where, in speaking of vine props, he said they were \"destin\u00e9s \u00e0 y servir \u00e0 cet usage jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'ils soient enti\u00e8rement us\u00e9s, et qu'ils ne puissent plus servir\". The buildings themselves where the machinery is placed, are of a character designed for the carrying on of the respective industrial processes for which the machines were acquired.\nAt the time when Pothier wrote, industrial development had not, of course, reached the stage of modern times, but Pothier touches upon the present question in his Trait\u00e9 de la Communaut\u00e9, (supra), in para. no. 59, where, in speaking of moveables which serve to \"complete\" the building in which they are found, he says:\n\u2026lorsqu'un b\u00e2timent a \u00e9t\u00e9 construit expr\u00e8s pour \u00eatre une raffinerie de sucre, les grandes chaudi\u00e8res qui y sont enfonc\u00e9es en terre, et scell\u00e9es en ma\u00e7onnerie, sont cens\u00e9es faire partie de l'\u00e9difice, auquel il manquerait quelque chose, et qui ne serait pas une raffinerie sans ces chaudi\u00e8res.\nUnder para. \"2\" the codifiers also refer to V Pandectes Francaises, pp. 66 and 67. On the latter page the word \"ustensiles\" is used, not in the narrow dictionary sense of \"vessels\" or \"tools\" but with a much larger signification. The paragraph reads :\nIl peut y avoir, et il y a en effet, dans les villes, m\u00eame \u00e0 Paris, des \u00e9tablissements, des manufactures, qui demandent un b\u00e2timent dispos\u00e9 expr\u00e8s, et qui deviendrait inutile si sa destination \u00e9tait chang\u00e9e. Il n'est pas douteux que non seulement les pressoirs, cuves, chaudi\u00e8res et alambics, mais encore les autres ustensiles, quoique mobiles, qui servent \u00e0 l'exploitation de ces \u00e9tablissements ou manufactures, sont r\u00e9put\u00e9s immeubles. Dans une raffinerie, par exemple, non seulement les cuves, mais aussi tous les autres ustensiles, sont immeubles.\nA judgment of the Parliament of Flanders on April 7, 1780, is referred to as the basis of the statement in the last sentence. I have not been able to locate the full text of that judgment but have seen only the reference to it in Merlin, vol. 20, p. 150.\nIt would therefore appear that even under the old law before the French Code not only the large objects physically attached to the refinery building, as described by Pothier, but \"tous les autres ustensiles\" of the refinery were also considered immoveables for the reason that they served to complete the building for the purpose for which it was designed or applied, namely, a refinery.\nThe governing principle is perhaps better understood by comparing the \"ustensiles\" mentioned above with such articles as household furniture. A chateau or a fortress is not complete as a chateau or a fortress without the artillery necessary for its defence, but both the chateau and the fortress would be complete, as such, without the furniture necessary for the comfort of the occupants. Similarly, the chapel attached to the chateau was not considered complete as a chapel without the things which served the object for which it was built, namely, divine service. On the other hand, the room in the mansion house in Paris used by the seigneur while living there for the purpose of divine worship, remained complete as a room when no longer used for that purpose, as it was not built or designed for use as a chapel.\nIt is this principle which is invoked, in my opinion, by art. 379 in the case of the classes of things described in para. \"2\". What is envisaged is a building designed for the carrying on of the enterprises therein mentioned. A papermill building without \"all utensils necessary for working\" the mill would not be a complete paper-mill. The words \"other manufactories\", in my opinion, make it clear that a factory used for a particular manufacturing purpose is none the less within the intendment of the paragraph although it is capable of being used for other kinds of manu- facturing processes with other machinery. Without the necessary machinery a factory is not a factory. The building is merely a shell.\nIn my opinion, therefore, if the proprietor of a building suitable for an industrial process places in it machinery for the purpose of carrying on that process permanently and not merely temporarily, such machinery becomes immobilized under art. 379 whether any part of it does or does not fall within the first paragraph of art. 380. The principle is not displaced merely because the same building could be devoted equally well to some other industrial purpose.\nIf such be the intention of the proprietor at the time of placing the machinery, the possibility of the occurrence of some vicissitude bringing about a desistment from that intention is not sufficient to change its nature. A railway built to be operated permanently may cease to be operated at a future time for a number of reasons but this possibility is not sufficient to alter the nature of the builder's original intention. On the other hand, instances occurred during the late war when manufacturing plants were established to supply some product or products during the period of the war only. Such a plant could not be regarded as having been established with an intention \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure.\nIn my opinion, this law was well understood in Lower Canada at the time of the enactment of the Code and subsequently, and forms the basis of the decision in The Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada v. The Eastern Townships Bank 29, a judgment of the Court of Appeal, where it was held that\n\u2026the locomotive engine seized as a moveable is in fact an integral part of the immoveable property constituting the Grand Trunk Railway. It is to all intents and purposes part of the realty, un immeuble par destination, and is no more liable to seizure, apart from the immoveable property to which it belongs, than the, detached burrstones in a mill, the vats in a. brewery, or the boilers in a sugar factory;\nper Drummond J. The judgment of the Court was put upon the ground that the locomotive \"is an indispensable portion of the realty forming the said road\".\nIt is obvious that the railway, consisting of rails, ties, etc., erected upon the ground, would be incomplete and useless for any other purpose without the rolling stock for the movement of which it is built. The rolling stock serves to complete the railway in the same way as the electric crane to which I have already referred.\nIn Binks v. The Rector & Church Wardens of the Parish of Trinity and The Trust and Loan Company of Canada 30, the issue was as to whether a church organ was an immoveable. Papineau J. correctly put to himself the question at p. 259:\nIl est donc important de constater si c'est pour perp\u00e9tuelle demeure que l'orgue en question a \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9 dans l'Eglise de la Trinit\u00e9, parce que de ce point-l\u00e0, et de celui-l\u00e0 seulement, d\u00e9pend le maintien ou le renvoi de l'opposition en cette instance.\nAfter pointing out that a church is a building constructed for a special purpose, so much so that it cannot be diverted to any other use without substantial alterations and that an organ, as much as the church in which it is placed, is earmarked permanently for divine service, the learned judge held that the earmarking or appropriation of the organ to the church building should be regarded as permanent as the object both were designed to serve.\nIn P\u00e9loquin v. Bilodeau 31, the question for decision involved certain boilers, vats, tuns, etc., used for making maple sugar. Lemieux J., who delivered the judgment of the majority, was of opinion that arts. 379 and 380 did not demand in all cases a physical tie between the moveable and the immoveable. The last paragraph of art. 380 was sufficient proof of this to him. He again pointed out, at the foot of p. 396, that while the French law has points of similarity, it differs substantially from the Civil Code. At p. 397 he said:\nAinsi, notre code \u00e9dicte l'immobilisation d'un meuble \u00e0 toutes fins que de droit, industrielles, agricoles ou autres, lorsqu'il est plac\u00e9 \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuit\u00e9 sur un fonds. L'art. 524 du code Napol\u00e9on n'exige pas, dans certains cas, la perp\u00e9tuelle demeure, il suffit que le meuble soit plac\u00e9 pour l'utilit\u00e9 et exploitation du fonds pour en faire un immeuble.\nThe learned judge held that if the articles in question were removed (at. p. 399)\n\u2026 on se serait trouv\u00e9 en pr\u00e9sence d'un fonds d\u00e9nud\u00e9 et incapable de donner la seule production que le propri\u00e9taire pouvait en attendre et esp\u00e9rer.\nCes ustensiles \u00e9taient l'\u00e2me de la fabrication. Les faire dispara\u00eetre, la fabrication tombait et perdait sa nature. Les enlever, aurait d\u00e9truit l'immeuble, l'aurait amoindri, lui aurait \u00f4t\u00e9 ses moyens productifs et, partant, \u00e7'aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 m\u00e9conna\u00eetre le v\u0153u du propri\u00e9taire qui avait plac\u00e9 ces objets sur le fonds pour en faire partie, et cela, \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure.\n* * *\nDans les circonstances relat\u00e9es, est-il possible de conclure logiquement et l\u00e9galement que le propri\u00e9taire n'avait pas plac\u00e9 pour toujours et \u00e0 I perp\u00e9tuelle demeure sur son fonds, pour le service et l'exploitation de ce fonds, les agr\u00e8s et ustensiles de sucrerie en question?\nIt is not necessary, for present purposes, to approve or disapprove of the actual decision. Cimon J. dissented, being evidently of opinion that the evidence was insufficient to satisfy the requirements of arts. 379 and 380, and it has been decided in other cases, upon other facts, that equipment for making maple sugar continued to be moveables. Lemieux J. had himself so held in Anderson v. Poirier 32. P\u00e9loquin's Case is not important for the particular application made of the principles laid down but for the discussion of these principles.\nIn 1936 the Court of Appeal had occasion to consider arts. 379 and 380 in Roy v. Lamontagne 33, a case involving again things used in making maple sugar,\nWalsh J. at p. 136 said:\nOur law is derived from the old French law of the time of Pothier. The Code Napol\u00e9on does not give effect to all the enactments of this old law, because of modern trends that gave importance to moveables. Our Civil Code, however, did not adopt all the principles of the Code Napol\u00e9on. The result is greater confusion in regard to a subject necessarily complicated because of the effort required to convert into an immoveable what is by nature a moveable (especially when the object is not attached to the principal thing by physical links).\nDorion J., at p. 141, after referring to the previously existing law and arts. 379 and 380, said:\nLa difficult\u00e9 est de savoir si l'on doit consid\u00e9rer comme immeubles des machines et des ustensiles et autres objets mobiliers qui se trouvent sur un immeuble et qui sont n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 l'exploitation de cet immeuble, et s'ils sont ainsi devenus immeubles par le seul fait qu'ils y sont plac\u00e9s par le propri\u00e9taire. Ceci peut conduire tr\u00e8s loin, et, en effet, on est all\u00e9 tr\u00e8s loin.\nL'ameublement d'une maison est n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l'usage ou \u00e0 l'exploitation de cette maison; les instruments aratoires sont n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 l'exploitation d'une ferme, ainsi que les animaux qui s'y trouvent, et le Code Napol\u00e9on, en effet, d\u00e9clare les animaux de ferme immeubles. (C.N. 524). Notre Code ne va pas jusque-l\u00e0. The learned judge, as well as St-Jacques J., considered that art. 380 laid down the limits within which immobilization under art. 379 was to be established\u2014\"Ce sont l\u00e0 des restrictions apport\u00e9es \u00e0 l'apparente g\u00e9n\u00e9ralit\u00e9 des termes de l'art. 379.\" This statement, if it overlooks the generality of the rule stated in art. 379, is too narrow.\nSt-Jacques J. pointed out that it is the last paragraph of art. 524 C.N., which is analogous to art. 379 C.C. French commentaries on the first part of art. 524 C.N. are thus of little use, in his opinion.\nThe learned judge was, however, of opinion that art. 379 provides for the immobilization of the classes of moveables described in paras. \"1\" and \"2\" only and no others. As already mentioned, I find myself unable to agree.\nFor the above reasons, Royal Trust Co. v. Ein 34 and Baum v. St. Casimir Lumber and Manufacturing Co. Ltd. 35 must be taken to have been wrongly decided.\nI do not find it necessary to discuss any of the other cases, beyond referring to Budden v, Knight 36 and Philion v. Bisson 37, which follows it. These decisions are misleading inasmuch as they are in part founded upon the view that the doctrine of industrial immobilization introduced into the French law by the first paragraph of art. 524 C.N. is applicable under art. 379 C.C. In Budden v. Knight, for example, the learned trial judge, after stating that moveables are immobilized by being \"placed by the proprietor on his real property for a permanency\" or \"by being incorporated in it\", based his judgment, inter alia, upon the statement in Sirey et Villeneuve, art. 517-8-9 et seq. (see Sirey et Gilbert, 4th ed. 1901, vol. 1, p. 415) that\nLes meubles et ustensiles attach\u00e9s \u00e0 l'exploitation d'une manufacture, que la loi r\u00e9pute immeubles par destination, ne sont autres que ceux qui sont n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 l'exploitation de cette manufacture.\nand concluded at p. 277:\nThe articles revendicated having been placed in the brewery to be used in its working, and being necessary to the same, were immoveables by destination, and became part of the brewery which could not be seized and sold by a fieri facias de bonis, and passed to the defendant under the adjudication to him of the brewery in which they still were, and of which they had never ceased to form part. The only question remaining for determination is as to whether art. 379 excludes from the determination of the question of intention all evidence other than external physical circumstances. In my opinion, that is not so. How is it to be ascertained that a farmer intends to sell his manure or straw rather than to place it on the land or whether the \"straw\" or \"other substance\" is intended for manure at all? No doubt his actual practice in former years may be looked to but that could not be an infallible guide in a subsequent year.\nBy the terms of the article itself, in my opinion, the evidence of the owner as to his intention is, at the least, admissible evidence. As already pointed out, McDougall and Gagn\u00e9 JJ. found it impossible in the case at bar to come to a conclusion without examining the evidence of the officers of the appellant company.\nI therefore think that the Court of Appeal has reached the right result. The appeal should be dismissed with costs throughout as against the appellants save that there should be no costs against the appellant city in this Court.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the City of Sherbrooke, appellant: A.

Dans cet immeuble se trouvait un tableau t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique, propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'appelante, que la ville pour fins de taxation municipale a \u00e9valu\u00e9 \u00e0 la somme de $60,000 pour l'ann\u00e9e 1950-51, se terminant le 30 juin 1951.

L'appelante demande, en cons\u00e9quence, que le r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation, comme d'ailleurs le r\u00f4le de perception, soient annul\u00e9s. L'honorable juge Lacroix a rejet\u00e9 l'action avec d\u00e9pens.

Elle a vu dans le texte de l'art. 488 de la Loi des Cit\u00e9s et Villes les conditions n\u00e9cessaires pour d\u00e9clarer immeuble, et, par cons\u00e9quent, sujet \u00e0 la taxe fonci\u00e8re, le standard t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique en question. Ce texte se lit ainsi:\nLes immeubles imposables dans la municipalit\u00e9 comprennent les terrains, les constructions et les usines qui y sont \u00e9rig\u00e9es et toutes am\u00e9liorations qui y ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites, de m\u00eame que les machineries et accessoires qui sont immeubles par destination ou qui le seraient, s'ils appartenaient au propri\u00e9taire de fonds. M. le juge Pratte conclut que par l'op\u00e9ration de l'art. 379 C.C., ces objets sont n\u00e9cessaires pour compl\u00e9ter le fonds sur lequel ils se trouvent, qu'ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9s \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure, et qu'ils sont, en cons\u00e9quence, immeubles par destination. M. le juge Hyde est d'opinion que ces objets sont non seulement des immeubles par destination en vertu de l'art. 379 C.C, mais aussi qu'ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9s \u00e0 fer et \u00e0 clous, et ont \u00e9t\u00e9 immobilis\u00e9s par l'op\u00e9ration de l'art. 380 C.C.

Dans cette derni\u00e8re cause, la compagnie n'\u00e9tait pas propri\u00e9taire de l'immeuble o\u00f9 \u00e9tait situ\u00e9 le standard t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique, et, par cons\u00e9quent, toute immobilisation par destination \u00e9tait impossible. Pour d\u00e9clarer immeuble le standard en question, il e\u00fbt fallu qu'il le soit par nature, suivant les dispositions de l'art. 376 C.C, et, \u00e0 mon sens, le Conseil Priv\u00e9 a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 avec raison que tel n'\u00e9tait pas le cas. Cette d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue en 1936, avant l'amendement apport\u00e9 \u00e0 l'art. 488 de la Loi des Cit\u00e9s et Villes (5 Geo. VI, c. 41), qui a ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 l'article tel qu'il existait la disposition suivante :\nLa valeur r\u00e9elle du tout est port\u00e9e au r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation au nom du propri\u00e9taire du fonds; mais si ce dernier prouve aux estimateurs que des machineries ou accessoires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9s par un locataire ou autre occupant, la valeur de ces machineries et accessoires est port\u00e9e au nom du locataire ou occupant qui les poss\u00e8de et qui, \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, est trait\u00e9 comme un propri\u00e9taire d'immeubles imposables.\nL'appel doit donc \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.

Le Bureau des Commissaires d'Ecoles Catholiques Romaines de la Cit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke et al.

This result is not affected by the fact that while some of the items are attached by \"iron and nails\", as the Courts below have found, the switchboard proper merely rests upon the floor by its own weight.\nI cannot agree that the assessed items, taken as a whole, are not to be considered as machinery within the meaning of the statute here in question.

A dependant under that Act is entitled to look only to the estate that the personal representatives of the deceased are entitled to administer, and those representatives have no claim upon such insurance moneys.\nPer Cartwright J., dissenting: When the definitions of \u201cestate\u201d, \u201ctestator\u201d and \u201cwill\u201d in the Act are properly construed, and read with the relevant provisions of The Insurance Act, the result is that insurance in such circumstances is to be deemed part of the estate for purposes of the Act, just as it is available to creditors of the estate. Dictum in Deckert v. The Prudential Insurance Company of America, [1943] O.R. 448 at 456-7, approved with a reservation; In re Roddick (1896), 27 O.R. 537, explained; Re Benjamin (1926), 59 O.L.R. 392; Re Isaacs, [1954] O.R. 942 at 956, disapproved. The position of an ordinary beneficiary designated in a policy of life insurance is analogous to that of a legatee or of a volunteer in whose favour a general power of appointment is exercised, and while on the death of the insured the beneficiary may enforce payment from the insurer he will hold the proceeds of the policy subject to the possible claims of creditors or dependants in the same way as if he had received them as a specific legacy.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming a judgment of McDonagh J. of the Surrogate Court of the County of York. Appeal dismissed, Cartwright J. dissenting. F.A. Brewin, Q.C., for the applicant, appellant.\nTerence Sheard, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and Rand, Kellock and Locke JJ. was delivered by\nKELLOCK J.:\u2014This appeal arises under the provisions of The Dependants\u2019 Relief Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 101, the contention of the appellant being that the \u201cestate\u201d of the testator for the purposes of the statute must be taken to include the proceeds of certain policies of insurance upon the life of the deceased Everett George Kerslake, originally payable to the estate of the deceased but subsequently changed by him by declaration under the Ontario Insurance Act and made payable to the respondent, an ordinary beneficiary. The appellant is the lawful wife of the deceased.\nThe provisions of the statute upon which the appellant particularly relies are as follows:\n1. (e) \u201ctestator\u201d means a person who by deed or will or by any other instrument or act so disposes of real or personal property, or any interest therein, that the same will pass at his death to some other person;\n(f) \u201cwill\u201d means any deed, will, codicil, instrument or other act by which a testator so disposes of real or personal property that the same will pass at his death to some other person.\n2.\u2014(1) Where it is made to appear to a judge of the surrogate court of the county or district in which a testator was domiciled at the time of death that such testator has by will so disposed of real or personal property that adequate provision has not been made for the future maintenance of his dependants or any of them, the judge may make an order charging the whole or any portion of the estate in such proportion and in such manner as to him may seem proper, with payment of an allowance sufficient to provide such maintenance.\nThe appellant contends that as the result in fact of the declarations is that the deceased has so disposed of his property that adequate provision has not been made for the future maintenance of the appellant as one of his dependants, the \u201cestate\u201d, with respect to which the judge is empowered to make an order by virtue of the subsection, must, in the light of the definitions in s. 1, be taken to include the insurance moneys.\nThe contention for the respondent, on the other hand, is that there is no sufficient basis in the statute for such a view and that \u201cestate\u201d means such assets only as the personal representatives of the deceased are entitled to administer. In support of her position, the appellant points out, in the first place, that while s. 164 of The Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 183, contains an express declaration that insurance moneys payable to preferred beneficiaries do not form part of the estate of the insured, there is no similar expression in s. 161. While that is so, I am of opinion that s. 161 operates to the same effect as regards ordinary beneficiaries as s. 164 does in the case of preferred.\nBy subs. (1) of s. 161, it is provided that the insured may designate the beneficiary by the contract or by declaration and may subsequently change the beneficiary, and subs. (2) enables the beneficiary, at the maturity of the contract, to enforce for his own benefit payment of the insurance moneys. It is significant that it is specifically provided by the subsection that \u201cthe insurer shall be entitled to set up any defence which it could have set up against the insured or his personal representatives\u201d. This provision emphasizes the status of the beneficiary in relation to his claim for payment.\nIt has for a long time been uniformly held in Ontario that insurance moneys payable to an ordinary beneficiary do not form part of the estate of the insured. Whatever criticism might have been directed at the decisions in In re Roddick[2]; Re Benjamin[3], and Re Jones[4] (and I am not suggesting that the appellant is well founded in his criticisms of them), there is no basis for criticism since the enactment of subs. (2) of s. 161 by 1946, c. 42, s. 6.\nIn considering the meaning of the word \u201cestate\u201d in The Dependants\u2019 Relief Act, it is of some relevance to refer to certain provisions of The Surrogate Courts Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 380. By s. 55 the Court is concerned only with \u201cthe property which belonged to the deceased at the time of his death\u201d. Further, by s. 77(1), it is provided that the fees payable upon the value of \u201cthe estate\u201d of the deceased shall be calculated upon the value of \u201cthe whole estate\u201d. It has been held in Re Farnsworth[5] that insurance moneys payable to an ordinary beneficiary do not enter into the valuation of the estate under this section. Whatever bearing the above statute may or may not have upon the issue here in question, I am, in any event, of opinion that there is in The Dependants\u2019 Relief Act itself clear indication that the contention of the appellant is erroneous. Section 10 is as follows:\nSubject to section 8, the amount or value of any allowance ordered to be paid, together with the value of any benefits given under the will of the testator, shall not exceed the amount to which the person in whose favour the order is made would have been entitled if the testator had died intestate.\n(The italics are mine.)\nCounsel for the appellant contends that the word \u201cintestate\u201d must be interpreted in the light of the definitions of \u201ctestator\u201d and \u201cwill\u201d in s. 1, and that by so doing the result for which he contends is attained. I am unable to agree. In my opinion the word \u201cintestate\u201d is not to have read into it other than its ordinary meaning, and when so regarded it is perfectly clear that a dependant is entitled to look only to the estate which the personal representatives of the deceased are entitled to administer. They, of course, have no claim upon moneys payable to an ordinary beneficiary under a policy of insurance except where there may exist some ground upon which the designation of the beneficiary may be set aside. It is not suggested that any such ground exists in the present case.\nAgain, by s. 8, it is provided that where a dependant has given personal assistance or the gift or loan of money or real or personal property toward the advancement of the testator in any business or occupation, the judge may place a money value upon the same and may direct that\nthe applicant shall rank as a creditor upon the estate therefor, in the same manner and to the same extent as a judgment creditor upon a simple contract debt...\nThe section goes on to provide that\n... except as to the amount so fixed as the value of such assistance or as the amount or value in money of such gift or loan an allowance payable under this Act shall be postponed to the claims of creditors of the estate.\n(The italics are mine.)\nThis section would seem in the clearest terms to indicate that the sole source from which any allowance granted under the Act is to be satisfied is the assets to which creditors are entitled to look. The assets to which creditors are entitled to look are the assets which the personal representative of a testator is entitled to administer. Instead of containing any provision that a dependant is entitled to a higher right than creditors, as is here contended by the appellant, the statute is express in placing the dependant in a less favourable position.\nIn my opinion the appeal fails and must be dismissed with costs.\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):\u2014The question raised on this appeal is as to whether the proceeds of two policies of insurance on the life of the late Everett George Kerslake, hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe deceased\u201d, form part of his estate within the meaning of s. 2(1) of The Dependants\u2019 Relief Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 101.\nThe facts are not in controversy. The appellant is the widow of the deceased. In 1949 the deceased obtained, in the State of Idaho, what purported to be a decree of divorce and on July 25, 1950, went through a form of marriage with the respondent; but it is conceded, for the purposes of this appeal, that the domicile of the deceased was at all times in Ontario and that his marriage to the respondent was not valid by the laws of that Province.\nThe policies in question were issued under contracts of group life insurance. In each case the certificate issued to the deceased bore the date July 1, 1946, and stated that the moneys to become payable on his death were to be paid to his estate.\nOn November 16, 1950, the deceased executed declarations naming the respondent as beneficiary in each of the policies and reserving his right to change the beneficiary.\nOn November 10, 1950, the deceased made a will reading, so far as is relevant, as follows:\nI GIVE, DEVISE AND BEQUEATH the whole of my estate of whatsoever nature and kind and wheresoever situate and over which I have any power of appointment to my second wife Alison Bruce Kerslake (formerly Alison Bruce Gray) for her own use absolutely, and I appoint her the sole executrix of this my Will.\nThe deceased died on July 22, 1953, and probate of his will was granted to the respondent on February 5, 1954.\nApart from the policies in question, certain other policies payable to the appellant and another policy as to which other litigation is pending, the deceased died insolvent. The appellant\u2019s application for an allowance under the provisions of The Dependants\u2019 Relief Act was heard by His Honour Judge McDonagh in the Surrogate Court of the County of York. That learned judge was of the opinion that in the circumstances outlined above the proceeds of the policies in question did not form any part of the estate of the deceased and dismissed the application. His judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.\nThe appellant contends that the proceeds of the policies in question form part of the \u201cestate\u201d of the deceased within the meaning of that term as used in The Dependants\u2019 Relief Act. The argument proceeds in this way: Apart from the declarations executed by the deceased on November 16, 1950, the proceeds of the policies would have formed part of his estate. Each declaration was a \u201cwill\u201d as defined by s. 1(f) of The Dependants\u2019 Relief Act, being an \u201cinstrument by which a testator so disposes of\u2026 personal property that the same will pass at his death to some other person\u201d. The deceased in executing the declaration was a \u201ctestator\u201d as defined by s. 1(e) of The Dependants\u2019 Relief Act, being a \u201cperson who by... instrument... so disposes of... personal property, or any interest therein, that the same will pass at his death to some other person\u201d. Up to this point the appellant\u2019s argument appears to be sound; it continues, the purpose of the Act is to make available for the maintenance of dependants such part of the estate of the testator as he has disposed of by \u201cwill\u201d as defined in the Act; this purpose appears from the wording of s. 2(1):\n2.\u2014(1) Where it is made to appear to a judge of the surrogate court of the county or district in which a testator was domiciled at the time of death that such testator has by will so disposed of real or personal property that adequate provision has not been made for the future maintenance of his dependants or any of them, the judge may make an order charging the whole or any portion of the estate in such proportion and in such manner as to him may seem proper, with payment of an allowance sufficient to provide such maintenance.\nwhich must be considered with s. 10:\n10. Subject to section 8, the amount or value of any allowance ordered to be paid, together with the value of any benefits given under the will of the testator, shall not exceed the amount to which the person in whose favour the order is made would have been entitled if the testator had died intestate. The Dependants\u2019 Relief Act is, in the appellant\u2019s submission, a remedial statute and under s. 10 of The Interpretation Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 184, \u201cshall... receive such fair, large and liberal construction and interpretation as will best attain the object of the Act according to the true intent, meaning and spirit thereof\u201d; this requires that the word \u201cestate\u201d as used in s. 2(1) and elsewhere in the Act be interpreted as including the property disposed of by the testator by any instrument falling within the definition of \u201cwill\u201d in s. 1(f) which but for such disposition would have formed part of his estate, and that the word \u201cintestate\u201d as used in s. 10 be interpreted as \u201cwithout having disposed of any property by any instrument falling within the definition of \u2018will\u2019 in s. 1(f)\u201d.\nTo this it is objected that such an interpretation involves adding to clauses (e) and (f) of s. 1 some such words as \u201cand the words \u2018estate\u2019 and \u2018intestate\u2019 shall have corresponding meanings\u201d. As long ago as 1865, in The Local Board of Health for the District of Wakefield v. The West Riding and Grimsby Railway Company[6], Cockburn C.J. said:\nI hope the time will come when we shall see no more of interpretation clauses, for they generally lead to confusion.\nThe hope of the learned Chief Justice has not been realized, and we must do our best not to be led into confusion.\nWith some hesitation, I have reached the conclusion that up to this point the appellant\u2019s argument is sound and that when The Dependants\u2019 Relief Act is read as a whole it becomes necessary to give to the words \u201cestate\u201d and \u201cintestate\u201d the meanings for which Mr. Brewin contends. To do otherwise would, in the case at bar and in many cases, make the application of the Act depend upon the form used by a testator to dispose of his assets. If, for example, in the case at bar, the deceased instead of naming the respondent as beneficiary in the declarations he attached to his certificates had simply stated in his will that everything of which he could dispose by will was to be given to her it would, I think, be clear that the proceeds of the policies would have been subject to s. 2(1) of the Act. \u201cEstate\u201d is not a word of single and precise meaning and in the context of this Act, read as a whole, it appears to me to mean \u201cthat which would have formed the property of the deceased at the time of his death if he had made no \u2018will\u2019 as defined in the Act\u201d. \u201cIntestate\u201d on the other hand is a word of plain and definite meaning, that is \u201cnot having made a will\u201d; but it also must be interpreted in context and the whole Act proceeds on the basis that \u201cwill\u201d includes all those methods of disposition set out in s. 1(f). To construe the word \u201cintestate\u201d in s. 10 in the narrow sense of \u201cnot having made a will executed in accordance with the provisions of The Wills Act\u201d would be to nullify the purpose, which appears from the Act as a whole, to reach all property of the deceased so disposed of by him that it will pass on his death to some other person.\nUp to this point I have been considering only the wording of The Dependants\u2019 Relief Act, read as a whole, and it is now necessary to turn to an argument of the respondent which may be summarized as follows: It is said that, in the law of Ontario, it is well settled that the proceeds of a policy of life insurance made payable, either in the policy as originally issued or by declaration, to a named ordinary beneficiary do not form part of the estate of the insured and are not subject to the claims of his creditors; that when enacting The Dependants\u2019 Relief Act the Legislature must be assumed to have known this to be the law; and that the intention to alter the law in this respect should not be imputed when express words are not used and indeed insurance is nowhere mentioned in the Act. To this the appellant replies that the law of Ontario is not as stated and that such cases as appear to have so held were wrongly decided.\nIn approaching the problem posed by these conflicting arguments it is necessary to bear in mind the particular facts with which we are concerned. Nothing seems to turn on the fact that the policies in question were contracts of group life insurance. Section 137(2) of The Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 183, is as follows:\n(2) In the case of group life insurance the term \u201cinsured\u201d, in the provisions of this Part relating to the designation or appointment of beneficiaries and the rights and status of beneficiaries, means the person whose life is insured.\nIt is conceded that the respondent is an \u201cordinary beneficiary\u201d. Section 158(3) of The Insurance Act is as follows:\n(3) Ordinary beneficiaries are beneficiaries who are not preferred beneficiaries, beneficiaries for value or assignees for value. Section 161(1) of The Insurance Act reads:\n161.\u2014(1) Subject to the rights of beneficiaries for value and assignees for value and to the provisions of this Act relating to preferred beneficiaries, the insured may designate the beneficiary by the contract or by a declaration, and may from time to time by any declaration appoint, appropriate or apportion the insurance money, or alter or revoke any prior designation, appointment, appropriation or apportionment, or substitute new beneficiaries, or divert the insurance money wholly or in part to himself or his estate, and may surrender the contract to the insurer, borrow from the insurer upon the security of the contract, receive the surplus or profits for his own benefit, and otherwise deal with the contract as may be agreed upon between him and the insurer.\nIt is clear that the deceased up to the moment of his death had power to change the beneficiary named in the declarations and to make the policies payable to anyone else he pleased or to his estate.\nIt will, I think, be helpful to first consider what, in these circumstances, the legal position would have been prior to the amendment of the Ontario Insurance Act by c. 42, s. 6, of the statutes of Ontario of 1946 whereby subs. (2) was added to s. 161. After considering all the cases referred to by counsel it is my opinion, subject to a reservation to be mentioned shortly, that that position was correctly stated by Plaxton J. in Deckert v. The Prudential Insurance Company of America[7]. While it did not become necessary for the learned judge to express a final opinion on the question, he examined with care a number of English and Canadian authorities including most of those which were discussed on the argument before us and having done so continued as follows, at pp. 456-7:\nIt follows, on the authority of these decisions, (1) that the mere fact that the policy moneys are expressed to be payable to somebody other than the assured does not make the assured a trustee of the policy for the person nominated, and (2) that apart from statute and in the absence of the creation of any trust in his favour in respect of the policy moneys, an ordinary beneficiary under a life insurance policy, being a stranger to the contract, does not acquire any interest at law or in equity in the policy or the policy moneys, merely by reason of the fact that the policy moneys are expressed to be payable to him. He cannot, therefore, maintain any action against the insurer for the recovery of the policy moneys. The cause of action passes to the personal representative of the deceased insured, and the policy moneys, if and when recovered, fall into his estate.\nThis conclusion is, I realize, at variance with the decisions in In re Roddick, supra[8], and Re Benjamin, supra[9]. I cannot, after a most attentive consideration of the matter, reconcile those decisions with the decisions of the English Courts to which I have referred and which appear to me, in light of the scheme of the life insurance legislation, to control the determination of the question under discussion\u2026 For the reasons I have indicated, I am disposed to think that the plaintiff has no right of action on the policies in her personal capacity, and can maintain the present action only in her representative capacity, i.e., as sole executrix under the last will of the deceased insured, and for the benefit of his estate.\nThe Court of Appeal while affirming the judgment of Plaxton J. did not find it necessary to express an opinion on this point.\nThe view expressed in this dictum of Plaxton J. is in accordance with the law of England on the point which is, in my opinion, accurately stated in the following passages in Preston and Colinvaux on Insurance (1950) at pp. 337-8:\nAs we have already seen the legal property in a life policy normally belongs to the person taking it out, subject to any assignment by him. If it is his own life that he insures, unless he has made a specific disposition of the policy by will, it will, on his death, subject to any equitable interests and the claims of his creditors, fall into residue and pass to the residuary legatee, or, if there is no will, to those entitled on intestacy.\n* * *\nIt is common in the case of insurances on the assured\u2019s own life, for the assured to nominate a beneficiary at the time of taking out a policy. Such a nomination does not, however, by itself, constitute the assured a trustee, nor, since the person nominated is a stranger to the contract, has he any remedy at law. The property in such a policy will therefore pass, notwithstanding the nomination, to the personal representative of the assured on his death and the nominee has no rights whatsoever, unless\u2014\n(i) the nomination amounts to a declaration of trust, or the person taking out the policy is merely the agent of the nominee, or... [the remaining exceptions refer to special statutory provisions].\nThe reservation to which I made reference above is as to that part of the dictum of Plaxton J. which negatives any right in an ordinary beneficiary to the proceeds of the policy in which he is so named. If those proceeds belong to the estate of the insured and pass under his will if he dies testate and otherwise as on an intestacy, then the provisions in The Insurance Act dealing with the appointment and change of ordinary beneficiaries would have no practical effect. The provisions of s. 161(1) have formed part of the Ontario Insurance Act in substantially their present form since 60 Vic., c. 36, s. 151, and it is difficult to suppose that they were not intended to serve some useful purpose. It may be that even prior to the 1946 amendment, the intention of the Legislature was to give to the designation of an ordinary beneficiary in accordance with the terms of the Act the equivalent of testamentary effect. On the other hand the purpose of s. 161(1) may have been to make. it clear that the proposition stated, in, I venture to think, much too wide terms, in Bliss on Life Insurance, 2nd ed. 1874, p. 554, had no application in Ontario. The passage to which I refer is as follows:\nWhere the policy designates a person to whom the insurance money is to be paid, the person who procures the insurance and who continues to pay the premiums has no authority, by will or deed, to change the designation or title to the moneys.\nHowever, I do not pursue this line of inquiry as the position has been to some extent clarified by the enactment by Statutes of Ontario, 1946, c. 42, s. 6, of subs. (2) of s. 161, which reads:\n(2) Subject to subsection 1, a beneficiary or a trustee appointed pursuant to section 186 may, at the maturity of the contract, enforce for his own benefit or as such trustee the payment of insurance money appointed, appropriated or apportioned to him by the contract or a declaration and in accordance with the terms thereof, but the insurer shall be entitled to set up any defence which it could have set up against the insured or his personal representatives; and payment made to the beneficiary or trustee shall discharge the insurer.\nIt is noteworthy that a similar amendment was made in each of the other common law Provinces in 1945.\nBefore proceeding to a consideration of the effect of the legislation in its present form it will be convenient to refer to one of the more recent cases which support the position of counsel for the respondent.\nIn Re Isaacs[10], Roach J.A. delivered the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal. Having decided that the beneficiary designated in a policy of life insurance was, in the unusual circumstances of that case, an ordinary beneficiary, he continued at p. 956:\nMr. Brewin then argued that if the appellant should be held entitled to the insurance moneys they should be declared subject to the payment of the debts of the estate. They cannot be liable for those debts unless they form part of the estate and they are not part of it: see In re Roddick (1896), 27 O.R. 537, and Re Benjamin (1926), 59 O.L.R. 392.\nIt will be observed that in the report of the argument the following appears at p. 950:\nThe insurance moneys never formed part of the estate, and are therefore not subject to the debts of the deceased. They are never part of the estate when the insurance is in favour of a named beneficiary. [ROACH J.A.: We need not hear you further on that point.] There are statements to the same effect in a number of judgments of the Ontario Courts but I think I am right in saying that they are all founded on the authority of In re Roddick, supra. In my respectful view the judgment in In re Roddick did not purport to lay down any general rule having application to a case in which both by contract and statute the insured has power, up to the last moment of his life, to dispose of the proceeds of a policy as he sees fit. The contract between the insured William Roddick and the insurer \u201cthe Supreme Tent of the Knights of the Maccabees of the World\u201d contained the following provisions, set out at pp. 538\u20119 of the report:\nSection 10. \u201cNo beneficiary or endowment certificate shall be made payable to any person other than the wife, children, dependents, mother, father, sister or brother of the member, nor can any such certificate be transferred or assigned by a member to any other person than above ***.\u201d Section 11. \u201cIn the event of the death of all the beneficiaries named by the member before the decease of such member, if no other disposition be made thereof, the benefit shall be paid to the beneficiaries of the deceased member first in the order named in the preceding section; and if no person or persons shall be found entitled to receive the same by the laws of the order, then it shall revert to the endowment fund of the association.\u201d\nThe certificate issued to William Roddick named his mother as beneficiary; she predeceased him and the only persons falling within the class set out in s. 10 who survived him were his two sisters. The sisters did not bring an action; a case was stated for the opinion of the Court as to whether they or the administrator of William Roddick were entitled to receive the proceeds of the policy. I find it difficult to infer a general rule from a decision on a policy which by its terms precluded the insurance moneys from falling into the estate of the insured.\nAt common law the policies in question would, in my opinion, have been treated as contracts made between the deceased and the insurers whereby the latter agreed to pay the proceeds of the policies on the death of the deceased to the respondent, who, being a stranger to the contracts, would have had no right to enforce them. While authority is scarcely needed for this elementary proposition it is succinctly stated in Anson on Contract, 20th ed. 1952, at pp. 254\u20115 as follows:\nA man cannot acquire rights under a contract to which he is not a party. It is contrary to the common sense of mankind that M should be bound by a contract made between X and A. But if A and X make a contract in which X promises to do something for the benefit of M, all three may be willing that M should have all the rights of an actual contracting party; and there would be nothing startling if the law should give effect to this desire. In many systems of law, indeed, this is the rule. It is not, however, the rule of the English Common Law.\nBy statute (s. 161(2)) the respondent has now been given a right of action against the insurer, and it is necessary to consider the nature of the right so created. Section 161(2), quoted above, must be read in the light of the other provisions in the Act dealing with life insurance and particularly those already quoted and the following:\n131. 8. \u201cdeclaration\u201d means an instrument in writing signed by the insured, attached to or endorsed on a policy, or an instrument in writing, signed by the insured in any way identifying the policy or describing the subject of the declaration as the insurance or insurance fund or a part thereof or as the policy or policies of the insured or using language of like import, by which the insured designates or appoints a beneficiary or beneficiaries, or alters or revokes the designation or appointment of a beneficiary or beneficiaries, or apportions or reapportions, or appropriates or reappropriates, insurance money between or among beneficiaries;\n158.\u2014(1) Beneficiaries for value are beneficiaries who have given valuable consideration other than marriage and who are expressly stated to be, or described as, beneficiaries for value in the policy or in an endorsement thereon or in a subsequent declaration signed by the insured.\n(2) Subject to section 167, preferred beneficiaries are the husband, wife, children, adopted children, grandchildren, children of adopted children, father, mother and adopting parents of the person whose life is insured.\n(3) Ordinary beneficiaries are beneficiaries who are not preferred beneficiaries, beneficiaries for value or assignees for value.\n159. A beneficiary for value and an assignee for value of a policy shall have a vested interest in the policy; but except as regards beneficiaries for value who are expressely stated to be or described as beneficiaries for value in the policy, a beneficiary for value or assignee for value who gives notice in writing of his interest in the policy to the insured at the head or principal office of the insurer in Canada prior to any other beneficiary for value or assignee for value shall have priority of interest as against such last-mentioned beneficiary or assignee.\n161.\u2014(4) A declaration, whether contained in a will or other instrument in writing, shall, subject to subsection 1, have effect from the time of its execution, but a declaration shall not affect the interest or rights of a beneficiary for value or assignee for value unless the declaration has been filed with the insurer at its head or principal office in Canada prior to the time when the beneficiary for value or assignee for value acquired such interest or rights and if not so filed the interest or rights of the beneficiary for value or assignee for value shall be as if the declaration had not been made.\n(5) In the case of a declaration contained in a will it shall be sufficient for the purposes of subsection 4 to file a copy thereof or of the material part thereof verified by statutory declaration. (6) A declaration contained in an instrument purporting to be a will which has not been revoked otherwise than by operation of law shall be effective as a declaration, notwithstanding that the instrument is invalid as a testamentary instrument.\n164.\u2014(1) Where the insured, in pursuance of the provisions of section 161, designates as beneficiary or beneficiaries, a member or members of the class of preferred beneficiaries, a trust is created in favour of the designated beneficiary or beneficiaries, and the insurance money, or such part thereof as is or has been apportioned to a preferred beneficiary, shall not, except as otherwise provided in this Act, be subject to the control of the insured, or of his creditors, or form part of the estate of the insured.\nWhen these provisions are considered together, it appears to me that the intention of the Legislature, in enacting the 1946 amendment, was to alter the rule of the common law to the extent of giving testamentary effect or an effect analogous thereto to the designation of an ordinary beneficiary so that the position of such beneficiary is assimilated to that of a legatee of the proceeds of the policy, and to give to the beneficiary a right of action against the insurer in substitution for, or in addition to, the procedure ordinarily available to a legatee to obtain payment of a legacy.\nIn my opinion an ordinary beneficiary has no vested interest in the policy or the proceeds thereof until the maturity of the contract, which in the case at bar is at the death of the deceased; to hold otherwise would be to disregard the sharp difference between the wording of s. 161(2) on the one hand and that of ss. 159 and 164(1) on the other. Up to the moment of his death the policies and their proceeds were the sole property of the deceased who had full power to dispose of them by will as he saw fit. The legislation gives to the declarations although not in testamentary form the same effect as if they had been made in that form; but I cannot find words in the legislation or discern reasons in principle to justify imputing to the Legislature the intention of placing a designated ordinary beneficiary in a position so different from, and superior to, that of a legatee of the proceeds of the policies that those proceeds should be held free from the claims of creditors of the deceased or from the liability to be made subject to the provisions of s. 2(1) of The Dependants\u2019 Relief Act. Such an interpretation would in effect, on the death of the insured, place an ordinary beneficiary in the same position as a preferred beneficiary, a result which the Act read as a whole does not appear to me to contemplate. There appears to me to be a close analogy between the position of an insured who, as in the case at bar, having an unfettered power to dispose at his death of the proceeds of a policy to anyone he pleases including his personal representatives designates an ordinary beneficiary, and that of an appointor having a general power of appointment over a fund which he exercises in favour of a volunteer. In the latter case the applicable rule is stated as follows in Farwell on Powers, 3rd ed. 1916, at p. 286:\nBoth real and personal estate, subject to general powers of appointment, become assets for the payment of the appointor\u2019s debts, if the power is actually exercised in favour of volunteers; and it makes no difference whether the power is exerciseable by deed or by will, or by will only.\nA simple example will serve to illustrate the anomalous result of holding that a policy of insurance payable to a designated ordinary beneficiary forms no part of the estate of the insured. Suppose A dies leaving as his only assets policies of life insurance totalling $500,000, all of which are stated to be payable to his personal representatives. He leaves a widow, B, with no means of support, and he owes debts totalling $10,000. If (i) he leaves a will made the day before his death leaving everything of which he can dispose by will to C, a stranger, his creditors will be paid, the Court will have power to make provision for B under The Dependants\u2019 Relief Act and the remainder of the $500,000 will go to C; but if (ii) he leaves a will made the day before his death in which he designates C as the beneficiary of all his insurance policies, C will take the $500,000 and neither the creditors nor B can get anything, since under the combined effect of ss. 131(8) and 161(4) the will is a declaration and C a designated ordinary beneficiary. I do not think the words of the statute require such a result and I would respectfully decline to follow a decision that so held unless it were binding upon me.\nIn my opinion, the proceeds of a policy payable to an ordinary beneficiary can be resorted to by creditors of the insured and, consequently, I do not need to consider the argument of the respondent based on s. 8 of The Dependants\u2019 Relief Act as that argument rests on the assumption that the proceeds would be free from the claims of creditors. For the above reasons I have reached the conclusion that the position of an ordinary beneficiary designated in a life insurance policy is analogous to that of a legatee to whom a legacy of an amount equal to the proceeds of the policy is given; and that while on the death of the insured the beneficiary may enforce payment from the insurer he will hold the proceeds of the policy subject to the possible claims of creditors or of dependants under The Dependants\u2019 Relief Act in the same manner as if he had received them as a specific legacy.\nIn the result I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgments below and direct that the application be referred back to the learned Surrogate Court Judge to be dealt with on the basis that the proceeds of the policies in question should be treated for the purposes of s. 2(1) of The Dependants\u2019 Relief Act as forming part of the estate of the late Everett George Kerslake specifically bequeathed to the respondent. The costs of both parties in all courts should be paid out of the proceeds of the policies in question, the costs of the further proceedings hereby directed should be disposed of by the learned Surrogate Court Judge.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, CARTWRIGHT J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Cameron, Weldon, Brewin & McCallum, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the respondent: David J.

The Queen, (1957) S.C.R. 531\nDate: 1957-06-26\nLouis Beaver (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nHer Majesty the Queen (Defendant) Respondent.\n1957: May 30; 1957: June 26.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nNarcotic drugs\u2014Possession\u2014What constitutes\u2014Physical possession of package without knowledge of true nature of contents\u2014The Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 201, s. 4(1)(d).\nOne who has physical possession of a package which he believes to contain a harmless substance but which in fact contains a narcotic drug, cannot be convicted of being in possession of the drug under s. 4(1)(d) of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act. The essence of that crime is the possession of the forbidden substance and in a criminal case there is in law no possession without knowledge of the character of the forbidden substance. Section 4(1)(d) is not an enactment of the class that excludes mens rea as an essential ingredient of the offence, and there is nothing in the wording of s. 17 of the Act requiring such a construction of s. 4(1)(d). It is, therefore, misdirection for a trial judge to tell the jury that, if possession of a package is established, the only question for them to decide is whether or not the package in fact contained a narcotic drug, and that the accused\u2019s knowledge or lack of knowledge of that fact, or even his honest but mistaken belief that it was a harmless substance, are wholly irrelevant to the question of his guilt or innocence and must not be considered by them.\nRex v. Hess, [1949] 1 W.W.R. 577, approved; Morelli v. The King (1932), 58 C.C.C. 120; Rex v. Lawrence, [1952] O.R. 149, overruled.\nPer Fauteux and Abbott JJ., dissenting: The statute creates an absolute prohibition and mens rea is therefore not an essential element of the offence of possession. The principle underlying the Act is that possession of drugs covered by it is unlawful and where any exception is made to this principle that exception is made subject to particular controlling provisions and conditions.\nAPPEAL by the accused from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] dismissing an appeal from convictions. Appeal allowed in part.\nC.L. Dubin, Q.C., for the appellant.\nWalter M. Martin, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Rand, Locke and Cartwright JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014The appellant was tried jointly with one Max Beaver before His Honour Judge Forsyth and a jury in the Court of General Sessions of the Peace for the County of York on an indictment reading as follows:\nThe jurors for our Lady the Queen present that LOUIS BEAVER and MAX BEAVER, at the City of Toronto, in the County of York, on or about the 12th day of March, in the year 1954, unlawfully did sell a drug, to wit, diacetylmorphine, without the authority of a license from the Minister of National Health and Welfare or other lawful authority, contrary to Section 4(1)(f) of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, Revised Statutes of Canada, 1952, Chapter 201 and amendments thereto.\n2. The said jurors further present that the said LOUIS BEAVER and MAX BEAVER, at the City of Toronto, in the County of York, on or about the 12th day of March, in the year 1954, unlawfully did have in their possession a drug, to wit, diacetylmorphine, without the authority of a license from the Minister of National Health and Welfare or other lawful authority, contrary to Section 4(1)(d) of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, Revised Statutes of Canada 1952, Chapter 201, and amendments thereto;\nAND FURTHER that the said LOUIS BEAVER is an habitual criminal;\nAND FURTHER that the said MAX BEAVER is an habitual criminal. On September 19, 1955, the accused were found guilty on both counts and on the same day the learned trial judge found them to be habitual criminals. On October 17, 1955, the learned judge sentenced them to 7 years\u2019 imprisonment on each count, the sentences to run concurrently, and also imposed sentences of preventive detention.\nMax Beaver has since died and we are concerned only with the case of the appellant.\nThe appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario against both convictions and against the finding that he was an habitual criminal. These appeals were dismissed.\nOn February 19, 1957, the appellant was given leave to appeal to this Court from the convictions on the two counts on the following grounds:\n1: The learned trial Judge erred in failing to instruct the jury that if they accepted the evidence of Louis Beaver or were in doubt as a result of it, he was not guilty of the offence.\n2: The learned trial Judge erred in holding that the accused Louis Beaver was guilty of the offence charged whether he knew the package handed by the accused Max Beaver to the Police were drugs or not.\n3: The learned trial Judge erred in instructing the jury that the only point that they had to decide was whether in fact the package handed the police by the accused Max Beaver was diacetylmorphine.\n4: The charge to the jury by the learned trial Judge and the Court of Appeal is in error in holding that the accused Louis Beaver could be convicted of the offence charged in the absence of knowledge on his part that the substance in question was a drug.\nBy the same order, leave to appeal from the finding that the appellant was an habitual criminal was granted, conditionally upon the appeals from the convictions being successful.\nIt is not necessary to set out the facts in detail. There was evidence on which it was open to the jury to find (i) that Max Beaver sold to a police officer, who was working under cover, a package which in fact contained diacetylmorphine, (ii) that the appellant was a party to the sale of the package, (iii) that while the appellant did not have the package on his person or in his physical possession he and Max Beaver were acting jointly in such circumstances that the possession which the latter had of the package was the possession of both of the accused, and (iv) that the appellant had no knowledge that the substance contained in the package was diacetylmorphine and believed it to be sugar of milk.\nI do not mean to suggest that the jury would necessarily have made the fourth finding but there was evidence on which they might have done so, or which might have left them in a state of doubt as to whether or not the appellant knew that the package contained anything other than sugar of milk.\nThe learned trial judge, against the protest of the appellant, charged the jury, in effect, that if they were satisfied that the appellant had in his possession a package and sold it, then, if in fact the substance contained in the package was diacetylmorphine, the appellant was guilty on both counts, and that the questions (i) whether he had any knowledge of what the substance was, or (ii) whether he entertained the honest but mistaken belief that it was a harmless substance were irrelevant and must not be considered. Laidlaw J.A., who delivered the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal, was of opinion that this charge was right in law and that the learned trial judge was bound by the decision in Rex v. Lawrence[2], to direct the jury as he did. The main question on this appeal is whether this view of the law is correct.\nThe problem is one of construction of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 201, and particularly the following sections, which at the date of the offences charged read as follows:\n4. (1) Every person who\u2026\n(d) has in his possession any drug save and except under the authority of a licence from the Minister first had and obtained, or other lawful authority;\u2026\n(f) manufactures, sells, gives away, delivers or distributes or makes any offer in respect of any drug, or any substance represented or held out by such person to be a drug, to any person without first obtaining a licence from the Minister, or without other lawful authority;\u2026\nis guilty of an offence, and is liable\n(i) upon indictment, to imprisonment for any term not exceeding seven years and not less than six months, and to a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars and not less than two hundred dollars, and, in addition, at the discretion of the judge, to be whipped; or (ii) upon summary conviction, to imprisonment with or without hard labour for any term not exceeding eighteen months and not less than six months, and to a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars and not less than two hundred dollars.\n(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of the Criminal Code, or of any other statute or law, the court has no power to impose less than the minimum penalties herein prescribed, and shall, in all cases of conviction, impose both fine and imprisonment;\u2026\n11. (1) No person shall, without lawful authority or without a permit signed by the Minister or some person authorized by him in that behalf, import or have in his possession any opium pipe, opium lamp, or other device or apparatus designed or generally used for the purpose of preparing opium for smoking, or smoking or inhaling opium, or any article capable of being used as or as part of any such pipe, lamp or other device or apparatus.\n(2) Any person violating the provisions of this section is liable, upon summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding one hundred dollars, and not less than fifty dollars, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months, or to both fine and imprisonment.\n15. Where any person is charged with an offence under paragraph (a), (d), (e), (f), or (g) of subsection (1) of section 4, it is not necessary for the prosecuting authority to establish that the accused had not a licence from the Minister or was not otherwise authorized to commit the act complained of, and if the accused pleads or alleges that he had such licence or other authority the burden of proof thereof shall be upon the person so charged.\n17. Without limiting the generality of paragraph (d) of subsection (1) of section 4, any person who occupies, controls, or is in possession of any building, room, vessel, vehicle, enclosure or place, in or upon which any drug or any article mentioned in section 11 is found, shall, if charged with having such drug or article in possession without lawful authority, be deemed to have been so in possession unless he prove that the drug or article was there without his authority, knowledge or consent, or that he was lawfully entitled to the possession thereof.\nIn the course of the argument counsel also referred to the following provisions of other statutes of Canada:\nThe Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 158, s. 28(1):\n28(1) Every Act shall be read and construed as if any offence for which the offender may be\n(a) prosecuted by indictment, howsoever such offence may be therein described or referred to, were described or referred to as an indictable offence;\n(b) punishable on summary conviction, were described or referred to as an offence; and\nall provisions of the Criminal Code relating to indictable offences, or offences, as the case may be, shall apply to every such offence.\nThe Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36, s. 5:\n5. In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,\u2026\n(b) having in one\u2019s possession includes not only having in one\u2019s own personal possession, but also knowingly, (i) having in the actual possession or custody of any other person, and\n(ii) having in any place, whether belonging to or occupied by one\u2019s self or not, for the use or benefit of one\u2019s self or of any other person.\n2. If there are two or more persons, and any one or more of them, with the knowledge and consent of the rest, has or have anything in his or their custody or possession, it shall be deemed and taken to be in the custody and possession of each and all of them.\nThe judgment in appeal is supported by earlier decisions of appellate Courts in Ontario, Quebec and Nova Scotia, but a directly contrary view has been expressed by the Court of Appeal for British Columbia. While this conflict has existed since 1948, this is the first occasion on which the question has been brought before this Court.\nIt may be of assistance in examining the problem to use a simple illustration. Suppose X goes to the shop of Y, a druggist, and asks Y to sell him some baking-soda. Y hands him a sealed packet which he tells him contains baking-soda and charges him a few cents. X honestly believes that the packet contains baking-soda but in fact it contains heroin. X puts the package in his pocket, takes it home and later puts it in a cupboard in his bathroom. There would seem to be no doubt that X has had actual manual and physical possession of the package and that he continues to have possession of the package while it is in his cupboard. The main question raised on this appeal is whether, in the supposed circumstances, X would be guilty of the crime of having heroin in his possession?\nIt will be observed at once that we are not concerned with the incidence of the burden of proof or of the obligation of adducing evidence. The judgment of the Court of Appeal states the law to be that X must be convicted although he proves to the point of demonstration that he honestly believed the package to contain baking-soda.\nI have examined all the cases referred to by counsel in the course of their full and helpful arguments but do not propose to refer to them in detail as the differences of opinion which they disclose are not so much as to the principles by which the Court should be guided in con- struing a statute which creates a crime as to the result of applying those principles to the Act with which we are concerned.\nThe rule of construction has often been stated.\nIn The Company of Proprietors of the Margate Pier v. Hannam et al.[3], Lord Coke is quoted as having said:\nActs of Parliament are to be so construed as no man that is innocent, or free from injury or wrong, be by a literal construction punished or endamaged.\nIn The Attorney General v. Bradlaugh[4], Brett M.R. said:\nNow, to my mind, it is contrary to the whole established law of England (unless the legislation on the subject has clearly enacted it), to say that a person can be guilty of a crime in England without a wrongful intent\u2014without an attempt to do that which the law has forbidden. I am aware that in a particular case, and under a particular criminal statute, fifteen judges to one held that a person whom the jury found to have no intent to do what was forbidden, and whom the jury found to have been deceived, and to have understood the facts to be such that he might with impunity have done a certain thing, was by the terms of that Act of Parliament guilty of a crime, and could be imprisoned. I say still, as I said then, that I cannot subscribe to the propriety of that decision. I bow to it, but I cannot subscribe to it: but the majority of the judges forming the Court so held because they said that the enactment was absolutely clear.\nIn Reynolds v. G.H. Austin & Sons Ld.[5], Devlin J. says at pp. 147-8:\nIt has always been a principle of the common law that mens rea is an essential element in the commission of any criminal offence against the common law. In the case of statutory offences it depends on the effect of the statute. In Sherras v. De Rutzen, [1895] 1 Q.B. 918, 921, Wright, J., in his well-known judgment, laid it down that there was a presumption that mens rea was an essential ingredient in a statutory offence, but that that presumption was liable to be displaced either by the words of the statute creating the offence or by the subject-matter with which it dealt\u2026 Kennedy, L.J., in Hobbs v. Winchester Corporation, [1910] 2 K.B. 471, 483, thought that in construing a modern statute this presumption as to mens rea did not exist. In this respect, as he said, he differed from Channell, J., in the court below. But the view of Wright, J., in Sherras v. De Rutzen has consistently been followed. I need refer only to the dictum of Lord Goddard, C.J., in Harding v. Price, [1948] 1 K.B. 695, 700: \u201cThe general rule applicable to criminal cases is actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea, and I venture to repeat what I said in Brend v. Wood (1946), 62 T.L.R. 462, 463: \u2018It is of the utmost importance for the protection of the liberty of the subject that a court should always bear in mind that unless a statute either clearly or by necessary implication rules out mens rea as a constituent part of a crime, the court should not find a man guilty of an offence against the criminal law unless he has a guilty mind\u2019.\u201d\nIn Regina v. Tolson[6], Stephen J. says at p. 188:\n...I think it may be laid down as a general rule that an alleged offender is deemed to have acted under that state of facts which he in good faith and on reasonable grounds believed to exist when he did the act alleged to be an offence.\nI am unable to suggest any real exception to this rule, nor has one ever been suggested to me.\nand adds at p. 189:\nOf course, it would be competent to the legislature to define a crime in such a way as to make the existence of any state of mind immaterial. The question is solely whether it has actually done so in this case.\nI adhere to the opinion which, with the concurrence of my brother Nolan, I expressed in The Queen v. Rees[7], that the first of the statements of Stephen J. quoted above should now be read in the light of the judgment of Lord Goddard C.J., concurred in by Lynskey and Devlin JJ., in Wilson v. Inyang[8], which, in my opinion, rightly decides that the essential question is whether the belief entertained by the accused is an honest one and that the existence or non-existence of reasonable grounds for such belief is merely relevant evidence to be weighed by the tribunal of fact in determining that essential question.\nIn Watts and Gaunt v. The Queen[9], Estey J. says:\nWhile an offence of which mens rea is not an essential ingredient may be created by legislation, in view of the general rule a section creating an offence ought not to be so construed unless Parliament has, by express language or necessary implication, disclosed such an intention.\nI do not suggest that the principle stated in the above excerpts was absent from the minds of the learned judges in the Courts of Appeal in Ontario, Quebec and Nova Scotia who decided the cases on which the respondent relies. Those decisions are founded on the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, in Morelli v. The King[10], in which Bond J., at p. 128, concluded his reasons as follows:\nI therefore reach the conclusion that while it is a principle of our law that to constitute an offence there must be a guilty mind, and that principle must be imported into the statute (per Cockburn, C.J., 8 Cox C.C., at p. 478), yet by apt words Parliament may exclude such a requirement, and in the case now under consideration has effectively done so.\nWhen the decisions as to the construction of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act on which the respondent relies are examined it appears that two main reasons are assigned for holding that mens rea is not an essential ingredient of the offence created by s. 4(1)(d), these being (i) the assumption that the subject-matter with which the Act deals is of the kind dealt with in the cases of which Hobbs v. Winchester Corporation[11] is typical and which are sometimes referred to as \u201cpublic welfare offence cases\u201d, and (ii) by implication from the wording of s. 17 of the Act.\nAs to the first of these reasons, I can discern little similarity between a statute designed, by forbidding the sale of unsound meat, to ensure that the supply available to the public shall be wholesome, and a statute making it a serious crime to possess or deal in narcotics; the one is to ensure that a lawful and necessary trade shall be carried on in a manner not to endanger the public health, the other to forbid altogether conduct regarded as harmful in itself. As a necessary feature of his trade, the butcher holds himself out as selling meat fit for consumption; he warrants that quality; and it is part of his duty as trader to see that the merchandise is wholesome. The statute simply converts that civil personal duty into a public duty.\nA few passages from the judgment in Hobbs v. Winchester Corporation will show the view taken of the purpose of the legislation there under consideration:\nCozens-Hardy M.R., at p. 476:\nBefore reading the material words of these sections it is perhaps convenient to indicate what is the plain and apparent object of the Act with regard to the sale of unsound meat. The object is to prevent danger to the public health by the sale of meat for human consumption in a state or condition in which it is dangerous to human health. Farwell L.J., at p. 481:\nWho is to take the risk of the meat being unsound, the butcher or the public? In my opinion the Legislature intended that the butcher should take the risk and that the public should be protected, irrespective of the guilt or innocence of the butcher. The knowledge or possible means of knowledge of the butcher is not a matter which affects the public; it is the unsound meat which poisons them; and I think that the Legislature intended that the butcher should sell unsound meat at his peril.\nKennedy L.J., at pp. 484-5:\nA man takes upon himself to offer goods to the public for their consumption with a view to making a profit by the sale of them. Those goods may be so impregnated with disease as to carry death or at any rate serious injury to health to any one consuming them. To say that the difficulty of discovering the disease is a sufficient ground for enabling the seller to excuse himself on the plea that he cannot be reasonably expected to have the requisite technical knowledge or to keep an analyst on his premises, is simply to say that the public are to be left unprotected and must submit to take the risk of purchasing an article of food which may turn out to be dangerous to life or health. I think that the policy of the Act is this: that if a man chooses for profit to engage in a business which involves the offering for sale of that which may be deadly or injurious to health he must take that risk, and that it is not a sufficient defence for any one who chooses to embark on such a business to say \u201cI could not have discovered the disease unless I had an analyst on the premises.\u201d\nAssuming that Hobbs v. Winchester Corporation was rightly decided I do not think that its reasoning supports the decision of the Court of Appeal in the case at bar. The difference between the subject-matter of the legislation there considered and that of the Act with which we are concerned is too wide.\nAs to the second reason, the argument is put as follows: Using again the illustration I have taken above, it is said (i) that the words of s. 17 would require the conviction of X if the package was found in his bathroom cupboard \u201cunless he prove that [it] was there without his authority, knowledge or consent\u201d, that is, he is prima facie presumed to be guilty but can exculpate himself by proving lack of knowledge, and (ii) that since no such words as \u201cunless he prove that the drug was in his possession without his knowledge\u201d are found in s. 4(1)(d) it must be held that Parliament intended that lack of knowledge should be no defence.\nIn my view all that s. 17 accomplishes, still using the same illustration, is, on proof that the package was in his cupboard, to shift to X the onus of proving that he did not have possession of the package. To this X would answer: \u201cOf course I had possession of the package, I bought it, paid for it, carried it home and put it in my cupboard. My defence is that I thought it contained baking-soda. I had no idea it contained heroin.\u201d If it be suggested that X could not usefully make this reply if what was found in his house was not a sealed package but an article of the sort described in s. 11 the answer would appear to be that many persons might not recognize an opium lamp or an article capable of being used as part of such a lamp. The wording of s. 17 does not appear to me to compel the Court to construe s. 4 as the Court of Appeal has done. It still leaves unanswered the question: Has X possession of heroin when he has in his hand or in his pocket or in his cupboard a package which in fact contains heroin but which he honestly believes contains only baking-soda? In my opinion that question must be answered in the negative. The essence of the crime is the possession of the forbidden substance and in a criminal case there is in law no possession without knowledge of the character of the forbidden substance. Just as in Regina v. Ashwell[12] the accused did not in law have possession of the complainant\u2019s sovereign so long as he honestly believed it to be a shilling so in my illustration X did not have possession of heroin so long as he honestly believed the package to contain baking-soda. The words of Lord Coleridge C.J. in Regina v. Ashwell at p. 225, quoted by Charles J. delivering the unanimous judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Rex v. Hudson[13]:\nIn good sense it seems to me he did not take it till he knew what he had got; and when he knew what he had got, that same instant he stole it.\nmight well be adapted to my illustration to read: \u201cIn good sense it seems to me he did not have possession of heroin till he knew what he had got.\u201d\nIn my view the law is correctly stated in the following passage in the judgment of O\u2019Halloran J.A., with whom Robertson J.A. concurred, in Rex v. Hess[14]:\nTo constitute \u201cpossession\u201d within the meaning of the criminal law it is my judgment that where, as here, there is manual handling of a thing, it must be co-existent with knowledge of what the thing is, and both these elements must be co-existent with some act of control (outside public duty). When those three elements exist together, I think it must be conceded that under sec. 4(1)(d) it does not then matter if the thing is retained for an innocent purpose.\nIf the matter were otherwise doubtful I would be drawn to the conclusion that Parliament did not intend to enact that mens rea should not be an essential ingredient of the offence created by s. 4(1)(d) by the circumstance that on conviction a minimum sentence of 6 months\u2019 imprisonment plus a fine of $200 must be imposed. Counsel informed us that they have found no other statutory provision which has been held to create a crime of strict responsibility, that is to say, one in which the necessity for mens rea is excluded, on conviction for which a sentence of imprisonment is mandatory. The legislation dealt with in Hobbs v. Winchester Corporation, supra, provided that a sentence of imprisonment might, not must, be imposed on a convicted person. As to this Kennedy L.J. said at p. 485:\nGreat stress is laid on the character of the punishment that may be inflicted under s. 117. I protest for myself that we are not to assume that where a judicial discretion is granted by the Legislature the tribunal, whatever its rank may be, exercising that discretion will exercise it otherwise than in a judicial manner. Because there may be a case, as there obviously may be, in which a man unknowingly exposes for sale food which is dangerous to health, and because the offence created by the statute is punishable by imprisonment in the first instance, that to my mind is not a ground for holding that a mens rea must be shewn in every case. If it is shewn that the man had no guilty knowledge the magistrate would probably inflict a merely nominal fine\u2026\nAt p. 481 Cozens-Hardy M.R. expressed himself in similar terms.\nIt would, of course, be within the power of Parliament to enact that a person who, without any guilty knowledge, had in his physical possession a package which he honestly believed to contain a harmless substance such as baking-soda but which in fact contained heroin, must on proof of such facts be convicted of a crime and sentenced to at least 6 months\u2019 imprisonment; but I would refuse to impute such an intention to Parliament unless the words of the statute were clear and admitted of no other interpretation. To borrow the words of Lord Kenyan in Fowler v. Padget[15]: I would adopt any construction of the statute that the words will bear, in order to avoid such monstrous consequences as would manifestly ensue from the construction contended for\u2026\nThe conclusion which I have reached on the main question as to the proper construction of the word \u201cpossession\u201d makes it unnecessary for me to consider the other points raised by Mr. Dubin in his argument as to the construction of s. 4(1)(d). For the above reasons I would quash the conviction on the charge of having possession of a drug.\nAs to the charge of selling, as is pointed out by my brother Fauteux, the appellant\u2019s version of the facts brings his actions within the provisions of s. 4(1)(f) since he and his brother jointly sold a substance represented or held out by them to be heroin; and I agree with the conclusion of my brother Fauteux that the conviction on the charge of selling must be affirmed.\nFor the above reasons, I would dismiss the appeal as to the first count (that is, of selling) but would direct that the time during which the appellant has been confined pending the determination of the appeal shall count as part of the term of imprisonment imposed pursuant to that conviction. As to the second count (that is, of having possession) I would allow the appeal, quash the conviction and direct a new trial. As leave to appeal from the finding that the appellant is an habitual criminal was granted conditionally upon the appeal from the convictions being successful, and as the appeal as to one conviction has failed, we are without jurisdiction to review the finding that the appellant is an habitual criminal and in the result that finding stands.\nThe judgment of Fauteux and Abbott JJ. was delivered by\nFAUTEUX J. (dissenting):\u2014The appellant Louis Beaver appeals, with leave of this Court, from a unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[16] affirming his conviction by a jury on an indictment charging him, jointly with his brother Max Beaver, on two counts: (i) possession and (ii) sale, on March 12, 1954, of a drug, to wit, diacetylmorphine, contrary to s. 4(1)(d) and s: 4(1)(f), respectively, of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 201.\nSubsequent to this conviction, the appellant was found to be an habitual criminal and this conviction, being appealed, was also unanimously confirmed by the Court of Appeal. Leave to appeal as to this conviction has been granted, conditionally upon the appeal against the conviction on the primary charge being successful.\nTo appreciate and determine the points of law raised on behalf of the appellant on the appeal related to the primary charge, it is expedient but sufficient to relate the following facts.\nThe evidence for the prosecution shows that in the forenoon of March 12, 1954, Constable Tassie of the R.C.M.P., known and operating under the name of Al Demeter, was introduced to the appellant by one Montroy, a drug addict, as one who was interested to obtain, jointly with him, one ounce of heroin. The price asked by the appellant for such a quantity being $800, it was agreed that only half an ounce would be bought and, further, that delivery and payment would be made at four o\u2019clock in the afternoon, at the same place; the appellant insisting, however, that only one of either Tassie or Montroy was then to appear. At the appointed time and place, Tassie arrived and boarded the car driven by the appellant, then in company of his brother Max Beaver. Having travelled a certain distance, the car stopped; Max Beaver walked out towards a lamp-post, picked up a parcel, came back and boarded the car, and while proceeding to another destination, gave the parcel to Tassie who paid him the agreed price. Admittedly, this package contained half an ounce of diacetylmorphine.\nThe appellant did not challenge these incriminating facts but, testifying in his own defence, gave the following evidence: The day before the above-related occurrences, appellant and Montroy met together. The latter explained to the former that one Al Demeter had \u201cdouble crossed\u201d him, that he wanted to \u201cget even\u201d with him and, to achieve this purpose, made the following proposal, to which appellant acceded. It was agreed that Montroy would introduce Demeter, who wanted to have drugs, to appellant as one from whom they could be obtained; a sale would be made; but sugar of milk instead of drugs would be delivered and the price received by the appellant would be remitted to Montroy. Feeling indebted to Montroy, from whom he and his brother, Max Beaver, had received certain favours while in a penitentiary, appellant executed this fraudulent plan.\nHence, on his story, appellant\u2019s defence was that he never intended to deal in drugs and never knew that the parcel delivered contained any. This was not accepted by the trial judge or by the Court of Appeal as being a valid defence in law under the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act. The jury, therefore, did not consider that defence which was withdrawn from them.\nThe grounds of law upon which leave to appeal was granted are the following:\n1: The learned trial Judge erred in failing to instruct the jury that if they accepted the evidence of Louis Beaver or were in doubt as a result of it, he was not guilty of the offence.\n2: The learned trial Judge erred in holding that the accused Louis Beaver was guilty of the offence charged whether he knew the package handed by the accused Max Beaver to the Police were drugs or not.\n3: The learned trial Judge erred in instructing the jury that the only point that they had to decide was whether in fact the package handed the police by the accused Max Beaver was diacetylmorphine.\n4: The charge to the jury by the learned trial Judge and the Court of Appeal is in error in holding that the accused Louis Beaver could be convicted of the offence charged in the absence of knowledge on his part that the substance in question was a drug.\nThe first proposition of law, submitted by counsel for the appellant, is that want of knowledge as to the nature of a substance found in the possession of an accused is a good defence to a charge that he had in his possession a drug, contrary to s. 4(1)(d) of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act.\nThis submission rests on the presumption that mens rea is a necessary ingredient in every offence. But, as stated by Wright J. in Sherras v. De Rutzen[17], this presumption is liable to be displaced and this may be done either by the words of the statute creating the offence or by the subject-matter with which it deals, both of which must be considered. This view of the law and of the method of interpreting a statute when the question arises, is expressed in many other cases, such as Hobbs v. Winchester Corporation[18], and Reynolds v. G.H. Austin & Sons Ld.[19]\nIt appears convenient to deal first with the subject-matter of the Act and consider afterwards the provisions directly relevant to the offence of possession.\nThe plain and apparent object of the Act is to prevent, by a rigid control of the possession of drugs, the danger to public health, and to guard society against the social evils which an uncontrolled traffic in drugs is bound to generate. The scheme of the Act is this: The importation, exportation, sale, manufacture, production and distribution of drugs are subject to the obtention of a licence which the Minister of National Health and Welfare may issue, with the approval of the Governor General in council, and in which the place where such operations may be carried on is stated. Under the same authority are indicated ports and places in Canada where drugs may be exported or imported, the manner in which they are to be packed and marked for export, the records to be kept for such export, import, receipt, sale, disposal and distribution. The Act also provides for the establishment of all other convenient and necessary regulations with respect to duration, terms and forms of the several licences therein provided. Without a licence, it is an offence to import or export from Canada and an offence for any one who, not being a common carrier, takes or carries, or causes to be taken or carried from any place in Canada to any other place in Canada, any drug. Druggists, physicians, dentists and veterinary surgeons stand of course, in a privileged class; but even their dealings in drugs for medicinal purposes are the object of a particular control. Under penalties of the law, some of them have to keep records of their operations, while others have the obligation to answer inquiries in respect thereto. Having in one\u2019s possession drugs without a licence or other lawful authority, is an offence. In brief, the principle underlying the Act is that possession of drugs covered by it is unlawful; and where any exception is made to the principle, the exceptions themselves are attended with particular controlling provisions and conditions.\nThe enforcement sections of the Act manifest the exceptional vigilance and firmness which Parliament thought of the essence to forestall the unlawful traffic in narcotic drugs and cope effectively with the unusual difficulties standing in the way of the realization of the object of the statute. Substantive and procedural principles generally prevailing under the Criminal Code in favour of the subject are being restricted or excepted. The power to search by day or by night, either premises or the person, is largely extended under s. 19. Special writs of assistance are provided for under s. 22. The consideration of the provisions of ss. 4 and 17 being deferred for the moment, the burden of proof is either alleviated or shifted to persons charged with violations under ss. 6, 11, 13, 16 and 18. Minimum sentences are provided or are made mandatory, under ss. 4 and 6. Deportation of aliens found guilty is also mandatory and this notwithstanding the provisions of the Immigration Act or any other Act, under s. 26. And the application of the Identification of Criminals Act, ordinarily limited to the case of indictable offences, is, by s. 27, extended to any offence under the Act.\nAll of these provisions are indicative of the will of Parliament to give the most efficient protection to public health against the danger attending the uncontrolled use of drugs as well as against the social evils incidental thereto, by measures generally centred and directed to possession itself of the drugs covered by the Act. The subject-matter, the purpose and the scope of the Act are such that to subject its provisions to the narrow construction suggested on behalf of appellant would defeat the very object of the Act. Such narrow construction is repugnant to the clear terms of s. 15 of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 158. In Chajutin v. Whitehead[20], Lord Hewart C.J., referring to the provisions of art. 18 of para. 4(d) of the Aliens\u2019 Order, 1920, which made an offence of the possession, without lawful authority, of a forged passport, said, at p. 509:\nIn my opinion the Order\u2014the circumstances giving rise to which are\nsufficiently familiar\u2014would be reduced almost to waste paper if the offence could not be established unless the prosecution proved that the person having in his possession the forged passport had guilty knowledge of the fact that it had been forged. It is not easy to see how that knowledge, except in rare circumstances, could be directly proved; but not only, in my opinion, is there nothing in this part of the article to put any such burden upon the prosecution, but the words of the article negative the view that the prosecution is required to carry such a burden.\nIn that case, the appeal committee found, as a fact, that the appellant did not know that the passport had been altered, and honestly believed, on reasonable grounds, that it had been issued to him in the ordinary course, by the proper authority. The language of art. 18, para. 4(d), of the Order was as follows:\nAny person shall be guilty of an\u2026offence if\u2026he\u2026\n(d) without lawful authority uses or has in his possession any forged, altered or irregular certificate, passport, or other document, or any passport or document on which any visa or endorsement has been altered or forged.\nIt was none the less decided that it was neither necessary for the prosecution to prove guilty knowledge of the alteration, nor open to the defendant to secure acquittal by proof that he did not know and had no reason to suspect that the passport was altered. This case, amongst others, such as Rex v. Wheat; Rex v. Stocks[21], is a clear authority supporting the proposition that the presumption that mens rea is an ingredient of an offence, as well as the defence flowing from an honest belief as to the existence of a state of facts may, by reason of the subject-matter of the Act or of the language of its provisions, or of both, cease to obtain. The Opium and Narcotic Drug Act comes, in my view, within these classes of Acts referred to by Wright J. in Sherras v. De Rutzen, supra.\nWith these considerations related to the subject-matter of the Act, it is appropriate now to turn to the language of the provisions of the statute directly related to the offence of possession. The main provisions to consider are those of s. 4(1)(d), reading as follows:\n4. (1) Every person who\u2026\n(d) has in his possession any drug save and except under the authority of a licence from the Minister first had and obtained, or other lawful authority;\u2026\nis guilty of an offence, and is liable\u2026\nOn the plain, literal and grammatical meaning of the words of this section, there is an absolute prohibition to be in possession of drugs, whatever be the various meanings of which the word possession may be susceptible, unless the possession is under the authority of a licence from the Minister first had and obtained, or under other lawful authority. As to the meaning of these provisions, I am in respectful agreement with and content to refer to the reasoning of Laidlaw J.A., speaking for the Court of Appeal for Ontario, in Rex v. Lawrence[22].\nThe language of the section and the subject-matter of the Act in which it is found, both considered in the light of the provisions of s. 15 of the Interpretation Act, cannot justify the narrow meaning of the word possession which is contended for by counsel for the appellant. I find no reason which would render inapplicable to this case what was said by Lord Hewart C.J. in the case of Chajutin v. Whitehead, supra. The question is not what is the meaning ascribed to the word possession in civil or in criminal cases, at common law or under statutory laws, but what is the meaning of the word under the Act and the provisions here considered. The case of Regina v. Ashwell[23] is, I think, of no application in the matter. The question there considered was possession in relation to the offence of larceny. Larceny is an offence involving the violation of possession; it is an offence against a possessor. This is not the type of possession with which this Act is concerned.\nIn The Attorney-General v. Lockwood[24], Alderson B. said at p. 398:\nThe rule of law, I take it, upon the construction of all statutes, and therefore applicable to the construction of this, is, whether they be penal or remedial, to construe them according to the plain, literal and gramma- tical meaning of the words in which they are expressed, unless that construction leads to a plain and clear contradiction of the apparent purpose of the act, or to some palpable and evident absurdity.\nThe interpretation of s. 4(1)(d), as made particularly in Bex v. Lawrence, supra, cannot, I think, be said to lead \u201cto a plain and clear contradiction of the apparent purpose of the Act\u201d. On the contrary, of the construction suggested by the appellant and the one submitted by the respondent, the latter appears to be the only one really consistent with the apparent purpose of the Act. Nor, in my respectful view, can this latter construction be said to lead \u201cto some palpable and evident absurdity\u201d. Such a view was not the one reached by Lord Hewart C.J. in Chajutin v. Whitehead, supra, where the provision of the law creating the offence was couched in language substantially similar to the one here examined. Indeed, and when the provisions of s. 4(1)(d) are further considered in the light of those of s. 17, it would seem to me that the construction suggested on behalf of the appellant would, as it will appear, bring an astonishing result.\nSection 17 reads:\n17. Without limiting the generality of paragraph (d) of subsection (1) of section 4, any person who occupies, controls, or is in possession of any building, room, vessel, vehicle, enclosure or place, in or upon which any drug or any article mentioned in section 11 is found, shall, if charged with having such drug or article in possession without lawful authority, be deemed to have been so in possession unless he prove that the drug or article was there without his authority, knowledge or consent, or that he was lawfully entitled to the possession thereof.\nThe language of the section is clear. Parliament has provided: (i) that either one of these three facts, i.e., occupation, or control, or possession, of any place in or upon which a drug covered by the Act is found, makes without more one who occupies, controls or has in his possession such a place, a possessor of drug without lawful authority, and (ii) that the occupier of such a place \u201cshall, if charged with having such drug or article in possession without lawful authority, be deemed to have been so in possession unless he prove that the drug or article was there without his authority, knowledge or consent, or that he was lawfully entitled to the possession thereof\u201d. In the circumstances described in this section, knowledge in any sense is not an essential ingredient of the offence; but lack of knowledge, if proved, is a defence. Yet, on the submission of appellant, if a drug is found on the very person of the accused, knowledge as to the nature of the substance would be an essential ingredient of the offence and would, therefore, have to be proved as part of the case for the prosecution of a charge laid under s. 4(1)(d). The essential ingredients of unlawful possession, under the Act, are the same under s. 4(1)(d) and under s. 17; the opening words of the latter section forbid us to construe the offence in a manner varying from one section to the other. This, however, is the result flowing from the appellant\u2019s submission. Furthermore, and if it is argued that knowledge is of the essence of unlawful possession under both s. 4(1)(d) and s. 17, then one is at a loss to understand why Parliament should have, in the latter section, provided for a defence resting on the proof of lack of knowledge. A like interpretation of s. 17 strips this exculpatory provision of any meaning and effect. The language of the two sections can only be rationalized, I think, by interpreting s. 4(1)(d) as meaning what it says, i.e., as creating an absolute prohibition, and by interpreting s. 17 as extending the meaning of s. 4(1)(d), i.e., this absolute prohibition, to the circumstances described in s. 17, with, however, and only in such circumstances, a defence resting on the proof of lack of knowledge.\nThis is the first occasion which this Court has to consider this submission of appellant which, ever since the decision rendered in 1932 in Morelli v. The King[25], the judges of the provincial Courts of Appeal have, with a few exceptions, refused to accept. The majority judgment rendered in 1948 in Rex v. Hess[26] stands as the first expression of judicial opinion contrary to these views. In the majority of judgments rendered subsequently to the Hess case, the views therein expressed were not followed. This decision has no reference to the Morelli case and it rests principally on a concept of possession which, in my respectful view, the subject-matter, purpose and scope of the Act and the language of s. 4(1)(d) and s. 17 do not warrant. The more recent reported case, where a similar question was considered by the English Court of Criminal Appeal, is that of Regina v. Hallam[27]. The provision considered was s. 4(1) of the Explosive Substances Act, 1883, the relevant part of which reads:\nAny person who\u2026 knowingly has in his possession or under his control any explosive substance, under such circumstances as to give rise to a reasonable suspicion that he\u2026 does not have it in his possession or under his control for a lawful object, shall, unless he can show that he\u2026 had it in his possession or under his control for a lawful object, be guilty of felony\u2026\nOn this language, it was decided that knowledge that the substance was an explosive was an essential ingredient of the offence. Arguments such as the one related to the concept of possession, which feature the reasoning in the Hess case, supra, are foreign to this decision, which indeed was reached because the word possession was there qualified by the word \u201cknowingly\u201d. Such a word, as noted by Laidlaw J.A. in the Lawrence case, supra, is absent from s. 4(1)(d). Furthermore, while possession of explosive substances is not, under the English Act of 1883, subject to a licence first had and obtained or other lawful authority, the contrary is the case with respect to the possession of drugs under the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act. Finally, the existence of \u201csuch circumstances as to give rise to a reasonable suspicion\u201d that possession is for an unlawful object is an essential ingredient of the offence under the Explosive Substances Act; this ingredient does not appear under s. 4(1)(d). Reading the reasons for judgment in the Hallam case, one reaches the view that had the provisions therein considered been worded as are those of s. 4(1)(d) and as were also those of the section considered in Chajutin v. Whitehead, supra, a decision similar to the one rendered in the latter case would have been made.\nAs interpreted by most of the members of the Canadian Courts of Appeal since 1932, the provisions of s. 4(1)(d) are, like many other provisions of the Act, undoubtedly severe. The duty of the Courts is to give effect to the language of Parliament. And notwithstanding that the views expressed in Morelli and Lawrence, in particular, had been prevailing ever since 1932 and are still prevailing, Parliament has not seen fit to intervene. For all these reasons, I find it impossible to accede to the proposition that knowledge of the nature of the substance is of the essence of the offence of unlawful possession under the Act.\nEven assuming the correctness of this view of the law, argues counsel for the appellant, the latter could not be found guilty of either possession under s. 4(1)(d) or sale under s. 4(1)(f).\nAs to possession: Contrary to what is admittedly the fact in the case of Max Beaver, it is said, Louis Beaver the appellant did not have physical possession. The application of the relevant provisions of s. 5 of the 1927 Criminal Code in like matters has never been doubted. As stated by the Court of Appeal for British Columbia in Rex v. Colvin and Gladue[28], there is joint possession where one has a right to exercise some measure of control over the thing in the possession of another. On the admitted facts of this case, there is no doubt that the appellant was, to say the least, in full command and control of all the operations.\nAs to sale: Though the substance delivered to and paid for by Tassie was a drug, as admittedly it was represented and held out to be by appellant, it is said that the latter could not be guilty of the offence of sale under s. 4(1)(f) because, on his story, he intended and thought the substance sold to be sugar of milk. To this submission, the provisions of s. 4(1)(f) afford, I think, a complete answer:\n4. (1) Every one who\u2026\n(f)... sells,\u2026 any drug, or any substance represented or held out by such person to be a drug, to any person without first obtaining a licence from the Minister, or without other lawful authority;...\nIn the case of any sale made without first obtaining a licence from the Minister or without other lawful authority, the accuracy or inaccuracy of the representation made by the seller to the purchaser as to the nature of the substance sold and the honesty or dishonesty attending the representation, if inaccurate, are quite immaterial if the substance sold is represented or held out to be a drug by the seller to the purchaser. The relevant count of the indictment does not in terms say that appellant did sell a substance represented or held out by him to Tassie to be a drug, but that \u201che did sell a drug, to wit, diacetyl- morphine\u201d; in this language, however, is necessarily implied the allegation of the fact that appellant represented or held out the substance sold, delivered and paid for, to be a drug. Hence appellant\u2019s version of the facts brings this case within the provisions of s. 4(1)(f) and, if believed, would leave no alternative to a reasonable jury acting according to law but to return a verdict of guilty. Section 4(1)(f), as well as those previously referred to in the analysis of the Act, is indicative of the intent of Parliament to deal adequately with the methods, which are used in the unlawful traffic of drugs to defeat the purpose of the Act, ingenious as they may be. That the enforcement of the provisions of the Act may, in exceptional cases, lead to some injustice, is not an impossibility. But, to forestall this result as to such possible cases, there are remedies under the law, such as a stay of proceedings by the Attorney General or a free pardon under the royal prerogative.\nI would dismiss the appeal against the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming the conviction on the primary charges and, in view of this result, the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal, affirming the decision that appellant is an habitual criminal, remains undisturbed.\nAppeal allowed in part, FAUTEUX and ABBOTT JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Kimber & Dubin, Toronto.\n[1] [1956] O.W.N. 798, 116 C.C.C. 231, 25 C.R. 53.\n[2] [1952] O.R. 149, 102 C.C.C. 121, 13 C.R. 425.\n[3] (1819), 3 B. & Ald. 266 at 270, 106 E.R. 661.\n[4] (1885), 14 Q.B.D. 667 at 689-90.\n[5] [1951] 2 K.B. 135, [1951] 1 All E.R. 606.\n[6] (1889), 23 Q.B.D. 168.\n[7] [1956] S.C.R. 640 at 651, 115 C.C.C. 1, 24 C.R. 1, 4 D.L.R.

Bernier (Defendants) Respondents.\n1957: February 20, 21, 22, 25, 26, 27; 1957: June 26.\nPresent: Kerwin C.J. and Rand, Locke, Cartwright and Abbott JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nJudicial sales\u2014Duty of officer conducting sale\u2014Allegation of conspiracy between buyer and sheriff's officer\u2014Whether sheriff's officer obtained reasonable price for goods sold\u2014Evidence of value.\nThe plaintiff company appealed from the dismissal of an action for damages arising out of the sale of its goods under writs of extent issued in respect of unpaid income tax and excess profits tax. The action was based principally upon allegations that (i) the defendant T (the sheriff's officer in charge of the sale) had conspired with other defendants who bought the goods to arrange a fraudulent \"wash sale\" and thus to deprive the plaintiff of the opportunity of buying the goods, and (ii) the sheriff and T had negligently carried out their duties and had failed to obtain a reasonable price for the goods.\nHeld (Rand and Cartwright JJ. dissenting in part): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Locke and Abbott JJ.: As to the allegation of conspiracy, there were concurrent findings in the Courts below that the evidence did not support these allegations and the Court should not interfere with these findings. As to the claim based on negligence, the onus was on the plaintiff to establish a sale at an undervalue and the evidence as to value was unsatisfactory. T had been negligent in making no proper inventory or appraisal, but damage was the gist of the action and there were concurrent findings that damage had not been proved.\nPer Rand and Cartwright JJ., dissenting in part: While the evidence raised suspicion as to some of the dealings, the Court would not be justified in setting aside the concurrent findings in the Courts below negativing the existence of the alleged conspiracy. As to the claim based on negligence, however, the evidence did support a finding that T had not exercised due care to obtain the best price possible for the goods sold and that he could have obtained at least $700 more. The appellant was therefore entitled to judgment for $700 against T. APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] affirming a judgment of Wood J.[2] dismissing the action.

Ostlund, for the defendant insurance company, respondent.\nG. F. H. Long, for the defendants Moodie, Tuttle and Bernier, respondents.\nL. S. Eckardt, for the defendants Bernier Bros., Bernier Bros. Logging Co. and Arnold Bernier, respondents.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C. J. and Locke and Abbott JJ. was delivered by\nLOCKE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[3] , which dismissed an appeal of the present appellant from the judgment of Wood J.[4] , dismissing the action.\nThe appellant is a lumber company which formerly carried on its operations in New Westminster and engaged in logging operations at Acteon Sound in the county of Vancouver.\nOn February 6, 1950, a writ of extent issued out of the Exchequer Court of Canada directed to the sheriff of the county of Westminster, in respect of an indebtedness of $10,984.40 for income and excess profits taxes due to the Crown. A second writ of extent was issued in like manner on July 8, 1950, directed to the said sheiff for the sum of $2,653.95.\nOn July 7 and July 8, 1950, two concurrent writs of extent were issued by the Exchequer Court directed to the respondent Moodie, the sheriff of the county of Vancouver, directing him to seize the goods and chattels of the appellant for the recovery of the said debts, to diligently appraise and extend the same and not to sell the same \"until We shall otherwise command you\". Acteon Sound is on the mainland approximately 200 miles north of Vancouver and, at this place, the appellant had carried on logging operations for some time prior to the month of December 1948, when they were discontinued. At that time the buildings and logging equipment were leased by the appellant to a third party. Operations were apparently terminated about April 1, 1950. Thereafter, the appellant maintained a watchman at the camp.\nOn June 16, 1951, the assets of the appellant at Acteon Sound were seized by the respondent Tuttle on the direction of the sheriff under the concurrent writs of extent. These consisted of various donkey engines, trucks, trailers, pumps, blocks and lines, tools and other equipment of the nature commonly used in small logging operations on the Pacific coast. In addition, there were certain booming equipment, floats, furniture, a quantity of steel rails, a launch and two smaller boats. While this equipment was described in great detail in the voluminous evidence directed to the question of its value, I consider it unnecessary, in view of my conclusion, to describe it in further detail.\nOn June 27, 1951, upon the application of the Crown, an order was made by the Registrar of the Exchequer Court at Ottawa directing the sheriff of the County of Vancouver to\nsell by private sale or public auction the goods or chattels now under seizure by virtue of a Concurrent Writ of Extent issued out of this Honourable Court on the 7th day of July, A.D. 1950.\nNo question is raised in these proceedings at to the propriety of the making of this order.\nOn June 15, 1951, Raymond Bernier, since deceased, who was apparently a member of the firm of Bernier Bros., saw the sheriff, saying that they were interested in purchasing the seized chattels. Tuttle was sent by the sheriff to Acteon Sound in company with Bernier and made a very rough inventory of the goods under seizure. Thereafter, Bernier opened negotiations with H. W. Kellond, an official in the Vancouver office of the Department of National Revenue, and made an offer of $4,500. This offer was subsequently increased in negotiations with Tuttle, the last offer made by Bernier, according to him, being in the amount of $5,300. On July 7, 1951, according to the latter, Bernier came to the sheriff's office and signed a letter written for him by Tuttle, offering that amount for the \"machinery & equipment presently under seizure by your office, owned by Keystone Shingles & Lumber Ltd.\".\nAccording to Kellond, while negotiations were going on with Bernier, Gail W. Beach, the president of the appellant company, had been negotiating with him for a settlement of the Department's claim. Kellond says that on July 6 he told Beach that, if the Keystone company would pay $5,000 then and $3,000 at some later time to be arranged, he would recommend its acceptance. At Beach's request, he wrote out a memorandum which read:\nIf you will offer settlement of $8,000 for FULL SETTLEMENT, we will give the offer favourable consideration.\nKellond says that he told Beach to pay the sheriff the $5,000 on account of the claim for taxes and that, if this was paid, a sale of the assets would be \"withheld\" and that Beach left his office agreeing to do this. Kellond then telephoned to Tuttle telling him that he did not want the sale to proceed if the $5,000 was paid.\nThere is a direct conflict between Beach and Tuttle as to what followed thereafter.\nAccording to Beach, it was on July 5 that Kellond agreed to recommend the settlement and gave him the memorandum and he says that, on the same afternoon, he went to see Tuttle telling him of the arrangement made with Kellond and that he wanted to make a payment of $5,000 on the taxes and stop the sale. According to him, Tuttle said that he would not accept the payment on account and that he would have to bid for the purchase of the assets seized. Beach does not say that he showed the memorandum he had received from Kellond to Tuttle, nor did he ask him to telephone to Kellond and verify his statement that the $5,000 was to be paid on account of the taxes, nor did he himself telephone to Kellond to ask him to instruct the sheriff. He says that Tuttle told him he had a private bid for the goods but that it was not for a very large sum and that if he (Beach) brought in a cheque for $5,000 to purchase them it would be all right. Beach says that, as Tuttle refused to accept the payment on that footing, he left the office returning on the morning of July 7 at about 10.30 with a letter addressed to the sheriff signed by Beach on behalf of Westminster Mills Ltd., a company of which he was also an officer. This letter read:\nWe attach hereto cheque for $5,000 which we are offering for sale to us of goods and equipment which you seized belonging to Keystone Shingles & Lumber Ltd. at Acteon Sound B.C.\nThis tender is made for immediate acceptance, otherwise please return the cheque to us without delay.\nAccording to Beach, it was because Tuttle insisted that the matter could only be handled in this way that the offer of purchase was made. He says that he was aware of the fact that it was Bernier who had been negotiating to purchase the assets but had understood from Tuttle that $5,000 was more than any offer Bernier had made. Kellond was unavailable on July 7, which was a Saturday. Beach, after leaving the sheriff's office, went to the law office of Mr. C. S. Arnold, a solicitor, but found the office closed and left a memo with certain instructions. He then was called out of town to Harrison Lake in connection with some other business and did not again reach Vancouver until early afternoon of July 9, in the interim having no communication of any kind with Tuttle or Kellond.\nMr. Arnold, in giving evidence, said that he had received a written message from Beach on the morning of July 9 and telephoned the sheriff's office saying that he understood that he was making some kind of a sale under an execution against one of Beach's companies, that he did not wish to act for Beach and had telephoned to the latter's office but found that he had not returned to New Westminster, having been held up by the floods in the Fraser valley. According to him, Tuttle said that Beach had called on him the previous week and made an offer of $5,000 but that he (Tuttle) had a higher offer and that he had told Beach that he would give him until noon that day. Arnold said that he then asked him if he could not extend the time since Beach was caught up at Harrison but that Tuttle declined, saying that 12 noon was the deadline and if Arnold was to get hold of Beach he should tell him to go to the Income Tax Department and try to make a deal with them himself. Tuttle asked Arnold if he wanted to make a bid but was told that his instructions were so vague that he was not in a position to do so. Tuttle's evidence directly conflicts with that of Beach on most of the material matters. He says that he had been told by Kellond on the afternoon of July 6 of the proposed settlement and that Beach was to pay to the sheriff $5,000 on account of the claim for taxes and a further $3,000 later. Beach did not, according to Tuttle, see him either on July 5 or 6 but appeared at the sheriff's office on the morning of July 7 at about 10.30 with two letters bearing that date: one, the letter from Westminster Mills Ltd. above referred to; the other, also dated that day, signed by Beach on behalf of the appellant company, which stated that the writer had called at the sheriff's office the previous day to obtain details of the seizure and had been informed that the sheriff had received a private bid for the equipment and intended to accept it, unless he received a higher offer immediately. Tuttle said that he asked Beach if he would not alter the letter so that the $5,000 offered would be a payment on account of the settlement of $8,000 arranged tentatively with Kellond. At the same time, he says that he told Beach that he had received a bid of $5,300 and, accordingly, could not accept a bid for the property for a lesser amount. Tuttle says that Beach refused to change the letter and that he then told him that he would hold his cheque in the meantime and give him until 12 noon on the following Monday to make the payment of $5,000 on account. On cross-examination, he said that Beach might alternatively have made a higher bid than the $5,300 offered by Bernier, though he does not say that he told him so. Beach then left and Tuttle reported the matter to Kellond on Monday morning, July 9. At this time he heard from Mr. Arnold who, he says, informed him that he had been trying to get in touch with Beach but did not ask him to defer the sale, saying that if Arnold had done so he would have agreed. According to him, Mr. Arnold had said that he did not want to act in the matter and, apparently, the discussion only amounted to a request to know what was being done.\nNot having heard from Beach by noon on July 9, Tuttle says that he notified Bernier that his offer of July 7 was accepted. On July 23 Westminster Mills Ltd. wrote to the sheriff enclosing two cheques totalling $6,000 to increase the amount of its previous offer. The sheriff returned these with a letter dated July 24.\nThe learned trial judge, in a considered judgment, dealt with this aspect of the matter in the following terms[5] :\nVarious negotiations went on between Mr. Beach and the department which resulted in something concrete on July 6 when the department agreed to accept $8,000 in full settlement of all taxes owing by the Company of which $5,000 was to be paid in cash and the balance later, the sale being in the meantime postponed indefinitely.\nBeach then repaired to the sheriff's office armed with a memorandum reading: \"If you will offer settlement of $8,000 in full settlement we will give the offer favourable consideration.\" But instead of paying the $5,000 on account of taxes he made no mention of this memorandum or of his arrangement. By letter dated (Friday) July 7, he made an offer on behalf of Westminster Mills, another of his companies, to buy the goods for $5,000. This letter was accompanied by an unmarked cheque payable to the sheriff. However, Bernier Bros. made a new offer of a larger amount, namely $5,300 of which Beach was advised. He, therefore, had an opportunity of making a larger offer and had he done so no doubt that larger offer would have been accepted.\nInstead of that he left town leaving some indefinite instructions with Mr. C. S. Arnold, a solicitor in Vancouver, but no money. Beach had been advised that the sale would take place on the following Monday and nothing further being heard in the meantime from him, except a telephone call from Mr. Arnold, the Bernier Bros. offer was accepted.\nIn a later passage the learned judge, after saying that he was asked to find on the evidence that Tuttle and the deceased Raymond Bernier had fraudulently arranged a \"wash sale\", held that this was not established and that the evidence \"forms no sufficient basis for a finding of conspiracy and fraud against the defendants\".\nThe offer of $5,300 had not, according to Tuttle, been made after Beach made the offer on July 7, but before. Beach had denied that he was advised of this, but the learned trial judge accepted Tuttle's evidence in preference and, while he did not deal in further detail with the conflict in the evidence of the two witnesses, made what I construe to be a finding that Beach did not offer to pay the $5,000 in accordance with his arrangement with Kellond.\nThe reasons for the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal were delivered by Mr. Justice Sheppard[6] . After finding that it had been agreed between Kellond and Beach on July 6 that $5,000 should be paid in cash and $3,000 at some later date to be arranged, and that what Beach had done was to make the offer of Westminster Mills Ltd. to buy the assets for $5,000, it was said that Tuttle had told Beach that day that the sheriff had a higher offer and that they would allow Beach until noon on Monday July 9 to increase his offer and that, as he did not do so, the assets had been sold. The Court concurred in the finding of fact made at the trial that the evidence did not support the charge of fraudulent conduct against Tuttle and Raymond Bernier and formed no sufficient basis for a finding of conspiracy and fraud against the defendants.\nIf, as Beach asserted, Tuttle, having been informed, as he admits, by Kellond of the arrangement made with Beach the day previous, had told Beach that he could not accept the payment on account and postpone the sale, but insisted that the matter could be dealt with only by a sale under the writs of extent and refrained from telling Beach of Bernier's offer of $5,300, his conduct would have been clearly fraudulent. That he did so has been negatived by the concurrent findings of the learned trial judge and of the Court of Appeal. Both Courts have accepted Tuttle's version as to what took place at the discussion on the morning of July 7. No finding is made as between Mr. Arnold's statement that he had asked that the sale be delayed until he could get in touch with Beach and Tuttle's evidence that no such request was made. If, however, Tuttle was mistaken in this, his refusal to extend the time in the circumstances narrated by him would not, in my opinion, afford any basis for a charge of fraudulent conduct on his part.\nThe statement of claim alleged negligence on the part of the sheriff and of Tuttle in carrying out their duties under the writs of extent in a number of particulars, which included failing to make an inventory and appraisal of the goods seized and in failing to obtain a greater price at the sale. It further alleged that there was a conspiracy between the sheriff, Tuttle and the Berniers to sell the property seized to the latter for a grossly inadequate amount, it being claimed that the property sold was of the value of at least $97,000.\nUnder the authority of the writs of extent, Beach had been examined on oath on June 20, 1950, in his capacity of president of the appellant company as to its assets. A transcript of this examination was put in evidence at the trial and contained statements by Beach which, while not being particularly explicit, were clearly capable of meaning that the property of the company at Acteon Sound was worth only approximately $5,000. In dealing with the question of the value of this property, the learned trial judge referred to these statements and to the further fact that, in his dealings with Tuttle on July 7, Beach had only offered $5,000 for the property under seizure which, he considered, confirmed the opinion expressed previously as to the value.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeal, after reviewing generally the evidence of value adduced on the part of the appellant and pointing out that the onus was on the plaintiff in the action to establish a sale at an undervalue, agreed with the learned trial judge that this had not been done.\nThe evidence as to the value of the property in question was, in my opinion, unsatisfactory. The sheriff's officer, Tuttle, who seized the property in June 1951, expressed the opinion that it was only of value as scrap and not worth more in the aggregate than $3,000 or $4,000. However, no proper inventory was taken by him or appraisal made and he had no qualifications as a valuator and it is rather upon the failure of the appellant to prove by acceptable evidence that the sale was not made for a reasonable price that both Courts have proceeded. There was, in my opinion, a failure on the part of the sheriff and his officer to discharge their duty of making a proper inventory and appraisal of the goods but, as pointed out by Sheppard J. A., damage is the gist of the action and there are concurrent findings that damage has not been shown.\nThe argument addressed to us by learned counsel for the appellant, in which everything that could be fairly urged on its behalf has been said, has failed to satisfy me that these findings are clearly wrong. I would accordingly dismiss this appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Rand and Cartwright JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting in part):\u2014The salient facts out of which this litigation arises are set out in the reasons of my brother Locke. The two main grounds of appeal urged before us were (i) that the Courts below erred in rejecting the appellant's claim based on conspiracy, and (ii) that the appellant suffered damages as a result of the breach of the duty to use reasonable care to obtain as high a price as possible for the goods of the appellant sold pursuant to the writs of extent.\nAs to the first of these grounds, while the evidence appears to me to raise suspicion as to the nature of some of the dealings between the respondent Tuttle and the Berniers, I agree with my brother Locke that we would not be justified in setting aside the concurrent findings in the Courts below negativing the existence of the alleged conspiracy.\nAs to the second ground, counsel for the respondents concede that there rested upon the respondent or respondents responsible for the conduct of the sale of the appellant's goods a duty to use reasonable care to obtain as high a price as possible; their contention is that there was no breach of that duty.\nIn support of this ground counsel for the appellant stress the following points, (i) that no detailed inventory of the goods to be sold was made (ii) that even if the lowest figures given by any of the witnesses called by the respondents be taken in valuing the goods sold, their total value was greatly in excess of the amount realized, (iii) that it was unreasonable of Tuttle to accept the Berniers' offer of $5,300 at noon on Monday July 9, 1951, when he had been advised by the late Mr. Arnold that Beach was out of town and delayed by the floods, as he ought to have anticipated that Beach, on his return, would make a better offer, and (iv) that as the Berniers' offer had been accepted conditionally on their cheque being honoured on presentation Tuttle ought to have cancelled the sale to them when the cheque was dishonoured and given Beach an opportunity to make a higher bid.\nThe failure to make a more detailed inventory does not appear to have caused any damage. The only prospective purchasers of the equipment were the Berniers and Beach, or his nominees, and both had knowledge of what was being offered for sale. The evidence shows that it was reasonable to make a sale en bloc. The value placed upon the equipment, after the event, by the various witnesses does not, in all the circumstances of the case, establish that the price of $5,300 obtained at the forced sale was such that a reasonable business man in the position of Tuttle would not have accepted it. It must be remembered that Beach, who was at all relevant times in full control of the appellant company, had consistently belittled the value of the equipment in his dealings with the Income Tax officials, particularly when he was examined on oath as to the appellant's assets, and that the bid which he had made in the name of Westminster Mills Ltd. a few days before the sale to the Berniers was for only $5,000. At the trial counsel for the appellant repudiated the suggestion that this bid was in reality made on behalf of the appellant.\nAs to the third point mentioned above, there is first the difficulty of the conflict between the evidence of Tuttle and that of the late Mr. Arnold. The latter says that on Monday morning July 9, he spoke to Tuttle on the telephone and proceeds as follows:\nI said to Mr. Tuttle, \"Tuttle, I have a letter from Mr. Beach in which he tells me that you have some execution process against one of his companies\"\u2014now which one it was, I am not sure\u2014I said, \"I have just telephoned Mr. Beach's office to speak to him\"' because I said, \"I do not wish to act for Mr. Beach.\" I said, \"The office tells me that Mr. Beach went to Harrison on Saturday. They expected him back Sunday but he isn't back, the floods are raging and they can't get through by telephone and they can't tell me when he will be in.\" Mr. Tuttle said, \"I have a Writ of Extent from the Income Tax Department,\" and he said, \"Mr. Beach was in last week and made an offer of $5,000.\" He said, \"I have a higher offer than that,\" and he said, \"I told Mr. Beach that I would give him until to-day at noon.\" And I said to Mr. Tuttle, \"Well, in view of the fact that he is caught up at Harrison Lake, can't you extend that along further?\" And he said, \"No, 12.00 o'clock noon is the deadline. If you are able to get hold of Mr. Beach tell him to go to the Income Tax Department and try and make a deal with them himself.\" So that was about all that took place.\nMR. MURPHY: Q. Mr. Arnold, when you asked him to extend the time, do you remembe\u2014or will you please try and remember so far as you can the words that he used?\nA. I can't say whether he said \"I will not\" or \"I cannot extend the time past 12.00 o'clock noon.\"\nTHE COURT: Q. That was noon of that very day?\nA. That was noon of that day.\nTuttle's account of this telephone conversation is that Mr. Arnold told him that he could not get in touch with Beach but did not ask him to postpone the sale. Tuttle says that if Mr. Arnold had asked him to postpone the sale he would have done so. The learned trial judge makes no finding as between these two versions of the conversation. On the probabilities of the case it appears to me unlikely that Mr. Arnold would have failed to request a postponement under the circumstances and it is significant that he was not cross-examined, but for reasons which will appear I do not find it necessary to endeavour to decide this question of fact.\nThe fourth point mentioned above is not specifically dealt with in the reasons in the Courts below. It seems clear that at noon on July 9, the offer of Bernier Bros, was accepted and a receipt, ex. 82, was handed to Arnold Bernier on which the words \"subject to acceptance of cheque\" were written in two places. The meaning attached to these words by Tuttle as stated on his examination for discovery and accepted by him at the trial was as follows:\nQ. Were you asked these questions and did you make these answers:\n\"941. Q. And you gave him a receipt for that cheque?\nA. I imagine it was subject to acceptance of the cheque.\n942. Q. It was an unconditional acceptance of his offer?\nA. Subject to acceptance of his cheque.\n943. Q. What do you mean by that?\nA. Well, if the cheque is no good, the sale would have been null and void.\"\nA. That is right.\nTuttle goes on to say that he said nothing to Arnold Bernier as to the significance of this notation on the receipt. The cheque of Bernier Bros. was drawn on the Powell River branch of the Canadian Bank of Commerce. It appears to have been deposited to the credit of the sheriff's account in the Robson District branch of the same bank in Vancouver. On July 11 payment of the cheque was refused at the Powell River branch, the rejection slip is marked \"Not sufficient funds\" and \"Refer to drawer\" and has written on it the words \"Refer to Mr. Tuttle\u2014Sheriff's office\". The cheque was apparently redeposited in the sheriff's account in the Robson District branch on July 13 and was paid in due course.\nIn the meantime under date of July 10, 1951, a letter addressed to the sheriff of the County of Vancouver and signed \"Keystone Shingles & Lumber Ltd. By G. Beach\" was sent to the sheriff. At the trial this letter was produced by counsel for the respondents Moodie and Tuttle at the request of counsel for the appellant and it does not appear to have been suggested that it had not been received by the addressee in due course. In this letter the appellant took the position that the sale to Bernier Bros. was void and said in part:\n(18) Bids are definitely available by us or others, exceeding the sum purported to have been received at the so-called sale.\n(19) Numerous requests have been received by us for sale of various items of equipment, and we have just received another this morning from a logger at Simoon Sound.\nResponsibility for irregularity rests on you and associates and all parties concerned.\nIt is requested that the money received be returned to the parties who made tender, and the sale nullified and cancelled. A larger offer will then be made by ourselves and others.\nNo attention seems to have been paid to this letter. Under date of July 13 the sheriff wrote to Westminster Mills Ltd. returning that company's cheque for $5,000 and stating that a greater sum had been tendered and accepted for the equipment in question. On July 23 Westminster Mills Ltd. forwarded to the sheriff cheques totalling $6,000. These were returned by the sheriff with a letter of July 24 stating that the equipment had been sold on July 9.\nThe learned trial judge did not deal expressly with the claim of the appellant based on Tuttle's alleged breach of duty and the Court of Appeal disposes of the point by holding that there was no proof that the sale was not made for a reasonable price. Consequently we are not confronted, as in the case of the allegation of conspiracy, with concurrent findings of fact.\nAfter considering the evidence bearing on this branch of the matter I have reached the conclusion that Tuttle did not exercise due care to obtain the best price for the equipment. Granted that the conduct of Beach was most unsatisfactory, it must have been apparent to Tuttle that he or one of the companies he controlled was a prospective purchaser of the equipment. I can find no adequate explanation of Tuttle's conduct in insisting on carrying out the sale at noon on Monday, July 9 after his conversation with Mr. Arnold, even on the assumption that the latter did not expressly request a postponement, nor for his failure to make any inquiry as to what Beach or Westminster Mills Ltd. was prepared to offer after the cheque of Bernier Bros, had been dishonoured. On the preponderance of evidence I think it is established that, had he exercised reasonable care and judgment, Tuttle could have obtained at least $6,000 for the equipment. On the other hand I do not think it was proved that he could have obtained more than this.\nIn the result I would allow the appeal to the extent of awarding the appellant judgment for $700 damages against the respondent Tuttle. Having reached this conclusion it would next become necessary to consider (i) whether the respondent Moodie is also liable for this amount, (ii) whether the respondent Royal Plate Glass and General Insurance Company of Canada is liable under its bond, and (iii) what order should be made as to costs; but as the majority of the Court are of opinion that the appeal fails in toto, no useful purpose would be served by my exploring these difficult questions.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, RAND and CARTWRIGHT JJ. dissenting in part.\nSolicitor for the plaintiff, appellant: Robert D.

Ragnar Johnson, Q.C., for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting):\u2014By leave of this Court the appellant, the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto, appeals from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 reversing that of F.G. MacKay J.A.2, and quashing the appellant\u2019s By-law 278, passed June 14, 1955. By The Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto Act, 1953 (c. 73 of the Ontario statutes of 1953), hereinafter called \u201cthe Act\u201d, the inhabitants of the metropolitan area were constituted a body corporate; the respondent, the Corporation of the Village of Forest Hill, is an \u201carea munic- ipality\u201d within the limits of the metropolitan district. The council had previously adopted report no. 8 of its Works Committee recommending that the Commissioner of Works be authorized to take the necessary steps to undertake the fluoridation of the metropolitan water supply and by By-law 278 that action was ratified and confirmed. Clause 2 of the by-law provides:\n2. That the said Commissioner of Works and all other appropriate officials of the Municipality be and they are hereby authorized and directed to take the necessary steps, forthwith, to undertake the treatment of the Metropolitan water supply by fluoridation and to obtain all approvals required by statute for the installation of the equipment necessary for such treatment.\nPart III of the Act is headed \u201cMetropolitan Waterworks System\u201d. By virtue of the earlier provisions of this Part the appellant became a provider of water at the wholesale level to the area municipalities. Then comes the important section, s. 41:\n41. The Metropolitan Council may pass by-laws for regulating the time, manner, extent and nature of the supply of water from its waterworks system, and every other matter or thing related to or connected therewith which it may be necessary and proper to regulate in order to secure to the inhabitants of the Metropolitan Area a continued and abundant supply of pure and wholesome water, and to prevent the practising of frauds on the Metropolitan Corporation with regard to the water so supplied.\nIn these proceedings the Court is, of course, confined to the material filed so far as it may be relevant. On behalf of the appellant an affidavit was filed, sworn to by Professor Joslyn Rogers. Professor Rogers was a member of the Association of Professional Engineers and a graduate of the University of Toronto in chemistry; he had been the Professor of Analytical Chemistry at the University from 1918 to 1954 and was a toxicologist of over forty years\u2019 experience and was currently practising as a consulting chemist. From his knowledge and experience he was able to state that chemically pure water does not occur in nature and cannot be produced artificially except in small quantities and with considerable difficulty and that, accordingly, water is classified as pure if it is suitable for human consumption and agreeable in taste, smell and appearance. Paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of his affidavit read:\n4. All natural waters contain minerals and such waters would not for that reason alone be classified as impure if the quantity of minerals present does not render the water unpleasant to the senses or prejudicial to health. 5. Water containing fluorides in concentrations of up to two or three parts per million, which occurs naturally in many parts of North America, is not considered impure because of the presence of the fluoride. If the fluoride was introduced mechanically the water would still be considered pure as the ion added is the same in both cases and is offered to the human body in the same state.\n6. To confirm my opinion respecting the classification of water I would refer to the 5th Edition of \u201cThe Examination of Waters and Water Supplies\u201d by Thresh, Beale and Suckling at pages 84, 85, 86 and 87 in the Chapter entitled \u201cWhat Constitutes a \u2018Pure and Wholesome Water\u2019 \u201d which accurately represent my views.\nAs he indicates, an examination of the pages of the book referred to confirms his opinion.\nWhile it is notorious that chlorine is added to many water supplies, it is argued that the addition of fluoride to a supply otherwise pure and wholesome is really treating it for a medicinal effect. In view of the above evidence I cannot treat any statement of counsel as an admission that the supply here in question before the addition of the fluoride was pure and wholesome. However, even assuming that this supply when treated with chlorine would be pure and wholesome, the only other evidence in the record bearing upon the point is the affidavit of Dr. Andrew L. Chute, Pediatrician-in-Chief of the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, and Professor of Pediatrics at the University of Toronto. Paragraphs 3, 4, 5 and 6 of his affidavit read:\n3. Tooth decay, by affecting the majority of people in a community, has come to be recognized by the Medical and Dental Professions as one of the major health problems of our time.\n4. I have been associated with others in the consideration of the effect of fluoridation of public or communal water supplies.\n5. Studies covering a period of over thirty years under a wide variety of controlled conditions have established the effects of the consumption by human beings of fluoridated water.\n6. I am convinced from a thorough perusal of these studies that the addition of fluoride in the proportion of one part per million to a public water supply which is deficient in that constituent is a safe measure and is free from any systemic ill-effects. Such treatment renders the water more wholesome as it is effective in reducing tooth decay to the extent of approximately 60% where consumption of such water begins at an early age and continues during childhood and adolescence. The benefits extend into adult life.\nThese paragraphs indicate that certainly water is rendered more wholesome through the addition of fluoride in the proportion named and, always presuming that the council acts in good faith, I cannot read s. 41 of the Act in such a way as to declare that in enacting By-law 278 the council of the appellant exceeded its authority. The good faith of the appellant\u2019s council was not impugned. I have not overlooked that Dr. Chute states in para. 7 of his affidavit:\n7. In my opinion fluoridation is a most valuable measure in preserving the teeth and as a result a valuable measure in maintaining health.\nThis does not alter my opinion that in proceeding as it did the council of the appellant was not invading the realm of public health and, therefore, it is unnecessary to consider the provisions of The Municipal Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 243, The Public Health Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 306, or any other statute referred to. A decision in the contrary sense would raise the question as to the powers so to do, under the relevant statutes, of other municipalities who have added fluoride to their water supplies, but I refrain from discussing their position and restrict myself to a consideration of the power of the appellant\u2019s council under the provisions of s. 41 of the Act.\nThe appeal should be allowed, the order of the Court of Appeal set aside and the judgment of the judge of first instance restored, with costs throughout.\nThe judgment of Rand, Taschereau and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by\nRAND J.:\u2014The question in issue is whether the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto, under its power, given by s. 41 of its charter[3] to pass by-laws\nfor regulating the time, manner, extent and nature of the supply of water from its waterworks system, and every other matter or thing related to or connected therewith which it may be necessary and proper to regulate in order to secure to the inhabitants of the Metropolitan Area a continued and abundant supply of pure and wholesome water, and to prevent the practising of frauds on the Metropolitan Corporation with regard to the water so supplied\ncan bring about what is called the \u201cfluoridation\u201d of its metropolitan water supply. The process, so-called, is simply the introduction into the water of a minute portion of fluorine, say, one part in one million, for the purpose of promoting the health of the teeth and in particular the elimination of caries, by building up in the bone substance a greater resistance to the inroads of decay by foreign matter within the mouth. In the water the fluorine effects no chemical change but becomes merely diffused in solution.\nMr. Manning\u2019s contention is short and precise: the duty and the authority of the municipality is to furnish \u201cpure and wholesome water\u201d; admittedly the addition of fluorine does not affect its quality, otherwise wholesome; by its authority to regulate the \u201cnature\u201d of the supply it may introduce into the particular supply such substances as are generally found in water and in its judgment are beneficial to the health of the users; and in regarding such an object we must distinguish between ends and means, that is, the end being wholesome water, the means, an agency of promoting health, rather than the end being to serve a health purpose superimposed on a functional or water means.\nNotwithstanding the attractiveness of this argument, I am unable to agree with it. The word \u201cnature\u201d can be satisfied by other and more accustomed meanings than that of a medicinal addition for another than a water purpose. The nature of the supply is too well known for question: it may be taken from a lake, a river or a stream, accumulated in a reservoir, obtained from artesian wells or collected directly from rainfall. Although the exact role of water in the physiological economy was not gone into, the matter of furnishing that indispensable aliment to life has too long been the subject of discussion to leave much doubt of what it means to furnish it in a wholesome quality. That a municipality may purify it, that is, reduce objectionable foreign matter in it by means harmless to its consumers, is universally understood. In the settled understanding, also, a \u201cwater supply\u201d comes from natural sources which show differences in their degree of purity. \u201cPurity\u201d itself is well understood although partaking of the impreciseness of any general term. Solutions of different substances are invariably present, but the human body has evolved in an adaptation to them in their normal or subnormal quantities.\nDoes it lie, in such terms of authority, with a local government to furnish a supply of synthetic water by approximating the ordinary or normal components? If its object was to obtain the ordinary or natural composition of substances in solution so as to furnish what the body has become adapted to receive as water there would be grounds for justifying such a measure; and if it were a matter of choice between a natural supply containing normal quantities of fluorine and one lacking that element, I have no doubt the choice could not be challenged. These involve the matter of furnishing water for its accepted purposes only.\nBut it is not to promote the ordinary use of water as a physical requisite for the body that fluoridation is proposed. That process has a distinct and different purpose; it is not a means to an end of wholesome water for water\u2019s function but to an end of a special health purpose for which a water supply is made use of as a means.\nThe method proposed does not appear to be the only feasible mode of making available to the public what is considered by the municipality to be a desired health ministration. Fluoridation apparently can be provided otherwise than by making it general in the water supply. If that is so, there is here neither that accepted desirability for its use nor an unobjectionable manner of supplying it which in other situations might be influential considerations in the determination of the question raised.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nLOCKE J. (dissenting):\u2014The appellant is a body corporate constituted by c. 73 of the statutes of Ontario, 1953. The expression \u201cMetropolitan Corporation\u201d is defined by the Act to mean the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto and, by s. 3, it is provided that the powers of the corporation shall be exercised by its council and, except where otherwise provided, its jurisdiction confined to the metropolitan area. The area so defined includes the municipality of the Village of Forest Hill, which is one of the area municipalities referred to throughout the Act.\nOf the various powers and duties vested in and imposed upon the appellant, this matter concerns only those dealt with in Part III of the statute under the subheading \u201cMetropolitan Waterworks System\u201d.\nSection 36 declares that, for the purpose of supplying to the area municipalities water for their use, the metropolitan corporation shall have all the powers conferred by any general Act upon a municipal corporation and by any special Act upon an area municipality or local board thereof respecting, inter alia, the establishment, maintenance and operation of a waterworks system.\nSection 37(1) reads:\nThe Metropolitan Council shall before the 1st day of December, 1953, pass by-laws which shall be effective on the 1st day of January, 1954, assuming as part of the metropolitan waterworks system all works for the production, treatment and storage of water vested in each area municipality or any local board thereof and all trunk distribution mains connected therewith, and on the day any such by-law becomes effective the works and mains designated therein shall vest in the Metropolitan Corporation.\nBy s. 39 it is declared that where all the works of an area municipality for the production, treatment and storage of water are assumed by the metropolitan corporation, the area municipality shall not thereafter establish or operate any such works.\nSection 41, so far as it is relevant to the present matter, reads:\nThe Metropolitan Council may pass by-laws for regulating the time, manner, extent and nature of the supply of water from its waterworks system, and every other matter or thing related to or connected therewith which it may be necessary and proper to regulate in order to secure to the inhabitants of the Metropolitan Area a continued and abundant supply of pure and wholesome water\u2026\nBy a written report dated May 2, 1955, the Works Committee of the appellant municipality, after an investigation, details of which were disclosed in it, recommended to the council that the Commissioner of Works be authorized to take the necessary steps to undertake the fluoridation of the metropolitan water supply. By a by-law enacted on July 14, 1955, the municipality directed the Commissioner of Works to take the necessary steps forthwith\nto undertake the treatment of the Metropolitan water supply by fluoridation and to obtain all approvals required by statute for the installation of the equipment necessary for such treatment.\nSection 101 of The Public Health Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 306, requires the council of any municipality contemplating, inter alia, any change in an existing waterworks system to submit the plans, specifications and an engineer\u2019s report of the water supply and the works to be undertaken, together with such other information as may be deemed necessary by the Department of Health, to that Depart- ment, and declares that no such works shall be proceeded with until the source of supply and the proposed works have been approved by the Department.\nThe Commissioner of Works applied under the provisions of this section for approval of a change in the existing waterworks system of the metropolitan corporation to provide for the addition of one part per million of fluoride to the water supply. By a certificate dated July 11, 1955, signed by the Minister of Health, the Provincial Sanitary Engineer and the Deputy Minister of Health, it was certified that \u201cthe installation of equipment for fluoridation of the water supply\u201d at the waterworks plants of the appellant and the source of water supply and the proposed works had been approved by the Department as required.\nThe respondent, by notice of motion given as permitted by s. 293 of The Municipal Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 243, applied for an order to quash for illegality the by-law referred to \u201con the grounds, inter alia, that such by-law is ultra vires and beyond the competence of the said Council\u201d. While other grounds of attack were suggested, the only one argued has been that in passing the by-law the council exceeded its powers.\nThe application was dismissed by Mr. Justice F.G. MacKay[4]. That learned judge was of the opinion that it was for the council acting in good faith to determine what treatment, if any, should be given to the water to most effectively carry out its statutory obligation. He was of the opinion that the arguments advanced as to the advisability of adding fluoride were irrelevant and should not be considered, except for the purpose of determining whether it had been shown that the council was not so acting. In his opinion, the evidence supported his view that good faith had been shown.\nThe unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal, delivered by the Chief Justice of Ontario[5], reversed this order and directed that the by-law be quashed. In the reasons it is stated that it had been admitted in the Court of Appeal that the water, without the addition of fluoride, was pure and wholesome. Accepting the admission as establishing that fact, it was said that nothing in The Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto Act, The Public Health Act, The Public Utilities Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 320, or The Municipal Act conferred upon any of the area municipalities power to add some chemical to a pure and wholesome water supply and that the question to be decided was as to whether the respondent had power to do so \u201cfor a medicinal purpose\u201d. With great respect, I disagree and think the judgment appealed from is based upon a false premise.\nIn deciding the question whether the by-law was intra vires of the council, it was, of course, necessary to determine the exact nature of the action which the by-law assumed to authorize. The uncontradicted evidence is that \u201ca physically or chemically pure water does not occur in nature and has defied all efforts to obtain it\u201d. This is the opinion of Joslyn Rogers, a chemical engineer of long experience whose affidavit was filed on the application. Mr. Rogers further said that it cannot be produced artificially, except in small quantities and with considerable difficulty. The admission that the water was pure\u2014if intended as an admission of fact\u2014was, therefore, inaccurate. If intended as meaning that it was \u201cpure\u201d within the meaning of the appellant\u2019s Act of incorporation, that was a question of law for the decision of the Court and not to be decided upon the admission of counsel. It should be said that no such admission was made in this Court.\nIn the extracts from the work of E.V. Suckling, M.B., to whose opinions in this respect Joslyn Rogers subscribes, it is said that wholesomeness is purely a medical question while purity must be physical and chemical. Apart from such evidence, the accuracy of the statement seems obvious. In view of the evidence to the contrary, I would decline in a matter of such moment to act on an admission of counsel in the Court of Appeal that the water supply was, without any addition, either pure or wholesome. That question, which, in my view, is only relevant to the issue as to whether the members of the council have acted in good faith in the exercise of their statutory duties, is to be decided on the evidence adduced upon the application. The only evidence on the question is that of Dr. A.L. Chute, the Pediatrician-in-chief of the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto and Professor of Pediatrics at the University of Toronto. His affidavit states that tooth decay, by affecting the majority of people in a community, has come to be recognized by the medical and dental professions as one of the major health problems of our time. After saying that studies covering a period of over 30 years under a wide variety of controlled conditions had established the effects of the consumption by human beings of fluoridated water, the affidavit reads:\n6. I am convinced from a thorough perusal of these studies that the addition of fluoride in the proportion of one part per million to a public water supply which is deficient in that constituent is a safe measure and is free from any systemic ill-effects. Such treatment renders the water more wholesome as it is effective in reducing tooth decay to the extent of approximately 60% where consumption of such water begins at an early age and continues during childhood and adolescence. The benefits extend into adult life.\n7. In my opinion fluoridation is a most valuable measure in preserving the teeth and as a result a valuable measure in maintaining health.\nAs an exhibit to this affidavit, there is a list of some 65 municipalities in Ontario where natural fluorides are contained in the water supply in concentrations varying from .01 to 2.5 parts per million.\nThe requirement that the water supply shall be \u201cpure and wholesome\u201d would appear to have originated in the early English statutes. Thus, by s. 35 of the Waterworks Clauses Act, 1847, 10 Vict., c. 17, the undertakers operating waterworks are required to provide \u201ca Supply of pure and wholesome Water, sufficient for the domestic Use of all the Inhabitants of the Town or District within the Limits of the special Act\u201d. Apparently in recognition of the fact that, as stated in the evidence in this matter, chemically pure water does not occur in nature and cannot be produced artificially except in small quantities and with difficulty, the Public Health Act, 1936, 26 Geo.V and I Edw. VIII, c. 49, by s. 111, imposes on the local authority the duty to provide \u201ca sufficient supply of wholesome water for domestic purposes\u201d.\nThe word \u201cwholesome\u201d is used in more than one sense. One of the definitions in the Oxford Dictionary reads:\nPromoting or conducive to health; favourable to or good for health; health-preserving\u2026 The definitions in Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary include the following:\nPromoting physical well-being; beneficial to the health or the preservation of health;\u2026 healthful\u2026\nThe material does not assume to say what are the causes of tooth decay. The evidence, however, shows that the use of fluoridated water does materially reduce tooth decay where consumption begins at an early age, that these benefits extend into adult life and that it is a valuable measure for maintaining health. As the article from Suckling\u2019s work shows, water is treated with chlorine, lime and other chemicals or substances for the purpose of rendering it sterile and I would draw the inference from the statements made that doing so renders it less likely to cause typhoid fever or other water-borne diseases.\nWith respect for differing opinions, I consider that the appellant in discharging its duty to supply water that is wholesome may treat the water with chlorine, lime or other substances to render it sterile and less likely to cause typhoid, or with fluoride to render it less likely to be injurious to the health by contributing to tooth decay.\nIt is, in my opinion, a necessary inference from the evidence that the water supply in the metropolitan district of Toronto, whatever it may be, is in its natural state lacking in the element fluoride and thus less wholesome than it would be if that were added, to the extent mentioned. If the supply in its natural state contained fluoride to the extent of 2.5 parts to a million, as does the water obtained from the Boone River by the municipality of Essex, and if, in the opinion of the council acting in good faith, it was considered advisable to reduce the fluoride content to one part in a million, I think it would be within the power of the municipality to do so. Indeed, I find it hard to understand why it can be fairly contended that this would be beyond the municipal powers any more than to add chlorine to render the water more wholesome by rendering sterile and harmless some existing constituent in it. If the argument which succeeded in the Court of Appeal is carried to its logical conclusion, it would be ultra vires of the appellant to use water of the character used by the municipality of Essex or the 64 other municipalities referred to by Dr. Chute since such waters, in their natural state, contain fluoride in varying proportions.\nIn my opinion, nothing more is required to sustain the present by-law than the clear provisions of s. 41 of the appellant\u2019s Act of incorporation. It is, of course, not suggested that the council has not acted in good faith in attempting to discharge the duties imposed upon it by that section and it is not disputed that the introduction of fluoride, to the extent proposed, will render the water supply more wholesome, assigning to that word the meaning above quoted. The Legislature has deputed the responsibility of determining what steps should be taken to obtain a pure and wholesome water supply to the metropolitan council and not to the Courts.\nI would allow this appeal with costs and restore the order of Mr. Justice MacKay.\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014I am in general agreement with the reasons of my brother Rand and those of the learned Chief Justice of Ontario, and will add only a few words.\nThe question is as to the power of the council to enact the impugned by-law, and the answer depends upon the nature of the subject-matter to which it relates. If, on the evidence in the record, it could properly be regarded as action by the council to provide a supply of pure and wholesome water or to render more pure and wholesome a supply of water already possessing those characteristics I would hold it to be valid. But, in my opinion, it cannot be so regarded. Its purpose and effect are to cause the inhabitants of the metropolitan area, whether or not they wish to do so, to ingest daily small quantities of fluoride, in the expectation which appears to be supported by the evidence that this will render great numbers of them less susceptible to tooth decay. The water supply is made use of as a convenient means of effecting this purpose. In pith and substance the by-law relates not to the provision of a water supply but to the compulsory preventive medication of the inhabitants of the area. In my opinion the words of the statutory provisions on which the appellant relies do not confer upon the council the power to make by-laws in relation to matters of this sort. In view of the difference of opinion in the Courts below and in this Court, it is fortunate that this is a case in which if we have failed to discern the true intention of the Legislature the matter can be dealt with by an amendment of the statute.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nABBOTT J.:\u2014For the reasons given by brothers Rand and Cartwright, with which I am in agreement, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, KERWIN C.J. and LOCKE J. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the appellant: C.

M\u2019s automobile being disabled, he took and drove a car belonging to his brother J, with whom he lived, on terms set out in the reasons for judgment. While driving this car, M was involved in an accident as a result of which he was killed and the respondents sustained serious injuries. The respondents obtained judgment against M\u2019s estate and then sued M\u2019s insurer under s. 214 of The Insurance Act. Held: The insurer was liable. In the circumstances, it could not be said that M was \u201ca member of\u201d J\u2019s household and the policy accordingly extended to the risk.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario [1] affirming a judgment of Aylen J.[2] Appeal dismissed.\nD.A. Keith, Q.C., and D.R.K. Rose, for the defendant, appellant.\nG.L. Mitchell, Q.C., and A.L. McKenzie, for the plaintiffs, respondents.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau J. was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014It is impossible to define the phrase \u201cany person or persons of the household of which the insured is a member\u201d so as to cover all possible cases. In the present appeal the evidence discloses:\n(1) Murley Milley paid board.\n(2) His stay with his brother was of a temporary character.\n(3) He was not a member of the family in the sense that children of the brother would be.\n(4) Murley was not under the control of his brother.\n(5) While Murley helped to some extent, it cannot be said that he shared any responsibility of a householder.\nIn view of these circumstances, I am unable to say that both Courts were wrong in the conclusion at which they arrived.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Rand and Cartwright JJ. was delivered by\nRAND J.:\u2014The issue here is on the interpretation of the phrase of an exception \u201cnot owned by \u2026 any person or persons of the household of which the Insured is a member\u201d as it applies to a substitute automobile in a liability insurance policy. The driver of a car involved in a collision in which the respondents were injured was the insured and the car belonged to a brother and had been taken by the insured without permission; and the appellant\u2019s contention is that by reason of the exception it was excluded from the coverage of the policy.\nBoth the Oxford and the Century dictionaries make it clear that the term \u201chousehold\u201d is of flexible meaning. In the general understanding it is associated and at times identical with what is connoted by \u201cfamily\u201d or \u201cdomestic establishment\u201d. The characteristics of the relations between members of a household are so varied and of such different degree or significance that it is quite impossible to define the word in detailed terms applicable to all cases; and to come to a conclusion as to its scope as it is used in the policy requires that we resort to the ordinary aids to interpretation. The exception is in the language of the company, and if it is ambiguous the ambiguity must be resolved in favour of the insured; and a material consideration to be taken into account is the purpose intended to be served by it.\nThat purpose must be sought. The insurance here is of an owner in relation to a described automobile, but this is only one of a number of forms which automobile insurance may take. The automobile as described may extend, as here, but with exceptions, to a substituted machine; the policy may insure persons other than the owner, also with exceptions; and the insurance against theft, for example, may as here except members of a specified group. This does not exhaust the special forms or provisions, but the examples point one direction which experience has led insurance companies to take. These particular exceptions seem clearly to be aimed at persons living in close relations with the owner and against automobiles conveniently available for interchangeable use; slight differences in the language used seem to reflect similar differences in the nature or scope of the membership and to be referable significantly to special features of the particular risk being dealt with. The precise language used, then, may be of controlling importance.\nIn the case before us the reason for the exception of the substituted car where it is owned by a person \u201cof the household\u201d of which the insured is a member seems to be the tendency of and the opportunity afforded to the members of such a group to make common use of their cars and thus to limit the insurance taken out. In other ways more or less freedom in the common use of cars tends to be prejudicial to the insurance business, such as by creating favourable conditions for collusion on claims; and the exception against theft clearly regards the special opportunities furnished for that offence.\nThe \u201chousehold\u201d, in the broad sense of a family, is a collective group living in a home, acknowledging the authority of a head, the members of which, with few exceptions, are bound by marriage, blood, affinity or other bond, between whom there is an intimacy and by whom there is felt a concern with and an interest in the life of all that gives it a unity. It may, for example, include such persons as domestic servants, and distant relatives permanently residing within it. To some degree they are all admitted and submit to the collective body, its unity and its conditions, particularly that of the general discipline of the family head. They do not share fully in the more restricted family intimacy or interest or concern, but they participate to a substantial degree in the general life of the household and form part of it.\nThese are persons \u201cof\u201d the household. A distinction between being \u201cof\u201d and \u201cin\u201d a household is made in the policy itself. In the case of theft the insured is not protected when it is committed by a person \u201cin\u201d the household. On the argument my first impression was that one \u201cin\u201d the household is necessarily \u201cof\u201d it, but further consideration has led me to a different view. The circle of those \u201cin\u201d is larger than those \u201cof\u201d, a good example of which is furnished by the case of Home Ins. Co. v. Pettit [3]. There the exception was of theft by a person \u201cin\u201d the household of the insured and an uncle, temporarily a guest of the insured\u2019s father, was held to be of that description.\nWith this distinction in mind, the purpose of the exemption here, to guard against the use by the insured of another automobile either his own or that of one \u201cof\u201d the household of which he is a member, is against one who bears such a relation to the owner as to make easy and readily at hand the use by him of the other\u2019s car, which otherwise the latter might be interested in seeing insured. By the exception the business objectionableness of the extension of one insurance to cover more than one car\u2014obvious in the case of the owner himself\u2014is so far avoided.\nThe insured was a younger brother of the owner, in whose home he was a boarder. The details of his position in the household have been given in other reasons and I will not repeat them. From them I do not draw the inference that makes him \u201cof\u201d the household. He was paying his board and working; his stay, though indefinite, was not intended to be longer than to enable him to become started in a home of his own. He had no permission whatever to use the brother\u2019s car. His interests and concerns were primarily his own and not more related to the family life of his brother than if he had been living apart. The mere occasional extension to him of minor household accommodations or participation on special occasions in more intimate family activities does not overbear the dominant and distinct individual interests of his own. That separate identity of life he maintained and in no substantial way was it merged in that of the family. It may be said that he was a person \u201cin\u201d the household of his brother but not \u201cof\u201d it.\nThat was the view taken by Laidlaw J.A., speaking for the Court of Appeal [4], and I am quite unable to say that it was not the right view.\nThe appeal must, then, be dismissed with costs.\nLOCKE J.:\u2014The policy which, it was found, had been issued by the appellant company to the late Murley Milley was an owner\u2019s policy, within the meaning of that expression in s. 207 of The Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 183.\nThe insured vehicle described in it was a Studebaker sedan. While the third party liability insured against by the policy was, on the face of it, in respect of the operation of the Studebaker car, by a clause appearing under a heading \u201cAdditional Agreements\u201d following the main insuring clauses, the word \u201cautomobile\u201d, where used in the policy, was defined to include\nan automobile not owned by the Insured nor by any person or persons of the household of which the Insured is a member, while temporarily used as the substitute for an automobile described in this Policy which is withdrawn from normal use because of its breakdown, repair, servicing, loss or destruction.\nAt the time of the accident giving rise to these claims, the Studebaker sedan owned by Murley Milley was apparently out of commission and he was driving a Vauxhall car, the property of his brother, John Milley, at whose home he resided. He appears to have taken his brother\u2019s car without the latter\u2019s permission, but this circumstance does not affect the question to be determined. The respondents were severely injured in the accident and Murley Milley was killed.\nIn an action brought against John Milley and George Stewart Nash, administrator ad litem of the estate of Murley Milley, deceased, damages were awarded to the respondent Florence Bell in the sum of $6,000 and to the respondent Allen Bell in the sum of $48,228.05. The action against the present appellant under the provisions of s. 214 of The Insurance Act followed.\nThe deceased was a younger brother of John Milley who lived with his wife and family in Sarnia. The Milleys were natives of Newfoundland and some 3 years prior to the accident, at the invitation of John Milley, Murley Milley had come from there to Sarnia to obtain work. He was unmarried and, except during a comparatively short period of time when he was employed on a steamer on the Great Lakes, he lived with his brother, being provided with both room and board and, as would appear from the evidence, was treated as one of the family. When working he paid board but when, as at times happened, he was unemployed he paid nothing, though apparently he was expected to pay for any such period when he became able to do so. During the last year of his life he had become engaged to be married and at times his fiancee had stayed at his brother\u2019s house, being treated as a guest and no payment being made for either her food or lodging. On the day of his death he had been going to Goderich to see her and I gather from the evidence that he contemplated marriage and leaving his brother\u2019s home as soon as he was able to do so.\nDuring the latter part of Murley Milley\u2019s life, a cousin of the brothers was also living in John Milley\u2019s house and, during part of the time, a younger brother had lived there, the cousin and younger brother each paying for their board and lodging.\nMurley Milley was 27 years old at the time of his death on February 12, 1955. While being treated as if he were a member of his brother\u2019s family, it is not suggested that he regarded himself in any sense as being subject to the latter\u2019s orders or directions and while he at times helped around the premises by doing odd jobs, such as cutting the lawn, they formed no part of the arrangement between the brothers.\nSection 212(b) of The Insurance Act permits an insurer, by an endorsement on the policy, to extend the coverage in the case of an owner\u2019s policy to include \u201cthe operation or use of automobiles not owned by nor registered in the name of the insured\u201d. While this would permit an extension of the coverage to any automobile other than that described in the policy in certain circumstances, the present insurer limited the risk by excluding, inter alia, other automobiles owned by a person of the household of which the insured was a member.\nThere is much to be said, in my opinion, for the view advanced by the appellant that, in the circumstances described, Murley Milley was a member of the household of his brother. The interpretation which has commended itself to the learned trial judge is, however, that the word \u201chousehold\u201d should be construed as synonymous with the word \u201cfamily\u201d and that the relation existing between the parties must be permanent and not temporary. While undoubtedly a resident in the household, the learned judge considered that he was not a member of it in the sense the expression was used in the policy. The judgment of the Court of Appeal delivered by Mr. Justice Laidlaw and concurred in by Aylesworth and Schroeder J.J.A. agreed with the reasons for judgment delivered at the trial, adding that [5]:\nthere was not that intimate relationship, that domestic nexus, between the late Everett Murley Milley and John Milley, as head of a household and other members of it, that would make him ... a member of it.\nAfter pointing out that he was simply a temporary inmate, the learned judge added:\nhe did not have those duties and responsibilities and those privileges of the kind and nature reciprocal to the head and other members that would make him a member of the household of John Milley.\nTo entitle the insurer in the present case to the benefit of what may be called either language restricting the risk or an exemption of certain vehicles from the protection granted by the clause, it was necessary for it to satisfy the Court that Murley Milley was a member of the household of which his brother John was the head.\nWhile the provision now appearing as para. (b) of s. 212 of The Insurance Act was introduced into the statute as s. 183f(b) by 1932, c. 25, the point to be determined here has not been dealt with in any Canadian case to which we have been referred.\nThe language of this portion of the clause is, in my opinion, ambiguous, due to the uncertainty of the meaning to be ascribed to the word \u201chousehold\u201d. The word has been interpreted in several American cases construing policies of insurance as bearing the same meaning as \u201cfamily\u201d. But, again, that word is one which has various meanings dependent upon the context in which it is found. In The King v. The Inhabitants of Darlington [6], construing a provision in one of the poor laws, Lord Kenyon C.J. said that in common parlance\nthe family consists of those who live under the same roof with the paterfamilias: those who form (if I may use the expression) his fireside.\nIn the New Oxford Dictionary, one of the definitions of the word \u201chousehold\u201d reads:\nThe inmates of a house collectively; an organized family, including servants or attendants, dwelling in a house; a domestic establishment. In the same work, the definitions of \u201cfamily\u201d include one which reads:\nThe body of persons who live in one house or under one head, including parents, children, servants, etc.\nIn English v. Western [7], a policy of insurance taken out by a boy of 17, living with and dependent on his father, provided that the underwriter should indemnify the insured against liability for bodily injury to any person arising out of the use of the car but excluding injury to any member of the insured\u2019s household. While the boy was driving in the car with his sister, who also lived with his father, an accident occurred in which she was injured. The claim was resisted on the ground that she was a member of the insured\u2019s household, which was given effect to by Branson J. at the trial. On appeal, the judgment was reversed by a majority of the Court, Slesser and Clauson L.JJ. holding that the expression \u201cany member of the assured\u2019s household\u201d was just as capable of being construed as meaning any member of a household of which the assured was the head as it was of meaning any member of the same household of which the assured was a member and, being ambiguous, it must be construed contra proferentes and that, since the assured was not the head of the household, the exception did not apply.\nI think it may be said with equal force that the household referred to in the clause in question in this action may consist of only the head of the house, his wife and children, or may include, in addition, relatives rooming in the house, even though they pay for their lodging. Some slight indication that the word should be construed in the former sense is afforded by the fact that, in the insuring clause against theft, liability is excluded for theft by any person in the household while the clause we are considering refers to a member of the household.\nThe language of the insuring clause, unlike the statutory conditions, is the language of the insurer. In Anderson v. Fitzgerald [8], LordSt. Leonards, referring to a policy of life insurance, said that, as it was prepared by the company, if there should be any ambiguity in it it must be taken more strongly against the person who prepared it. In a more recent case, the law was stated to the same effect in the House of Lords by Viscount Sumner in Lake v. Simmons [9]. The result of the authorities appears to me to be accurately summarized in MacGillivray on Insurance Law, 4th ed. 1953, s. 708.\nIn the circumstances of the present case, I think the language in question is to be construed in the manner most favourable to the insured person and that the respondents as judgment creditors are entitled to the same rights against the company as the insured might have asserted. For these reasons, I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Bell, Keith, Ganong & Griffiths, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, respondents: Mitchell & Hockin, London.\n[1] [1956] O.W.N. 809, [1956] I.L.R. 1-241, 5 D.L.R.

The appellant sold to the respondent D a tractor under a conditional sale agreement in which it was provided, inter alia, that on default by D the appellant should be entitled to retake possession of the property \"and sell the same at public auction or by private sale and apply the proceeds \u2026 on account of the purchase price \u2026 and interest then unpaid\", and that: \"Any surplus after such sale shall belong to the purchaser.\" At a time when the balance unpaid including interest was less than $1,500 (out of a total purchase-price of $7,780), the appellant took possession of the tractor and, after some unsuccessful negotiations with D, it delivered the tractor to P on payment by him of the exact balance owed by D and, on P's instructions, assigned its interest under the contract to the defendant S, an employee of P.\nHeld: The appellant was liable in damages for breach of its obligation under the contract to effect a provident sale of the tractor. The evidence established that the market value of the tractor at the time of repossession was much in excess of the price obtained by the appellant from P and the measure of damages was this excess value. D had never consented to the substitution of S or P as a party to the original contract and the circumstances did not in any way amount to a novation. The appellant's obligation under the contract was one that it could not assign without D's consent so as to be discharged of its own liability.\nCourts\u2014Jurisdiction\u2014Appellate jurisdiction of Supreme Court of Canada\u2014 Issue as to costs only\u2014The Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 259, ss. 36(a), 43.\nAn action was brought against L Co. and S.

The price was $7,780 of which $3,700 was paid in cash, the balance of $4,080 plus a financing charge of $160 to be paid in instalments the last of which fell due on August 19, 1949. Interest was payable on any instalments not paid when due.\nThe conditional sale agreement provided in part as follows:\n\u2026 if the Purchaser makes any default in payment the Vendor shall be entitled to possession and may retake possession of the property, so agreed to be sold to the Purchaser, without process of law, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 10 of Conditional Sales Act, and sell the same at public auction or by private sale, and apply the proceeds after deducting all expenses connected with such retaking possession and sale, including the payment of any lien or distress for rent of a third party on the said property, on account of the purchase price of said property and interest then unpaid; and the Purchaser further agrees to pay for any deficiency after such repossession and sale of above property if provisions of Section 10 of Conditional Sales Act have been complied with. Any surplus after such sale shall belong to the Purchaser.\nOn January 24, 1950, the balance of the purchase-price remaining unpaid including interest was $1,444.15 and on that day the appellant took possession of the tractor and sent to Duthie a notice of seizure pursuant to the provisions of The Conditional Sales Act, R.S.N.B. 1927, c. 152, now R.S.N.B. 1952, c. 34. The notice, which was addressed to Duthie and signed by the appellant, read in part:\nAnd Further Take Notice that demand is hereby made upon you for payment of the sum of Fourteen Hundred and Forty-four Dollars and fifteen cents being the balance due under the said Conditional Sales Agreement, and that unless the said sum of Fourteen Hundred and Forty-four dollars and fifteen cents is paid to the undersigned on or before the 14 day of February 1950 the undersigned will thereafter sell the said Tractor and angledozer by private sale on the premises of the undersigned at Pleasant St. in the town of Newcastle, in the County of Northumberland and that if the proceeds of such sale are less than the said sum of Fourteen Hundred and Forty-four dollars and fifteen cents you will be held liable of any deficiency, but should there be a surplus on such sale, you will be entitled to same.\nBetween the date of the seizure and February 14, 1950, Duthie had some discussions of the matter with Mr. Roy, manager of the appellant, who urged him to get the money to pay off the balance due; Duthie tried unsuccessfully to do this and then told Roy he had not been able to get the money and would have to let the tractor go. Duthie assumed at this point that the appellant would sell the tractor and that in due course he would receive the surplus of the selling price as it is not disputed that the market value of the tractor in its then condition was substantially greater than the balance owing under the conditional sale agreement, and his evidence on discovery, put in at the trial by the appellant, was that he was quite willing that the appellant should sell it.\nDuthie heard nothing further from the appellant, or from anyone else. At a later date, not fixed exactly in the evidence, he found out that the tractor had been delivered to one Price who was using it in his business as if it were his own.\nOn March 18, 1952, Duthie commenced this action against the appellant and the respondent Sinclair. The statement of claim, as originally delivered, recited the conditional sale agreement, the seizure, the terms of the notice quoted above and continued:\n7. The Plaintiff says that, instead of selling the said Tractor and Angle Dozer and accounting to the Plaintiff, as required so to do, under the said Notice in writing hereinbefore referred to and under and by virtue of the Provisions of Section 10, of the Conditional Sales Act, being Chapter 152 of the Revised Statutes of New Brunswick, 1927, the said Defendant, Lounsbury Company Limited, on or about the 20th day of February, A.D., 1950, unlawfully and wrongfully assigned and transferred the said Conditional Sale Agreement hereinbefore referred to and wrongfully and unlawfully converted the said Tractor and Angle Dozer to it's [sic] own use thereby depriving the Plaintiff thereof.\n8. The Plaintiff further says that on or about the 20th day of February, A.D., 1950, the Defendant, Lounsbury Company Limited, wrongfully and unlawfully delivered possession of the said Tractor and Angle Dozer, which it had wrongfully and unlawfully converted from the said Plaintiff, to the Defendant, Earl Sinclair.\n9. The Plaintiff says that the Defendant, Earl Sinclair, wrongfully and unlawfully converted the said Tractor and Angle Dozer to his own use and continues so to do. 10. The Plaintiff claims against the Defendants, for the wrongful conversion of the said Tractor and Angle Dozer and for an accounting.\nThe statement of claim concluded with a claim for damages in the sum of $6,335.85 being the difference between the purchase price of the tractor and the unpaid balance of $1,444.15.\nAt the opening of the trial para. 7 of the statement of claim was amended to read:\n7. The Plaintiff says that the Defendant The Lounsbury Company Limited did not sell the said Tractor and Angle Dozer in accordance with the Notice of Sale above referred to, and further says that the said Defendant The Lounsbury 'Company Limited wrongfully and illegally, and contrary to the provisions of Section 10 of the Conditional Sales Act, Chapter 152, R.S.N.B. (1927), on or about the 20th day of February, 1950, delivered possession of the said Tractor and Angle Dozer to one Harold N. Price, and otherwise converted the same to its own use.\nParagraph 8 was struck out and there was added an alternative claim for damages amounting to the difference between the value of the tractor at the time of repossession and the unpaid $1,444.15. I agree with the view of the learned Chief Justice of New Brunswick that the pleadings sufficiently asserted a claim for damages for breach by the appellant of its contractual obligation to act in realizing on the seized property as a reasonable man would in the realization of his own property.\nThe defence pleaded by the appellant was that after having seized the tractor and given the notice quoted above to Duthie, it received a request from one Price to assign the conditional sale agreement to him, that it agreed to do so on payment to it of the $1,444.15, that Price paid this amount to it, that Price directed the assignment to be made to the respondent Sinclair who was then an employee of Price, that this was done and that it then delivered the tractor to Price.\nAn assignment under seal from the appellant to Sinclair dated February 14, 1950, was filed as an exhibit at the trial; the affidavit of execution attached to it was sworn on February 14, 1950. No notice of the assignment, in writing or otherwise, was given to Duthie, nor was he advised that the appellant was not going to proceed with the sale of the tractor in pursuance of the notice of seizure. The learned trial judge found the facts to be as pleaded by the appellant, and was of opinion that, Sinclair being merely the nominee of Price, the latter \"by virtue of the assignment and taking over possession of the repossessed tractor stepped into the shoes of the defendant Lounsbury Company as the conditional vendor\". While he does not say so expressly it is implicit in the reasons of the learned trial judge that as a result of the assignment the appellant was relieved of its obligations to Duthie which were ipso facto fastened upon Price, so that Duthie's right of action, if any, was thereafter against Price only.\nIn allowing the appeal the Appeal Division proceeded on two alternative grounds. The first is stated in the following terms 3:\nIn his judgment the learned trial Judge discussed briefly the transactions between Duthie and Price involved in the lumbering operations or resulting therefrom. He expressed the view that they constituted a collateral matter in no way material to the issues raised in the action, in which opinion I concur. He proceeded to find that the company had duly repossessed the machine as it was entitled to do under the conditional sale agreement by reason of Duthie's default in completing payment and that due notice had been given by the company to Duthie, in accordance with the Conditional Sales Act, that unless payment was made on or before February 14, 1950, the machine would be sold by the company at private sale. There can be no question as to the correctness of such findings.\nHe concluded however that there had been no sale of the machine by the company and therefore no conversion for which it could be held responsible. With this view I find myself unable to agree. It seems to me that the acts of the company in assigning the conditional sale agreement, at the instigation of Price, to Sinclair, without the knowledge or consent of the latter, and in delivering the machine, without any authorization from Sinclair, to Price on being paid by the latter $1,444.15 were mere subterfuges to cloak the nature of the real transaction which was a sale and nothing else.\nOn this view of the case the company is liable for its failure to effect a provident sale on principles enunciated in McHugh v. Union Bank, 10 D.L.R. 562, [1913] A.C. 299, and Vanstone & Rogers v. Scott (1908), 1 Alta. L.R. 492.\nI do not find it necessary to discuss this first ground as, in my respectful opinion, the alternative ground on which the judgment of the Appeal Division is based is clearly right. Proceeding on the assumption that the findings of fact made by the learned trial judge were correct the learned Chief Justice of New Brunswick was of opinion that the appellant was liable in damages to Duthie for failing to effect a provident sale of the tractor. He says in part 4:\nBy its contract with Duthie the company undertook that, in the event of repossession, it would proceed to sell the machine and pay to Duthie any surplus remaining after expenses and the balance of the purchase-price had been paid. The conditional obligation so undertaken became an absolute obligation when the company resumed possession under the contract. The liability under that obligation could not be assigned by the company so as to deprive Duthie of his right to have the company proceed to a sale of the machine and pay to him any surplus resulting therefrom.\nIn Anson's Law of Contract, 20th ed., p. 262, the relevant principles of law are stated thus:\n\"A promisor cannot assign his liabilities under a contract.\n\"Or conversely, a promisee cannot be compelled, by a promisor or by a third party, to accept any but the promisor as the person liable to him on the promise.\n\"The rule is based on sense and convenience, for a man is entitled to know to whom he is to look for the satisfaction of his rights under a contract.\nIn 8 Halsbury, 3rd ed., p. 258, the principles are enunciated as follows:\n\"451. Assignment of Liabilities. As a rule a party to a contract cannot transfer his liability thereunder without the consent of the other party. This rule applies both at common law and in equity and is generally unaffected by statute.\n\"There is, however, no objection to the substituted performance by a third person of the duties of a party to the contract where the duties are disconnected from the skill, character, or other personal qualifications of the party to the contract. In such a circumstance, however, the liability of the original contracting party is not discharged, and the only effect is that the other party may be able to look to the third party for the performance of the contractual obligation in addition to the original contracting party.\n\"By the consent of all parties liability under a contract may be transferred so as to discharge the original contract. Such a transfer is not an assignment of a liability but a novation of the contract.\"\n* * *\nThere is nothing in the circumstances that can be construed as a novation. As already stated the agreement contained no provisions respecting an assignment of it or of any right or obligation created thereby. There was nothing said or done by Duthie that can be taken as authorizing or consenting to a transfer by the company of its obligations under the agreement. Consequently the company had no right to seek to divest itself of its undertaking contained in the agreement that, in the event of seizure, it would proceed to a sale of the repossessed machine and account to Duthie for any surplus. Having resumed possession of the machine the company was bound to proceed in a proper manner to sell the machine and pay to Duthie any surplus resulting, being powerless to rid itself of its obligation in this regard. For its breach of contract the company should be held liable.\nIn my opinion, the passage from Halsbury quoted by the learned Chief Justice of New Brunswick correctly states the law; and, assuming that it could validly assign the contract without Duthie's consent, the appellants' liability to perform its contractual obligation to effect a provident sale would not be discharged by the making of the assignment.\nI wish to make two additional references. The first is to the judgment of Collins M.R. in Tolhurst v. The Associated Portland Cement Manufacturers (1900), Limited; The Associated Portland Cement Manufacturers (1900), Limited and The Imperial Portland Cement Company, Limited v. Tolhurst 5:\nIt is, I think, quite clear that neither at law nor in equity could the burden of a contract be shifted off the shoulders of a contractor on to those of another without the consent of the contractee. A debtor cannot relieve himself of his liability to his creditor by assigning the burden of the obligation to some one else; this can only be brought about by the consent of all three, and involves the release of the original debtor.\nThe second is to the judgment of the Lord President in Thomas Stevenson & Sons v. Robert Maule & Son 4. That was a case in which the obligation undertaken by the defenders did not require any special skill or experience and consequently was one which might be performed vicariously. After differentiating the contract from one to which the principle delectus personae applies and which is therefore not assignable, the Lord President treats it as a matter of course that the assignment of the contract would not relieve the assignors from liability if their obligation was not performed. He says at p. 343:\nIt is work, therefore, the performance of which might quite well be delegated to another, the defenders' liability, of course, remaining the same as if the work was being done on their own premises by their own servants. The law applicable to this case is nowhere more succinctly and accurately stated than in Anson on Contracts (l5th ed., p. 286). \"If A undertakes to do work for X which needs no special skill, and it does not appear that A has been selected with reference to any personal qualification, X cannot complain if A gets the work done by an equally competent person. But A does not cease to be liable if the work is ill done.\" That appears to me to be good law and good sense, and is directly applicable to the present case. No attempt was made to challenge the assessment of Duthie's damages made by the Appeal Division.\nI share the view of both Courts below that the state of accounts between Price and Duthie was irrelevant to the latter's claim against the appellant.\nFor the above reasons I would dismiss the appeal against the judgment in Duthie's favour.\nThe appellant also appeals from that part of the judgment of the Appeal Division which requires it to pay the costs of Sinclair. The judgment at the trial dismissed the action as against Sinclair with costs payable by Duthie. The Appeal Division affirmed that dismissal but varied the order as to costs. Neither Duthie nor Sinclair appealed from that part of the judgment dealing with Sinclair and the only issue before us in which he is concerned is the order as to costs. No leave to appeal having been granted, it appears to me that, under ss. 36(a) and 43 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 259, we are without jurisdiction in regard to the judgment in favour of Sinclair which is for costs only.\nIn the result I would dismiss the appeal against Duthie with costs and would dismiss the appeal against Sinclair with costs as of a motion to quash.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the defendant company, appellant: R.

There is no presumption of advancement where such an account is opened by a mother in the joint names of herself and her child, although in the case of a widowed mother very little evidence will be required in such circumstances to establish the intention of a gift. If the evidence is insufficient to show such an intention, effect must be given to the trust.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing a judgment of Barlow J.[2] Appeal allowed.\nR.M. Willes Chitty, Q.C., and R.E. Shibley, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nW.B. Beardall, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau J. was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014It is unnecessary to decide in this appeal whether what was done was invalid as a testamentary disposition. There are cases where it has been held that, there being a present gift of the amount on deposit, The Wills Act did not apply: Young et al. v. Sealey[3], where Romer J. discussed several decisions in the Irish Free State, in New Brunswick and in Ontario, including Re Reid[4]. Reference might also be made to Russell v. Scott[5], a decision of the High Court of Australia. The circumstances of this case and particularly the fact that the respondent, a daughter of Mrs. Edwards, lived with her husband in Michigan, many miles from her mother\u2019s residence, do not permit any presumption of advancement to arise and, therefore, the ordinary rule applies that there was a resulting trust in favour of the mother, unless the evidence is sufficient to overcome that presumption. There is nothing in the document signed for the bank by the mother and daughter to cut down the former\u2019s equitable interest. It has been pointed out in Re Mailman Estate[6] and Niles et al. v. Lake[7]) that documents of this nature are drawn by the bank and cannot affect the resulting trust. That does not mean that where the facts warrant it a finding may not be made that there was a present gift and that the presumption as to a resulting trust was overcome, but here the evidence falls short of what is required.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the Court of Appeal set aside. The judgment of the trial judge should be restored, except that the appellant\u2019s costs of the action and trial should be paid out of the money in the bank as between solicitor and client. The appellant is also entitled out of the money in the bank to his costs as between solicitor and client of the appeal to this Court, but there should be no other order as to costs in this Court. The respondent should pay the appellant\u2019s costs as between party and party in the Court of Appeal, leaving the appellant, as executor, to recover the difference between such party-and-party costs and his solicitor-and-client costs of that appeal out of the money in the bank.\nThe judgment of Rand and Locke JJ. was delivered by\nRAND J.:\u2014The question in issue is whether the deceased mother of the parties, Alice Maud Edwards, on the occasion of having a bank account then in her name transferred to the names of herself and her daughter, Edna Bradley, the respondent, intended that the daughter should thereby obtain a beneficial interest either of a present joint tenancy or in the nature of a remainder. This depends upon the circumstances surrounding the transfer and these must then be examined. The mother, 80 years of age and in reasonably good health, was a widow with three children, two sons and the respondent. The husband had died in 1950, leaving her the sole beneficiary of his estate. Included in that estate was the home farm on which the widow continued to live. The son Anthony, the appellant, lived on his own farm 1\u00bd miles distant and the daughter, married, at Pontiac, Michigan. The homestead was rented and farmed by Anthony, for which he paid his mother $500 a year.\nAt the time of transferring the account the daughter\u2019s husband was building a home in Pontiac and the common expectation seems to have been that in the course of time the mother would be living with them in it. In anticipation of that, the mother apparently thought she should make a contribution towards the cost and during this period, the precise date of which does not appear, had offered assistance which at the time the daughter declined.\nOn January 30, 1952, the mother and daughter went to the bank and, as mentioned, had the account changed to their joint names. On April 8 following, the daughter approached the mother, saying \u201cThe money you offered me, I could use it now.\u201d A cheque on the account was thereupon given to her signed by the mother for $500. Later, on July 28, 1952, they went together to the bank and the same amount was drawn out by the mother and given the daughter. On this occasion a document, intended to confirm the fact of a gift to the daughter of both sums, was signed by the mother to this effect:\nI gave Edna Bradley my daughter on April 8th $500 also on July 29 $500 to help building a home on Dixie Hi-Way. At any time if I am not able to live alone or sick I can go to live with them.\nMrs. Alice M.M. Edwards\nThis was endorsed on the back by the former wife of the son Garnet as follows:\nJuly 29th, 1952.\nAt the time this money was given to Edna, Mrs. Edwards knew what she was doing and it was her wish that Edna have it free of any ties.\nHazel Edwards\nThe memorandum was given at the request of the daughter in these words: \u201cI don\u2019t want there to be any fuss about this at all, would you mind signing a statement to the effect that this is a gift and not a loan.\u201d No cheque was drawn on the account by the daughter while the mother lived. The mother died on January 9, 1953. On August 3, 1951, six months before the joint account was opened, she had made a will, afterwards probated, by which the farm was devised to the son Anthony subject to the payment of (a) $1,500 to her stepson, Ray Edwards, (b) $1,500 to the respondent and (c) $1,500 to her son Garnet. After providing $100 each for four granddaughters, to be paid out of the personal estate, the residue was divided equally between her stepson, Ray, and the three children, the respondent, the appellant and Garnet. There is no evidence of personal property of any value apart from the bank account. On January 30, 1952, the amount to the credit of the account was $6,195.63 and at her death it was $4,612.79. Her only income was the rent from the farm and the bank interest.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeal[8], reversing that of the trial judge[9], and finding that the joint account was intended to vest beneficially in the daughter, nullifies the residuary bequest as well as those to the grandchildren. It will be seen from the charge of $4,500 against the farm and the division of the residue that, even with an additional benefit accruing to the son Anthony from the farm, the amount of which, if any, is not shown, the intention of the testatrix was to distribute her estate in rough equality between the three children and the stepson. Is the conclusion that within six months after that testamentary act, she deliberately divested herself of any residual property and completely distorted the distribution provided by the will, a reasonable inference from the circumstances shown?\nThat she was a woman of character, strength and independence is quite evident. Enjoying good health, she undoubtedly looked to a not far distant day when she would accept the welcome home of her daughter, the acknowledgment of which was made clear by her contribution to its cost; but there was also the possibility that at any time she might be stricken with incapacity. Obviously she desired to be a burden to no one and her resources were sufficient to that purpose. It was what one might easily expect that she should provide against the day when she would be unable to attend to her banking affairs as she had done; and that, I am satisfied, was the purpose of the joint account.\nIt is just as clear that the daughter had no notion of having received any gift by the fact of the account or of having the right to touch it for her own purposes while her mother lived. The requests for the advances and the exclusive checking on the account by the mother themselves put this beyond any doubt, and the memorandum of July 9 concludes it.\nNo present benefit for the daughter was, then, intended by formal change in the account. Is there any justification for inferring that the mother intended the money to be exclusively hers while she lived but at her death to belong to the daughter? I can discover not an iota of matter on which can be based the conclusion that the mother, giving so many evidences of parental regard to the claims of all her children as well as of the stepson, had in mind to strip the residuary clause of all content and meaning: that would be contrary to every probability. The care taken to protect the daughter against an adverse inference from the two cheques, evidenced by the memorandum, shows how sensitive she was to the effect on the children of the distribution of what she owned; the legacy of $1,500 in addition to one-third of the residue to the daughter had been overbalanced to the extent of $1,000, but this had a special justification; to add to that the remaining funds in the bank and to wipe out the residue, including, as the evidence goes, the $400 to the grandchildren, would, as I read her mind, have been something utterly repugnant to her.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and restore the judgment of Barlow J., including the costs of both parties to be paid out of the money in the bank, those of the appellant as between solicitor and client. In this Court the appellant only will be entitled to costs, and as between solicitor and client to be paid out of the same fund. The respondent will pay the appellant\u2019s costs as between party and party in the Court of Appeal, the appellant recovering the difference between those and solicitor-and-client costs out of the same fund. CARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014I have had the advantage of reading the reasons of the Chief Justice and those of my brother Rand and agree with their conclusion that this appeal must be allowed. I also agree that it is unnecessary in this case to decide the question dealt with by Romer J. in Young et al. v. Sealey[10] as to whether the view of the law taken in Owens v. Greene; Freeley v. Greene[11] or that taken in Re Reid[12] should be preferred.\nAssuming that on the death of the late Alice Maud Edwards the respondent had the legal right to withdraw the money on deposit in the joint bank account and on making the withdrawal would have the legal title to the money withdrawn, the question is whether she is beneficially entitled to that money or holds it in trust for her mother\u2019s personal representative.\nAs all the moneys deposited in the account were the sole property of the mother the daughter would prima facie hold the fund to which she has the legal title on a resulting trust for the mother\u2019s estate. In Dyer v. Dyer[13], Eyre C.B. says:\nIt is the established doctrine of a Court of equity, that this resulting trust may be rebutted by circumstances in evidence.\nThe cases go one step further, and prove that the circumstance of one or more of the nominees being a child or children of the purchaser, is to operate by rebutting the resulting trust; and it has been determined in so many cases that the nominee being a child shall have such operation as a circumstance of evidence, that we should be disturbing land-marks if we suffered either of these propositions to be called in question, namely, that such circumstance shall rebut the resulting trust, and that it shall do so as a circumstance of evidence\u2026 Considering it as a circumstance of evidence, there must be, of course, evidence admitted on the other side.\nDyer v. Dyer was a case of father and son. In my opinion the result of the decisions in cases of mother and child is correctly summarized in the following passage in 18 Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England, 3rd ed. 1957, s. 736, p. 387:\nThere is no presumption of a gift where the purchase or investment is made by a mother, even though living apart from her husband, or a widow, in the name of her child or in the joint names of herself and her child, though in the case of a widowed mother very little evidence to prove the intention of a gift is required \u2026 Giving full effect to the existence of the relationship of mother and daughter, as a circumstance of evidence, I agree with the Chief Justice and my brother Rand that the proper inference to be drawn from all the evidence in the case at bar is that it has not been shown that the mother intended to pass the beneficial interest to the respondent either in her lifetime or on her death. It necessarily results from this finding of fact that the appeal succeeds.\nI have found the question as to what disposition should be made of the costs of the proceedings a difficult one. If I alone were called upon to decide it I would have thought that the costs of both parties throughout should be paid out of the fund in question by reason of the following circumstances: The deceased mother, through no fault of the respondent, made arrangements whereby on her death the legal title to the fund appeared to be vested in the respondent, leaving it to be determined by an examination of all the surrounding circumstances whether the respondent was intended to have the beneficial interest also. The learned trial judge[14] was of opinion that the mother did in fact intend that on her death the respondent should take the fund beneficially, but for reasons of law decided he could not give effect to this intention. The Court of Appeal[15], while taking a similar view of the evidence, reached a different conclusion as to the law and allowed the appeal. In this Court for the first time in the proceedings a different view has been taken as to the result of the evidence and we are restoring the judgment of the learned trial judge but for reasons differing from those on which he proceeded. It appears to me that the grounds for ordering all costs to come out of the fund are at least as strong as those which were found sufficient by the majority of this Court in Niles et al. v. Lake[16].\nHowever, as my view on this branch of the matter is not shared by the other members of the Court, I concur in the disposition of the appeal proposed by the Chief Justice.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Myers, McDonnell & Mitchell, Chatham,\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Bedford, Beardall & Pickett, Chatham.\n[1] [1956] O.R. 359, 2 D.L.R.

The natural parents can lose their right only by abandoning the child or so misconducting themselves that in the opinion of the Court it would be improper to leave the child with them. Their wishes in respect of custody must not be disregarded unless very serious and important reasons connected with the child\u2019s welfare require it. Re Baby Duffell, [1950] S.C.R. 737; In re Agar-Ellis (1883), 24 Ch. D. 317, applied. The fact that the natural parents of a child have Consented to its adoption does not affect this principle. It cannot be said that a consent to adoption, once voluntarily given, is in effect irrevocable, or that the withdrawal of this consent before the adoption has been completed should be disregarded by the Court unless it appears to be in the best interests of the child that withdrawal be allowed. Re Baby Duffell, supra, applied.\nThe mother of newborn twins, who before their birth had told the doctor and others that she wished to have them adopted, signed a consent to their being taken from the hospital by the doctor, to be given to adopting parents. After her discharge from the hospital she and her husband both signed formal consents to the adoption of the children, but within three months they changed their minds. They were at first unable to find out where the children were, but eventually, having done so, they took proceedings to obtain custody. The trial judge awarded custody to the foster parents with whom the children had been placed, but this judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal. The foster parents appealed. Held (Locke J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed. The conduct of the respondents, though reprehensible in many ways, did not constitute \u201cvery serious and important reasons\u201d sufficient to justify the Court in depriving them of custody of their children.\nPer Locke J., dissenting: Under the law of Ontario the paramount consideration in matters of custody, to which all others must yield, is the welfare and happiness of the infant. McKee v. McKee, [1951] A.C. 352 at 365, quoted and applied. Here the trial judge, having heard the parties and considered the matter most carefully, awarded custody to the appellants. It was not shown that in so doing he had acted on any wrong principle or disregarded any material evidence; on the contrary, he had clearly followed the principle declared in the McKee case. Accordingly, under the rule laid down in that case at p. 360, his decision should not be disturbed.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario reversing a judgment of Treleaven J. on an issue as to the custody of two infants. Appeal dismissed.\nC.L. Dubin, Q.C., for the defendants, appellants.\nJ.J. Robinette, Q.C., for the plaintiffs, respondents.\nRAND J.:\u2014It is, I think, of the utmost importance that questions involving the custody of infants be approached with a clear view of the governing considerations. That view cannot be less than this: prima facie the natural parents are entitled to custody unless by reason of some act, condition or circumstance affecting them it is evident that the welfare of the child requires that that fundamental natural relation be severed. As parens patriae the Sovereign is the constitutional guardian of children, but that power arises in a community in which the family is the social unit. No one would, for a moment, suggest that the power ever extended to the disruption of that unity by seizing any of its children at the whim or for any public or private purpose of the Sovereign or for any other purpose than that of the welfare of one unable, because of infancy, to care for himself. The controlling fact in the type of case we have here is that the welfare of the child can never be determined as an isolated fact, that is, as if the child were free from natural parental bonds entailing moral responsibility\u2014as if, for example, he were a homeless orphan wandering at large.\nThe view of the child\u2019s welfare conceives it to lie, first, within the warmth and security of the home provided by his parents; when through a failure, with or without parental fault, to furnish that protection, that welfare is threatened, the community, represented by the Sovereign, is, on the broadest social and national grounds, justified in displacing the parents and assuming their duties.\nThis, in substance, is the rule of law established for centuries and in the light of which the common law Courts and the Court of Chancery, following their differing rules, dealt with custody. As applied in equity, where the absolute right of the father, recognized in the common law Courts, was not acknowledged, it is now by s. 3 of The Infants Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 180, the governing law of Ontario.\nAs was said by my brother Cartwright in Re Baby Duffell; Martin and Martin v. Duffell[1]:\nThe wishes of the mother [here the parents] must, I think, be given effect unless \u201cvery serious and important\u201d reasons require that, having regard to the child\u2019s welfare, they must be disregarded.\nand by Bowen L.J. in In re Agar-Ellis; Agar-Ellis v. Lascelles[2], quoted in the Duffell case at p. 747:\n... it must be the benefit to the infant having regard to the natural law which points out that the father knows far better as a rule what is good for his children than a Court of Justice can.\nIt might be that the foster parents would furnish to the children here a home of easier circumstances and better fortune than that of the respondents; but who can say that that difference is for the ultimate welfare of the child? It might, in fact, prove to be the reverse. Carried to its logical result, the presumption that it would be would involve the conclusion that a modest home can, with better grace, be torn apart than one of opulent means. This needs only to be mentioned to be rejected. In the home of the respondents a third child, a daughter, was born in the year following the birth of her brothers, and that what forms the home for this child is not fit for nurturing these young boys cannot, in the circumstances shown, be seriously urged.\nVarious acts of the mother in special relation to these boys are argued to show her unfitness to resume the care of them. At the time of their birth this young woman was 21 and the father 23 years of age, they had within 5 or 6 years of that time come to this country from Holland, the husband had been out of work for almost 6 months, they were undoubtedly passing through very dark days and hope was at its faintest. That at such a time thoughts from which they would afterwards shrink could enter their minds needs only a bit of imagination to be understood. The mother\u2019s evidence does exhibit almost a primitive idea of her duty to a Court in this country; but she was young, in a strange land, fighting for her children, and however much she is to be condemned as an individual, it would be psychologically unsound to take that conduct to evidence her unfitness as a mother. Within less than 2 months of handing the children over these parents were seeking them and that desire had been made known to the foster parents. Whether it was instigated by the admonition of the maternal grandmother to remember their duty as Dutch parents or by the awakening of the parental sense or both is unimportant; that it was not for the purpose of exacting a price was the conclusion of the Court of Appeal in which I entirely concur; and it is not disputed that from September 1954 they sought first to discover the whereabouts of and then to recover their children. It may not unfairly be suggested that if the foster parents had extended to the respondents the sensitive and sympathetic imagination that enabled them to long to bestow parental love on children of strangers, they would have better understood the thoughts and feelings of the young couple seeking their own, and not have sought to strengthen their claim by keeping the whereabouts of the children secret. I should have thought that, to avoid any unnecessary distress to the latter, however temporary it might be, they would at least have allowed the dispute to be determined without delay. Nor can I view the pain of a permanent separation on the part of these foster parents to be comparable with that of the natural parents.\nI find it, therefore, quite impossible to say that the conclusion arrived at by the Court of Appeal was wrong. The appeal must be dismissed, but there will be no costs.\nLOCKE J. (dissenting):\u2014In my opinion this appeal should be allowed.\nThere can be no doubt as to the principles to be applied in matters of this nature in the Province of Ontario since the judgment delivered by the Judicial Committee in McKee v. McKee[3], which reversed the judgment of this Court[4] which had, in turn, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal[5] and that of Wells J. who had heard the application for custody[6]. In that case Lord Simonds said in part (p. 360):\nFurther, it was not, and could not be, disputed that the question of custody of an infant is a matter which peculiarly lies within the discretion of the judge who hears the case and has the opportunity generally denied to an appellate tribunal of seeing the parties and investigating the infant\u2019s circumstances, and that his decision should not be disturbed unless he has clearly acted on some wrong principle or disregarded material evidence.\nHe said further (p. 365):\nIt is the law of Ontario (as it is the law of England) that the welfare and happiness of the infant is the paramount consideration in questions of custody\u00bc To this paramount consideration all others yield.\nIn this matter Treleaven J., after having heard the parties and given the most careful consideration to the matter, awarded the custody to the appellants. It was not shown, in my opinion, that in doing so that learned judge either acted on any wrong principle or disregarded any material evidence. On the contrary, it is clear that he followed the principle declared by the Judicial Committee in the McKee case, which I have quoted.\nAs the other members of the Court are of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed, I refrain from making any comment on the evidence other than to say that my consideration of it would lead me to the same conclusion as that reached by Mr. Justice Treleaven and by Mr. Justice F.G. MacKay in the Court of Appeal.\nThe judgment of Cartwright, Abbott and Nolan JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, reversing a judgment of Treleaven J. and ordering that the respondents do have the custody of the infants Richard John Maat and Roland Charles Maat. The infants whose custody is in question are twins. They were born on June 23, 1954, in lawful wedlock. The respondents are their natural parents, but since leaving the hospital, on or about July 23, 1954, the children have been in the custody of the appellants.\nAt the time of the trial of the issue before Treleaven J. in November 1955 the respondent Herman Maat was 24 years of age and the respondent Trudy Maat 22. Both of them were born in Holland. The former came to Canada in July 1949 and the latter in September 1952. They met each other in September 1952 and were married on October 10, 1953.\nShortly after their marriage Herman Maat experienced difficulty in securing steady employment. He was unable to keep up the payments on a home which he had purchased and lost it. For some time the respondents\u2019 only home was a trailer. In this they moved to Windsor where Herman Maat sought employment without success. In May 1954 he returned to Toronto where he got work with a former employer. He left his wife living in the trailer at Windsor and returned there at week-ends. He did not get a room in Toronto but slept in his truck. In June 1954 he brought his wife and the trailer from Windsor and they lived in the trailer at the trailer camp in Cooksville, some 10 miles west of Toronto. On the drive from Windsor to Cooksville they suffered some minor mishaps.\nSpeaking of their state of mind at this period the learned trial judge says:\nThere can be no doubt they were both greatly worried about the expected child, and there is much convincing evidence that both parents regretted it was going to be born.\nOn or about June 16, 1954, Trudy Maat consulted Dr. J.D. Smith of Cooksville. There are direct contradictions between the evidence of this witness and his wife, who is also a doctor, on the one hand and that of the respondent Trudy Maat on the other. Where it conflicts with that of the respondents the learned trial judge has expressly accepted the evidence of the Smiths and I proceed on the basis that the facts are as testified to by them. Trudy Maat was very upset emotionally and was crying. She told the doctor that she was pregnant, that she and her husband did not want to have the baby, and that she had, at the sugges- tion of her husband, taken an overdose of pills without result. She asked the doctor to bring on an abortion. He, of course, told her he would not do this, and went on to say that she must let the child be born and could make one of three choices, to keep it, to have it adopted through the Children\u2019s Aid Society, or to have it adopted privately.\nThe next day Trudy Maat returned to the doctor\u2019s office and told him that she and her husband wanted the baby to be adopted. He examined her, found her condition normal and formed the opinion that the child would be born in about a month. About a week later Herman Maat telephoned the doctor that his wife\u2019s pains had commenced. Dr. Smith arranged for hospital accommodation, went to the trailer and told Herman Maat to take his wife to the hospital. The doctor asked if they still wanted to give the baby up and they both said that they did. Later in the day the twins were born. Being premature they were placed in an incubator. That evening Herman Maat went to the hospital to see his wife. He had asked the doctor if he could see her and the doctor, thinking that he might not be able to see her if he went alone, offered to drive him to the hospital. Mrs. Smith was also in the car. On the way Mrs. Smith asked Herman Maat if he was sure he wanted to give the babies up and he replied that he wanted to get it over with. Neither of the parents saw the children. On the fourth day after their birth Dr. Smith again asked Trudy Maat the same question and she replied in the affirmative. It is customary for a newborn baby to leave the hospital with the mother unless written instructions are given to the contrary. Trudy Maat signed the necessary form to permit the babies to be taken out by Dr. Smith and knew they were to be taken to adopting parents. When she was able to leave the hospital, apparently on June 30, Dr. and Mrs. Smith drove her home and on the way went to the office of Mr. Leslie Pallett, a solicitor whom the respondents had visited at Dr. Smith\u2019s suggestion before the babies were born. At that time Herman Maat had told Mr. Pallett that they wished to have the baby adopted and when Mr. Pallett learned that the Maats were married he tried to discourage them from taking this course. The Smiths also tried to persuade them to keep the children. In Mr. Pallett\u2019s office Trudy Maat signed a consent to the adoption of each twin and later in the day Herman Maat came in and signed these also. Mr. Pallett explained to them that the making of an adoption order would permanently deprive them of their parental rights. On July 31 Trudy Maat went to Mr. Pallett\u2019s office to ask about a notice she had received regarding the registration of the children\u2019s birth. At Mr. Pallett\u2019s request she signed fresh consents as he understood that her consent should be on a document other than that signed by her husband. Mr. Pallett asked her if she had changed her mind about the adoption and she replied in the negative. In reciting the above facts I have proceeded on the evidence of Mr. Pallett which the learned trial judge accepted in preference to that of the respondents.\nAt no time did the Smiths or Mr. Pallett disclose to the respondents either the identity or the whereabouts of the appellants, to whom the twins had been given when they left the hospital.\nBy the middle of September 1954 the respondents had regretted their decision and were actively seeking to recover their children. They interviewed Dr. J.D. Smith and Mr. Pallett, both of whom refused to tell them where the children were but communicated to the appellants the respondents\u2019 request for their children. The request was rejected. The respondents consulted a solicitor who wrote to Dr. Smith on October 6, 1954, but received no answer. After months of persistent effort the respondents finally discovered the whereabouts of the children and the respondent Herman Maat forcibly repossessed them. On being visited by the police, however, the respondents were persuaded for the time being to relinquish such possession and the present proceedings resulted. It is not suggested that there was any undue delay in commencing these proceedings.\nMr. Pallett testified that on the occasion of the last-mentioned visit, after he had told the respondents that the appellants would not give up the babies and that he did not think he could do anything for them they went out. His evidence continues:\nVery shortly after the husband came back in and said to me, \u201cWill they give me some money for the babies?\u201d I said, \u201cGet out.\u201d He said, \u201cWill I get my money back?\u201d I presumed he was referring to the money paid for the hospital bill, and we had a few nasty words, and he left. This was put forward as indicating a willingness upon the part of Herman Maat to sell his children but I am quite unable to so interpret it. Assuming that he used the words quoted, it must be remembered that Maat had just been told by Mr. Pallett, the only lawyer with whom he had had any discussion about adoption, that he could not get the babies back, and that he was at this time without independent advice, Mr. Pallett being solicitor for the appellants. Under these circumstances what he said was consistent with his seeking repayment of the expenses to which he had been put in connection with the birth of the babies if, as he had just been told was the case, he could not have the babies themselves. I share the view as to the incident expressed by Aylesworth J.A. as follows:\n... I must say at once that if the learned trial judge attributed any particular significance to what was then said as bearing upon the question of custody I must respectfully disagree.\nI agree with the following statement of Aylesworth J.A. as to the appellants:\nIt is quite clear that Mr. and Mrs. Hepton are of reputable character and no one suggests that they are not both well qualified and anxious to become foster parents or that the twins presently in their custody have not been well and lovingly cared for. Respondents at the present time are considerably better off financially than the Maats and are both in their middle thirties and childless.\nI also agree with the view of the respondents which he expressed as follows:\nThe evidence shows that the young parents, although of extremely modest means, are hard-working, religious people of respectable parentage. They are regular attendants at their church and have many friends in their community of the same racial strain as themselves.\n* * *\n... If in any of the quotations which I have made from the learned trial judge\u2019s reasons he is to be taken as concluding that the parents are unfit persons to have the custody and upbringing of their children then again I must respectfully disagree. I am quite unable to find anything in the evidence so far as the welfare of their children is concerned in impeachment of the appellants from a moral, spiritual or social viewpoint; reference has already been made to the economic situation, or even to the contrast in the economic situation, as between appellants and respondents, but the appellants are much younger than the respondents and have yet to make their way in their new country. As I have already said, the evidence indicates that they are industrious and of good character\u00bc\nThe material position of the respondents at the time of the trial was accurately described by the learned trial judge as follows:\nSince the babies were born the Maats\u2019 material position has improved somewhat. They no longer live in the trailer but are now in a modest apartment. The locality, however, is not a very desirable one in which to bring up children. They have had another child born to them, a daughter. As at present situated if the twins are returned to them all three children would be occupying the same room. Herman Maat is earning between $80 and $90 a week as a truck driver for a fuel oil company.\nWith the greatest respect it appears to me that the learned trial judge has attached too much importance to the consents to the adoption of the infants which were signed by both of the respondents. The argument that a consent to adoption once voluntarily given by the natural parents is in effect irrevocable or that the withdrawal thereof should be disregarded by the Court unless it appears to be in the best interests of the child that withdrawal should be allowed was unanimously rejected by this Court in Re Baby Duffell; Martin and Martin v. Duffell[7]. That case concerned the claim of the unmarried mother of an illegitimate child but as Aylesworth J.A. points out: \u201cThe position of a man and his wife jointly seeking custody of their children is of course at least on a par with that of the mother of an illegitimate child.\u201d In the course of his able argument, Mr. Dubin submitted that much that was said in the judgments delivered in Re Duffell as to the principles by which the Court should be guided in dealing with a question of custody in which one of the parties is a natural parent and the other a stranger in blood, was obiter. I incline to disagree with this submission and in any case I regard it as settled law that the natural parents of an infant have a right to its custody which, apart from statute, they can lose only by abandoning the child or so misconducting themselves that in the opinion of the Court it would be improper that the child should be allowed to remain with them, and that effect must be given to their wishes unless \u201cvery serious and important reasons\u201d require that, having regard to the child\u2019s welfare, they must be disregarded.\nWhile not accepting this view of the law, Mr. Dubin put forward a number of matters which in his submission should be regarded as \u201cvery serious and important reasons\u201d that the respondents should not have their children; these may be summarized as follows: (i) the desire of the parents to procure an abortion, (ii) the fact that they consented to give up the children for adoption when their circumstances were such that it was not impossible for them to have kept them, (iii) the conversation as to money with which I have dealt above, (iv) their apparent willingness to give untrue testimony, (v) the taking of the children from their carriage without the permission and against the will of the appellants, (vi) the sense of irresponsibility which, it was argued, the above matters indicate, (vii) the suggestion that their desire to get the children back was not spontaneous but was inspired by their spiritual adviser and by the wife\u2019s parents and that there is no evidence that they have real love for the children.\nAs to the last of these items, I can find nothing in the evidence to warrant the inference that the respondents are actuated by any motive other than the normal desire of parents for their children, and I cannot see in what way it would have been possible for them to demonstrate their love for the children, whose whereabouts were concealed from them for months and who were thereafter kept from them, except by doing their best to regain possession of them. I do not find it necessary to deal with the other items in detail as I share the view of my brother Rand and that of Aylesworth J.A. that they do not warrant the conclusion that the parents are unfit persons to have the custody and upbringing of their children.\nIn argument we were pressed with the authorities that emphasize the peculiar advantage possessed by the trial judge in cases as to the custody of infants and the reluctance of appellate Courts to interfere with the exercise of his discretion; but, in the case at bar, with respect, I am of opinion that the learned trial judge erred in principle in failing to give due weight to the fact that the respondents are the natural parents of the children and in attaching undue importance to the consent to adoption which the respondents withdrew when the children had been for less than two months in the possession of the appellants.\nHaving reached the conclusion that the respondents are fit and proper persons to have the custody and upbringing of their children and that there is no very serious and important reason requiring that, having regard to the children\u2019s welfare, the wishes of their parents must be dis- regarded it follows that I would dismiss the appeal, but before parting with the matter I wish to adopt the view expressed by Aylesworth J.A. as follows:\nIndeed, so far as the welfare of the children is concerned, I do not think it should be overlooked that now that the whereabouts of the children is known to the appellants their desire to keep in contact with their children if the children are left with respondents may well work against the children\u2019s welfare; nor do I think it unimportant that the children are almost bound to become aware of their ancestry and of their racial heritage. Knowledge of these things and that they are being brought up in alienation from their own flesh and blood is something which to my mind must play an important part on a consideration of what is best for the welfare of the children. Nor is it without significance that in their parents\u2019 home they will in all probability experience the affection and companionship of their sister and perhaps of future brothers and sisters. I also regard these as additional considerations demonstrating in an affirmative way the absence in this case of anything of a serious or important nature militating to deprive the parents of custody.\nWhile in view of the difference of opinion in the Courts below and in deference to the full and able arguments addressed to us I have set out my reasons in my own words, and perhaps at undue length, I wish to express my agreement with the reasons of Aylesworth J.A. with whom Roach J.A. concurred.\nI would dismiss the appeal. Both counsel made it plain that, whatever the result, costs were not asked and there will be no order as to costs.\nAppeal dismissed without costs.\nSolicitors for the defendants, appellants: Pallett & Pallett, Port Credit.\nSolicitor for the plaintiffs, respondents: W.E.G.

(Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nHer Majesty The Queen (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1957: April 3; 1957: June 26.\nPresent: Taschereau, Rand, Locke, Fauteux and Nolan JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nTaxation\u2014Sales Tax\u2014Whether awnings, canopies, marquees and umbrellas are \"prepared roofings\"\u2014The Excise Tax Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 179, ss. 86(1), 89(1), sched. III The aluminum awnings, canopies, marquees and umbrellas manufactured and sold by the defendant for installation over windows, doorways, patios and house balconies are not \"prepared roofings\" within the meaning of sched. III of the Excise Tax Act and consequently are not exempt from sales tax under s. 89(1) of the Act.\nThe words \"prepared roofings\" mean materials such as paper and felt, specially prepared for roofing, processed or treated so as to make them capable of resisting the weather. They are generally manufactured and sold in rolls or sheets and may be installed on roofs. A roof constructed with the defendant's products would not possess the essential characteristics of being an integral part of the building and of being weatherproof.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of Fournier J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada 1. Appeal dismissed.\nH. Neuman and J. Rudner, for the defendant, appellant.\nD. H. W. Henry, Q.C., and P. M. Ollivier, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nNolan J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada 2 awarding the respondent the sum of $37,064.66, representing sales tax payable by the appellant in respect of the sale of aluminum awnings, canopies, marquees and umbrellas during the period May 1, 1950, to May 31, 1953, together with penalties to November 30, 1953, amounting to $2,383.81 and further penalties in the amount of $2,470.90 from December 1, 1953, to the date of judgment.\nFor the purposes of the action the appellant made the following admissions:\n1. That it produced or manufactured in Canada the goods referred to in Plaintiff's information;\n2. That the said goods were sold and delivered to purchasers by Defendant in all the provinces of Canada except Ontario, from the 1st of May 1950 to the 31st of May 1953 ;\n3. That total payment, either on a cash or deferred payment basis, has been received by Defendant covering the said total sales prices;\n4. That if the sales of the said goods were taxable under the provisions of the Excise Tax Act and amendments thereto, which is specifically denied for the reasons mentioned in Defendant's statement of defence, Defendant is liable for the amount of taxes claimed in the present action.\nThe appellant is an incorporated company having its head office in Montreal. It manufactures, sells and installs metal coverings known as \"Kool Vent\" and is a licensee of a company in the United States of America known as Kool Vent of America. Its two manufacturing plants in Canada are situate in the Province of Quebec and in the Province of British Columbia.\nThe material manufactured and sold by the appellant consists of strips of aluminum of varying widths, but generally about 7 inches wide. After being painted, the strips are cut into the required lengths and are assembled by being hooked or fastened together. They are then given the shape and slope specified in the order form and the sides are processed in the same way. They are installed over windows, doorways, patios and balconies.\nThe only point in issue on this appeal is whether the learned trial judge was right in holding that such aluminum awnings, canopies, marquees and umbrellas, manufactured and sold by the appellant during the period in question, were subject to the sales tax imposed by s. 86(1) of the Excise Tax Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 179, as amended, or whether such products were exempt as being \"Prepared roofings\" within the meaning of sched. III of that Act.\nSections 86(1) and 89(1) of the Excise Tax Act read, in part, as follows:\n86. (1) There shall be imposed, levied and collected a consumption or sales tax of eight per cent on the sale price of all goods\n(a) produced or manufactured in Canada\n(i) payable, in any case other than a case mentioned in subparagraph (ii) hereof, by the producer or manufacturer at the time when the goods are delivered to the purchaser or at the time when the property in the goods passes, whichever is the earlier, and\n(ii) payable, in a case where the contract for the sale of the goods (including a hire-purchase contract and any other contract under which property in the goods passes upon satisfaction of a condition) provides that the sale price or other consideration shall foe paid to the manufacturer or producer by instalments (whether the contract provides that the goods are to be delivered or property in the goods is to pass before or after payment of any or all instalments), by the producer or manufacturer pro tanto at the time each of the instalments becomes payable in accordance with the terms of the contract;\n* * *\n89. (1) The tax imposed by section eighty-six of this Act shall not apply to the sale or importation of the articles mentioned in Schedule III of this Act. Under the heading of \"Certain Building Materials\" in sched. III are included \"Prepared roofings\" and \"Articles and materials to be used exclusively in the manufacture or production of the aforementioned building materials\".\nThe appellant contended that the products in question were \"Prepared roofings\" within the meaning of sched. III of the Excise Tax Act and consequently exempt from taxation by reason of s. 89(1) of that Act.\nThe evidence adduced on behalf of the appellant was that these coverings installed over windows, doorways, patios and balconies were roofs and that such Kool Vent products were \"Prepared roofings\". On the other hand the evidence adduced by the respondent was that prepared roofing consisted of felt, rags or asbestos saturated with bitumen and was sold in a roll and that it was called prepared roofing because it could be laid without the assistance of an expert by simply spreading it over a wooden roof and fastening it down with nails.\nThe learned trial judge, in accepting the contention of the respondent, set out his views on the expression \"Prepared roofings\" in the following language 3:\nIn my mind, the words \"prepared roofings\" were well explained by the witnesses and I believe they mean materials such as paper and felt, specially prepared for roofing. They are processed or treated in a way that makes them capable of resisting the weather. These materials are generally manufactured and sold in rolls or sheets and may be installed on roofs by an uncomplicated procedure requiring very little skill. The felt or paper is ordinarily saturated in a bituminous preparation and when affixed is covered with asphalt or tar and sprinkled with sand or very fine crushed stone. There may be other prepared roofings with which I am not familiar, but the above will suffice to illustrate what I think is the meaning of \"prepared roofings\" and the defendant's goods do not fall within that meaning.\nIn my opinion the learned trial judge, on the evidence, correctly defined the expression as it is understood by persons familiar with the building trade and the appellant has failed to discharge the onus of showing that its products come within the exempting provision contained in sched. III of the Excise Tax Act.\nMoreover, I agree with the contention of the respondent that the roof of a building is commonly understood to be an integral part of the building and to be weatherproof. I accept the evidence adduced by the respondent that a roof constructed with the products of the appellant would not possess these essential characteristics.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the defendant, appellant: Jack Rudner, Montreal.\nSolicitor for the plaintiff, respondent: F. P. Varcoe, Ottawa.\n1 [1954] Ex. C.R. 633, 54 D.T.C. 1158, [1954] C.T.C. 311.\n2 [1954] Ex. C.R. 633, 54 D.T.C. 1158, [1954] C.T.C. 311.\n3 [1954] Ex. C.R. at p. 642.\n",

If the buyer of an automobile allows 14 months to elapse without making any complaint, and then, after the automobile has been repossessed, seeks to annul the sale on the ground that the car, although sold to him as new, was not so in fact, his action must fail. In such circumstances he will be deemed, because of his unreasonable delay, to have accepted the situation.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec 1, affirming the dismissal of the action by Gibsone J. Appeal dismissed.\nPaul Miquelon, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant.\nGeo. Ren\u00e9 Fournier, Q.C., for the defendants, respondents. The judgment of Taschereau, Cartwright, Fauteux and Nolan JJ. was delivered by\nTaschereau J.:\u2014Dans le cours du mois de juillet 1952, l'appelant a achet\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9e la L\u00e9vis Automobiles Inc. une voiture de marque Dodge, mod\u00e8le 1952, pour le prix de $2,600. En paiement, l'appelant a remis au vendeur une voiture Pontiac, pour laquelle on lui a donn\u00e9 un cr\u00e9dit de $500, et la balance due sur le prix d'achat, plus les taxes de vente, s'\u00e9levait \u00e0 $2,142. L'appelant a donn\u00e9 un ch\u00e8que au montant de $342, laissant une balance de $1,800.\nLe compagnie intim\u00e9e qui a fait cette vente par l'interm\u00e9diaire de son agent Ren\u00e9 Hall\u00e9, a obtenu de l'appelant un document permettant au vendeur de vendre et c\u00e9der \u00e0 General Motors Acceptance Corporation of Canada, la mise-en-cause, tous ses droits sur ladite automobile.\nLe ch\u00e8que au montant de $342 donn\u00e9 en acompte n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 par l'appelant, mais ce dernier a fait quelques versements \u00e0 la mise-en-cause la General Motors Acceptance Corporation. Il a ainsi pay\u00e9 les versements \u00e9chus respectivement les 23 septembre, octobre et novembre 1952, mais subs\u00e9quemment a discontinu\u00e9 de les effectuer. Jusqu'\u00e0 cette date, il ne s'\u00e9tait pas plaint de l'\u00e9tat de la voiture qu'on lui avait vendue, et ce n'est que le 18 f\u00e9vrier 1953, apr\u00e8s au del\u00e0 de six mois de possession et d'usage, alors qu'il \u00e9tait press\u00e9 de payer par la mise-en-cause, qu'il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 reprocher \u00e0 ses vendeurs que l'automobile n'\u00e9tait pas une voiture neuve, telle que vendue, et demanda une r\u00e9duction du prix de vente. Le 23 mars 1953, la mise-en-cause, \u00e0 qui la voiture avait \u00e9t\u00e9 transport\u00e9e, en reprit possession faute de paiement, et ce n'est que le 18 septembre 1953, soit apr\u00e8s treize mois et vingt et un jours de la vente, que l'appelant a institu\u00e9 une action en r\u00e9siliation.\nL'honorable Juge Gibsone en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a rejet\u00e9 l'action avec d\u00e9pens, et ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 unanimement confirm\u00e9 par la Cour d'Appel 2.\nJe suis clairement d'opinion que, si la voiture automobile achet\u00e9e par l'appelant n'\u00e9tait pas de la qualit\u00e9 sup\u00e9rieure qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, l'action est s\u00fbrement tardive, et sur ce point je m'accorde enti\u00e8rement avec les raisons donn\u00e9es par M. le Juge St-Jacques et qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9es par MM. les Juges Pratte et Rinfret. Les actions de ce genre doivent \u00eatre institu\u00e9es dans un d\u00e9lai raisonnable, et dans le cas actuel elle ne l'a \u00e9t\u00e9 qu'au del\u00e0 d'un an apr\u00e8s que le contrat de vente fut intervenu.\nIl est bien vrai que l'appelant pr\u00e9tend avoir appris seulement au mois de d\u00e9cembre 1952 que la voiture en question n'\u00e9tait pas une voiture neuve, mais m\u00eame ceci ne serait pas suffisant pour justifier la pr\u00e9sente action, qui n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9e que dans le mois de septembre 1953. Ce d\u00e9lai est tardif, et je partage enti\u00e8rement les vues de la Cour d'Appel que le demandeur a implicitement renonc\u00e9 au droit qu'il aurait pu avoir de se plaindre de l'erreur et des fausses repr\u00e9sentations dont il pr\u00e9tend avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 la victime.\nLa cause de Lortie v. Bouchard 3 n'a pas d'application et ne peut servir \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer le pr\u00e9sent litige. Dans cette cause, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l'action en annulation pouvait \u00eatre maintenue, m\u00eame si elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9e quatre mois apr\u00e8s l'ex\u00e9cution du contrat, parce que dans les circonstances sp\u00e9ciales qui se pr\u00e9sentaient, il n'y avait pas eu de retard indu. Les d\u00e9fauts attribu\u00e9s \u00e0 l'automobile n'\u00e9taient apparus que graduellement, et il n'y avait eu aucune acceptation de la part de l'appelant acheteur qui n'avait cess\u00e9 de se plaindre.\nIl est bien vrai que dans cette cause de Lortie v. Bouchard, supra, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9, comme il l'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 dit d\u00e9j\u00e0 par la Cour d'Appel dans la cause de Bernier v. Grenier Motor Co. Ltd. 4, que l'art. 1530 C.C. qui est applicable au cas de demande en nullit\u00e9 pour vices r\u00e9dhibitoires, ne l'est pas dans le cas o\u00f9 il s'agit de garantie conventionnelle et formelle, mais il a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 dit qu'il faut quand m\u00eame que l'action, comme celle qui nous est soumise, soit intent\u00e9e dans un d\u00e9lai raisonnable, m\u00eame si on n'applique pas toute la rigueur qu'il faut appliquer dans le cas de l'art. 1530.\nJe suis d'opinion que le vieux brocard de droit romain Vigilantibus et non Dormientibus jura subveniunt, s'applique dans le pr\u00e9sent cas. Par son silence, l'appelant a accept\u00e9 les conditions existantes; il a institu\u00e9 son action tardivement, et celle-ci a \u00e9t\u00e9 justement rejet\u00e9e par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour du Banc de la Reine.\nL'appel doit en cons\u00e9quence \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.

After drinking beer for some two hours they embarked in the car, both of them being then intoxicated. An accident occurred as the result of J's gross negligence and the plaintiff sustained serious injury.\nHeld (Taschereau and Abbott JJ. dissenting in part): The plaintiff could not recover. The circumstances were such as to lead necessarily to the inference that he had impliedly, and with full knowledge of the nature and extent of the risk resulting from J's driving, agreed to assume that risk. Car and General Insurance Corporation Limited v. Seymour and Maloney, [1956] S.C.R. 322, distinguished and applied.\nPer Taschereau and Abbott JJ., dissenting in part: The circumstances were not such as to establish a voluntary assumption of the risk by the plaintiff but he had been guilty of contributory negligence to the extent of 50 per cent.

Appeal dismissed. The defendants Dick Decker and Trien Decker were the parents of the defendant John Decker, an infant.\nAlfred Bull, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant.\nDouglas McK. Brown and Raymond E. Ostlund, for the defendants, respondents.\nThe judgment of Taschereau and Abbott JJ. was delivered by\nABBOTT J. (dissenting in part) :\u2014Appellant's claim is one in damages for personal injuries sustained while a gratuitous passenger in a car owned by the respondent John Decker and driven by him while he was under the influence of liquor. The facts, which are really not in dispute, are fully set out in the judgments in the Courts below and I need not recite them here. The accident in which the appellant was injured was caused by the gross negligence of the respondent.\nThe learned trial judge held that the defence of voluntary assumption of the risk had been established and dismissed appellant's action. That judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, by Bird J.A. on the ground of voluntary assumption of risk, by O'Halloran J.A. on the ground that the parties were engaged in a common enterprise, and by Smith J.A. on the ground that appellant's action was barred by the rule ex turpi causa non oritur actio.\nThe principal defence argued before this Court was that of volenti non fit injuria. The general principles applicable to that defence were stated by the Judicial Committee in Letang v. Ottawa Electric Railway Company[3] , in the following terms, quoted from the judgment of Wills J. in Osborne v. The London and North Western Railway Company[4] :\nIf the defendants desire to succeed on the ground that the maxim \"volenti non fit injuria\" is applicable, they must obtain a finding of fact that the plaintiff freely and voluntarily, with full knowledge of the nature and extent of the risk he ran, impliedly agreed to incur it. It might be noted in passing that the facts in that case are of little help since it was held that there was no evidence of either volentia or scientia.\nThe defence as applied to a drunken driver, known to his passenger to be under the influence of liquor, was recently considered by this Court in Car and General Insurance Corporation Limited v. Seymour and Maloney[5] . In that case the learned trial judge[6] had applied the principle of voluntary assumption of the risk to relieve a drunken driver from responsibility for damages caused to a gratuitous passenger as a result of the driver's gross negligence. This finding was reversed by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia sitting in banco, sub nom. Seymour v. Maloney et al.[7] , and the driver was held to have been guilty of contributory negligence. That judgment was confirmed by this Court.\nIt is clear from the judgments in this Court in the Seymour case that for a negligent driver to be completely relieved from liability, the plaintiff must have agreed expressly or by implication to exempt the defendant from liability for damages suffered by the plaintiff and occasioned by the negligence of the defendant during the carrying out of the latter's undertaking. In other words, to constitute a defence there must have been an express or implied bargain between the parties whereby the plaintiff gave up his right of action for negligence. As was pointed out by Kellock J. at p. 331, the question in each particular case is, in the language of Lindley L.J. in Yarmouth v. France[8] , \"not simply whether the plaintiff knew of the risk, but whether the circumstances are such as necessarily to lead to the conclusion that the whole risk was voluntarily incurred by the plaintiff\".\nNo doubt there may be cases in which the defence of voluntary assumption of risk is available to a drunken driver to relieve him completely from responsibility to his passenger for the consequences of his own gross negligence. I am in agreement, however, with the view expressed by Doull J. in Seymour v. Maloney, supra, when, speaking for himself, Ilsley C.J. and Hall and MacQuarrie JJ., and referring to the volenti doctrine, he said[9] :\n\u2026in my opinion it is not in most cases an appropriate approach to the determination of the liability of the drunken driver. The person who accepts the drive may be negligent in doing so, but he seldom considers the risk or knows how drunk the driver is.\nIt is not without significance, I think, that we were referred to no case decided in England since the passing of the Law Reform, (Contributory Negligence) Act, 1945, c. 28, in which the doctrine of voluntary assumption of risk has been applied to relieve a defendant completely from civil liability for the consequences of his own negligence, and Mr. Brown told us that he had not been able to find any such decision.\nIn the instant case I am of opinion that the proper point of time at which appellant might be said to have voluntarily assumed the risk was when the three young men set out in respondent's car to visit the beer parlour. At that time no drinks had been consumed and the respondent John Decker stated that, as he was the driver, he had only intended to take one or two drinks. These good intentions, as so often happens, were not lived up to, but to paraphrase the words of Kellock J. in the Seymour case, supra, at p. 332, I do not think that the situation was then such as necessarily to lead to the conclusion either that the appellant agreed to take upon himself the whole risk or that the respondent accepted him into his automobile on such a footing. Moreover, in my opinion the evidence established that after some two hours spent in the beer parlour appellant was in no condition to give such an undertaking.\nWith respect I cannot agree with the view expressed by Smith J.A. that the action is barred by the rule ex turpi causa non oritur actio. This ground does not appear to have been directly pleaded or argued in the Courts below but in any event in my opinion more must be proved than is evident in this case before this defence can be given effect to. The application of the rule in a case of this kind was recently considered by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia sitting in banco in Foster v. Morton[10] . The relevant authorities are reviewed at length in the judgment of MacDonald J. and I am in agreement with his statement at p. 333 where he says:\nThere are, I think, weighty reasons why in principle this doctrine of illegality should not afford a general defence to civil actions of negligence arising out of automobile accidents, particularly in Canada where many kinds of conduct are prohibited by the Criminal Code and by many Provincial Acts of a penal nature. Accordingly, authority of the clearest kind should be required before concluding that the mere fact that the conduct of a party to a civil action was wrongful as being in violation of the Criminal Code or a penal act constitutes a defence. There is no such binding authority and such as exists is to the contrary effect. (Williams, Joint Torts and Contributory Negligence, pp. 333-5; Winfield on Tort, 6th ed., pp. 47, 520-1; Pollock on Torts, 15th ed., pp.125-7; National Coal Board v. England, [1954] 1 All E.R. 546 at pp. 552, 554-7, noted in (1954), 17 Mod. L. Rev. 365; 70 L.Q. R. 298-9; cf. City of Vancouver v. Burchill, [1932] S.C.R. 620-breach of highway legislation.) There is even less reason to hold that a passenger injured in a motor vehicle should be debarred from compensation merely because he was in law implicated in the criminal conduct of the driver as a constructive party thereto.\nUpon the principle enunciated by the Judicial Committee in Nance v. British Columbia Electric Railway Company Limited[11] , however, I am of opinion, upon the evidence, that appellant was guilty of contributory negligence. Under the Contributory Negligence Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 68, and having regard to all the circumstances of the case, I would apportion the liability equally between the appellant and the respondent John Decker.\nNothing was established which could justify holding the respondents Dick Decker and Trien Decker responsible for the negligence of their son John Decker.\nIn the result, therefore, I would allow the appeal against the respondent John Decker, declare him liable for 50 per cent, of the damages suffered by appellant and refer the matter back to the Supreme Court of British Columbia for the assessment of damages. The appellant should have his costs here and in the Court of Appeal and one-half of his costs in the trial Court. The appeal should be dismissed as against the respondents Dick Decker and Trien Decker with costs throughout.\nRAND J.:\u2014In this case there is the extreme example of complementary relations considered in Car and General Insurance Corporation Limited v. Seymour and Maloney[12] , in the circumstances that both driver and passenger at the time of the accident were so far under the influence of liquor as to be incapable of appreciating the dangers of their situation. The facts leading up to that condition can be shortly stated.\nThe driver, the respondent John Decker, and the passenger, the appellant Miller, with a friend Thistleton, young men of 19 years of age, had in the early evening of October 12, 1952, in Vancouver set out together to enjoy themselves. This was to be done first by indulging in the amenities of a beer parlour and following that those of a dance hall. The car was owned by Decker. Shortly before setting out, at a restaurant, a gathering place for the young men of the neighbourhood, they had met with others and in the course of talk the evening's entertainment was mentioned. Miller was undecided whether to go to a \"show\" with Decker and Thistleton or to \"go beering with the rest of the fellows\". Telling the others to wait for his return, he left the restaurant to go home for his clothes. After waiting 15 or 20 minutes Decker and Thistleton took the car and called at Miller's home to see what it was to be, and they were told that he would go along with them to the show. They drove past the restaurant just as the others were leaving it. The car was stopped and the discussion of plans was renewed. Miller indicated his preference for a \"beer\" party and finally Decker and Thistleton agreed to have a couple of drinks at a hotel in New Westminster and then \"come straight back\" to a dance hall. Miller described his purpose in going to the beer parlour as being \"to drink a bunch of beers to get feeling good and then go to the dance hall\". It was suggested by one of them, 7 or 8 in number, that all go in one car, but to this Decker demurred. At the hotel they gathered around a table and drank double rounds or more of beer from each one. Miller equally with Decker fully appreciated the condition to which they would be brought by the beer and the effect of that condition on the driving of the car as well as the risks entailed. Before leaving they decided to go not to a Legion dance they had in mind but to another, the place of which is not material.\nAbout 11 o'clock they left the hotel and proceeded to the hall. Miller recalls getting into the car but is very vague about the journey or being at the dance; and the memory of Decker is not much clearer. About midnight the three set out for home, but neither could recall the circumstances of getting into the car or of the ride. Later they passed another automobile at an estimated speed of 75 miles an hour and when their car struck railway tracks running across the street on which they were travelling it seemed, in the language of the witness who was watching it, \"to take off in the air\", and crashed on its side. Both suffered injuries.\nFrom these facts the inference is clear that the three were acting together in a common purpose and that the drinking of each was an encouragement to the same act in the others. Being fully aware of the most likely consequences of this indulgence, each voluntarily committed himself to the special dangers which they then entered upon.\nIn that situation I cannot think that any difficulty arises in the application of the principles of liability for negligence. As between themselves there is no doubt of what would have been required by Decker in the interchange that is to be constructed between these young men as they sat down at the beer table to begin \"to make an evening of it\". That he would have required the other two to assume the risks all were able to foresee and would have participated in creating, to take the same risks that he was taking, is unquestionable. The conditions then existing, their inevitable development, and the obvious hazards were theirs equally and jointly; and one can imagine the reasonable response of Decker, had his mind still been clear enough, if either of them had let fall a suggestion that he would be responsible for their safety: they would have been told to get into another car.\nIt is equally clear that Miller is to be taken to have accepted that requirement. This would have been obvious if he had remained sober and in command of his faculties; and having, by his voluntary acts, co-operated in creating and placing himself in the midst of the mounting dangers, his intoxication does not qualify his acceptance.\nIn this case, to treat either the question whether the assumption of the risk was a requirement of Decker or whether it was accepted by Miller as to be decided at the moment of setting out from the dance hall, would, in view of their condition, be futile: one could not then rationally propose terms nor the other accept them: and only from the circumstances in which they moved to the fulfilment of their purpose around the beer table is the answer in either case to be drawn. The terms are to be inferred, then, on the understandings which the ordinary persons of their age, aware of their situation and as it would develop, as reasonable and prudent young men, would have proposed and accepted. That standard is imposed on those whose minds are clear and those who deliberately commit themselves to the vortex of such risks can claim no greater indulgence.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Kellock and Locke JJ. was delivered by KELLOCK J.:\u2014In Car and General Insurance Corporation Limited v. Seymour and Maloney[13] , this Court held the defence of volenti to be available in actions of the type here in question, provided, of course, that defence was made out as a matter of evidence. The question for the Court in such cases was variously formulated by the members of the Court but with no difference in essence.\nAt p. 324, Rand J. said:\nIn such commitments the question ought, I think, rather to be, can the defendant reasonably be heard to say, as an inference from the facts, that the risk of injury from his own misconduct was required by him to be and was accepted by the complainant as such a term?\nAt p.326:\n\u2026the basic understanding must be reduced to an actual or constructive exchange of terms under which the commitment of the interests of both is brought.\nKellock J., at p. 332:\n\u2026the true question is that stated in Salmond, 10th ed., at p. 34, \"Did the plaintiff give a real consent to the assumption of the risk without compensation; did the consent really absolve the defendant from the duty to take care?\" Having regard to the statute law in force in Nova Scotia, that question becomes in the case at bar, \"Did the plaintiff agree, expressly or by implication, to exempt the defendant from liability for any damage suffered by the plaintiff during the carrying out of the undertaking of the latter, occasioned by the gross negligence of the defendant?\"\nThe word \"latter\" above should obviously have been \"former\". And lower down on the same page, with reference to the facts then before the Court:\n\u2026I do not think it arguable that the situation was then such as necessarily to lead to the conclusion either that the plaintiff agreed to take upon herself the whole risk or that the defendant accepted her into his automobile on such a footing. At p. 334, Locke J.:\nIn the present matter, the question as to whether or not the respondent \"freely and voluntarily, with full knowledge of the nature and extent of the risk\" she ran \"impliedly agreed to incur it\", the test approved by the Judicial Committee in Letang v. Ottawa Electric Railway Company, [1926] A.C. 725, 731, was one of fact.\nAnd lower on the same page:\nIn my opinion, the question as to whether the evidence showed that the plaintiff had given a real consent to the assumption of the risk, absolving the defendant from the duty to take the limited degree of care imposed upon him by s. 183 of the Motor Vehicles Act (c. 6, 1932), did not in this case depend upon the views of the trial judge as to the respondent's veracity, but rather upon the inferences to be drawn from facts which were not in dispute.\nCartwright J. at p. 335:\nI agree with my brother Rand that the question to be answered in deciding whether the defence of volenti non fit injuria was established in this case is whether the defendant can reasonably be heard to say, as an inference from the facts, that the risk of injury from his own misconduct was required by him to be and was accepted by the complainant as a term of his undertaking to carry her gratuitously\u2026\nUnder the relevant statute law of British Columbia the respondent driver is rendered liable to a passenger for gross negligence only. It is common ground between the parties that the finding of gross negligence at the trial must stand and that the further finding that the accident, as a result of which the plaintiff sustained injuries, occurred as a result of the defendant's intoxication.\nThe learned trial judge[14] upheld the defence of volenti, as did Bird and O'Halloran JJ.A. in the Court of Appeal[15] . The judgment of Sidney Smith J.A. dismissing the appeal was put on another ground.\nThe learned trial judge[16] found that\nThe two young men involved, aged about 19, were members of a group of similar age and proclivities living in Vancouver who on the evening in question had nothing to do so they all decided to go \"beering\" and for such purpose drove in three cars to the Russell Hotel in New Westminster where they sat drinking beer for two hours or more. Some time during the evening they decided to go to a dance and it seemed appropriate that they should qualify themselves to enjoy that dance for the plaintiff says on his examination for discovery:\n\"Q. What you were to do actually was to drink a bunch of beers to get feeling good and then go out to this dance hall, isn't that right? A. That's right.\" This plan was ultimately carried out. In my opinion, the relevant time when the question of consent or no consent is to be determined is the time, as above, to which the learned trial judge directed his mind.\nThe relevant evidence of the appellant is as follows:\nQ. You knew as you were drinking these beers that you were gradually becoming under the influence of liquor, didn't you? A. That is right.\nAnd further:\nQ. I suppose you knew when you were in the beer parlour that if Decker would be drinking beer his ability to drive might not be as good as otherwise? A. Yes.\nQ. You knew that, didn't you\u2014did you tell him to quit drinking at all? A. No.\nQ. I suppose you knew, too, that the more beer he drank the greater would be the risk if he would drive the car? A. No, I wasn't bothering with any\u2014\nQ. You know that is so? A. Yes.\nQ. In other words, if you are sitting by with me and we are both drinking and you see me drinking a lot and know I am going to drive a lot, you know there is additional risk to be incurred if you drive with me? A. Yes.\nQ. You know that, don't you\u2014and you knew when you were in the beer parlour drinking he was drinking with you, that the plans were to go to the dance hall? A. Yes.\nQ. And as far as you were concerned you were going with Decker? A. That is right.\nQ. And in his car? A. Yes.\nQ. And these other boys were all your age approximately? A. Yes.\nQ. I don't suppose you thought drinking beer like that would make any of them sober or more sober, did you? A. No.\nQ. You know enough about drinking to know that it might affect them the same as it affected you, isn't that right? A. Yes.\nQ. \"Yes\", did you say? A. Yes.\nThe appellant says that all he can recall as to leaving the beer parlour was getting into the front seat of the respondent's car. He also has some vague recollection of his conduct at the dance. The accident took place after the respondent driver and the appellant had left the dance. Its occurrence is thus described by the learned trial judge[17] :\nAt any rate, both the plaintiff and the defendant became very intoxicated and in that condition they, together with another young man, drove to a dance. They seem to have very little recollection as to what happened there but on returning Decker drove along Scott Road at 75 to 80 miles per hour passing other traffic until a railway crossing was reached. At that point, according to the evidence of the driver of one of the cars which was passed, the defendant's car seemed to take to the air. It landed off the road on its side as a result of which the infant plaintiff suffered his injuries. There is no doubt that Decker's driving was not only dangerous but reckless and amounted to gross negligence. Had there been a fatality he might well have been successfully prosecuted for manslaughter. As it was he pleaded guilty to dangerous driving before a magistrate and was fined $50.\nIn my opinion, the question whether the evidence establishes that the appellant consented to assume the risk without compensation in the event of injury must be answered in the affirmative. I adopt what was said by Bird J.A. in the Court below[18] , that\nIt is I think inconceivable that anyone, even of the most limited intelligence, would not realize the danger of being driven by another thus fortified. Miller was party to the plan, realized that he himself was becoming intoxicated and that the others, drinking as he was, were likely to be similarly affected; nevertheless he elected to ride with Decker in the latter's car. In those circumstances I do not think that Miller's conduct in so doing reasonably can be interpreted otherwise than as a free and voluntary acceptance of the risk involved in being driven by one who he knew was intoxicated.\nIt is further contended for the appellant that as the respondent driver committed a breach of s. 285(6) of the 1927 Criminal Code as well as that he was driving in excess of the statutory speed limit at the time of the accident, the defence of volenti is rendered inapplicable.\nIn my opinion, this objection is not well taken. There is a substantial difference between the breach of such statutory provisions as those laying down safety requirements in factories for the protection of persons employed therein, and a breach of such statutory provisions as the above.\nSuch statutes as the Factory Acts were enacted to create an absolute duty on the employer to protect his employees by the installation of the safeguards called for by the enactments, breach of which duty would give to an injured employee a cause of action against which even the express consent of the employee to dispense with the statutory requirements would afford no defence. On the other hand, statutes of the character of those here in question were not enacted from any such standpoint or with any such object. Accordingly, there is no public policy attaching to their breach which would provide any basis for giving effect to such a contention as that put forward by the appellant in the case at bar. As to the contention put forward on behalf of the respondents other than the driver, based on s. 48 of the Motor-Vehicle Act, R.S. B.C. 1948, c. 227[19], our view as to its untenable nature was sufficiently indicated on the argument.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, TASCHEREAU and ABBOTT JJ. dissenting in part.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Bull, Housser, Tupper, Ray, Guy & Merritt, Vancouver.\nSolicitor for the defendants, respondents: Angelo E.

As the result of the negligence of D, the plaintiff was injured while a passenger in a taxicab owned by the defendant and driven by D. The plaintiff and D, an old friend of army days, embarked upon an extensive tour of the city of Montreal, visited at least two taverns and were both intoxicated at the time of the accident. The meter of the taxicab was not in operation during the tour but there was evidence that payment was to toe made for the time spent on the trip. While there were inconsistencies in the evidence, there was little direct conflict. The trial judge found that D was in the performance of his work but this finding was reversed by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld: The Court of Appeal was justified in its view that the judgment at trial could not be supported and in drawing the inference that this was not a case of an engagement of carriage on behalf of D's employer. The judgment should therefore be affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec 1, reversing the judgment at trial. Appeal dismissed.\nG. Laurendeau and L. Racicot, for the defendant, appellant.\nHazen Hansard, Q.C., and William Grant, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau, Fauteux and Abbott JJ. was delivered by\nAbbott J.:\u2014Appellant's claim is one in damages for personal injuries sustained while a passenger in a taxicab owned by respondent and driven by an employee, one Fernand Daigle.\nThe Superior Court maintained appellant's action to the extent of $13,296.91, being 75 per cent. of $17,729.21, established as being the amount of the damages sustained by appellant, held that the accident in which appellant was injured was caused by the fault of Daigle and that the latter was in the performance of the work for which he was employed by respondent within the meaning of art. 1054 C.C. so as to engage the vicarious responsibility of respondent.\nThere is no doubt that the accident was due to the negligence of Daigle, the facts are fully recited in the judgments of the Courts below and I need refer to them only briefly.\nAppellant and Daigle both testified, the latter on discovery and the former at the trial. From their evidence it appears that the appellant, on the invitation of Daigle, an old friend of Army days, entered the latter's taxicab and the two then repaired immediately to the nearest tavern where they proceeded to refresh themselves with at least one bottle of beer apiece, paid for by appellant. They then embarked upon an extensive tour of the city of Montreal, a tour which the learned trial judge characterized by such terms as \"fameuse course\", \"fantastique et extraordinaire\". During the course of this tour they visited at least one more tavern where they partook of further alcoholic refreshment, again at appellant's expense, and were found by both Courts below to have been in a state of intoxication at the time of the accident.\nThere is some evidence that a part of the trip was to enable appellant to visit the office of his employer and to look for a customer whom appellant admitted he had never met or spoken to and whom they were unable to find. The meter on the taxicab was not operating during the tour but appellant testified that at some time during the evening he made an arrangement with Daigle to pay him at the rate of $4 an hour for the time spent on the trip while Daigle's version is that appellant was to pay him $3 to $4 for the evening.\nOn this evidence, the learned trial judge held that Daigle was in the performance of the work for which he was employed but this finding has been unanimously reversed by the Court of Queen's Bench 2, which held that the trip in question was in the nature of a joy ride and that at the time of the accident\nle conducteur du taxi ne conduisait pas dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de son patron mais pour se r\u00e9jouir durant quelques heures en compagnie de l'intim\u00e9, en absorbant de la boisson qui devait augmenter l'agr\u00e9ment.\nIt is a truism, of course, to state that when a case is tried under the system known in Quebec as \"enqu\u00eate and merits\", the trial judge, who acts as both judge' and jury, speaks with preponderating authority when he determines the weight to be given to contradictory testimony : see Montreal Tramways Company v. Sofio 3. While there are some inconsistencies as between the evidence of appellant and that of Daigle there is little direct conflict. There is some conflict as to the degree of intoxication and as to the arrangements for payment, but the trial judge accepted the evidence of Daigle as to intoxication in preference to that of appellant. Presumably, therefore, he was not ready to accept the evidence of the latter without some reservations.\nThe validity of appellant's claim depends upon an inference of fact to be drawn from all the facts proved and the application to it of a legal principle. On this inference of fact the learned judges of the Court of Appeal have differed from the learned trial judge, as they were entitled to do. The position of this Court in such circumstances was clearly stated by Taschereau J., as he then was, when in rendering the unanimous judgment of the Court in Demers v. The Montreal Steam Laundry Company 4, he said at p. 538:\n\u2026 it is settled law upon which we have often acted here, that where a judgment upon facts has been rendered by a court of first instance, and a first court of appeal has reversed that judgment, a second court of appeal should interfere with the judgment on the first appeal, only if clearly satisfied that it is erroneous; Symington v. Symington L.R. 2 H.L. Sc. 415.\nThe appellant has failed to satisfy me that the judgment of the Court below is erroneous. On the contrary, I am in agreement with the view expressed by the learned judges of the Court of Queen's Bench that the judgment of the Superior Court cannot be supported.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nRand J.:\u2014I agree that this appeal should be dismissed. Several of the significant items of the story which, as presented, were suspect, could and should, if true, have been supported by more or less independent corroboration. In its absence the Court of Appeal 5 was justified in drawing the conclusion it did, that the case was one of the reunion of two comrades-in-arms and not an engagement of carriage by one of them on behalf of his employer.\nLocke J.:\u2014In my opinion, this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the defendant, appellant: Lomer Racicot, Montreal.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: McMichael, Common, Howard, Case, Ogilvy & Bishop, Montreal.\n1 [1956] Que.

SICARD\n(Sign\u00e9) L. D. GERMAIN.\n(The italics are mine.)\nAs originally drafted by appellant, this agreement contained the following words in clause B following the words \"la valeur nette desdites actions\":\ntel que fix\u00e9e par les Auditeurs de la Compagnie, et approuv\u00e9e par M. M. Lajoie, G\u00e9linas & Macnaughten, avocats,\nbut at the suggestion of respondent these words were struck out and replaced by the words :\nbas\u00e9e sur le rapport des auditeurs de la Cie annex\u00e9' aux pr\u00e9sentes et sujet \u00e0 la v\u00e9rification de L. D. Germain.\nThe amount of $200 per share called for by clause A of the agreement was paid and respondent's claim is for the balance alleged to be owing under the provisions of clause B.\nAppellant contends that the terms of clause B require that \"la valeur nette\" of the company's shares be established (i) by using as a basis the financial statements annexed to the agreement, but also (ii) by giving what Mr. G\u00e9rin-Lajoie described as \"full effect\" to certain settlements made with the Department of Munitions and Supply with respect to war contracts and with the Department of National Revenue with respect to liability for income tax and excess profits tax.\nBefore the Superior Court and the Court of Queen's Bench, respondent took the position that the agreement entitled him, by reason of his right of \"v\u00e9rification\", to revalue all the assets of the company and to revise the amount of all its liabilities following the final determination of the two claims referred to, in order to ascertain the net value of the shares. This interpretation was rejected by the trial Court and by the Court of Queen's Bench, and was not urged before this Court.\nAlternatively respondent submitted that the financial statements prepared by the company's auditors and annexed to the agreement were to be accepted as final in determining the value of the assets and the amount of the liabilities of the company as shown therein, leaving only the undetermined claims for contract refunds and taxes to be replaced when these items had been finally settled. This interpretation was accepted by the Court of Queen's Bench and is the one urged by respondent before this Court.\nIt is conceded that the financial statements annexed to the agreement accurately reflected the financial position of the company as shown by its books at August 31, 1944, including the value placed upon its assets and the amount of its liabilities, both actual and estimated.\nI am in respectful agreement with the view expressed by Bissonnette and Hyde JJ. in the Court below, that the agreement of sale is clear and unambiguous in its terms. The parties accepted as final for the purposes of the agreement the value of the company's assets and the amount of its liabilities as set forth in the auditors' statements and as shown on its books with two exceptions, namely, the estimated liability for contract refunds and the estimated liability for income and excess profits tax. In these two instances the actual amounts when these were determined were to replace the estimated amounts shown in the statements. In addition, respondent reserved the right to verify (1) that the auditors' statements annexed to the agreement were in accordance with the company's books and (2) the amounts finally settled as being the company's actual liability for contract refunds and taxes. Respondent, having ceased to be a shareholder of Sicard Limit\u00e9e, took no part in the settlement of the two Government claims although it was obviously in his interest as well as in that of the company that these claims should be settled for the lowest possible amount. The final determination of the exact amount of these two liabilities may have rendered it desirable that some changes be made in the company's books in order to make them conform to approved accounting practice. This, however, was something in which the respondent had ceased to have any interest, and he was, of course, in no position to have any say as to what changes it might be deemed desirable to make in the company's books. The settlement of the two liabilities in question was bound to affect the company's surplus of assets over liabilities but the final determination of the amounts owing for contract refunds and taxes could not affect the value of the assets of the company, nor could it affect the amount of the company's other liabilities as accepted by the parties in their agreement of June 18, 1945.\nFor these reasons as well as for those given by Bissonnette and Hyde JJ. in the Court below, with which I am in respectful agreement, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Lajoie, G\u00e9linas & Lajoie, Montreal.\nSolicitor for the plaintiff, respondent: L.

In a substitution fid\u00e9icommissaire, on the other hand, the donee is charged to deliver the thing given, or another thing, to a third person, benefited in second place; in other words, two benefits are conferred, but in succession rather than simultaneously, and there is an interval between the enjoyment of the grev\u00e9 and the opening of the substitution. Under art. 928 of the Civil Code a disposition may create a substitution notwithstanding the use of the word \"usufruct\"; the terms of the deed, and the intention there disclosed, rather than the ordinary interpretation of particular terms, must determine whether or not a substitution has been created.\nA testator, by cl. 5 of his will, devised \"la jouissance et usufruit\" of his estate to his four sons and made them universal legatees \"en jouissance et usufruit comme susdit\". By cl. 6, he devised \"la nue propri\u00e9t\u00e9\" of his estate \"aux enfants de ces derniers [his four sons] n\u00e9s et \u00e0 na\u00eetre \u2026\" One of the assets of the estate, an immoveable, was seized by the sheriff to satisfy a judgment against the estate and was subsequently sold to the defendant. An opposition to secure charges was made by the grandchildren but rejected by a judgment which was not appealed. The grandchildren instituted this action to have the sale declared null on the ground that it had not discharged the right of substitution not then open. The trial judge held that the will had created a substitution, and gave judgment for the plaintiffs, but this judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed. The rights of the plaintiffs in the immoveable were discharged by the sheriff's sale since the terms of the will indicated that a usufruct rather than a substitution was created.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec 1, reversing the judgment at trial. Appeal dismissed. C. A.

Dans son testament, ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 devant les notaires J. A. Brunet et J. H. Lipp\u00e9 le 2 novembre 1916, Alexandre Aubertin qui avait quatre fils, Joseph, Paul, Albert et Raoul, a dispos\u00e9 de ses biens de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\n5\u00b0. Je donne et l\u00e8gue la jouissance et usufruit de tous mes biens meubles et immeubles de nature quelconque que je d\u00e9laisserai aux jour et heure de mon d\u00e9c\u00e8s, sans exception ni r\u00e9serve, \u00e0 Joseph Aubertin, Albert Aubertin, Paul Aubertin, et Raoul Aubertin, mes quatre fils que j'institue mes l\u00e9gataires universels en jouissance et usufruit comme susdit.\nPour par eux avoir la dite jouissance et usufruit, leur vie durant, \u00e0 leur caution juratoire et sans \u00eatre tenus de faire inventaire et \u00eatre partag\u00e9e par parts et portions \u00e9gales entre eux, savoir un quart \u00e0 chacun d'eux.\n6\u00ba. Je donne et l\u00e8gue la nue propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des biens ci-dessus l\u00e9gu\u00e9s \u00e0 mes dits fils Joseph Aubertin, Albert Aubertin, Paul Aubertin et Raoul Aubertin, en jouissance, aux enfants de ces derniers, n\u00e9s et \u00e0 na\u00eetre en l\u00e9gitimes mariages.\nPour \u00eatre, mes dits biens partag\u00e9s entre les enfants des dits Joseph Aubertin, Albert Aubertin, Paul Aubertin et Raoul Aubertin, par souche suivant l'ordre ordinaire des Successions, \u00e0 l'exclusion de tous autres, lequel partage ne sera fait qu'apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9c\u00e8s du dernier des mes dits enfants ci-dessus nomm\u00e9s.\nDans le cas de d\u00e9c\u00e8s d'aucun des dits Joseph Aubertin, Albert Aubertin, Paul Aubertin et Raoul Aubertin avant moi, en laissant des enfants, sa part dans ma Succession accro\u00eetra \u00e0 ses dits enfants.\nDans le cas o\u00f9 aucun des dits Joseph Aubertin, Albert Aubertin, Paul Aubertin et Raoul Aubertin mes fils viendrait \u00e0 d\u00e9c\u00e9der sans laisser d'enfants ou qu'en ayant il vient ou vinssent \u00e0 d\u00e9c\u00e9der en minorit\u00e9 et sans laisser d'enfants, sa part dans ma succession accro\u00eetra \u00e0 ses fr\u00e8res ci-dessus nomm\u00e9s lui survivant et dans le cas de pr\u00e9d\u00e9c\u00e8s d'aucun d'eux ci-dessus nomm\u00e9s aux enfants de ce dernier, \u00e0 l'exclusion de tous autres, pour \u00eatre partag\u00e9e entre ses fr\u00e8res survivants et les enfants d'aucun de ses fr\u00e8res susnomm\u00e9s, d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9, par souche et suivant l'ordre des Successions. Je donne cependant \u00e0 aucun de mes enfants qui d\u00e9c\u00e9derait sans laisser d'enfants, le droit de l\u00e9guer par testament, \u00e0 son \u00e9pouse la vie durant de cette derni\u00e8re en gardant viduit\u00e9, la jouissance des biens \u00e0 lui pr\u00e9sentement l\u00e9gu\u00e9s.\nJe veux et entends et c'est une clause expresse de mon pr\u00e9sent Testament que les biens meubles et immeubles, ainsi que les fruits, revenus et int\u00e9r\u00eats de ces dits biens pr\u00e9sentement l\u00e9gu\u00e9s \u00e0 mes enfants ci-dessus nomm\u00e9s ou petits enfants, leur soient propres, qu'ils ne fassent partie d'aucune communaut\u00e9 de biens; de plus que ces dits biens et les fruits, revenus et int\u00e9r\u00eats de ces dits biens soient insaisissables par aucun des cr\u00e9anciers de mes enfants ci-dessus nomm\u00e9s et petits-enfants, leur \u00e9tant donn\u00e9s \u00e0 chacun d'eux \u00e0 titre d'aliments et de pension alimentaire, cependant la pr\u00e9sente clause n'aura en aucune mani\u00e8re effet d'emp\u00eacher mes petits-enfants de vendre, hypoth\u00e9quer ou autrement ali\u00e9ner leur part dans les biens de ma Succession.\nPar la clause 8 de son testament, le testateur a nomm\u00e9 son fils Joseph Aubertin ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire, et a \u00e9tendu ses pouvoirs au del\u00e0 de l'an et jour, et lui a donn\u00e9 l'autorisation de vendre et de disposer de l'actif de sa succession.\nParmi cet actif dont le testateur \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire \u00e0 son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, se trouvaient les 7\/10 d'un lot de terre, situ\u00e9 dans la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al et portant le num\u00e9ro 3607 du plan officiel et du livre de renvoi de la paroisse de Montr\u00e9al. Les autres 3\/10 du lot en question appartenaient \u00e0 trois des fils du testateur, Joseph, Paul et Albert Aubertin.\nPar acte authentique en date du 27 ao\u00fbt 1937, l'ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire et les h\u00e9ritiers ont vendu \u00e0 la compagnie Canada Packers Limited une partie du lot 3607 ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9, pour le prix de $12,000 comptant. Le 1er f\u00e9vrier 1939, la Canada Packers Limited a institu\u00e9 des proc\u00e9dures judiciaires contre les vendeurs et contre tous les appelants dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, et a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 le paiement de la somme de $1,157.80 pour taxes d'\u00e9glise affectant le lot 3607, que la Canada Packers Limited avait pay\u00e9es avec subrogation, et avec les conclusions hypoth\u00e9caires sur la balance du lot 3607 non vendue et appartenant encore \u00e0 la succession du testateur Alexandre Aubertin. Cette action a \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9e par la succession, mais a \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenue par jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure rendu par l'honorable Juge Louis Cousineau le 21 d\u00e9cembre 1939. Un bref d'ex\u00e9cution a en cons\u00e9quence \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mis le 12 avril 1940, \u00e0 la r\u00e9quisition de Canada Packers Limited, et le r\u00e9sidu de ce lot 3607 appartenant \u00e0 la succession, a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi pour satisfaire le jugement rendu. Les appelants actuels ont, le 31 mars 1940, produit une opposition \u00e0 fin de charges dans laquelle ils ont conclu que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 soit vendue par le sh\u00e9rif, sujette aux droits des opposants comme \"nus propri\u00e9taires\". Cette opposition a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e par jugement rendu par l'honorable Juge Surveyer le 9 octobre 1940, pour le motif que les opposants \u00e9taient parties \u00e0 l'action, et l'appel \u00e0 la Cour du Banc du Roi qui a suivi ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 subs\u00e9quemment abandonn\u00e9. Le 12 septembre 1940, la partie du lot saisie a \u00e9t\u00e9 vendue par le sh\u00e9rif et adjug\u00e9e \u00e0 la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, l'intim\u00e9e dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, pour la somme de $3,300.\nOn voit donc par les termes du testament dont j'ai reproduit les parties essentielles et n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la d\u00e9termination de cette cause, que le testateur a laiss\u00e9 \u00e0 ses quatre fils Joseph, Albert, Paul et Raoul la jouissance et usufruit de tous ses biens meubles et immeubles pour leur vie durant, sans \u00eatre tenus de faire inventaire. Quant \u00e0 la nue propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des biens affect\u00e9s \u00e0 l'usufruit, il l'a donn\u00e9e et l\u00e9gu\u00e9e aux enfants de ses quatre fils n\u00e9s et \u00e0 na\u00eetre en l\u00e9gitimes mariages. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 stipul\u00e9 que les biens ainsi l\u00e9gu\u00e9s devaient \u00eatre partag\u00e9s entre les enfants des quatre usufruitiers par souche suivant l'ordre ordinaire des successions, apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9c\u00e8s du dernier des enfants du testateur.\nIl s'agit de savoir, dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, si ce testament a cr\u00e9\u00e9 un usufruit ou s'il a cr\u00e9\u00e9 une substitution fid\u00e9icommissaire. Evidemment, s'il s'agit d'un usufruit, les droits des parties ont \u00e9t\u00e9 purg\u00e9s par la vente du sh\u00e9rif le 12 septembre 1940, mais s'il s'agit au contraire d'une substitution, alors, en vertu des termes de l'art. 781 du Code de proc\u00e9dure civile, le d\u00e9cret aurait purg\u00e9 tous les droits r\u00e9els, sauf la substitution non ouverte \u00e0 cette date.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'il s'agissait d'une substitution non ouverte, et que l'action institu\u00e9e par les pr\u00e9sents appelants \u00e9tait bien fond\u00e9e, qu'en cons\u00e9quence la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al n'avait pas un titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 absolu et parfait sur l'immeuble vendu par le sh\u00e9rif, que le droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al \u00e9tait sujet \u00e0 caducit\u00e9 en faveur des demandeurs appel\u00e9s \u00e0 la substitution cr\u00e9\u00e9e par le testament de feu Alexandre Aubertin, enregistr\u00e9 contre ledit immeuble. La Cour du Banc de la Reine 3 a adopt\u00e9 une opinion contraire. Elle a renvers\u00e9 ce jugement, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il s'agissait d'un legs d'usufruit en faveur des quatre fils Aubertin, qu'il ne s'agissait nullement d'une substitution, et que les demandeurs-appelants n'avaient pas le droit de demander que l'immeuble poss\u00e9d\u00e9 par la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9 affect\u00e9 d'une substitution en leur faveur et qu'\u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, si telle substitution existait, elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 purg\u00e9e par la vente du sh\u00e9rif \u00e0 cause des dispositions de l'art. 959 du Code Civil, qui dit que: \"Les jugements intervenus en faveur des tiers contre le grev\u00e9 ne peuvent \u00eatre attaqu\u00e9s par les appel\u00e9s sur le motif de la substitution, si on les a mis en cause \u2026\"\nJe partage les vues de la Cour du Banc de la Reine, car je vois clairement dans les termes m\u00eames du testament tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments essentiels \u00e0 la constitution d'un usufruit. On sait que l'usufruit est le droit de jouir des choses dont un autre a la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, comme le propri\u00e9taire lui-m\u00eame, mais \u00e0 la charge d'en conserver la substance: C.C. 443. Le legs en usufruit constitue un d\u00e9membrement de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, car le droit de l'usufruitier qui en est un de jouissance, comporte seulement le droit d'utiliser la chose et d'en recueillir les fruits, mais non celui de disposer de cette chose. L'usufruitier a, en cons\u00e9quence, le jus utendi et le jus fruendi, mais est priv\u00e9 du jus abutendi. Il n'a pas la pl\u00e9nitude du droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, qui ne se compl\u00e9tera que par la fin de l'usufruit en faveur du nu propri\u00e9taire.\nL'usufruit comporte simultan\u00e9ment une double lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9, prenant effet au m\u00eame moment, soit la jouissance pour l'usufruitier, et la nue propri\u00e9t\u00e9 pour l'autre b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire. Les lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9s ne comportent pas d'ordre successif. Dans la substitution fid\u00e9icommissaire, au contraire, celui qui re\u00e7oit une chose est charg\u00e9 de rendre cette chose, soit \u00e0 son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, soit \u00e0 un autre terme. La substitution fid\u00e9icommissaire est en effet une disposition par laquelle, en gratifiant quelqu'un express\u00e9ment ou tacitement, on le charge de rendre la chose qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e, ou une autre chose \u00e0 un tiers que l'on gratifie en second ordre: Thevenot D'Essaule no. 7. Il n'y a donc pas de lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 simultan\u00e9e, soit la jouissance d'un bien \u00e0 une personne et la nue propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 une autre en m\u00eame temps. Il y a bien, comme le dit Mignault, vol. 5, p. 8, deux lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9s, mais d'ordre successif, et il existe aussi un trait de temps entre la jouissance des grev\u00e9s et l'ouverture de la substitution, quand l'appel\u00e9 aura la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des biens.\nEn vertu de l'art. 928 du Code civil, il est bien vrai qu'une substitution peut exister quoique le terme d'\"usu-fruit\" ait \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9 pour exprimer le droit du grev\u00e9. C'est d'apr\u00e8s l'ensemble de l'acte et l'intention qui s'y trouve suffisamment manifest\u00e9e, plut\u00f4t que d'apr\u00e8s l'acceptation ordinaire de certaines expressions, qu'il est d\u00e9cid\u00e9 s'il y a ou non substitution.\nDans le cas qui est soumis \u00e0 la consid\u00e9ration de cette Cour, il me semble clair d'apr\u00e8s les termes du testament, qu'il y a eu en premier lieu une double lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 simultan\u00e9e, soit la jouissance des biens aux quatre fils Joseph, Albert, Paul et Raoul Aubertin, et en m\u00eame temps, en vertu du paragraphe 6 de son testament, le testateur a donn\u00e9 et l\u00e9gu\u00e9 la nue propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des biens ci-dessus l\u00e9gu\u00e9s \u00e0 ses petits-enfants, soit les enfants des quatre fils ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9s, n\u00e9s et \u00e0 na\u00eetre en l\u00e9gitimes mariages. Tous ces biens doivent \u00eatre partag\u00e9s entre les enfants de Joseph, Albert, Paul et Raoul Aubertin par souche suivant l'ordre ordinaire des successions, et le partage ne doit \u00eatre fait qu'apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9c\u00e8s du dernier des quatre fils ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9s. Il n'y a pas d'ordre successif qui est cr\u00e9\u00e9, comme il n'y a pas davantage de trait de temps entre le droit de chacun des l\u00e9gataires. S'il y avait une substitution, il faudrait voir dans les termes du testament, et a d\u00e9faut de pr\u00e9cisions satisfaisantes, par l'ensemble de l'acte et l'intention qui s'y trouve manifest\u00e9e par le testateur, un ordre successif, c'est-\u00e0-dire des lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9s successives, et un trait de temps qui est essentiel \u00e0 la substitution.\nEn d'autres termes, l'usufruit est un droit r\u00e9el limit\u00e9 \u00e0 la vie de son titulaire auquel il permet de se servir d'une chose appartenant \u00e0 autrui et d'en prendre les fruits, sans en alt\u00e9rer la substance ni en modifier la destination:\nCapitant, \"Vocabulaire Juridique\" p. 488.\nC'est pourquoi dans l'usufruit il y a deux lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9s simultan\u00e9es, la jouissance \u00e0 un, la nue propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 un autre, tandis que la substitution, pour employer l'expression de Pothier (\u0152uvre de Pothier vol. 8, p. 455), est une disposition que l'on fait de ses biens au profit d'un autre par le canal d'une personne interpos\u00e9e que l'on charge de remettre \u00e0 cet autre. Comme le dit M. le Juge L. P. Demers dans la cause de Gauthier v. L'Hon. M. Wilson et al. et Antigna 4:\nCe qui caract\u00e9rise la substitution, c'est que le testateur fait pour ainsi dire le testament de chacun des grev\u00e9s quant aux biens donn\u00e9s.\nDans le cas de substitution, les biens passent d'une personne \u00e0 une autre mais non pas dans le cas d'usufruit. L'appel\u00e9 n'a nullement la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, mais la re\u00e7oit par l'interm\u00e9diaire d'un grev\u00e9 qui est charg\u00e9 de la lui remettre. Ce n'est qu'\u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, \u00e0 l'ouverture de la substitution, que l'appel\u00e9 recevra la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la chose. Les mots \"nue propri\u00e9t\u00e9\" comportent \u00e0 mon sens l'id\u00e9e d'un usufruit, \u00e0 moins que le contraire n'apparaisse, car dans le cas de substitution le droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'appel\u00e9 ne na\u00eetra qu'\u00e0 la mort du grev\u00e9. Dans le cas qui nous occupe, il n'y a rien de semblable. Seul le partage se fait \u00e0 la mort du dernier des fils, de tous les biens dont les petits-fils avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nPour ces raisons, et celles donn\u00e9es par la Cour du Banc de la Reine, je suis d'avis de rejeter le pr\u00e9sent appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, appellants: Pager & Pager, Montreal.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Choquette & Berthiaume, Montreal.\n1 [1956] Que.

Marcoux, [1957] S.C.R. 650\nDate: 1957-10-01\nRichard Foley (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nOvila Marcoux (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n*1957: May 24, 27; **1957: October 1.\n*Present: Taschereau, Rand, Cartwright, Fauteux and Nolan JJ.\n**Nolan J. died before the delivery of judgment.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nInfants\u2014Automobile taken by minor son of owner\u2014Whether father liable for injury resulting from minor's negligence\u2014No allegation of minority in action taken against father\u2014Minor not pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 of his father\u2014Civil Code, arts. 1053, 1054\u2014The Motor Vehicles Act, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 142, s. 53.\nWhen, in an action against a father for damages caused by his minor son while driving his father's car with permission, there is no allegation of the minority of the son and it is admitted that the son was not the pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 of his father, the latter cannot be held responsible under art. 1054 C.C. But his responsibility will be engaged under art. 1053 C.C. if it is proved that he was negligent in permitting his son to take his car.\nThe defendant's son, aged 18 years, took his father's automobile and negligently struck and injured the plaintiff's minor daughter. The son did not have specific permission to use the car on this occasion but had a continuing and standing permission to use it for his own purposes whenever he wished to do so. He used a piece of wire to start the car, as the keys were in his father's possession, but to the knowledge of his father he had used a similar device previously. The liability of the father was maintained by the trial judge and by a majority in the Court of Appeal.\nHeld (Rand J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed. The father was guilty of a fault of omission in not exercising a proper supervision and 'control over the driver. It is not sufficient to give instructions, one must see that they are followed.\nIf the defendant is responsible under art. 1053 C.C. because of his negligence, he is a fortiori responsible under the Motor Vehicles Act which creates a presumption against him.\nRand J., dissenting, agreed with Martineau J. that the defendant had proved that the damages suffered by the plaintiff's daughter were not the result of his fault. .\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec 1, affirming the judgment at trial. Appeal dismissed.\nS. D. Rudenko, Q.C., for the defendant, appellant.\nC. A. S\u00e9guin, Q.C., for the plaintiff, respondent. The judgment of Taschereau, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by\nTaschereau J.::\u2014Les circonstances suivantes ont donn\u00e9 naissance \u00e0 cet appel. Le 2 juillet 1950, la voiture automobile de l'appelant Richard Foley \u00e9tait conduite par son fils Richard Foley jr. et, dans la paroisse de St-Gr\u00e9goire le Grand, district d'Iberville, a frapp\u00e9 la fille mineure de l'intim\u00e9 es-qualit\u00e9, qui circulait \u00e0 bicyclette sur la route r\u00e9gionale Iberville-Farnham. La victime a subi des blessures graves, et l'intim\u00e9 a en cons\u00e9quence r\u00e9clam\u00e9, tant personnellement qu'en sa qualit\u00e9 de tuteur \u00e0 son enfant mineure, la somme de $75,000 contre Richard Foley p\u00e8re et Richard Foley fils, conjointement et solidairement.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, pr\u00e9sid\u00e9e par M. le Juge C. E. Ferland, a accueilli l'action contre Richard Foley p\u00e8re, pour la somme de $26,843.81, mais elle l'a rejet\u00e9e contre le fils, parce qu'au moment de l'assignation ce dernier \u00e9tait mineur. La Cour du Banc de la Reine 2 a rejet\u00e9 l'appel log\u00e9 seulement par Richard Foley p\u00e8re. M. le Juge Martineau dissident, aurait maintenu l'appel et rejet\u00e9 l'action. Ici, comme en Cour d'Appel, il n'est pas question de l'action qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9e contre le fils.\nLa veille de l'accident en question, c'est-\u00e0-dire le samedi 1er juillet, Richard Foley fils, avec l'un de ses fr\u00e8res ainsi que Jules Poliquin et Real Cousineau, avaient pass\u00e9 la soir\u00e9e avec d'autres amis, dans le garage de Richard Foley p\u00e8re, et il est en preuve qu'ils avaient bu ensemble plusieurs bouteilles de bi\u00e8re. Vers onze heures ce soir-l\u00e0, le fils prit la voiture de son p\u00e8re et, en compagnie de Cousineau et Poliquin, ils se rendirent tous trois dans le district d'Iberville, o\u00f9 ils pass\u00e8rent la nuit. Le lendemain matin, soit le dimanche suivant, les trois jeunes voyageurs se rendirent dans un h\u00f4tel local, o\u00f9 ils absorb\u00e8rent encore des liqueurs alcooliques. Ils quitt\u00e8rent l'h\u00f4tel vers 11.30 heures de l'avant-midi, et l'accident s'est produit vers midi. Apr\u00e8s l'accident, Richard Foley fils et ses compagnons ont quitt\u00e9 les lieux sans porter secours \u00e0 la victime; ils cach\u00e8rent l'automobile dans une cour dans la ville d'Iberville, et ils ont continu\u00e9 leur route vers Montr\u00e9al, sauf Richard qui est demeur\u00e9 \u00e0 St-Jean, et qui apr\u00e8s, est retourn\u00e9 \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al et s'est cach\u00e9 sous une tente, o\u00f9 la police l'a retrouv\u00e9. Au jour fix\u00e9 pour l'enqu\u00eate, ce dernier \u00e9tait d\u00e9tenu dans la prison commune de Bordeaux, o\u00f9 il a purg\u00e9 une sentence d'emprisonnement.\nIl ne fait aucun doute que cet accident est d\u00fb \u00e0 la faute de Richard Foley fils, qui conduisait la voiture. Le juge au proc\u00e8s en vient \u00e0 la conclusion qu'il conduisait d'une mani\u00e8re imprudente, dangereuse et quasi criminelle, dans une courbe, et \u00e0 une vitesse ill\u00e9gale. D'ailleurs, devant la Cour du Banc de la Reine, la question de n\u00e9gligence dans la conduite de l'automobile n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e, et elle ne l'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 davantage devant cette Cour.\nDans son plaidoyer, Richard Foley p\u00e8re all\u00e8gue que c'est sans permission que le fils a pris son automobile la veille de l'accident, qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas son pr\u00e9pos\u00e9, qu'il a bien \u00e9lev\u00e9 son fils, lui a donn\u00e9 les soins d'\u00e9ducation que doit donner un bon p\u00e8re de famille \u00e0 ses enfants, et a veill\u00e9 sur lui avec soin et diligence.\nDans l'action, la minorit\u00e9 du fils n'est pas all\u00e9gu\u00e9e, et elle ne l'est pas davantage dans le plaidoyer de Foley p\u00e8re. Cette absence d'all\u00e9gation exclurait par cons\u00e9quent l'application de l'art. 1054 C.C., qui est \u00e0 l'effet que le p\u00e8re est responsable du dommage caus\u00e9 par son fils mineur, mais cette responsabilit\u00e9 que la loi pr\u00e9sume a lieu seulement lorsque le p\u00e8re ne peut prouver qu'il n'a pu emp\u00eacher le fait qui a caus\u00e9 le dommage.\nDans la cause de Alain v. Hardy 3, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que si le p\u00e8re d\u00e9montre la comp\u00e9tence de son fils mineur pour conduire une automobile, qu'il \u00e9tait porteur d'une licence apr\u00e8s avoir pass\u00e9 les examens requis, qu'il \u00e9tait un chauffeur comp\u00e9tent, ayant une assez longue exp\u00e9rience, qu'il n'est pas adonn\u00e9 aux liqueurs alcooliques, qu'il \u00e9tait assidu \u00e0 son travail et prudent dans la conduite des v\u00e9hicules automobiles, il repousse la pr\u00e9somption cr\u00e9\u00e9e par l'art. 1054.\nMais ce n'est pas ainsi dans la pr\u00e9sente cause que le d\u00e9bat s'est engag\u00e9, vu les all\u00e9gations de la contestation \u00e9crite. Comme il est \u00e9tabli que le fils n'\u00e9tait pas le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 de son p\u00e8re, ce dernier ne peut de ce chef \u00eatre tenu civilement responsable, sous l'empire de l'art. 1054 C.C Si dans l'occurrence il y a responsabilit\u00e9 du p\u00e8re, c'est donc en vertu de l'art. 1053 C.C., mais alors, le fardeau de la preuve repose normalement sur le demandeur, et c'est \u00e0 lui qu'incombe de prouver une faute imputable au d\u00e9fendeur. Ainsi, ce sera pour lui une faute qui engagera sa responsabilit\u00e9, de pr\u00eater sa voiture automobile \u00e0 un chauffeur incomp\u00e9tent, d'\u00eatre n\u00e9gligent dans le choix de la persone qui doit la conduire (culpa in eligendo).\nIl n'y a pas dans la d\u00e9claration d'all\u00e9gation de faute de cette nature, mais le d\u00e9fendeur a voulu d\u00e9montrer qu'il n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 coupable de cette n\u00e9gligence qui pouvait lui \u00eatre reproch\u00e9e, et c'est ainsi que le d\u00e9bat s'est engag\u00e9. Comme le dit M. le Juge Bissonnette, avec qui je m'accorde:\nAinsi donc, telle que li\u00e9e, la contestation ne permettait pas \u00e0 la d\u00e9fense de recourir \u00e0 la preuve de l'exon\u00e9ration d\u00e9coulant du deuxi\u00e8me alin\u00e9a de l'art. 1054 C.C. Mais parce qu'elle a tent\u00e9 cette preuve, la demande pouvait la combattre et, comme ceci se faisait sans objections de part et d'autre, l'intim\u00e9 peut tirer avantage de tous faits repr\u00e9hensibles prouv\u00e9s contre l'appelant en raison de sa conduite fautive \u00e0 l'endroit de son fils, non pas cependant sous la force de l'article 1054, mais sur celle de l'article 1053 CC.\nDans sa d\u00e9fense, Richard Foley p\u00e8re plaide entre autres qu'il n'est pas en faute, que son fils a \u00e9t\u00e9 bien \u00e9lev\u00e9, qu'il lui a donn\u00e9 tous les soins d'entretien et d'\u00e9ducation qu'un bon p\u00e8re de famille doit donner \u00e0 ses enfants, qu'il lui a toujours prodigu\u00e9 de bons conseils. Dans sa r\u00e9ponse, le demandeur all\u00e8gue que le d\u00e9fendeur savait d'ailleurs que son fils \u00e9tait imprudent, mais il lui confiait r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement l'usage de son automobile, sans \u00e9gard aux risques qu'il encourait ainsi. L'appelant aurait donc pr\u00eat\u00e9 sa voiture \u00e0 son fils, malgr\u00e9 que ce dernier f\u00fbt imprudent, et ne se pr\u00e9occupait nullement des cons\u00e9quences pr\u00e9visibles.\nComme le signale M. le Juge Bissonnette, il est tr\u00e8s possible que cette all\u00e9gation de la r\u00e9ponse soit ill\u00e9gale, mais l'objection, je crois, est tardive et irrecevable, parce que non seulement l'appelant n'en a pas demand\u00e9 le rejet, mais il a, dans sa r\u00e9plique, li\u00e9 contestation sur icelle. La preuve a \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9e au dossier sans objection, et ce n'est pas la fonction de cette Cour de se soucier maintenant de cet incident de proc\u00e9dure.\nIl r\u00e9sulte donc que si Foley p\u00e8re a commis une faute en pr\u00eatant sa voiture \u00e0 un conducteur dont la comp\u00e9tence n'offrait pas la garantie n\u00e9cessaire de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, sa responsabilit\u00e9 sera engag\u00e9e en vertu de l'art. 1053 C.C. La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le, et c'est la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle en est arriv\u00e9 le juge au proc\u00e8s, que le fils d\u00e9tenait un permis pour conduire une automobile avec le consentement \u00e9crit de son p\u00e8re, et que ce dernier avait donn\u00e9 \u00e0 son fils la permission de se servir de la voiture \u00e0 volont\u00e9, pour ses fins personnelles, sans demander aucune autorisation pr\u00e9alable. Il n'est pas contest\u00e9 que le soir en question, Foley p\u00e8re avec madame Foley \u00e9taient dans la maison, et que dans le garage en arri\u00e8re de la cour, o\u00f9 se tenait une r\u00e9union pour c\u00e9l\u00e9brer le retour d'un jeune Foley arriv\u00e9 d'Afrique, plusieurs personnes \u00e9taient r\u00e9unies. Apr\u00e8s que la r\u00e9union eut pris fin, Foley fils prit la voiture de son p\u00e8re, et comme je l'ai signal\u00e9 d\u00e9j\u00e0, en compagnie de Cousineau et Poliquin, ils se rendirent dans le district d'Iberville, pour y voir un autre ami du nom de Perron. Comme Foley p\u00e8re \u00e9tait all\u00e9 se coucher assez \u00e0 bonne heure, il avait laiss\u00e9 sa voiture dans la cour de la maison, vu que le garage \u00e9tait occup\u00e9, et avait gard\u00e9 les cl\u00e9s avec lui, de sorte que personne normalement ne pouvait se servir de la voiture sans lui demander les cl\u00e9s. Au lieu d'aller \u00e9veiller son p\u00e8re pour les lui demander, afin de se rendre \u00e0 Iberville, Foley fils \u00e9tablit le contact dans la voiture, dont les portes n'\u00e9taient pas ferm\u00e9es \u00e0 cl\u00e9, au moyen d'un fil de plomb, et c'est ainsi qu'il r\u00e9ussit \u00e0 d\u00e9marrer.\nJe crois que la n\u00e9gligence de Foley p\u00e8re a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, et que sa faute en est une d'omission, vu qu'il n'a pas exerc\u00e9 la surveillance voulue dans le choix du conducteur. Il n'est pas suffisant pour se disculper de la responsabilit\u00e9 civile, de donner des instructions, mais encore faut-il voir \u00e0 ce que ces instructions soient observ\u00e9es. Dans le cas actuel, il y a \u00e0 mon sens certainement eu une d\u00e9ficience de ce c\u00f4t\u00e9. Le fils qui n'avait que 18 ans et qui, en cons\u00e9quence, devait \u00eatre surveill\u00e9 davantage, avait la permission de se servir de la voiture quand il le voulait. Malgr\u00e9 que ce f\u00fbt le p\u00e8re qui gardait les cl\u00e9s, il savait que son fils faisait usage de la voiture pour entreprendre des randonn\u00e9es nocturnes, sans demander les cl\u00e9s. Il est clair que ce dernier devait donc n\u00e9cessairement, au cours de ces occasions, faire d\u00e9marrer la voiture au moyen d'un fil de plomb, comme il l'a fait le soir de l'accident. L'appelant \u00e9tait satisfait que l'automobile f\u00fbt de retour le matin afin qu'il puisse s'en servir lui-m\u00eame. Voici ce qu'il dit \u00e0 ce sujet dans son t\u00e9moignage:\nQ. Did he ever before take your car at night without permission, nor asking you for the keys?\nA. Yes a few times, but as long as the car was there in the morning I did not mind him taking the car.\nLe soir en question, l'appelant savait ou devait savoir que de la bi\u00e8re se consommait dans la cour et dans le garage, pour c\u00e9l\u00e9brer le retour de l'autre fils, et que les jeunes gens dont son fils mineur, absorbaient en assez grande quantit\u00e9 des liqueurs alcooliques. Au lieu d'exercer la vigilance requise qui s'imposait dans une semblable occasion, l'appelant est all\u00e9 se coucher, et a laiss\u00e9 \u00e0 la jeunesse la libert\u00e9 dont elle a profit\u00e9, avec le r\u00e9sultat malheureux que l'on conna\u00eet.\nL'appelant nous dit qu'il avait les cl\u00e9s avec lui, dans sa chambre. Mais il ne pouvait pas ignorer, \u00e0 cause des exp\u00e9riences pass\u00e9es et de la tol\u00e9rance bienveillante qu'il manifestait, qu'il \u00e9tait facile pour Richard fils de se servir quand m\u00eame de la voiture. C'est donc une grave faute d'omission que l'appelant a commise, et il doit en subir toutes les cons\u00e9quences qui d\u00e9coulent de la loi.\nL'article 53 de la Loi des V\u00e9hicules-Moteurs, S.R.Q. 1941, c. 142, ne peut pas \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9 davantage comme fin de non recevoir. Si, comme je le crois, l'appelant est responsable en vertu de l'art. 1053 C.C., parce que sa faute a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, a fortiori l'est-il en vertu de la Loi des V\u00e9hicules-Moteurs qui cr\u00e9e une pr\u00e9somption contre lui.\nPour les raisons ci-dessus je suis donc d'opinion que l'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nRand J. :\u2014For the reasons given by Martineau J. in the Court of Queen's Bench 4, I would allow the appeal and dismiss the action with costs throughout.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, Rand J. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the plaintiff, respondent: Stanislas Poulin, St. Jean, Quebec.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Rudenko & Gross, Montreal.\n1 [1957] Que.

After execution of the contract, payment in full of the purchase\u2011price and delivery to the plaintiffs of an authority to the custodian to release or ship the machines, the plaintiffs sent a carrier to collect them but before the carrier was able to obtain possession the defendant withdrew the goods from sale and returned the cheque given by the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs sued for damages for breach of contract.\nHeld: The plaintiffs could not succeed. The word \u201cdelivered\u201d in the contract imported an actual physical delivery out of the possession of the custodian, and since this had not taken place the defendant was entitled to withdraw the machines; there was no room for construing the contract contra proferentem. Nor, in view of the positive terms of the condition, could it be said that the defendant was estopped by the conduct of its employee from asserting that there had not been delivery; there was nothing in the record to show that the employee was authorized by the defendant to waive its right to enforce the condition.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiffs from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming a judgment of Barlow J.[2] The facts are fully stated in the reasons for judgment of the Courts below and for purposes of this report may be briefly summarized as follows:\nThe plaintiffs entered into a contract with the defendant corporation for the purchase of five tractor crawlers which were at that time at the United States Naval Station at Argentia, Newfoundland. These machines were surplus goods which the defendant was authorized to sell on behalf of the Government of the United States. The contract of sale, which was executed by both parties on May 17, 1955, was expressly made subject to \u201cgeneral conditions of sale\u201d, under no. 1 of which the defendant corporation was entitled \u201cto withdraw from the sale any property which has not been delivered to the Purchaser\u201d.\nOn execution of the contract the plaintiffs obtained from the defendant written authority to the custodian to release or ship the tractors, and they then instructed a carrier in Newfoundland to collect them for the plaintiffs. Before the carrier was able to obtain possession of the machines, they were withdrawn from sale by the defendant pursuant to instructions received from the United States.\nThe plaintiffs were advised on May 24, 1955, by G.L. Wood, who had negotiated with them on behalf of the defendant, that the sale was \u201ccancelled under clause no. 1, general conditions of sale\u201d and the cheque given by them to the defendant was returned.\nThe plaintiffs sued for damages for breach of contract but the action was dismissed at trial and on appeal.\nG.E. Beament, Q.C., and R.B. Hutton, for the plaintiffs, appellants.\nD.S. Maxwell, for the defendant, respondent.\nAt the conclusion of the argument, judgment was delivered orally dismissing the appeal with costs. The reasons of Kerwin C.J. and Locke, Cartwright and Abbott JJ.* were delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014At the conclusion of the argument on behalf of the appellants we dismissed this appeal with costs, without calling upon counsel for the respondent. We are of opinion that there is no ambiguity in clause 1 of the \u201cgeneral conditions of sale\u201d, reading as follows:\n1. Crown Assets Disposal Corporation (hereinafter referred to as \u201cThe Corporation\u201d) reserves the right to withdraw from the sale any property which has not been delivered to the Purchaser without incurring any liability except to refund to the Purchaser any amount paid on account of such property.\nWe agree with the Court of Appeal that \u201cdelivered\u201d means actual delivery out of the possession of the custodian, i.e., the U.S. Naval Station Supply Department, Argentia, Newfoundland. There is, therefore, no room for the application of the doctrine contra proferentem and none of the decisions relied upon by the appellants in that connection applies.\nIn view of the positive terms of the condition, the argument that the respondent was estopped by the conduct of. its employee Wood from asserting that there had not been delivery cannot be supported. There is nothing in the record to sustain a contention that Wood was authorized in any manner to waive on behalf of the respondent the right to enforce the condition.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, appellants: Beament, Fyfe & Ault, Ottawa.\nSolicitor for the defendant, respondent: D.S. Maxwell, Ottawa.\n[1] [1956] O.R. 930, 5 D.L.R. (2d) 572.\n[2] [1956] O.W.N. 489, 3 D.L.R. (2d) 156.\n* Nolan J. died before the delivery of the reasons.\n",

After various mesne conveyances, a certificate of title was issued on July 11, 1929, bearing a rubber stamp endorsement \"Minerals Included\". On October 4, 1949, the then owner of the lands conveyed them to transferees to whom a certificate of title was issued with the same endorsement. On January 29, 1951, these owners executed a transfer of a one-half interest in the mines and minerals to the appellant company and a certificate of title was issued to the appellant on February 12, 1954. The respondent had filed a caveat on October 9, 1953, on behalf of Her Majesty in the right of the Province against the registration of any instrument affecting title to the minerals. The appellant then proceeded by way of originating notice to determine the title to the minerals.\nHeld: The caveat must be withdrawn. The appellant had a title good as against all persons, including the Crown, to the mines and minerals conveyed to it by the transfer of .1951. Whatever might be said as to the position before the Province of Saskatchewan acquired its natural resources in 1930, the effect of the certificates issued after that date and bearing the endorsement \"Minerals Included\" was conclusive on a proper reading of ss. 66, 67 and 200(1) of The Land Titles Act.\nPer Rand, Locke, Cartwright and Nolan JJ. : The mistake made in endorsing the certificate did not result in a \"wrong description of boundaries or parcels\" within the meaning of s. 200(1). Canadian Pacific Railway Co. Ltd. et al. v. Turta et al, [1954] S.C.R. 427, applied.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan 1 affirming a judgment of Doiron J.2. Appeal allowed.\nE. C. Leslie, Q.C., for the applicant, appellant.\nRoy S. Meldrum, Q.C., and Jule G. Gebhart, for the respondent.\nRand J. :\u2014The administration of lands by the Dominion in what is now the Province of Saskatchewan up to September 1, 1905, the date of the erection of the Province, was, for the purposes here, under The Dominion Lands Act, R.S.C. 1886, c. 54, and The Land Titles Act, 1894 (Can.), c. 28. By 4-5 Ed. VII, c. 42, the constituting Act, the ungranted public lands and reserved interests in granted lands were retained by the Dominion to be administered in the interest generally of Canada. By s. 16 all laws and regulations then in force were continued as if the Act had not been passed, but subject to be repealed or amended by Parliament or Legislature according to the authority of each.\nThe Province, by c. 24 of its statutes of 1906, enacted The Land Titles Act which, by s. 204, was to come into force upon the repeal, so far as it was applicable to lands within the Province, of The Land Titles Act, 1894. This repeal was effected by order in council dated July 23, 1906, under the authority of 4-5 Ed. VII (Can.), c. 18, and became final on September 8, 1906, the date of its last publication in the Canada Gazette. From that date, therefore, the provincial Land Titles Act applied to lands granted thereafter by the Dominion, the letters patent for which were forwarded direct to the provincial registrars of land titles. The distinction so indicated between the proprietary interests of the Dominion and their administration and the regulatory-jurisdiction of the Province over its own as well as the proprietary interests of private persons becomes significant to the resolution of the controversy here presented.\nThe interests retained by the Dominion, whether in the form of reservations or exceptions in the grant or in escheat or forfeiture (and apart from cases of grants of less than fee simple), were beyond the operation of provincial law; they were property of Canada and under s. 91 of the British North America Act within the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of Parliament. It is not suggested that any statutory provision of Parliament subjected them, by way of adoption, to the operation of the provincial Land Titles Act; and they were thus, after September 8, 1906, unaffected by any registration enactment.\nThis remained the situation until October 1, 1930, when The Saskatchewan Natural Resources Act , 1930 (Can.), c. 41, came into force. By its provisions and those of the agreement which it ratified, all interests of the Dominion in and connected with lands within the Province other than those which were to continue to be administered by the Dominion under the various heads of s. 91 of the federation Act, were transferred to the Province.\nAs of April 1, 1930, the provincial Legislature passed The Administration of Natural Resources (Temporary) Act, 1930, c. 12 of the statutes of that year. By s. 2 the provisions of certain Dominion statutes, including The Dominion Lands Act, enumerated in a schedule, so far as they dealt with matters within provincial authority, were continued in force. Broad powers of repeal and substitution and for making regulations were conferred on the Lieutenant Governor in council ; and the setting up of a Department to administer the transferred resources was authorized.\nThe effect of these enactments was that the transferred interests passed under the control of the Province as of October 1, 1930, and that the only legislation then applicable was that of the continued provisions of the Dominion Lands Act enabling their administration and the provincial Land Titles Act of 1906 as amended. The Provincial Lands Act, 1931 (Sask.), c. 14, and The Mineral Resources Act, 1931 (Sask.), c. 16, became effective on August 15 of that year. Between October 1, 1930, and that date, what was the standing of the title to mineral rights so transferred in relation to The Land Titles Act? The Province had become in effect the owner of minerals reserved in original Dominion grants, the remaining interests in which, speaking generally, were held under certificates of title authorized by the provincial statute which contained provisions subjecting the interests of the Crown to certain effects of the declarations of title contained in the certificates. Did the transferred interest in reservations thereupon become subject to what are now ss. 67 and 200 of The Land Titles Act, R.S.S. 1953, c. 108, in the same manner and to the same extent as if the grants had been made originally by the Province, for example, between October 1, 1930, and March 11, 1931?\nSection 67 deals with a certificate as an instrument of title in its descriptive aspect, as in an abstract; and in addition to express registrations for which provision is made by the statute, the certificate impliedly tabulates certain interests to which the title certified is declared to be subject. That, as a provincial instrument, it can and should exempt from its descriptive inclusion an interest reserved to the Crown in the original grant whenever and by whomever made, seems to me to be obvious. Its purpose is to furnish a true and correct specification of the estate or interest in land of which the statute affirms a definitive legal ownership in the holder, to distribute by enumeration the total interests of the fee simple with all burdens and subtractions however they arise. This function is to be distinguished from that of those sections which declare the legal effect of that description in relation to conflicting sources of interests or titles.\nThe clause in the first paragraph of s. 67, \"unless the contrary is expressly declared\", likewise goes to a descriptive purpose and is unobjectionable. When the operative efficacy of s. 200, on which the trust company rests its claim, is extended to clause (a) of s. 67, however, a further consideration must be taken into account. As already mentioned, a reservation in a grant by and subsisting in the Dominion cannot be affected by such a provision as s. 200. But when that reserved interest comes within the administration of the Province, a different situation is presented, in the examination of which a distinction must be made between a grant, say, of minerals to an individual and an administrative transfer, as in 1930, to the Province. If, for example, between June 11, 1929, when the certificate in this case was issued to the tax purchaser, and October 1, 1930, the Dominion Government had granted the minerals to A, would the prior certificate with its endorsement \"Minerals Included\" have prevailed over that issued upon the later grant? I should say not, because as the Dominion Crown was not bound by the provincial Act, its grant could not be nullified as from the moment of its issue. If a similar situation had arisen before September 5, 1905, while the Act of 1894 was in force, a different question would have been presented, calling, in my opinion, for a different answer.\nBut after October 1, 1930, there is the coincidence in the Province of both the administrative control of the minerals and the subjection of the Crown to the statute, as would have been the case of the Dominion between 1894 and September 1, 1905; and although a grant of the minerals by the Dominion to an individual could not be defeated by provincial law, a transfer of administrative powers over Crown interests to the Province can be nullified by an instrument given appropriate efficacy by provincial legislation. If the certificate issued in 1949 containing the same endorsement as in those of 1911 and 1929, \"Minerals Included\", would supersede the prior vested interests of the Province, uncertified, as I think it would, I can see no escape from attributing the same effect after October 1, 1930, to the certificate of 1929 or its predecessor of 1911. Once ownership, as it may be called, of the Province arises, the statute applies automatically, \"every certificate\" shall be \"conclusive evidence \u2026 as against Her Majesty\", and no subsequent date can be fixed as marking the point of producing that result. It is as if on November 1, 1930, the Province for the first time enacted s. 200; the same coincidence would arise with the same effect, just as in the case of a subsisting reservation made before 1894 at the moment of the enactment of s. 57, the forerunner of s. 200. If the certificate of 1949 had been issued on October 2, 1930, would the result have been different? I do not think so. What, then, do ss. 67 and 200 provide as binding the I provincial Crown?\nSection 67 had its prototype in s. 56 of the Act of 1894 and to the end of clause (a) is identical in its language; the subsequent clauses have been somewhat modified in their terms and some particulars have been added to the class of interests which generally they cover ; but essentially the two sections deal with the same matters and serve the same purpose, a purpose already elaborated. The phrase \"unless the contrary is expressly declared\", the vital phrase, does not mean the logical converse of the affirmative \"shall be subject to\"; it is not that the express declaration should, for example, be \"This certificate is not subject to subsisting reservations in the original grant from the Crown\"; that would involve a self-contradiction. The reservations may still remain in the Crown or may have been granted, and in the latter case they would be embodied in a certificate. What the section provides for as a contrary declaration is express language to the effect that the content of the land described and certified as owned by the holder includes a specific interest that, in the grant, may have been reserved. The interest is to be \"subsisting\"; if the reservation no longer subsists as such in the Crown, its subject-matter must have become merged in or released from the estate declared by the certificate, or have been disposed of by grant. There might, of course, have been nothing reserved. The important consideration is that the implication of the declaration or specific inclusion, that the reservation is no longer \"subsisting\", may be erroneous.\nThen s. 200 enters: the certificate is to be conclusive against Her Majesty as well as all other persons. \"Subject to the exceptions and reservations implied under the provisions of this Act\" must mean, when related to s. 67, as they are to be interpreted along with the clause providing the \"declaration to the contrary\". And here arises the question of what is meant by being \"under the Act\" where \"land\" is defined to include \"any interest\". It means either that the interest has been embodied in a certificate or that, by the language of the statute, it has been drawn within the operation of provisions declaring the conclusiveness of a certificate. If the reservation of an interest in the original grant by a Province remains for all purposes outside of and unaffected by the statute, the \"declaration to the contrary\" is read out of s. 67, and clause (a) serves the purpose only of a notice that it is excluded absolutely from the certificate. But the other clauses have not that purpose: they are concerned with interests which are created outside of the Act, which, but for the enumeration, would be overridden by the certificate, but which by an \"express declaration to the contrary\" can be defeated. I cannot see how, in the light of s. 200, a distinction is to be made between them; and if one can be overridden by a declaration, so can all. The necessary implication of the clause, then, is that the interest of the Province arising from a reservation in an original provincial grant can be bound by such a declaration in a certificate.\nIt follows that s. 67(a) provides for a descriptive title in a certificate in priority to subsisting Crown reservations made in original grants by either Government, and by force of s. 200 this is as operative against the Province when the reserved interest has been transferred to it by the Dominion as when the reservation has been made by itself.\nIs there, then, under s. 200, a case of \"wrong description of boundaries or parcels\"? The judgment of this Court in Canadian Pacific Railway Co. Ltd. et al. v. Turta et al.3, held that similar language in the Alberta Act did not embrace the omission of a reservation of mines and minerals in a certificate and the same result must follow from the improper inclusion of such an interest.\nNor can it be claimed for the Crown that it holds a prior \"certificate of title granted under this Act\". The language of s. 35 of the Act of 1894 in which the folio in the land titles office is spoken of as \"constituted by the existing grant or certificate of title of such land\" was retained in s. 45 of the statute of 1906, but in s. 37 of R.S.S. 1909, c. 41, the words \"grant or\" were omitted. This puts it beyond doubt that these instruments are not equivalents and that the registered grant does not by itself constitute a statutory title under the Act to the interests reserved to the Crown. Apart from an express legislative declaration of an indestructible paramount title, the provincial Crown is in the position of not being able, except by means of a prior certificate or caveat, to protect its reservations from the operation of s. 200.\nThis interpretation is supported by the general intendment of the statute which treats a grant in fee simple as the controlling interest and the reservations as incidental. By subjecting the Crown to the operation of ss. 67 and 200, the disposal of the fee draws those interests within the effects of error which the statute contemplates and which it subordinates to the legal declaration of ownership contained in the certificate.\nThe purpose of the new system of land titles was declared in its first enactment as The Territories Real Properties Act, 1886 (Can.), c. 26, as being\nto give certainty to the title to estates in land in the Territories and to facilitate the proof thereof, and also to render dealings with land more simple and less expensive.\nIn the light of that language the Crown has bound itself with the subject to the conclusiveness of the certificate. This cannot be restricted to land which, in the sum total of interests, has been granted out of the Crown, because the reservations within s. 67(a) must have been made in the original grant and still subsist in the Crown. And where the language of that clause and of the qualifying declaration is in such general terms, the basic purpose of the statute becomes pertinent to the interpretation. The same pertinency exists in relation to s. 200.\nThere remains the question of the effect upon ss. 67 and 200 of The Provincial Lands Act, now R.S.S. 1953, c. 45, and The Mineral Resources Act, now R.S.S. 1953, c. 47, including their amendments. The former, by s. 10, provides that in every disposition of provincial lands the reservations provided for by that Act, The Mineral Resources Act, and others shall be implied. \"Disposition\" is defined in s. 2(4) as\nthe act of disposal or an instrument by which that act is effected or evidenced, and includes a Crown grant, order in council, transfer, assurance, lease, licence, permit, contract or agreement and every other instrument whereby lands or any right, interest or estate in land may be transferred, disposed of or affected, or by which the Crown divests itself of or creates any right, interest or estate in land. Section 3 of The Mineral Resources Act declares that mines and minerals \"shall be leased or otherwise disposed of only in accordance with the provisions\" of that Act and regulations made under it. The word \"disposition\" is given the same meaning as in The Provincial Lands Act.\nThese provisions co-exist with those of The Land Titles Act and a reconciliation must be made if their language permits it. The former deal with the act or instrument of the Crown disposing of its interests; but it is not by such an act or instrument that the effects of ss. 67 and 200 are brought about; it is by the force of an act of the Legislature ; and once an interest of the Crown becomes bound by the conclusiveness of a certificate, that legal result is untouched by those two statutes. If that were not so, the submission by the Crown to ss. 67 and 200 would be limited to interests embodied in certificates of title, which would render s. 67(a) meaningless and reduce s. 200 to cases in which the Crown, by dealing in land already brought under certificate, would be bound by that fact alone.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal, set aside the judgments below, and direct the removal from the certificate of the caveat registered on October 9, 1953, as B.G. 5418. There will be no costs.\nKellock J.:\u2014The question at issue in this appeal concerns the title to certain mines and minerals reserved to the, Crown in the right of Canada by a patent of July 29, 1909, by which the lands, apart from the minerals, were granted to one Burrows. The latter registered his grant on September 2, 1909, and on the same day received a certificate of title under the provincial Land Titles Act, 1906, c. 24. By various mesne conveyances the title of Burrows became vested in one Schindler, to whom a certificate of title was issued on June 11, 1929, which certificate had endorsed upon it, by means of a rubber stamp, the words \"Minerals Included\". On October 4, 1949, Schindler executed a transfer in favour of Joseph and Carl Guber, the predecessors in title of the appellant, to whom a certificate of title was issued on October 29, 1949, bearing the same endorsement.\nUltimately, on January 29, 1951, the Gubers executed a transfer of an undivided one-half interest in the mines and minerals to the appellant, to whom a certificate of title was issued on February 12, 1954. In the meantime, on March 13, 1951, a caveat had been registered by the appel lant, followed on October 9, 1953, by a caveat filed by the respondent on behalf of Her Majesty in the right of the Province against the registration of any instrument affecting title to the said minerals. The present proceedings were brought by the appellant by way of originating notice to determine the mineral title.\nDoiron J., the judge of first instance, gave effect to the caveat filed on behalf of the respondent, and ordered cancellation of the certificate of title issued to the appellant, as well as deletion of the endorsement on the certificate of title issued to the Gubers. An appeal by the present appellant was dismissed by the Court of Appeal, Culliton J.A. dissenting.\nIt is common ground that The Land Titles Act, R.S.S. 1953, c. 108, recognizes the registrability of an estate in fee simple in minerals as a subject-matter of distinct ownership, and while the appellant admits that the minerals were never granted by the Crown, it is contended that in dealing with the Gubers with respect to the minerals, the appellant relied and was entitled to rely upon the certificate of title issued to them and that such certificate was \"conclusive evidence as against Her Majesty\" that they had title by virtue of ss. 67 and 200(1) of The Land Titles Act.\nThe appellant further submits that by reason of the express terms of s. 200(1), the Crown is bound by the statute and that the endorsement is an express declaration within the meaning of s. 67, which provides that:\n67. The land mentioned in any certificate of title granted under this Act shall by implication and without any special mention therein, unless the contrary is expressly declared, be subject to:\n(a) any subsisting reservations or exceptions contained in the original grant of the land from the Crown; \u2026\nIt is therefore argued that it is not competent to the respondent to assert that there is any \"subsisting\" reservation of minerals in the Crown. The argument involves the contention that, although the original grant was from the Dominion, title to the reserved minerals passed to the Province under the Natural Resources Agreement of 1930, before the issue of the Guber certificate, and that therefore, although the endorsement could not operate as a declaration to the contrary with respect to the reservation so long as it was in favour of the Dominion, the Province became precluded by the certificate of title and the operation of s. 200 from asserting any interest in the minerals immediately upon the Natural Resources Agreement becoming effective.\nIn the reference Re Transfer of Natural Resources to the Province of Saskatchewan 4, the effect of the 1930 legislation was considered. At pp. 275-6 Newcombe J., who delivered the judgment of the Court, said:\nIt is not by grant inter partes that Crown lands are passed from one branch to another of the King's government; the transfer takes effect, in the absence of special provision, sometimes by Order in Council, sometimes by despatch. There is only one Crown, and the lands belonging to the Crown are and remain vested in it, notwithstanding that the administration of them and the exercise of their beneficial use may, from time to time, as competently authorized, be regulated upon the advice of different Ministers charged with the appropriate service. I will quote the words of Lord Davey in Ontario Mining Company v. Seybold, [1903] A.C. 73, at 79, where his Lordship, referring to Lord Watson's judgment in the St. Catherines Milling Case (1888), 14 App. Cas. 46, said\n\"In delivering the judgment of the Board, Lord Watson observed that in construing the enactments of the British North America Act, 1867, 'it must always be kept in view that wherever public land with its incidents is described as 'the property of' or as 'belonging to' the Dominion or a province, these expressions merely import that the right to its beneficial use or its proceeds has been appropriated to the Dominion or the province, 'as the case may be, and is subject to the control of its legislature, the land itself being vested in the Crown.' Their Lordships think that it should be added that the right of disposing of the land can only be exercised by the Crown under the advice of the Ministers of the Dominion or province, as the case may be, to which the beneficial use of the land or its proceeds has been appropriated, and by an instrument under the seal of the Dominion or the province.\"\nAccordingly, the minerals here in question remained throughout vested in the Crown, having been and having remained reserved by the original patent. It was \"the administration of them and the exercise of their beneficial use\" only which was affected. The reservation in the original patent, therefore, remained a subsisting reservation as well after as before the Natural Resources Agreement.\nFor reasons which will appear, I do not find it necessary to decide as to the contention of the appellant that the endorsement became effective as against the Province immediately upon the coming into force of the agreement. Unquestionably, immediately prior to that date the endorsement could have no such effect. I do not think it can be doubted either, that a conveyance by the Dominion would have entitled the grantee to obtain registration of his title notwithstanding the outstanding certificate held by Schindler. To hold the contrary would render virtually nugatory the interest of the Dominion in the minerals by making that interest incapable of realization. It may be that the passing to the Province of the interest of the Dominion in 1930 did not disentitle the Province to registration, but, as I have said, I do not find it necessary, in the present circumstances, to decide the point.\nThe situation existing on the date when the agreement became effective did not continue. In 1949 there occurred the transfer from Schindler to the Gubers, to whom a certificate of title was issued with the endorsement \"Minerals Included\". That certificate was issued after the mineral title had been vested in the Province, and the appellant acquired its interest in the lands in reliance upon it. It is to these circumstances that The Land Titles Act is to be applied.\nThe respondent contends in the first place that the declaration contemplated by s. 67 is a statutory one. In my opinion, however, the section is not so limited. A declaration in the certificate itself is sufficient.\nThe respondent further contends that the words \"Minerals Included\" are employed in the Land Titles Office in practice only in cases where, in fact, no reservation of minerals at all is contained in the original Crown grant, and that they are inapt as a declaration that a reservation of minerals made in the original grant no longer subsists. I am unable to accept this contention. If the words are capable of the meaning that the original patent did not include a grant of the minerals, s. 200(1) would entitle the appellant to rest on that statement even although the original patent had contained such a reservation. The Province would not be entitled to assert the contrary. The words are, however, in my opinion, equally capable of the construction that the mineral title, although originally reserved, had been subsequently granted by the Dominion or by the Province after the latter had acquired it. In either circumstance the appellant would again be protected.\nAs applied to the certificate of title granted to the Gubers, under which the appellant claims, s. 200(1) plainly provides that it is a complete estoppel against the Province with respect to the express statement which it contains, namely, that the person named in the certificate is entitled to the minerals as against the Province. A person dealing with the lands on the footing of such a certificate would be entitled to assume as against the Province that both the surface rights and the minerals had been granted by the Crown at some earlier stage. This being so, it is not open to the respondent to contend that the minerals had never been brought under the Act.\nIt is, however, further contended for the respondent that by virtue of The Provincial Lands Act, now R.S.S. 1953, c. 45, and The Mineral Resources Act, now R.S.S. 1953, c. 47, enacted by the Legislature subsequent to the Natural Resources Agreement of 1930, the provincial title was protected. In my opinion this point can be put most forcibly from the standpoint of the respondent by reference to s. 3 of The Mineral Resources Act, 1931, c. 16, in the form in which it was enacted in 1939 by c. 14, s. 1, which was prior to the acquisition of any interest by the Gubers. The section reads:\n3. Mines and minerals which are the property of the Crown, and the right of access thereto, shall be leased or otherwise disposed of only in accordance with the provisions of this Act and the regulations made thereunder.\nWhile the verb \"dispose\" in s. 3 is not defined, the noun \"disposition\" is defined by s. 2(4) of The Provincial Lands Act, 1931, c. 14, (which The Mineral Resources Act by s. 2(3) adopts) as meaning, unless the context otherwise requires, the \"act\" of disposal or \"an instrument by which that act is effected or evidenced\" and includes \"every other instrument whereby lands or any right, interest or estate in land may be transferred, disposed of or affected\".\nWhile I was at first inclined to the view that the contention of the respondent upon the footing of this legislation was well founded, I now do not think that is so. In view of the clear terms of s. 200(1) of The Land Titles Act and the purpose of that statute, the appellant and other persons dealing with the Gubers were entitled to rely on the certificate, including the endorsement, and to assume that there had been a grant of the minerals.\nI do not think the decision of this Court in The District Registrar of the Land Titles District of Portage La Prairie v. Canadian Superior Oil of California Ltd. and Hiebert 5, is relevant. In that case the certificate of title contained a reference to the reservation in the original grant, and it was held by the majority of this Court that the relevant legislation required that grant to be read as reserving the minerals\nNor do I think there is anything in the decision of this Court in Balzer and Balzer v. The Registrar of Moosomin Land Registration District et al.6, which is relevant to the case at bar. That was the case, merely, of an application by a transferee of land to strike out an endorsement on his certificate of title where there was no opposing interest, and where there was no suggestion that any other person had acquired any rights on the faith of the endorsement or any prior endorsement to the same effect.\nI would allow the appeal. By agreement there will be no costs.\nThe judgment of Locke and Nolan JJ. was delivered by\nLocke J.:\u2014The patent granted to T. A. Burrows for the north-west quarter and the west half of the north-east quarter of section 6 in township 36, range 17, west of the second meridian in Saskatchewan, dated July 29, 1909, reserved to the Crown, inter alia, all mines and minerals which might be found to exist therein.\nSection 21 of The Saskatchewan Act, 1905 (Can.), c. 42, reserved all Crown lands, mines and minerals and royalties incident thereto in the Province to the Crown in the right of the Dominion.\nUpon the filing of these letters patent in the appropriate registration district, Burrows became entitled to a certificate of title by reason of the provisions of s. 49 of The Land Titles Act, 1906 (Sask.), c. 24. That section, with an alteration which is immaterial to the present matter, appeared as s. 41 of c. 41 in the revision of the statutes in 1909.\nThe certificate issued to Burrows was not made part of the material upon the application but, according to the abstract filed, it was issued on September 2, 1909, and it is common ground that it was in the form prescribed by the statute which appears as Form E in the statute of 1906. That form certifies that the named person is the owner of the estate described in the property in question \"subject to the incumbrances, liens and interests notified by memorandum underwritten or indorsed hereon, or which may hereafter be made in the register\". No reference as to the reservation of minerals was contained in or endorsed upon the certificate, this being unnecessary by virtue of s. 76 of the Act which, so far as it is relevant, read:\nThe land mentioned in any certificate of title granted under this Act shall, by implication and without any special mention therein unless the contrary is expressly declared therein be subject to:\n(a) Any subsisting reservations or exceptions contained in the original grant of the land from the crown \u2026\nBurrows transferred the north-west quarter of section 6 to the Luse Land Company Limited by a transfer registered on September 7, 1909, a certificate of title issuing to the company which contained no reference to minerals. That company transferred the lands to one Alexander by a transfer registered on June 5, 1911, and on that date a certificate of title issued to the transferee. At some unspecified time that certificate was endorsed \"Minerals Included\", these words being placed upon the certificate by a rubber stamp, immediately following the description of the land, and it appears to have been assumed throughout that this endorsement was made by or on the direction of the Registrar for the Humboldt Land Registration District. That the endorsement was made on that certificate prior to June 11, 1929, appears certain from the fact that in 1926 the land was sold for arrears of taxes and title was thereafter obtained by the tax sale purchaser, Thomas F. Schindler, by whom an application for title which resulted in the issue of the new certificate was filed on November 24, 1928. The new certificate was dated June 11, 1929, and endorsed in the same manner, \"Minerals Included\", presumably at the time it was issued. The title was in this state when an agreement between the Dominion of Canada and the Province of Saskatchewan P was made dated March 20, 1930, whereby the natural resources were surrendered to the Province. That agreement was confirmed by The Saskatchewan Natural Resources Act , 1930 (Can.), c. 41. In view of an argument which has been addressed to us as to the effect of this statute, it should be noted that para. 1 of the agreement, which was confirmed read in part:\n\u2026 the interest of the Crown in all Crown lands, mines, minerals (precious and base) and royalties derived therefrom within the Province, and all sums due or payable for such lands, mines, minerals or royalties, shall from and after the coming into force of this agreement and subject as therein otherwise provided, belong to the Province \u2026\nThus, the mines and minerals reserved to the Crown in the letters patent thereafter, in the words of the agreement \"belonged\" to the Province of Saskatchewan.\nWhen The Land Titles Act was first enacted as 1906 (Sask.), c. 24, s. 180 which appeared with a group of sections under the sub-heading \"Evidence and Procedure\" read:\n180. Every certificate of title granted under this Act shall except:\n(a) In case of fraud wherein the owner has participated or colluded; and\n(b) As against any person claiming under a prior certificate of title granted under this Act in respect of the same land; and\n(c) So far as regards any portion of the land by wrong description of boundaries or parcels included in such certificate of title so long as the same remains in force and uncancelled under this Act;\nbe conclusive evidence in all courts as against His Majesty and all persons whomsoever that the person named therein is entitled to the land included in the same for the estate or interest therein specified subject to the exceptions and reservations implied under the provisions of this Act.\nIn 1917 the Act was repealed and re-enacted as c. 18 of the second session of that year, subs. 1 of s. 174 being in the same terms.\nThe question whether the Crown in the right of the Dominion might have asserted its right to the minerals on the property in question as against Schindler does not arise. The section, it will be noted, does not purport to do anything more than to enact as a rule of evidence that no one, including the Crown, may be heard to dispute the title of the owner named in the certificate, except in certain specified cases. It is in effect an estoppel by statute. If it were necessary to determine the matter, it would be my opinion that no such estoppel would have operated as against the Crown in the right of the Dominion.\nFollowing the transfer of the natural resources pursuant to the agreement of 1930, the Province passed The Provincial Lands Act, 1931 (Sask.), c. 14, and The Mineral Resources Act, 1931 (Sask.), c. 16. These Acts now appear as cc. 45 and 47, respectively, of R.S.S. 1953. As it is contended that the provisions of these statutes affect the question to be determined, their terms must be considered.\nBy The Provincial Lands Act provision was made as to the manner in which lands forming part of the natural resources of the Province might be disposed of. The word \"disposition\" appearing in the statute is defined as meaning the act of disposal or an instrument by which that act is effected or evidenced and to include, inter alia, a Crown grant and every other instrument whereby lands or any right, interest or estate in lands may be transferred or disposed of, or by which the Crown divests itself of or creates any estate or interest in lands. By s. 8 it is provided that provincial lands shall be sold in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the orders and regulations made thereunder. Section 10 provides that there shall be implied in every disposition of provincial lands under the Act or any other Act of the Legislature all reservations provided for in the Act and, inter alia, The Mineral Resources Act. Section 14 declares that there is reserved to the Crown out of every disposition of provincial lands under the Act all mines and minerals, whether solid or liquid or gaseous, and that all mines and minerals existing on or under provincial lands shall be disposed of in the manner provided by The Mineral Resources Act and regulations made thereunder.\nThe Mineral Resources Act defines the word \"mineral\" in a manner including petroleum and natural gas and, by s. 3, provides that mines and minerals the property of the Crown shall be disposed of only in accordance with the provisions of the Act. The word \"disposition\" is defined as meaning a disposition as defined in The Provincial Lands Act.\nNothing was done by the Province from the time of the transfer of the natural resources in 1930 up to the time of the commencement of these proceedings to dispose of or 'alienate the minerals on the lands in question, the status of these remaining as it was at the time of the issue of the Crown grant to Burrows, save that the beneficial interest of the Dominion had, as stated, been transferred to the Province.\nOn October 29, 1949, a transfer from Schindler to Joseph and Carl Guber was registered in the Humboldt Land Titles Office and, on that date, a certificate of title issued endorsed in like manner with the words \"Minerals Included\".\nOn January 29, 1951, the Gubers executed a transfer in favour of the appellant of an undivided one-half interest in all mines and minerals, except coal, upon or under the quarter-section for valuable consideration, and on March 13, 1951, the trust company filed a caveat giving notice of its interest. By caveat filed on October 9, 1953, the Registrar gave notice on behalf of Her Majesty in right of the Province of a claim to ownership of the minerals. On February 12, 1954, a certificate of title issued to the trust company pursuant to the transfer from the Gubers, this being made subject to the Registrar's caveat.\nThat the Gubers and the trust company were purchasers for value without notice of any adverse claim to the minerals is admitted.\nThe provisions of The Land Titles Act which affected the rights of the parties did not differ at any relevant time from the terms of the statute as it appears in the Revised Statutes of 1953 and it will be convenient to refer to the sections as they there appear. Section 66 provides that:\nThe owner of land for which a certificate of title has been granted shall hold the same subject, in addition to the incidents implied by virtue of the Act, to such encumbrances, liens, estates or interests as are endorsed on the folio of the register which constitutes the certificate of title, absolutely free from all other encumbrances, liens, estates or interests whatever, except in case of fraud wherein he has participated or colluded and except the estate or interest of an owner claiming the same land under a prior certificate of title as mentioned in section 200.\nThe implied reservations, including those contained in the original grant from the Crown, which appeared as s. 76 of the statute of 1906 now appear as s. 67 in the Revised Statutes.\nSection 180 of the Act of 1906 is now, with an addition which does not affect the present matter, s. 200. In view of the provisions of ss. 66, 67 and 200, which must be read together, a person purchasing lands or an interest in land from one who has a clear certificate of title issued under the provisions of The Land Titles Act may not safely rely upon a search of the certificate alone, since he is charged with the knowledge that it is issued subject, inter alia, to any subsisting reservations or exceptions contained in the original grant from the Crown, unless the contrary is expressly declared. In the present matter, where the Prudential Trust company was interested only in the purchase of an interest in the mineral rights, it was, in my opinion, entitled to rely upon the statement on the face of the certificate that the title included minerals. The terms used were explicit and their meaning free from doubt. In my opinion, the fact that a search of the patent granted to Burrows would have disclosed the reservation does not assist the respondent.\nSection 200 declares that the certificate of title and the duplicate certificate shall be conclusive evidence of the title of the person named therein, except, inter alia, as to \"any portion of the land by wrong description of boundaries or parcels included in such certificate\". I mention this since, as the transfer from the Luse Land Company Limited to Alexander conveyed the land alone without any reference to minerals, to describe the interest of Alexander and subsequent transferees as including the minerals might appear to be a wrong description of the parcel of land to which they were entitled as owners. In my opinion, however, this point is concluded as against the Crown by the decision of this Court in Canadian Pacific Railway Co. Ltd. et al. v. Turta et al.7.. I see no distinction in this respect between cl. (c) of s. 200(1) and s. 44 of the Alberta statute considered in that case.\nI am further of the opinion that the provisions of The Provincial Lands Act and The Mineral Resources Act do not assist the position of the Crown. It is true that the joint effect of these statutes is to provide that lands and mineral rights which are included in the statutory definition of land in the former statute may be disposed of only in the manner provided. The \"disposition\" defined in The Provincial Lands Act, as an examination of that statute and The Mineral Resources Act discloses, is a disposition by the Crown in right of the Province, and there is no suggestion that any such disposition is involved in the present matter The appellant's case is simply that by virtue of the provisions of s. 200 the Province is estopped from asserting its claim to the minerals.\nThe word \"land\" is defined in s. 2(10) of The Land Titles Act as meaning land and every estate or interest therein and mines, minerals and quarries thereon or thereunder. The interest of the Crown in the minerals in question was, therefore, land in respect of which presumably a certificate of title might have issued under the provisions of the Act at the instance of the Crown. Section 85 of The Land Titles Act, which first appeared as s. 78a of The Land Titles Act of 1938 (c. 20) which repealed the former statute, provides that where a certificate of title is, on the coming into force of the Act, registered in the name of the Crown or is thereafter registered in the name of Her Majesty in the right of the Province of Saskatchewan and includes the mines and minerals which may be found to exist therein, no transfer by the Crown of such land shall include such mines or minerals which remain vested in the Crown. So long as the title to the minerals in question remained in the Crown in the right of the Dominion, no patent was issued in respect of them and nothing done to make such interest subject to The Land Titles Act. As indicated, at least since 1938, a certificate of title might have issued to the Crown in the right of the Province upon its application but that has not been done.\nFor the respondent, it is contended that ss. 66 and 200 relate only to certificates of title issued in respect of land which has been brought under the Act, either on application by the owner named in the letters patent pursuant to ss. 33 et seq. in the case of lands for which patents issued from the Crown prior to January 1, 1887, or by the filing of the original letters patent with the Registrar which entitled the owner under s. 48 to the grant of a certificate of title under the provisions of the Act. If this argument could be sustained, neither of these sections could affect the rights of the Province in the circumstances described. The contention amounts to this, that s. 200 should be construed as if it read:\nEvery certificate of title and duplicate certificate granted under this Act for land which is then or has theretofore been brought under the Act shall, except:\u2014\nor to that effect. Section 66 and the concluding sentence of s. 183 would, of necessity, be construed in the same manner.\nWith respect for differing opinions, I think this construction cannot be supported.\nConsidering s. 200 by itself, it is stated that the certificate and duplicate certificate referred to are conclusive evidence that the person named is entitled to the land included in the same for the estate or interest specified, subject to the exceptions named. Land is defined in subs. 10 of s. 2 as meaning, inter alia, lands of every nature and description and every estate or interest therein. The section is not restricted by its own terms to land which has been brought under the Act but includes an estate or interest granted by letters patent.\nThat this is the proper interpretation is further supported by the language in which the exceptions are expressed. Thus, where a Registrar has been induced by fraud to issue a certificate of title for land theretofore not subject to the Act, the construction contended for would make exception (a) inapplicable. In the same manner, where, by wrong description of boundaries or parcels, land which had not been brought under the Act and for which the existing root of title was a grant from the Crown, or land the title to which remains in the Crown, is included in the certificate, cl. (c) would not apply. Nothing in the language of the section itself excludes the application of (a) and (c) to such cases.\nIf the history of s. 200 and of the other sections whose construction would be affected if this contention of the Crown were upheld is considered, it appears to me to be fatal to the argument.\nSection 200, which appeared as s. 180 when The Land Titles Act of Saskatchewan was first enacted in 1906, was not original drafting but was apparently taken, though not verbatim, either from s. 62 of The Territories Real Property Act, 1886 (Can.), c. 26, which came into force on January 1, 1887, or from s. 62 of The Real Property Act of Manitoba, enacted as c. 28 of the statutes of 1885, which came into force on July 1 of that year.\nThe Manitoba section read in part:\nEvery certificate of title granted under this Act, when duly registered, shall (except in case of fraud wherein the registered owner shall have participated or colluded) so long as the same remains in force and uncancelled under this Act, be conclusive evidence at law and in equity as against Her Majesty and all persons whomsoever, that the person named in such certificate is entitled to the land included in such certificate, for the estate or interest therein specified, subject to the exceptions and reservations mentioned in section 61, except as far as regards any portion of land that may by wrong description of boundaries or parcels be included in such certificate when the holder of such certificate is neither a purchaser or mortgagee for value, nor the transferee of a purchaser or mortgagee for value, and except as against any person claiming under any prior certificate of title granted under this Act in respect of the same land \u2026\nSection 61, so far as it was relevant, was in the same terms as the present Saskatchewan s. 67.\nAt the time The Real Property Act was enacted in Manitoba, the root of the title of all lands in the hands of private owners, with some exceptions such as in the case of the Hudson's Bay Company, was a grant from the Crown by letters patent under the provisions of The Dominion Lands Act. The reference, therefore, to \"land that may by wrong description of boundaries or parcels be included in such certificate\" could not have been intended to be only such land as had been brought under the provisions of The Real Property Act. There was no such land on July 1, 1885. The fraud referred to in the case of the first certificate of title issued in respect of the lands could only, of necessity, have referred to fraud in obtaining a certificate for lands held under what was and continues to be known in Manitoba as the old system.\nThe same situation existed in the territory which now constitutes the Provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta and the North-West Territories when The Territories Real Property Act was passed by Parliament. As has been pointed out, the same language, with variations which do not affect the question, was contained in s. 62 and, at the time that statute was passed, there were no lands in this territory which were subject to any Land Titles Act. The Act did not, of course, apply to the Province of Manitoba. Since it is, therefore, apparent that the certificate of title referred to in the section in the Manitoba Act and that of the Dominion Act referred to certificates granted in respect of lands which were held by letters patent from the Crown as well as to those which became subject to the Act, I can see no logical reason for giving a different meaning to the same language in s. 200 of the present Saskatchewan Act.\nIt may be noted that the present s. 66 of the Saskatchewan statute, which appeared as s. 75 in the Act of 1906, was apparently taken from s. 60 of The Territories Real Property Act, though an important term of the section in that statute was omitted. As s. 66 of the Saskatchewan Act now reads, the owner of land for which a certificate of title has been granted shall hold the same, subject to the named exceptions, free of all other encumbrances, except in case of fraud wherein he has participated or colluded and except the estate or interest of an owner claiming under a prior certificate of title as mentioned in s. 200. The section in the Dominion statute contained the further exception of \"land that is, by wrong description of parcels or of boundaries, erroneously included in the certificate of title\". The reason for the omission is not apparent but, as s. 66 must be read in conjunction with ss. 183 and 200, the matter is not of importance. Nothing in s. 66 or s. 75 of the statute of 1906 nor s. 60 of The Territories Real Property Act lends any support to the view that the land for which the certificate of title mentioned has been issued includes only land which has been brought under the operation of the Act.\nIn my opinion, further light is thrown upon the matter by an examination of s. 183. By that section, it is provided that no action of ejectment or other action for the recovery of land for which a certificate of title has been granted shall lie against the owner under this Act, except in the case of, inter alia, a person deprived of land by fraud as against the person who through such fraud has been registered as owner, or as against a person deriving title otherwise than as a transferee bona fide for value from or through such owner through fraud, a person deprived of or claiming any land included in any grant or certificate of title of other lands by misdescription of such other land or of its boundaries as against the owner of such other land, and an owner claiming under an instrument of title prior in date of registration where two or more grants or certificates of title have been registered or issued in respect of the same land. The section concludes:\n(2) In any case other than the above, the production of the duplicate certificate of title or a certified copy of such certificate shall be an absolute bar and estoppel to any such action against the person named in such certificate as owner of the land therein described.\nThere is nothing in the section which qualifies or restricts the meaning to be assigned to the word \"land\", so that the definition in the statute applies.\nThis s. 183 appeared as s. 147 of the Act of 1906. That section appears to have been taken from s. 103 of The Territories Real Property Act. That section, in turn, appears to have been taken from s. 116 of the Manitoba Act, after deleting words which limited the right by providing that it was not available as against a bona fide purchaser for value.\nThe Manitoba Act was based largely upon the Real Property Act of the Province of South Australia, which appeared as c. 11 of the statutes of that Province in the year 1860. The section of that Act from which, obviously, the Manitoba section was taken is s. 118. The reference to misdescription, however, read:\nin the case of a person deprived of any land by reason of a wrong description of any land or of its boundaries.\nSection 116(5) of the Manitoba Act and s. 103(e) of the Territories Real Property Act referred to \"the case of a person deprived of or claiming any land included in any grant or certificate of title of other land by misdescription of such other land or of its boundaries\". The reason for the changed wording would appear to be that both in Manitoba and in the North-West Territories the title to some of the lands would continue to be letters patent, and, as to others, certificates of title which, for the first time, were authorized. It was apparently thought necessary to refer both to grants and to certificates of title to make it clear that, if land held in either manner was included by misdescription in a certificate of title issued under the Act, the right reserved to the real owner might be enforced by ejectment. The rights reserved by s. 200(c) are not, of course, limited to lands the title to which is either letters patent or certificates of title but include lands as to which no Crown grant has been made and title to which accordingly remains in the Crown.\nIn my opinion, the judgment of this Court in Balzer and Balzer v. The Registrar of Moosomin Land Registration District et al.8, does not assist the position of the respondent. That case did not involve the rights of third parties purchasing the lands in good faith or the application of ss. 66 and 200 of The Land Titles Act, as was pointed out in the judgment of Kellock J. In the circumstances of that case, the lack of authority of the Registrar to endorse a certificate with the words \"minerals in the Crown\" was decisive. In the present case, where title has been acquired by a purchaser in good faith and without notice, effect cannot be given to that objection in view of the decision in Turta's Case, supra.\nI would allow this appeal and direct that the registration of the caveat filed by the Registrar be vacated. By agreement between the parties, no costs should be awarded.\nCartwright J.:\u2014The relevant facts are set out in the reasons of other members of the Court and in those of the learned justices in the Courts below. Those reasons make it clear that the Crown in the right of Saskatchewan never parted with the title to the minerals within, upon or under the quarter-section in question, which became vested in it as of October 1, 1930, pursuant to statutes of Saskatchewan, 1930, 20 Geo. V, c. 87, and 1931, 21 Geo. V, c. 85, statutes of Canada, 1930, 20-21 Geo. V, c. 41, and 1931, 21-22 Geo. V, c. 51, and the statute of the United Kingdom 1930, 20-21 Geo. V, c. 26, having been previously vested in the Crown in the right of Canada.\nThere remains for consideration the submission that, notwithstanding the fact that the Crown never parted with these minerals, the appellant has acquired an indefeasible title to an undivided one-half interest therein by reason of the fact that it purchased the same from Joseph Guber and Carl Guber relying upon the certificate of title issued to them on October 29, 1949. Section 200(1) of The Land Titles Act, R.S.S. 1953, c. 108, is as follows:\n200.\u2014(1) Every certificate of title and duplicate certificate granted under this Act shall, except:\n(a) in case of fraud wherein the owner has participated or colluded; and\n(b) as against any person claiming under a prior certificate of title granted under this Act in respect to the same land; and\n(c) so far as regards any portion of the land by wrong description of boundaries or parcels included in such certificate of title;\nbe conclusive evidence, so long as the same remains in force and uncancelled, in all courts, as against Her Majesty and all persons whomsoever, that the person named therein is entitled to the land included in the same for the estate or interest therein specified, subject to the exceptions and reservations implied under the provisions of this Act.\nI did not understand counsel to suggest that any of the exceptions (a), (b), or (c) have application in the circumstances of this case.\nAs a matter of construction I think it clear that the Gubers' certificate of title in terms certifies that they are the owners not only of \"the surface\" of the quarter-section but also of the minerals in and under it. To hold otherwise would be to give no effect to the words \"Minerals Included\". It is argued for the respondent that, even if this is the proper construction of the words of the certificate, the appellant's case is not advanced because its title is \"subject to the exceptions and reservations implied under the provisions of this Act\", which, under s. 67(a) include, unless the contrary is expressly declared, \"any subsisting reservations or exceptions contained in the original grant of the land from the Crown\".\nNo doubt when the appellant purchased from the Gubers, whether or not it examined the original grant from the Crown, it took subject to the reservation therein contained reading as follows:\n\u2026 reserving all mines and minerals which may be found to exist within, upon or under such lands, together with full power to work the same, and for this purpose to enter upon, and use and occupy the said lands or so much thereof and to such an extent as may be necessary for the effectual working of the said minerals, or the mines, pits, seams and veins containing the same \u2026\nunless it can be said that \"the contrary\" was \"expressly declared\". In my opinion the contrary was expressly declared in the certificate which, construed as I have concluded it should be, stated in terms that the minerals were included in the Gubers' title. The certificate is \"conclusive evidence \u2026 in all courts as against Her Majesty and all persons whomsoever\"; and, in my opinion, the Crown cannot successfully assert its title to the minerals as against, the appellant, not because it has ever parted with that title but because the certificate on which the appellant relied is, by the statute, made conclusive evidence of the rights of the parties. Since the decision of this Court in Canadian Pacific Railway Co. Ltd. et al. v. Turta et al.9, it cannot be doubted that an owner may be deprived of title to his land by the error of a Registrar in issuing a certificate although the error would have been discoverable by a search of the title.\nThe circumstance that prior to October 1, 1930, the legislation of Saskatchewan may well have been ineffective as regards the rights of the Crown in the right of Canada appears to me to be irrelevant as the certificate upon which the appellant relied was issued in 1949.\nSince writing the above I have had the opportunity of reading the reasons of my brothers Rand and Locke and I agree with them.\nI would allow the appeal and direct the Registrar to withdraw caveat no.

It was possible to \"inflict\" evil, in the sense of causing another person to suffer or incur it, by mere persuasion and without any use of force or coercion. But it was not shown that he was likely to repeat his conduct; the proper conclusion on the evidence was that such a repetition was improbable, and one essential element of the definition was therefore not satisfied.\nPer Rand J.: Parliament intended by the definition in s. 659(b) to describe a condition of impulse that in certain circumstances of normal control would become uncontrollable. The medical evidence in this case was only to the effect that the respondent's impulses were \"uncontrolled or uncontrollable\" and the medical witnesses further said that normally a man in possession of his faculties (which the respondent was) could control his criminal sexual impulses. It had not been shown, as was essential, that the respondent's impulses were uncontrollable, rather than merely uncontrolled.\nPer Cartwright J.: The primary meanings of the word \"inflict\" involved an element of force, violence or coercion and the word was not apt to describe conduct consisting solely of temptation and persuasion. It was therefore not shown on the evidence that the respondent, even assuming that he was likely to repeat his offences, was \"likely to \u2026 inflict \u2026 evil\" on other persons. Further, the evidence did not indicate that the respondent was likely to repeat acts of the kind in respect of which he had been convicted.\nPer Taschereau and Locke JJ., dissenting: The long course of criminal conduct of the respondent inflicted \"injury \u2026 or other evil\" upon his victims within the meaning of s. 659(b) and there was ample evidence on which the trial judge might properly find that it was likely that he would in the future act in the same manner with other children. The finding of the trial judge should therefore be restored. Per Kerwin C.J. and Rand, Locke, Cartwright and Abbott JJ.: A psychiatrist called as a witness on a hearing under s. 661(1) should not be asked to give his opinion upon the very question that is to be determined by the Court, viz., whether or not the accused is a criminal sexual psychopath.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Cartwright and Abbott JJ.: The trial judge, on the hearing of an application under s. 661(1) of the Criminal Code, has not only the right but the duty to consider the evidence given on the substantive charges against the accused, and that evidence should form part of the record on an appeal from his decision.\nConstitutional law\u2014Criminal law and procedure\u2014Validity of the Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 659-667.\nSections 659 to 667 of the Criminal Code are intra vires of the Parliament of Canada, being legislation in relation to \"the Criminal Law, \u2026 including the procedure in Criminal Matters\" within s. 91(27) of the British North America Act.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, reversing a judgment of Boyd McBride J. finding the respondent to be a criminal sexual psychopath.\nH.

M. de Weerdt, for the Attorney General of Canada, intervenant.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Abbott J. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014By leave of this Court the Attorney General of Alberta appeals from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta setting aside a finding of Mr. Justice McBride under s. 661 of the Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, that the respondent was a criminal sexual psychopath. The appeal to the Appellate Division was under s. 667 of the Code and the leave to appeal to this Court was granted under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 259, as amended by 1956, c. 48, s. 3, so that we are not restricted to questions of law. Section 659(b) of the Code defines criminal sexual psychopath as\na person who, by a course of misconduct in sexual matters, has shown a lack of power to control his sexual impulses and who as a result is likely to attack or otherwise inflict injury, pain or other evil on any person. Mr. Justice McBride had presided over the trial with a jury of the respondent on two counts of an indictment charging :\n1. That he, at Calgary, in the Judicial District of Calgary, on or about the 1st day of September, A.D. 1955, being a male person, did commit an act of gross indecency with Hugh Ernest Helmer, another male person, contrary to the Criminal Code.\n2. That he, at Calgary, in the Judicial District of Calgary, on or about the 31st day of March, A.D. 1956, being a male person, did commit an act of gross indecency with George Melville Gibson, another male person, contrary to the Criminal Code.\nThe respondent was convicted on both counts and, pursuant to s. 661(1) of the Code, the Court heard evidence as to whether the respondent was a criminal sexual psychopath and made the finding in question. No appeal was taken from the conviction on the two counts and on the appeal by the respondent to the Appellate Division from the finding and sentence of preventive detention no application was made by the Crown to have the record of the trial proceedings before that Court, which thereupon proceeded to hear the appeal on the record of the application made under s. 661(1). Oral reasons were delivered as follows:\nThe Court feels, with our brother Mr. Justice Johnson in doubt, that the appeal should be allowed and the conviction quashed, on the grounds that the Crown has failed to bring the evidence of the psychiatrists within the definition of criminal sexual psychopath.\nThe trial judge was, of course, not only entitled but obliged to consider the evidence adduced at the trial on the two counts and that should have been produced before the Appellate Division. It is in the record before this Court and we have had the advantage of argument of counsel with reference as well to it as to the proceedings under s. 661(1).\nThe details appear elsewhere and need not be repeated. Upon a consideration of them and of all the evidence I am satisfied that it was proved that the respondent \"has shown a lack of power to control his sexual impulses\". In my opinion the evidence of his actions with young boys and his own testimony on the application under s. 661(1) makes that clear. As to the last part of the definition, \"and who as a result is likely to attack or otherwise inflict injury, pain or other evil on any person\",\u2014if, because of his lack of power to control his sexual impulses, he is likely to repeat the actions referred to, then the mere fact that he would not use force upon the other party is not sufficient to take it out of the phrase. Parliament has distinguished \"attack\", which indicates force, from inflicting injury, pain or other evil. One may inflict, that is, cause another to suffer or incur, something that is inherently evil by persuading him without the use of force to commit the act, the effect of which may remain with him for many years. I am unable to restrict the meaning of the words Parliament has chosen to carry out its intention to those cases where coercion is used.\nThere remains the question whether the respondent is likely to inflict that evil upon another in the future. The disease is a terrible one and requires treatment, but the penalty imposed is severe. The sentence of preventive detention is to be served in a penitentiary. By s. 664 it does not commence until the two years shall have been served, although the Governor in Council may commute the latter to a sentence of preventive detention. By s. 666 where a person is in custody under a sentence of preventive detention, the Minister of Justice shall, at least once in every three years, review the condition, history and circumstances of that person for the purpose of determining whether he should be permitted to be at large on licence, and if so, on what conditions.\nI have the greatest sympathy with the object desired to be attained by Parliament, but each case must be decided on its own circumstances. After careful consideration of these, I have come to the conclusion, by virtue of the powers conferred as a result of leave having been given to appeal to this Court under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act, that the respondent is not likely to repeat the acts with young boys of which he has been found guilty, or similar acts, and, therefore, he is not likely to inflict evil on any person in the future. Undoubtedly the trial judge had an advantage in seeing and hearing the respondent who gave evidence upon the application to declare him a criminal sexual psychopath, but on that application the two doctors were asked by counsel for the Crown questions that should not have been put and gave evidence that should not have been received. The nature of these questions and answers appears elsewhere. Even though the application under s. 661(1) was made to a judge alone, the fact that the doctors gave their opinion upon the very question to be determined by the Court makes it impossible for me to read the learned judge's reasons as showing that he came to his conclusion without ' being swayed by these opinions.\nFor this reason I am, with respect, unable to agree with him. Even if s. 592(1)(b)(iii) applies to appeals under s. 667 and if \"procedure on appeals\" in subs. (3) of s. 667 is applicable, not only am I not satisfied that no substantial wrong or miscarriage has occurred, but I have reached the conclusion that the Appellate Division was right in setting aside his finding.\nAt the argument, and without calling upon counsel for the Attorney General of Canada, we disposed of the respondent's contention that the sections were ultra vires of Parliament on the short ground that they were legislation in relation to criminal law, including procedure in criminal matters, within head 27 of s. 91 of the British North America Act.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nTaschereau J. (dissenting):\u2014I agree with my brother Locke that this appeal should be allowed, and the order of the Court of Appeal set aside.\nI do not find it necessary, however, for the determination of this case, to give any opinion as to the legality of the evidence of Drs. Michie and Carnat, who testified that the respondent was a criminal sexual psychopath who had a lack of power to control his sexual impulses, and was likely to inflict injury, pain, or other evil on any person.\nThe other evidence adduced, and particularly the continued misconduct of the respondent, was, I think, sufficient to justify the trial judge in reaching the conclusion at which he arrived.\nThe appeal should be allowed.\nRand J.:\u2014This appeal calls for the interpretation of the definition, in s. 659(b) of the Criminal Code, of a criminal sexual psychopath. The definition is in these words:\n\"Criminal sexual psychopath\" means a person who, by a course of misconduct in sexual matters, has shown a lack of power to control his sexual impulses and who as a result is likely to attack or otherwise inflict injury, pain or other evil on any person. The accused respondent was found by the trial judge to come within that definition but that finding was reversed in the Appellate Division. The facts have been set forth by my brother Cartwright and it will not be necessary for me to deal with them. The provision is new, and involving, as it may, the deprivation for years of a person's liberty, it calls for a careful examination of its terms and the considerations which lie behind it.\nThe essence of the defence is that what the definition describes is one who, in circumstances within the range of normal control over sexual impulses or tendencies, has no control; that within that range his desires are such as may seek satisfaction to the point of physical attack or its equivalent on another person. Sexual desires and impulses express themselves in a gamut of modes, and that fundamental characteristic of human beings must be kept in mind as the background to gross manifestations. By a loose sense of the word \"lack\", the definition is broad enough to include all the degrees of demand for gratification within or beyond the point of government; but the word may also signify the absence of control within that range as the essential factor; and applying the long-established rule for interpreting statutes creating criminal offences, the stricter and more limited scope must be attributed to the definition. In each case the distinctive features pertinent to that issue must be given the fullest enquiry and the conclusion reached beyond a reasonable doubt.\nThe question of the elements of control and their presence or absence becomes, then, of fundamental importance. In this, the will in action which dominates such emotional . pressures, the act of volitional rejection, is associated with ideas and feelings; they may be moral, ethical, religious or of any other character, and the resulting action executes or fulfils one or more of them. The criminal psychopath is afflicted with a constitutional endowment which in the particular respect does not provide that strength of restraint that keeps within the band of normal behaviour; and the critical degree lies at the point when the forces acting present a danger sufficiently great to be brought under social control. Here that point is argued to be where uncontrollability is present as abnormality. Parliament has dealt with the dereliction of indecency in the extreme manner in s. 149 of the Criminal Code, by which the offence as of April 1, 1953, was extended to embrace any two persons. Under that provision the accused was found guilty and sentenced to a term of two years in prison.\nIn the light of all this, I cannot but think that Parliament, by the definition, intended to describe a condition of impulse that in certain circumstances of normal control would become uncontrollable. The language applies to persons of both sexes and all ages. In matters involving boys in their 'teens, as here, there is in fact a consent on their part and that becomes relevant to the determination of controllability. As was put to counsel, if at any stage of the approach, upon a boy's turning away or resenting suggestions made, the accused had at once desisted, how could it be said that he was a victim of uncontrollable impulses? I do not think it can be. Dr. Michie spoke of the homosexual \"drive\" of the accused as either \"uncontrolled or uncontrollable\" (and these would, in the particular circumstances of the case, seem to distribute the alternatives) and that he (the doctor) had always \"had the feeling that the person who is not mentally disturbed can control his impulses. All do not agree with that.\" Dr. Carnat agreed that to a \"great extent\" a man who has possession of his faculties can control his \"criminal sexual impulses\". He was of the opinion that the accused was sane and had possession of his mental faculties; and that the trial and exposure to which he had been subjected could quite possibly act as a permanent deterrent of the practices indulged in.\nThe opinion of both psychiatrists that the accused was a criminal sexual psychopath was on their own interpretation of the definition, an interpretation which was not elaborated or even attempted to be stated to them but which, on a reading aloud of the definition, was assumed by both, and evidently by the trial judge and counsel prosecuting, to be of such plain and understandable simplicity as not to require any examination or analysis. Dr. Carnat agreed with every \"material part\" of the evidence of Dr. Michie \"relevant to this case\", and I take this to include the statement that the \"drive\" was either \"uncontrolled or uncontrollable\". The impulse was patently \"uncontrolled\" in the sense that it was given expression ; but the vital question was whether, at the critical time, it was uncontrollable. On this we have no confirmatory medical opinion which s. 661 requires.\nI should repeat, by way of emphasis, that the section applies to sexual manifestation in relation to both sexes and all ages. It is not merely a protection to young persons. It may be that it would be socially desirable to subject victims of this weakness to indefinite detention merely for a tendency that involved young boys. That can easily be understood. But the statute, in my opinion, does not go so far: such an extension of criminality and magnitude of punishment have not been deliberated upon by Parliament ; and the Courts are not the constitutional organs to enter upon questions of legislative policy.\nThe constitutionality of the statute was raised but I cannot think that its validity can be seriously challenged.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal.\nLocke J. (dissenting) :\u2014We were informed upon the argument of this matter that the evidence taken at the trial of the respondent upon the two offences of which he was found guilty by the jury was not made part of the record considered by the Appellate Division.\nThe oral reasons delivered in the Appellate Division for setting aside the finding that Neil was a criminal sexual psychopath simply say that:\nThe Crown has failed to bring the evidence of the psychiatrists within the definition of criminal sexual psychopath.\nWith respect, the meaning of this appears to me to be obscure.\nSubsection (2) of s. 661 of the Criminal Code requires that on the hearing of an application under subs. (1) the Court \"may hear any evidence that it considers necessary, but shall hear the evidence of at least two psychiatrists, one of whom shall be nominated by the Attorney General\".\nDr. T. C Michie and Dr. Morris Carnat, whose qualifications are unquestioned, gave evidence on the application, the former having been nominated by the Attorney General. Dr. Michie had heard all of the evidence given at the trial before the jury and on the application. Dr. Carnat had heard all of that evidence and, in addition, had examined Neil for some one and one-half hours while he was in custody to assist him in forming an opinion as to his mental state.\nParagraph (b) of s. 659 defines \"criminal sexual psychopath\" as meaning\na person who, by a course of misconduct in sexual matters, has shown a lack of power to control his sexual impulses and who as a result is likely to attack or otherwise inflict injury, pain or other evil on any person.\nOffences of the nature described in s. 661(1)(a)(iv),(v) and (vi) suggest mental infirmity and it was presumably for this reason that subs. (2) requires that in deciding such applications the Court should hear the opinions of at least two psychiatrists as to the sanity of the convicted person and as to whether he is likely to attack or otherwise inflict injury, pain or other evil on any person.\nThe decision as to whether Neil had shown by the long-continued course of misconduct in sexual matters, proven at the trial and on the application, a lack of power to control his sexual impulses was, of course, for the judge alone. Counsel appearing for the Crown, however (who did not appear on the argument in this Court), asked both Drs. Michie and Carnat if they considered Neil to be a criminal sexual psychopath and both answered in the affirmative. No objection was made by counsel for the convicted man but the question was clearly improper and should not have been permitted.\nThe oral reasons given by McBride J. for his finding show clearly, in my opinion, that that learned judge determined the question on his own view of the effect of the evidence and that the evidence of the doctors was treated by him as opinion evidence only as to the man's sanity, his power to control his sexual impulses and the likelihood of his attacking or otherwise inflicting pain or other evil on any person.\nHad the matter been one for determination by a jury it would be my opinion that the improper admission of this evidence would have necessitated a rehearing for the reasons stated by Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. in Allen v. The King 1, and by Lord Herschell L.C. in Makin et ux. v. The Attorney-General for New South Wales 2. In the present case, where the matter was one for the decision of a single judge, and in the circumstances above stated, I would apply s. 592(1)(b)(iii), since, in my opinion, no wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred.\nI consider that the long course of criminal conduct of this respondent inflicted \"injury \u2026 or other evil\" upon the children who were his victims within the meaning of that language in s. 659(b). There was ample evidence upon which the learned trial judge might properly find that it was likely that he would in the future act in like manner with other children.\nFor the reasons so clearly stated by McBride J., I would allow this appeal and set aside the order of the Appellate Division.\nCartwright J.:\u2014On May 24, 1956, the respondent was convicted after trial before Boyd McBride J. and a jury on the two following counts:\n1. That he, at Calgary, in the Judicial District of Calgary, on or about the 1st day of September, A.D. 1955, being a male person, did commit an act of gross indecency with Hugh Ernest Helmer, another male person, contrary to the Criminal Code.\n2. That he, at Calgary, in the Judicial District of Calgary, on or about the 31st day of March, A.D. 1956, being a male person, did commit an act of gross indecency with George Melville Gibson, another male person, contrary to the Criminal Code.\nFollowing these convictions, and before sentence was passed, counsel for the Crown made application to the learned trial judge, pursuant to s. 661(1) of the Criminal Code, to hear evidence as to whether the respondent was a criminal sexual psychopath. Evidence was heard accordingly and at the conclusion of the hearing the learned trial judge found the respondent to be a criminal sexual psychopath, sentenced him to two years' imprisonment on each of the counts set out above, the sentences to run concurrently, and also imposed a sentence of preventive detention.\nThe respondent did not appeal from the convictions of the two substantive offences but did appeal against the sentence of preventive detention, pursuant to s. 667(1) of the Code.\nOn October 10, 1956, the Appellate Division, Johnson J. dubitante, set aside the finding that the respondent was a criminal sexual psychopath and the sentence of preventive detention. On November 26, 1956, the appellant was granted leave to appeal to this Court from the judgment of the Appellate Division. Leave having been granted pursuant to s. 41(1) of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 259, as amended by 1956, c. 48, s. 3, our jurisdiction is not restricted to questions of law.\nPrior to the appeal coming on for hearing, the respondent gave notice to the Attorney General of Canada that he questioned the validity of ss. 659 to 667 of the Criminal Code and leave to intervene was granted to the Attorney General. At the hearing the Court was unanimously of opinion that these sections were intra vires of Parliament as being legislation in relation to the criminal law, including the procedure in criminal matters, within s. 91, head 27, of the British North America Act, and did not find it necessary to call upon counsel for the Attorney General of Canada.\nWe were informed by counsel that the Appellate Division was not furnished with the transcript of the evidence given at the trial of the two substantive offences but this was included in the appeal case in this Court. In my opinion the learned trial judge was entitled, and indeed required, to consider that evidence in addition to the evidence given before him on the application under s. 661(1).\nAs the definition of \"criminal sexual psychopath\" in s. 659(b) of the Code necessitates a consideration of the respondent's \"course of misconduct in sexual matters\", it is desirable to set out in chronological order the facts regarding that misconduct which are disclosed by the evidence.\nThere is no direct evidence as to the age of the respondent but he was teaching in a high school in 1937. The respondent did not give evidence on the trial of the substantive offences but did on the hearing under s. 661(1). He stated that he first remembered \"homosexual activities\" taking place in his own life when he was about 13 or 14. He was not asked to say what these activities were. Two witnesses were called who had associated with the respondent in the years 1938 and 1939. The first, Nares, gave evidence of no importance. The second, Stapley, stated (i) that the respondent had shared a bed with him and had handled his penis and that he had done the same to the respondent; (ii) that the respondent had committed sodomy upon him on several occasions; and (iii) that he and the respondent had engaged in acts of fellatio with each other on several occasions. The respondent explicitly denied statements (ii) and (iii) and stated that the thought of such actions was repugnant to him. He was not cross-examined and no finding of fact was made by the learned trial judge in regard to these two statements. In these circumstances counsel for the appellant stated in answer to a question from the bench that he did not ask the Court to proceed on the basis that either of these statements (ii) and (iii) was true, and in my opinion he was right in taking this position.\nApart from the respondent's own testimony, to be mentioned later, there is no evidence of other sexual misconduct until the years 1954, 1955 and 1956. During these years the respondent engaged in indecent acts with Gibson and Helmer and with two other youths in regard to whom no charges were laid. The course of conduct described was substantially the same in all cases and culminated in what counsel for the appellant described as \"mutual manual masturbation\". At the time of these occurrences the ages of the youths concerned varied from 14 to 17 years.\nThe testimony of the respondent, mentioned above, from which it might be inferred that there were other similar acts, is as follows:\nQ. Now when do you first remember homosexual activities taking place in your own life? I mean, how far back does it go? A. I would think when I was about 14 or 13.\nQ. Now, can you tell the Court how frequent those episodes have occurred in your life? Has it been a continuous thing, or have they broken off? A. They have broken off from time to time. The only times that there has been any pattern, if you could call it such, has been when the pressure of school work or some other such thing has forced me into the company of students whose problems actually became part of my own pattern of life, you might say. That is, in all cases I have tried to help whenever I could. In the case of the two boys that are mentioned in the indictment here, it seemed to me that they both had real problems, problems that were real to them, and I was trying to help build those people up mentally, to give them more confidence in themselves, and give them a better physique in order that they could appear to better advantage among other fellows. In the case of months of close association with them, then this very pattern grew out of it.\nQ. You mean, those homosexual practices? A. Yes, but there has never been any, as it were, impulse that has grown up suddenly or anything, like that. Questioned as to the future the respondent gave the following evidence:\nQ. What do you have to say as to the likelihood of ever indulging in these homosexual practices in the future? A. I began to say, Mr. Shannon, that I can state unequivocally that it could never possibly happen again. For the first time in my life I have seen how this looks to other people. It is the first time in my life I have ever been confronted with public opinion and I can only say this, that under no circumstances would it ever happen again. In the first place, I voluntarily sent my school certificate to Edmonton to have it cancelled by my request so that at no time in the future could I be associated with schools or with young people. Furthermore, I have no intention of at any time associating with them, and the only reason it has happened in the past is where that association has been possible. As I see these actions now through other people's eyes I can merely say it will never happen again, it simply could not, my whole attitude, I think, has been entirely changed.\nQ. What do you feel has been effect of the trial and your conviction on your attitude in this regard? A. It has been a tremendous shock, it was from the very first time, as a matter of fact, that Detectives Gilkes and Evans spoke to me in the morning of April 3rd, but the shock has been accumulative ever since and culminated as it has today. It has been a tremendous upheaval, but I will also say this, in those two months that have elapsed in between I have given very serious thought to my mental condition and all circumstances pertaining to this trial and to my past actions. And I say that not merely under oath, but with the deepest sincerity with which I am capable.\nQ. Have you ever been in trouble with the law before? A. I have not.\nQ. You have no previous convictions of any kind? A. No.\nQ. How important do you feel the steps are that you have taken so that you will not be associated with young boys again, how important do you feel that will be? A. It means a complete reorientation of my life. I have always been associated with schools. From this time on I will not have any association with schools, Scout Troops or anything else. I intend, as a matter of policy, regardless of where I am, to keep entirely disassociated with anything to do with young people in any form.\nQ. You said previously, as I understood your evidence, it was only through a period of time of associating with young people that those practices had developed, is that right? A. That is correct, yes.\nUp to this point I have been dealing with the factual evidence. Its effect may be summarized as follows. From the age of 13 or 14 the respondent has had a recurring abnormal desire to indulge in homosexual practices. Those practices have been uniform; the other party concerned has been a youth between 14 and 17 with whom the respondent had for some time previously to their commencement been in close association as a teacher. In each case a considerable period of time has been taken in inducing the youth to participate in the practices. There is no suggestion of the respondent ever having employed anything in the nature of force. The word \"seduction\", used by Dr. Michie, aptly describes his method.\nIn allowing the appeal the Appellate Division gave brief oral reasons as follows:\nThe Court feels, with our brother Mr. Justice Johnson in doubt, that the appeal should be allowed and the conviction quashed, on the grounds that the Crown has failed to bring the evidence of the psychiatrists within the definition of criminal sexual psychopath.\nThe two main grounds on which it was sought to support this judgment are (i) that even if the evidence supports the view that on regaining his liberty the respondent is likely to continue the same course of criminal conduct this does not bring him within the words of the definition in s. 659(b) \"a person who \u2026 is likely to attack or otherwise inflict injury, pain or other evil on any person\", and (ii) that the evidence does not warrant a finding that the respondent has shown such a lack of power to control his sexual impulses as makes it likely that he will in the future be unable to control them and be guilty of the same sort of conduct as that of which he has been convicted.\nThe validity of the first ground depends upon the proper construction of the definition in s. 659(b), and that of the second upon the effect of the evidence.\nAfter anxious consideration I have reached the conclusion that Mr. Shannon is right in the first of the two submissions mentioned. S. 659(b) reads as follows:\n\"criminal sexual psychopath\" means a person who, by a course of misconduct in sexual matters, has shown a lack of power to control his sexual impulses and who as a result is likely to attack or otherwise inflict injury, pain or other evil on any person.\nAssuming for the purposes of this branch of the matter that the course of misconduct in sexual matters pursued by the respondent has shown a lack of power on his part to control his impulses to engage in homosexual practices of the sort of which he has been convicted and that, therefore, when set at liberty he is likely to engage in similar practices, the question is whether this shows him to be \"likely to attack or otherwise inflict injury, pain or other evil on any person\". On the evidence there is no room for the suggestion that the respondent has ever attacked or is ever likely to attack anyone, and in the course of his full and helpful argument Mr. Frawley disclaimed any suggestion that the respondent had used, or was likely to use, anything in the nature of force or compulsion to bring about the gratification of his abnormal desires. The submission of counsel for the appellant was that, on the assumption made at the opening of this paragraph, the respondent \"is likely to \u2026 inflict \u2026 evil\" on other youths. To persuade a youth to participate in acts of gross indecency is in itself a crime and there is no need to expatiate on the heinousness of such conduct; but the person who so persuades a youth is causing him to do evil rather than inflicting evil upon him. The primary meanings of the word \"inflict\", given in the Shorter Oxford Dictionary, are \"to lay on as a stroke, blow or wound; to impose; to cause to be borne\". In my opinion, neither of the verbs \"to attack\" or \"to inflict\" is apt to describe conduct, however evil in its ultimate purpose, which contains no element of force, violence or coercion but consists solely of temptation and persuasion.\nI have reached this conclusion on the construction of the words of the definition, but it appears to me to be strengthened by a consideration of the evil which the enactment of the sections dealing with criminal sexual psychopaths was intended to remedy. The purpose of the enactment appears, from the related sections read as a whole, to be to protect persons from becoming the victims of those whose lack of power to control their sexual impulses renders them a source of danger; and the danger envisaged is, I think, that of coercive conduct resulting in the active infliction of pain, injury or other evil on the victim, not merely the persuading or seducing of another to participate in sexual misconduct. This view is also, in my opinion, supported by a consideration of the drastic nature of the preventive measure provided, that is, incarceration which may continue for life.\nHaving reached the above conclusion as to the meaning of the definition, it follows that I would dismiss the appeal, but I propose to deal also with the second main ground mentioned above on which it was sought to support the judgment of the Appellate Division.\nThe reasons of the Appellate Division are susceptible of the interpretation that, in their view, the evidence does not support a finding that the respondent has shown such a lack of power to control his sexual impulses as to render it likely that he will in the future commit further criminal acts of the sort of which he has been convicted. I do not find it necessary to decide whether the words in the definition \"a lack of power to control\" mean, as was submitted for the respondent, a total absence of power to control or, as was argued for the appellant, such a deficiency in power to control as renders it likely that control will not in fact be exercised, because, in my opinion, even if the latter meaning be adopted it cannot be said that the Appellate Division erred in their view that it was not established that the appellant was likely to repeat acts of the sort mentioned.\nI have already quoted the evidence of the respondent to the effect that he is confident that there will be no repetition of his misconduct. Against this is to be set the evidence of the two psychiatrists. I have no criticism of these witnesses. They possess high professional qualifications and their answers were responsive to the questions put to them; but, in my respectful opinion, their examination was conducted in an improper manner. Under s. 661(3) it is the duty of the Court to find whether an accused is a criminal sexual psychopath. Section 661(2) provides that the Court may hear any evidence that it considers necessary but shall hear the evidence of at least two psychiatrists, one of whom shall be nominated by the Attorney General. This provision does not effect any alteration in the rules as to the nature of the evidence which may be given by an expert witness, or as to the manner in which his examination should be conducted.\nIt will be sufficient to state briefly the course of the examination of Dr. Michie by counsel for the Crown. Having proved his professional qualifications, counsel asked him if he had listened to all the evidence both on the trial of the substantive offences and on the hearing under s. 661(1). The witness having answered in the affirmative, he was next asked whether he had listened for the purpose of determining to himself whether the accused was a criminal sexual psychopath. His answer was \"Yes\". He was then asked if he had \"arrived at a decision\". His answer was \"Yes\"; and he was then asked to make his decision known to the Court. His examination-in-chief concluded as follows:\nQ. Just one step further in clarification of your final finding that he is a criminal sexual psychopath. The definition in the Code of criminal sexual psychopath includes all of the following, and with leave of the court I would read it to- you, Doctor. I am reading 659, subsection (b) of the Code in the following words:\n\" 'Criminal sexual psychopath' means a person who, by a course of misconduct in sexual matters, has shown a lack of power to control his sexual impulses and who, as a result, is likely to attack or otherwise inflict injury, pain or other evil on any person.\"\nDo you find, Doctor, that each one of the isolated requirements set forth in section 659, subsection (b) are found affirmatively against the accused? A. It is my opinion that that is so.\nThe objections to such a method of examination are obvious. The witness is being asked to weigh conflicting evidence; the Court does not know, for example, whether he accepted as true the evidence of Stapley, as to acts of fellatio and sodomy, which was denied by the respondent and which counsel for the appellant did not ask this Court to accept. The witness may have disbelieved the testimony of the respondent in toto. The witness could not be expected to know the rules as to weighing the evidence of an accomplice or to appreciate the significance of the respondent not having been cross-examined. The Court is unaware of the foundation of assumed facts on which the opinion of the witness was based. The witness is also, in effect, being called upon to interpret the definition contained in s. 659(b), a task the difficulty of which is emphasized by the different submissions as to its meaning made by counsel in the course of the argument before us.\nIn the cross-examination of Dr. Michie the following appears:\nQ. I notice in your evidence, Dr. Michie, that you said, I think you used the term \"sex impulses\", I think that was the term you used, \"are either uncontrollable or uncontrolled\"? A. That is what I said, uncontrollable or uncontrolled.\nQ. Uncontrollable or uncontrolled. May I draw the inference from that that Neil could control his sexual impulses? A. I have always had the feeling that the prisoner, that the person who is not mentally disturbed can control his impulses. All do not agree with that,\nQ. That is your opinion? A. Yes.\nAnd in the cross-examination of Dr. Carnat:\nQ. Do you agree with Dr. Michie that a man, and here I do not misrepresent what Dr. Michie said, that a man who has possession of his mental faculties can control criminal sexual impulses. A. A man in possession of his mental faculties can control them?\nQ. Yes? A. To a great extent, he probably can. Q. Do you have any reason to believe that the accused, Sidney Keith Neil, does not have possession of his mental faculties? A. He is mentally sane.\nQ. Does he have possession of his mental faculties? A. Yes.\nQ. In your opinion, could a public trial and conviction and all of the publicity and humiliation that goes with it, bearing in mind the circumstances of this case, could that have a therapeutic effect on this accused? A. It is quite possible it could. It could definitely act as a deterrent.\nQ. It could make sufficient impression on him that he would no longer indulge in those practices? A. It is possible.\nThe question as to whether an accused who has shown a lack of power to control his sexual impulses is as a result likely to continue to fail to control them is one of fact in deciding which the trial judge undoubtedly has certain advantages over an appellate tribunal, but these advantages are not decisive in the case at bar where the finding depends on inferences to be drawn from past facts as to future probabilities. After a careful reading of all the record I have, as indicated above, reached the conclusion that it cannot be said that the Appellate Division was wrong in deciding that the evidence does not warrant a finding that the respondent is likely in the future to repeat the criminal conduct of which he has been found guilty.\nI rest my decision, therefore, on both of the two main grounds set out above urged on behalf of the respondent.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed, Taschereau and Locke JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the appellant: L.

Before 1948, its practice was to pay for each lot by an individual purchase of sterling at the rate of exchange then prevailing. In January 1948 the officers of the company, foreseeing a possible devaluation of sterling, arranged with a bank in London for a line of credit to a stated maximum which could be called in by the bank at the end of each year. Thereafter, as each shipment of cloth was received the London bank was instructed to pay the seller and the price was entered in the company's books in Canadian dollars at the current rate of exchange. When the bank overdraft was paid in September 1949, the rate of exchange had dropped and the company thus made a net profit of $169,000.\nHeld (Cartwright J. dissenting): This profit was taxable as income of the company tinder the Income Tax Act, 1948.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Locke J.: In essence, there appeared to be no difference in the resulting profit whether it was expressed as one realized by the reduction in the number of Canadian dollars needed to discharge the debt to the bank or as a reduction in the cost to the taxpayer of the merchandise purchased and used during the period, and the profit that would have resulted had the taxpayer sold sterling short to the requisite amount. In either case, it was a profit made in one necessary part of the appellant's trading operations and was not a capital gain as a result of speculation in sterling. Atlantic Sugar Refineries Limited v. The Minister of National Revenue, [1949] S.C.R. 706; Imperial Tobacco Co. (of Great Britain and Ireland) Ltd. v. Kelly (1943), 25 Tax Cas. 292, applied; McKinlay v. H. T. Jenkins and Son, Ltd. (1926), 10 Tax Cas. 372, distinguished.\nPer Rand and Fauteux JJ.: The profit was not to be regarded as one on a collateral borrowing of capital but rather as one derived from the \"business\" in which the company was engaged. The loan produced working capital used in the course of the company's business and in substance the creation of debt in the bank was merely a substitution of creditor for the actual transactions. There was no temporary investment in foreign capital.\nPer Cartwright J., dissenting: There was nothing in the evidence sufficient to displace the prima facie presumption that a saving made in discharging an obligation to a lender was properly treated as an item of capital and not of revenue. Applying that presumption to this case, the profit was not taxable. APPEAL from a judgment of Cameron J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada 1, reversing a judgment of the Income Tax Appeal Board 2. Appeal dismissed.\nLazarus Phillips, Q.C., and Philip F. Vineberg, for the appellant.\nD. W. Mundell, Q.C., and R. A. P. Montgomery, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and Locke J. was delivered by\nLocke J.:\u2014The Income Tax Act, 1948 (Can.), c. 52, does not contain any further definition of \"income\" which requires consideration in this case than that to be found in ss. 3 and 4. In this respect it differs from its predecessor, the Income War Tax Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 97, where the meaning to be assigned to the term in the Act was elaborately defined.\nSection 3 of the 1948 Act says that the income of a taxpayer for a taxation year for the purposes of Part I of the Act is his income from all sources inside or outside Canada and without restricting the generality of the foregoing includes income from, inter alia, all businesses. Section 4 so far as it is relevant merely says that income for a taxation year from a business is the profit therefrom for the year. Accordingly the only question to be considered is whether the profit which was undoubtedly realized in the present matter is a profit from the business carried on by the appellant.\nThe relevant facts are detailed in the judgment of Cameron J. delivered in the Exchequer Court (1). The purpose of the borrowing from the Canadian Bank of Commerce branch in London was stated during cross-examination of the witness Clayton, the secretary and controller of the appellant company, in these terms:\n\u2026 it was felt that the pound sterling would be devalued, and after discussing the matter fully with the president and other top officials in the company we decided to deliberately pursue this policy of running a large overdraft in England in the hope of gaining the capital profit on devaluation. And again:\nI contend that that profit is the result of a premeditated act on my part and other officials of the company to build up a liability in England when, in fact, we could have specifically paid out of funds that we had in Canada, and it had no relationship whatsoever with the merchandise, as you are saying it does, in that once we paid a supplier the transaction was completed with the supplier and we had no more recourse to him. In normal circumstances, for as long back as I can trace the records, the procedure was different, and it was only during this 18 months when we tried to go short of sterling and the procedure was different and resulted in a capital profit, and has no relationship, in my opinion, to the merchandise.\nWhile the foregoing is rather more argument than a statement of facts it makes clear the purpose of the course that was followed. The question as to whether the gain made by the company is a capital profit is, of course, the point in the case.\nIt is, in my view, of importance to note that while, as Clayton's evidence indicated, the appellant intended to advance the claim that any profit realized as a result of devaluation of the pound was a capital gain resulting from what was to be a speculation in foreign exchange, the interest charges on the bank loan were charged in the years 1948 and 1949 as expenses of the operation of the business. In my opinion the present matter is concluded against the appellant by the decision of this Court in Atlantic Sugar Refineries Limited v. The Minister of National Revenue 3. I am unable to differentiate the position of the taxpayer in that case in respect of the profit made on the short sales of sugar from the position of the appellant in regard to the profit that was made due to the fall in value of the pound.\nAt the commencement of the year 1948 the appellant had a very small overdraft with the bank in London and from then until September 1949 it used sterling borrowed from that bank to pay for the goods used in its manufacturing operations in Canada. The purpose of incurring the overdraft was made clear by Clayton. It was the hope that when it became necessary to pay the overdraft the value of the pound in relation to the Canadian dollar would have dropped, the practical result of which would be that the cost of the goods which had been used in the operations or purchased during that period would be reduced. In essence there appears to be no difference between the resulting profit, whether it be expressed as one realized by the reduction in the number of Canadian dollars needed to discharge a debt or as a reduction in the cost to the taxpayer of the merchandise which had been used and purchased during the period, and that which would have resulted had the taxpayer sold sterling short to the requisite amount.\nI agree with the learned trial judge that it was a scheme for profit-making in one necessary part of the appellant's trading operations, namely, the purchase of sterling funds and part of an integrated commercial operation being the purchase of the supplies and the payment for them in that currency. It was apparently treated as such in the preparation of the appellant's accounts for the years in question since if it was simply a speculation in sterling exchange divorced from the company's trading operations the interest payable on the bank loan would not have been deductible as an operating expense.\nIn my opinion the decision of Rowlatt J. in McKinlay v. H. T. Jenkins and Son, Limited 4 does not assist the appellant. As the report of that case indicates, Rowlatt J. treated the purchase of Italian currency which was made as an investment into which the taxpayer had put its money temporarily. The learned judge explained the ground of his decision in McKinlay's Case in the case of George Thompson & Co., Ltd. v. The Commissioners of Inland Revenue 5 where he said that he had considered that it was a case where they had some capital lying idle and they embarked upon an exchange speculation.\nThis fact is commented upon by Lord Greene M.R. in delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Imperial Tobacco Co. (of Great Britain and Ireland), Ltd. v. Kelly 6, where, however, it is pointed out that the case stated in McKinlay's Case does not appear to contain any basis for a finding that the original purchase of the lire was a speculation. There had been, however, no appeal from the decision of Rowlatt J. and Lord Greene did not further express his opinion as to its accuracy. Decisions as to what constitutes \"income\" under sched. D of the Income Tax Act, 1918 (U.K.), c. 40, appear to me to be of value in considering cases such as the present arising under the statute of 1948. To what extent they touch such cases arising under the Income War Tax Act need not here be considered. Under sched. D, s. 1, the tax is applied to the annual profit or gains arising, inter alia, from any trade whether the same be carried on in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. This does not appear to differ from ss. 3 and 4 of the Canadian statute.\nIn the Imperial Tobacco case the company carrying on business in England had acquired a large amount of American exchange for the purchase of tobacco in the United States and when the American dollars were requisitioned by the treasury in England they had appreciated greatly in value in terms of sterling. The question was as to whether the resulting profit to the company was income. Lord Greene said in part 7, after referring to Thompson's case:\nIn the present case it is truly said that it was no part of the company's business to buy and sell dollars. But in each case the commodity (in the one case the coal and in the other case the dollars) was required for the purpose of transactions on revenue account and nothing else.\nand held the profit to be taxable income. In the present matter the borrowings of sterling from the bank were made for the purpose of transactions on revenue account to the same extent.\nThe decision in Tax Case No. 308 8 does not, in my opinion, assist the appellant. That matter was decided in a special Court for hearing income tax appeals, the judgment being delivered by the learned President. The report contains a very meagre statement of the facts but it appears that the taxpayer, which carried on business in South Africa, had for many years financed its obligations by an overdraft in London. When the United Kingdom left the gold standard, the company took advantage of the favourable rate of exchange which resulted to discharge its liability on the overdraft for an amount in South African pounds substantially less than the nominal amount of its debts expressed in sterling. The profit thus resulting was held to be a capital gain on the ground that the debt due to the bank on overdraft was of the nature of a loan and, therefore, a capital liability.\nThe report does not contain the statutory definition of income in the statute which affected the matter and the evidence did not disclose the purpose for which the moneys borrowed had been disbursed. It was, apparently, on the ground that the borrowing of money is prima facie a liability on capital account that, in the absence of other evidence, the learned President considered that the profit was a capital gain.\nI see no relation between this set of facts and the present, where the exact purpose for which the moneys were borrowed from the bank was as above stated, being for the purpose of transactions on revenue account and nothing else, to adopt the language of the Master of the Rolls in the Imperial Tobacco case.\nEverything that could be fairly urged on behalf of the appellant in the present matter has been said by the learned counsel who appeared on its behalf but, in my opinion, this appeal should fail for the above reasons.\nThe judgment of Rand and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by\nRand J.:\u2014The appellant company deals in large-scale manufacture of wearing apparel in the course of which quantities of cloth are purchased in lots from Great Britain. Its ordinary practice, prior to January 1948, was to pay for each lot according to the terms of the invoice by an individual purchase of sterling at the rate of exchange then prevailing. In that month the officers of the company, foreseeing the likelihood of a devaluation of sterling, made preparations to avail themselves of the benefit of that happening should it eventuate.\nThe company thereupon arranged with a Canadian bank having a branch office in London for a line of credit at that office to a maximum of \u00a3250,000 which could be called in by the bank at the end of each year. Although this credit may have been available for any purposes of the company, that it would be resorted to for some or all of its purchases of material for its business is quite evident, and no other purpose is suggested. The debit account accumulated until September 1949; interim payments during that period were from time to time made on the loan generally for the purpose of keeping it within what were considered to be desirable limits. In that month the pound was devalued and the amount then reached, approximately $588,000, was, in the course of weeks, liquidated by purchases of sterling at the lower rate.\nDuring this period of approximately twenty months the purchases of goods were settled in the following manner: when the goods had been received in Canada, and within the terms of the invoice, a direction would be forwarded to the bank in London to make payment to the seller ; at the same time the price would be entered in the books of the company in Canadian dollars at the then officially fixed rate of exchange; and when payment was made the purchase became a closed transaction. The total outstanding advances in September 1949, cleared at the lower rate, consisted solely of accumulated sums paid in this manner to sellers of cloth, i.e., goods bought by the company in the course of its trade. Up to devaluation the rate was $4.04 to the pound but the bank overdraft was paid on an exchange rate of $3.0875. The net profit was approximately $160,000 and the question is whether that profit is taxable as income.\nThe company's contention is that the profit was on a collateral borrowing of capital, a single and discrete transaction, not in the course of any business carried on by it, in effect, a temporary capital investment in foreign currency. As a profit on such an investment it is not within the scope of the taxing statute.\nThe Crown's answer is that this mode of financing was, as created, an inseparable part of and merged in the business in which the company was engaged; or if not, that it was a venture within s. 127(1) (e) of the Income Tax Act, 1948 (Can.), c. 52, which defines \"business\" as including \"an adventure or concern in the nature of trade\".\nA number of authorities were examined by both counsel which bear more or less directly upon dealings involving foreign exchange. Those relied on by the Crown were cases in which the exchange was encountered as part of the transaction of purchase and sale as between the buyer and seller themselves: the exchange benefit or detriment was immediately involved in the actual payment to the seller of the price of goods purchased. Admittedly in such a mode of dealing the rate of exchange at the time of payment and not at any other time controls: the actual outlay by the purchaser to the seller for the goods received, in terms of the domestic currency, is the amount which must be taken into the account.\nBetween that and the practice here there is, no doubt, a difference in fact. When the goods were paid for with the borrowed sterling, the relation between buyer and seller, for those goods, was ended. Entry had to be made in various records, in London between the bank and the purchaser, in Canada between the purchaser and seller. What remained outstanding was the debt to the bank owing by the purchaser, and with this transaction the seller had nothing to do.\nThe proposition that the risk of a change in value of capital securities or investments is that of capital can be accepted. The capital machinery within and by means of which the business earning the income is carried on is distinct from that business itself; and the fluctuations in its value have no bearing on profits or losses from the business.\nThat distinction was stated with clarity by Lord Macmillan in Montreal Coke and Manufacturing Company v. Minister of National Revenue; Montreal Light, Heat and Power Consolidated v. Same 9. At p. 134, he puts it thus:\nIt is not the business of either of the appellants to engage in financial operations. The nature of their businesses is sufficiently indicated by their titles. It is to those businesses that they look for their earnings. Of course, like other business people, they must have capital to enable them to conduct their enterprises, but their financial arrangements are quite distinct from the activities by which they earn their income. No doubt, the way in which they finance their businesses will, or may, reflect itself favourably or unfavourably in their annual accounts, but expenditure incurred in relation to the financing of their businesses is not, in their Lordships' opinion, expenditure incurred in the earning of their income within the statutory meaning. The statute, in s. 5(b), significantly employs the expression \"capital used in the business to earn the income\" differentiating between the provision of capital and the process of earning profits.\nThe principle was applied by this Court in Bennett and White Construction Company Limited v. The Minister of National Revenue 10, in which certain payments, made as the price of obtaining guarantees required for bank advances to the company, were held to be of a capital nature and not deductible.\nAn analogous application was made in McKinlay v. H. T. Jenkins and Son, Limited 11. A contractor, undertaking work which called for the use of Italian granite, purchased lire in advance of his requirements. The exchange value of the lira went up, the contractor sold at a profit and later repurchased when the value had fallen off. The gain was held to result from an isolated transaction in a capital dealing and was not income. In the language of Rowlatt J. the profit was not \"connected with the contract to construct\"; it was an appreciation of a temporary investment, a dealing not merged in the business. So, too, in Davies v. The Shell Company of China, Limited 12. There the company sold petroleum products in China to agents who paid as the products were sold. To secure the seller's position the agents were required to deposit sums in Chinese dollars with the seller. The latter transferred the deposits to London and converted them into sterling. Three years later, when the business in China was brought to a close, the amounts due the agents in Chinese currency were repaid them. The value of that currency had declined and the company realized a substantial benefit in pounds sterling, which was held not to be taxable income.\nThe dealings before us are not, in my opinion, within that differentiating conception. The loan produced working capital used in the course of the company's business; the loan was effected as each payment was made to a seller ; but in substance the creation of debt in the bank was merely a substitution of creditor for the actual transactions: no advance was ever made or, so far as the case goes, was ever agreed to be made to the company itself. Mr. Phillips, in his plausible argument, stressed the arrangement as a temporary investment in foreign currency. But what, in the sense of McKinlay, is an investment? Surely it involves the putting at risk by the investor of an asset or interest of value from which an increment of additional return of value is ordinarily hoped for. Here there was simply an accumulation of debt as the transactions of the business proceeded. No asset was put at risk by the company: the obligation of the bank was to pay the sellers of the goods and them only. Even the elements here of a short sale of sterling do not, as a collateral investment, bring it within the meaning of McKinlay. What was intended and done was the creation of indebtedness to the bank arising directly out of the business and we cannot distort that into a purchase from the bank and a payment, as a matter of choice, by the company to the supplier: actual sterling as a commodity never existed in the ownership of the company. The only difference between that course of dealing and the ordinary monthly arrangements with a bank lies in the possibly greater time allowed the outgoings to accumulate. It was a large scale process of overdraft through a substantial period of time which I am quite unable to view as an investment.\nFrom South Africa, Income Tax Case No. 808 13 was cited as a direct authority for the company. There the taxpayer, carrying on business in South Africa, had for many years financed its many operations by an overdraft with a bank in London. When the United Kingdom left the gold standard the company discharged the overdraft at a favourable rate of exchange, and the question, as here, was whether that gain was of an income or capital nature. In the circumstances it was held to be of the latter, but in the reasons the following language, at p. 100, clearly differentiates the case from that before us:\nNow, it seems to us, having regard to ordinary business and banking experience, that it would foe absolutely impossible to dissect the various items in an overdraft account. Mr. Aiken has frankly admitted that his client, the appellant company, could not possibly trace each item in the overdraft and show whether it was applied or not to the discharge of trading liabilities. The appellant company has been carrying on a system of overdraft transactions with the bank for many years past, and it may very well be that certain items went to the discharge of trading liabilities, while other items may not have been applied to such liabilities. All we know is that this money went to the discharge of this overdraft. It would be quite impossible, as I have said, to dissect these various payments more especially as an overdraft goes up and down, and is decreased by other payment made from time to time, while it is swollen by further borrowings which are made by the client of the bank; but for all ordinary purposes an overdraft is a borrowing of money.\nWhat was impossible there is admitted here: the accumulated debt was exclusively that of payments made in the course of the trade; and that circumstance is itself sufficient to distinguish the cases and to justify the difference in their ultimate determination. The dealings here are, I think, governed by a decision of the Court of Appeal of England, Imperial Tobacco Co. (of Great Britain and Ireland), Ltd. v. Kelly 14. The tobacco company, an English incorporation, was a buyer of large quantities of tobacco leaf in the United States. During the first months of 1939, in preparation for that year's purchasing in the late summer and early autumn, the company bought $45,000,000 at rates of exchange varying between $4.63 and $4.68 and the money was remitted to the United States to be used to buy the ensuing year's stock. On September 3 the war with Germany broke out and on the 8th of that month the British Treasury requested the company to stop all further purchases. As a result of compliance, there remained of the American currency unusable approximately $25,755,000. On September 30 the British treasury required the company to sell this surplus of dollars to it. Owing to the rise in the dollar exchange which had occurred, the price received by the company was much larger than that paid and the difference was included in the computation of taxable profits. It was held by Macnaghten J. and by the Court of Appeal that the gain was attributable to the business carried on by the company. Lord Greene M.R., with whom MacKinnon L.J. and du Parcq L.J. concurred, took the view that the acquisition of the dollars was simply the first step in carrying out the purchases of the leaf and the payment of its price. Bought for that purpose, the currency took on a revenue characteristic which was not lost when the surplus was sold. The argument against that seems to have been directed mainly to the circumstance that the disposal was not voluntary but dictated by the Treasury and a considerable part of the reasoning was to meet that consideration. McKinlay's Case, supra, was examined and distinguished.\nThe principle there followed, however sound its application, and I do not imply a doubt of that, is, a fortiori, appropriate here. Every dollar of the accumulated debt represents the discharge of purchase-price of goods bought. From the standpoint of investment, that case is much clearer; the exchange was bought generally and that allocated to the specific purchases was chargeable at the exchange existing at the moment of purchase. In both cases the foreign currency was used in the purchase of a commodity for the company's trade, but in that before us, the sterling representing the debt had no existence apart from that use.\nMr. Phillips urged the analogy of a loan by way of bonds or debentures repayable, say, in 1 or 2 years. If the money was raised for the purpose and used as here, that is, for and as working capital that was immediately employed in the course of the company's business, there would not seem to be any difference, and profit realized upon the redemption of the bonds or debentures might find itself gathered into income. It is difficult to distinguish a liability represented by bonds or debentures for a short period and mere indebtedness however represented when the character of the money and the purpose of its employment are the same. Bonds or other securities representing permanent or fixed features of the capital structure are entirely different in their nature and incidents.\nMr. Phillips also stressed the distinction between sterling as a commodity and as a medium of exchange, but, as already remarked, here no sterling was ever owned by the company as a commodity. A contractual right, assuming that the arrangement went so far, to have a bank pay bills on behalf of a purchaser as they are presented by sellers of goods, does not entail a purchase of a commodity for the company; and it is confusing the issue to speak of the arrangement as having produced a temporary investment: a debt is neither an asset nor an investment of the debtor, even though, as here, it may be exposed to the risk of variable value in terms of a foreign currency.\nIt follows that the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nCartwright J. (dissenting) :\u2014The relevant facts out of which this appeal arises are undisputed.\nThe appellant has for many years carried on the business of manufacturing and selling clothing and in the course of that business makes large purchases of woollens in the United Kingdom the price of which is payable in sterling. For some years prior to January 1948 its practice was to purchase the necessary sterling funds to pay for each lot of goods bought but at about the date mentioned it arranged to borrow sterling from a bank in England. The funds borrowed were used to pay the vendors of the goods purchased and the cost of each lot of goods was charged in the appellant's books in dollars at the current rate of exchange which had for some time been pegged at $4.04 to the pound. Admittedly this arrangement was made in the expectation that the pound would be devalued and that a substantial saving to the appellant would result.\nOn September 20, 1949, the rate of exchange was altered to $3.0875. At this date the appellant owed the bank in round figures \u00a3178,000. In October 1949 the appellant paid off this indebtedness at the new rate of exchange. The amount in dollars required to make this payment was less by $169,614.96 than it would have been at the old rate. The respondent in assessing the appellant for the year 1949 added this sum to its declared income. The item in the notice of assessment reads:\nAdd: Profit on Foreign Exchange \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 $169,614.98\nThe appellant's appeal to the Income Tax Appeal Board was allowed and the assessment referred back to the Minister for reassessment by deleting the amount in question from the taxable income 15. An appeal by the respondent to the Exchequer Court was allowed and the assessment affirmed 16. From that judgment this appeal is brought.\nThe gist of the decision of the Income Tax Appeal Board, delivered by Mr. W. S. Fisher, Q.C., is contained in the following paragraph 17 in his reasons:\nIn the case of a debenture or bond issue floated by a company and subsequently liquidated or paid off for a smaller amount than that originally received, I am of the opinion that the difference would have been treated as a capital profit without question, and that this would be so even although the proceeds of the debenture or bond issue had been used in the business of the company for the purchase of raw materials utilized in the company's manufacturing and trading operations. In my opinion, the loan obtained from the British bank was borrowed capital, and when that loan was repaid by the appellant, the profit realized was a capital profit which was not subject to income tax under the Act. The profit in question did not arise out of the trading operations of the appellant company. The goods which it purchased in Great Britain were paid for promptly by it within a very short time after the goods were delivered, and the transaction was then closed. The fact that the payment was made out of monies borrowed from a bank does not, in my view, bring the bank loan into the category of ordinary day-to-day transactions carried on by the company. At all times, the position of the appellant in relation to the British bank was that of borrower to lender, and it was not part of the business of the appellant to deal in foreign exchange.\nIn the Exchequer Court, Cameron J. after a careful review of a number of authorities reached the conclusion 18 \"that the profit made in the instant case was one made in the ordinary course of the respondent's business operations and while engaged therein on a scheme for profit-making\".\nAfter considering all of the decisions referred to in the reasons of Cameron J. and those discussed by counsel in the argument before us, it is my opinion that, in the case of a taxpayer carrying on a commercial undertaking such as that of the appellant, whose business is not that of dealing in foreign exchange or borrowing and lending money, a gain or loss related to dealings between borrower and lender is prima facie one of capital and not of income. This appears to me to be the result of the decisions in Davies v. The Shell Company of China, Ltd.19, Montreal Coke and Manufacturing Co. v. Minister of National Revenue; Montreal Light, Heat and Power Consolidated v. Same 20, and Bennett and White Construction Company Limited v. The Minister of National Revenue 21.\nIn the case at bar I can find nothing sufficient to displace this prima facie presumption that a saving made in discharging an obligation to a lender is properly treated as an item of capital and not of revenue. The circumstance that the payments of interest to the bank were charged as expenses of the operation of the appellant's business in the years 1948 and 1949 does not appear to me to assist the respondent. The money borrowed was used as part of the appellant's working capital and the interest was \"an amount paid in the year \u2026 pursuant to a legal obligation to pay interest on borrowed money used for the purpose of earning income from a business\" and was properly deductible from taxable income under clause (c) of s. 11 (1) of the Income Tax Act, 1948 (Can.), c. 52. I think I am right in saying that in none of the cases relied upon by the respondent was a profit held to be taxable which arose in dealings where the relationship between the parties was solely that of lender and borrower. For this reason I do not propose to deal with those cases in detail. However, as the case of Eli Lilly and Company (Canada) Limited v. The Minister of National Revenue was submitted to be indistinguishable from the case at bar I should point out that in that case the relationship between the appellant and its parent company was throughout that of vendor and purchaser and the account, on the payment of which the saving held to be taxable was made, was a merchandise account for goods sold and delivered.\nFor the reasons given by Mr. Fisher and for those set out above I would allow the appeal and restore the decision of the Income Tax Appeal Board with costs throughout.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, Cartwright J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Phillips, Bloomfield, Vineberg & Goodman, Montreal.\nSolicitor for the respondent: A.

It had difficulty in buying from producers and others and the parent company therefore caused another subsidiary, M Co., to be incorporated in 1929 for the purpose of buying groceries, produce and similar commodities and distributing them to the appellant, and also of providing warehouse facilities for the appellant. M Co. also sold to other retailers, but at slightly higher prices. In 1947 the appellant bought from the parent company all the shares (except qualifying shares) in M Co., paying part of the purchase-price with the proceeds of an issue of debentures. M Co. earned substantial profits and the appellant received from it in. each year dividends greatly in excess of the interest paid by it on its debentures. These dividends were non-taxable in the appellant's hands. The appellant company claimed to be entitled to deduct from its income for the years 1947, 1948 and 1949 the interest paid by it on the debentures.\nHeld (Locke J. dissenting) : The interest was not an allowable deduction.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau J.: By virtue of s. 4(n) of the Income War Tax Act, the dividends received by the appellant from M Co. in 1947 and 1948 were not taxable and accordingly the interest paid by the appellant on its debentures constituted an expense incurred to earn non-taxable income, and therefore, under s. 6(5) as amended, could not be allowed as a deduction. The taxation year 1949 was governed by the Income Tax Act, as amended, and ss. 11(1)(c), 12(1), 27(1)(a) and 127(1) (e), (n) and (af) had, generally speaking, the same effect as the provisions of the earlier statute and, if anything, clarified the situation in respect of these interest payments.\nPer Rand J.: The money raised by the debentures was not \"used m the business\" within the meaning of s. 5(1) (b) of the Income War Tax Act. It was not part of the appellant's \"business to buy shares, although it was entitled to do so, and the purpose with which these shares were purchased was not determinant of the \"use\" made of the capital. It should be remembered that in the absence of an express statutory allowance interest payable on capital indebtedness was not deductible as an income expense. There was nothing in s. 11(1) (c) of the Income Tax Act to change the position in respect of the income for 1949.\nPer Cartwright J.: The borrowed capital, the interest on which was claimed as a deduction, was neither \"used in the business to earn the income\" nor \"used for the purpose of earning income from a business or property (other than property the income from which would be exempt)\" within the meaning of the relevant provisions of the Income War Tax Act and the Income Tax Act.\nPer Locke J., dissenting: Had the appellant used the proceeds of the debentures to build warehouses to be operated by itself, it would undoubtedly have been entitled to deduct interest under s. 5(1)(b) of the Income War Tax Act. No sound distinction was to be drawn between interest paid on capital borrowed for that purpose and that on capital borrowed to purchase the shares in an independent company carrying on the same activities if the purpose in both cases was to earn, in whole or in part, the income of the taxpayer. It should therefore be held that the moneys realized from the debentures were used in the business as a means of earning the appellant's income within the meaning of s. 5(1)(b). There was no provision in s. 6 that excluded this interest from the allowable deductions except subs. (5) of that section, under which there must be an apportionment of the expenses, which had been incurred to earn both taxable and non-taxable income. So far as the 1949 income was concerned, the money borrowed upon the debentures was money used for the .purpose of earning income from a business or property within the meaning of ss. 11(c) (i) and 12(a) of the Income Tax Act. Section 12(1) (c), however, like s. 6(5) of the earlier Act, required an apportionment of the expenses incurred. The matter should therefore be referred back to the Minister for such an apportionment.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Fournier J. in the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], dismissing an appeal from a judgment of the Income Tax Appeal Board[2] confirming the appellant's assessments for income tax. Appeal dismissed.\nJ. A. MacAulay, Q.C., and D. C. McGavin, for the appellant.\nW. R. Jackett, Q.C., J. D. C. Boland and G. W. Ainslie, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C. J. and Taschereau J. was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014Canada Safeway Limited appeals from a judgment of the Exchequer Court\u00b9, dismissing its appeal from a decision of the Income Tax Appeal Board\u00b2, which in turn had dismissed the appellant's appeals from its assessments under the Income War Tax Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 97, for the 1947 .and 1948 taxation years and from its assessment under the Income Tax Act, 1948 (Can.), c. 52, for the 1949 taxation year. As stated in the respondent's factum, the question in issue in respect of each year is the validity of a claim by the appellant to deduct, in the computation of its income for income tax purposes, the interest payable by the appellant on borrowed money which had been used to purchase shares in Macdonalds Consolidated Limited, the dividends from which latter company for the year constituted tax-exempt income of the appellant.\nThe appellant was incorporated under the Dominion. Companies Act by letters patent in 1929. All its common shares of stock, except director-qualifying shares, are and have been owned by Safeway Stores Incorporated, a Mary\u2014land corporation, hereafter referred to as the parent company. The appellant's preferred shares are held by the public. The appellant carried .on a retail chain grocery business in the Provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario. Since it was a retailer certain producers and companies would not sell direct to it and, therefore, Macdonalds Consolidated Limited was incorporated, also in 1929, under the Dominion Companies Act and, until June 1947, all the shares of that company, except director-qualifying shares, were owned by the parent company. The principal purpose of the incorporation of Macdonalds was to buy groceries, produce and similar commodities and then distribute them to the appellant, and also to provide warehousing facilities for it\u2014-although Macdonalds also sold to other retailers. Because of the control exercisable by the parent company over Macdonalds and the appellant, the latter was able to purchase from Macdonalds the goods it required and use that company's warehousing facilities on very advantageous terms.\nIn June 1947 the appellant paid the parent company $3,500,000 for the latter's shares in Macdonalds and also paid the parent company $1,500,000 for 15,000 common shares of the appellant, which were thereupon cancelled. The evidence is that in 1947 the parent company considered that its investment in its two subsidiaries was out of balance by several million dollars as compared with similar operations in the United States. It was suggested, but not proved, that if the appellant had not purchased the shares in Macdonalds the parent company would have disposed of them in some other way and to outside interests, but, in view of the ownership by the parent company of all the common shares of the appellant and of all the shares of Macdonalds, it is difficult to consider that suggestion seriously. The money required for the payments to the parent company was secured by the appellant, in 1947, issuing and selling its own 3\u00bc per cent collateral trust debentures in the amount of $3,000,000 and its own preferred shares in the amount of $2,000,000. The entire proceeds of the debenture issue were applied toward the purchase by the appellant from the parent company of the latter's shares in Macdonalds; the balance owing on the payments due the parent company came from the redemption of the appellant's preference shares. There is no doubt that, as among the three companies, this arrangement was very satisfactory and, added to the good management of the appellant and of Macdonalds and the ability of their respective officers and employees, had the following results. For the years in question the net income of Macdonalds, its taxable income, the taxes paid by it and the dividends paid by it to the appellant were as follows:\nNet\nTaxable\nTaxes\nDividends\nYear\nIncome\nIncome\nPaid\nPaid appellant\n1947\n$868,607.40\n$726,468.12\n$288,131.99\n$240,000\n(last half of year)\n1948\n836,033.27\n726,885.44\n254,409.90\n610,000\n1949\n839,252.60\n832,046.36\n316,177.62\n500,000\nFor the same years the appellant's net income, taxable income and income taxes paid by it were:\nNet\nTaxable\nTaxes\nYear\nIncome\nIncome\nPaid\n1947\n$1,546,144.93\n$1,284,325.89\n$557,079.23\n1948\n2,543,588.91\n1,771,014.83\n617,920.57\n1949\n3,147,613.34\n2,359,161.04\n897,250.15\nThe dividends received from Macdonalds by the appellant were not taxable in its hands and were not taxed. In calculating its income for the years 1947, 1948 and 1949, the appellant deducted the interest on the 3\u00bc per cent. collateral trust debentures issued in June 1947, the proceeds of which were used to purchase the shares of Macdonalds. The amounts of the interest so deducted were as follows:\n1947\n$44,876.72\n1948\n97,500.00\n1949\n97,500.00\nThe respondent disallowed the deduction of these amounts and hence the present proceedings.\nThe problem before the Court is to be determined by a consideration of the applicable statutory enactments and I deal first with the taxation years 1947 and 1948. The Income War Tax Act, as amended, was then in force, s. 4 whereof reads in part:\n4. The following incomes shall not be liable to taxation hereunder:\u2014\n(n) Dividends paid to an incorporated company by a company incorporated in Canada the profits of which have been taxed under this Act. Section 5(1) (b) enacts:\n5. (1) \"Income\" as hereinbefore defined shall for the purpose of this Act be subject to the following exemptions and deductions:\u2014\n(b) Such reasonable rate of interest on borrowed capital used in the business to earn the income as the Minister in his discretion may allow notwithstanding the rate of interest payable by the taxpayer, but to the extent that the interest payable by the taxpayer is in excess of the amount allowed by the Minister hereunder, it shall not be allowed as a deduction and the rate of interest allowed shall not in any case exceed the rate stipulated for in the bond, debenture, mortgage, note, agreement or other similar document, whether with or without security, by virtue of which the interest is payable.\nSubsection (1) of s. 6 so far as relevant is as follows:\n6. (1) In computing the amount of the profits or gains to be assessed, a deduction shall not be allowed in respect of\n(a) disbursements or expenses not wholly, exclusively and necessarily laid out or expended for the purpose of earning the income;\n(b) any outlay, loss or replacement of capital or any payment on account of capital or any depreciation, depletion or obsolescence, except as otherwise provided in this Act;\n(h) [as enacted by 1932-33, c. 41, s. 6] carrying charges of property the income from which is exempt, except to the extent that such carrying charges exceed the exempt income.\nSubsection (5) of s. 6 (as enacted by 1939, c. 46, s. 8) reads:\n(5) Expenses incurred by a corporation to earn non-taxable income shall not be allowed as a deduction in computing the income to be assessed. Where general expenses are incurred to earn both taxable and non-taxable income the Minister shall have power to apportion the said expenses.\nIt has been shown that in 1947 the appellant received $240,000 as dividends from Macdonalds, while it paid as interest on its debentures the sum of $44,876.72; and that in 1948 it received $610,000 in dividends from Macdonalds and paid, as interest on its debentures, $97,500. Under the authorities there is a great deal to be said for the argument of the respondent that the payments of interest were disbursements or expenses not wholly, exclusively and necessarily laid out or expended for the purpose of earning the income within subs. (1) (a) of s. 6, and that they were out-lays of capital within subs. (1) (b) of s. 6, but I do not pause to consider the points. In view of the fact that by virtue of s. 4(n) the dividends received by the appellant from Macdonalds, in 1947 and 1948 are not taxable, they are expenses incurred by the appellant to earn non-taxable income and, therefore, are not to be allowed as a deduction in computing the income to be assessed (s. 6(5)). Furthermore, even if they are \"carrying charges of property the income from which is exempt\" (s. 6(1)(h)), they do not exceed in either year such exempt income. Reliance was placed upon subs. (1) (b) of s. 5, but the exemption and deduction there contemplated of \"such reasonable rate of interest on borrowed capital used in the business to earn the income as the Minister in his discretion may allow\" do not apply, first, because the money borrowed on the debentures was not used by the appellant in its own business to earn the income and, secondly, reading s. 5(1) (b) together with subs. (5) of s. 6, there is no discretion left in the Minister under the former, in view of the precise direction in the latter that the expenses incurred by the appellant in the way of interest on the debentures to earn the non-taxable income shall not be allowed as a deduction.\nSo far as the taxation year 1949 is concerned, s. 11 of the Income Tax Act, 1948, c. 52, as amended by 1949, 2nd sess., c. 25, s. 4, and 1950, c. 40, s. 5, which amendments are applicable to the 1949 taxation year, provides as follows:\n11. (1) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a), (b) and (h) of subsection (1) of section 12, the following amounts may be deducted in computing the income of a taxpayer for a taxation year :\n(c) an amount paid in the year or payable in respect of the year (depending upon the method regularly followed by the taxpayer in computing his income), pursuant to a legal obligation to pay interest on\n(i) borrowed money used for the purpose of earning income from a business or property (other than property the income from which would be exempt), or\n(ii) an amount payable for property acquired for the purpose of gaining or producing income therefrom or for the purpose of gaining or producing income from a business (other than property the income from which would be exempt),\nor a reasonable amount in respect thereof, whichever is the lesser.\nSection 12 reads as follows:\n12. (1) In computing income, no deduction shall be made in. respect of\n(a) an outlay or expense except to the extent that it was made or incurred by the taxpayer for the purpose of gaining or producing income from property or a business of the taxpayer,\n(b) an outlay, loss or replacement of capital, a payment on account of capital or an allowance in respect of depreciation, obsolescence or depletion, except as expressly permitted by this Part, (e) an outlay or expense to the extent that it may reasonably be regarded as having been made or incurred for the purpose of gaining or producing exempt income or in connection with property the income from which would be exempt.\nSection 27(1) reads:\n27. (1) Where a corporation in a taxation year received a dividend from a corporation that\n(a) was resident in Canada in the year and was not, by virtue of a statutory provision, exempt from tax under this Part for the year,\nan amount equal to the dividend minus any amount deducted under subsection (2) of section 11 in computing the receiving corporation's income may be deducted from the income of that corporation for the year for the purpose of determining its taxable income.\nThe interpretation section contains the following definitions:\n127. (1) In this Act\n(e) \"business\" includes a profession, calling, trade, manufacture or undertaking of any kind whatsoever and includes an adventure or concern in the nature of trade, but does not include an office or employment.\n(n) [as re-enacted by 1949, 2nd sees., c. 25, s. 45(3)] \"exempt income\" means money, rights or things received or acquired by a person in such circumstances that they are, by reason of any provision in Part I, not included in computing his income and includes amounts deductible under section 27.\n(af) \"property\" means property of any kind whatsoever whether real or personal or corporeal or incorporeal and, without restricting the generality of the foregoing, includes a right of any kind whatsoever, a share or a chose in action.\n(The italics are mine.)\nGenerally speaking, these enactments have the same effect as those applicable to the 1947-1948 taxation years and, if anything, the definitions included in the Income Tax Act clarify the situation.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nRAND J.:\u2014The issue on the taxes for 1947-8 reduces itself to the meaning of the phrase in s. 5(1) (b) of the Income War Tax Act, \"borrowed capital used in the business to earn the income\", which in turn depends on the scope of the words \"used in the business\". Was the money raised by the borrower here \"used in the business\" when it was used to buy the entire capital stock of what thereupon became the subsidiary company? Mr. MacAulay argues yes because of the purpose intended: through the stock control to make available to the company the organization and facilities of the subsidiary for purchasing, warehousing and selling on a wholesale basis merchandise bought from it and sold by the company through a chain of retail stores. To this there is added the preferential treatment accorded the company in its purchases from the subsidiary, which is that the goods are sold at cost price with an allowance for handling and warehousing but without sales expense. The allowance is described as an \"upcharge\" but neither the specific basis nor the actual amount appears; an estimate places it as the equivalent of 2 per cent of the cost of the goods sold. Goods are sold by the subsidiary to other buyers as well who compete with the company and the prices paid by them are said to be higher than those paid by the company by the differential mentioned, although that seems to ignore the item of sales expense. It is part of the argument that such a control to be exercised for the benefit 'and as part of the company's business must, at the moment of purchase, have been the object of the acquisition, but that with that purpose the claimed business relation to the company is established definitively.\nWhen the money was received from the lender it might have been converted into a capital asset such as plant or machinery of the company; it might have been used as circulating capital; but it was used, as stated, for the purchase of the stock. In that naked form there was no \"use\" in the company's 'business; without more it was simply an investment. But it is said that the power of control inherent in the stock ownership is itself an asset by means of which the money of the company is, in the exercise of the power, put to use in the company's business. It should be interpolated here that it, is not part of the company's business 'to buy shares; the company may buy them but its business is something else.\nWhat the contention comes to is that the subsidiary becomes a mere agent or alter ego of the company; that its acts are those of the company; and that by acting as share-holder or director the company is acting in its own immediate right in matters of which the agency subsidiary performs the motions. But the two corporate bodies are assumed to be totally disparate in themselves and their activities, with the company exercising its voting power not in the course of its own business but as a shareholder only. That distinction in capacity cannot be obliterated, by a vague sense of the exercise of power by the company through its stock ownership as an instrument immediately used in its business. If the subsidiary is not merely an agent, the exercise of voting power must, on the argument made, be taken to be in the course of the company's business; but that exercise is as a shareholder or director of the subsidiary and I cannot view it as an act in the company's business. In the circumstances before us, the interposition of a new and distinct capacity as shareholder breaks the continuity of the company's act as being in its own business; the act of voting is in respect of an act relating to the business of the subsidiary. No doubt there is in fact a causal connection between the purchase of the stock and the benefits ultimately received; but the statutory language cannot be extended to such a remote consequence; it could be carried to any length in a chain of subsidiaries; and to say that such a thing was envisaged by the ordinary expression used in the statute is to speculate and not interpret.\nThere is nothing to require the subsidiary or the company to continue the preferential treatment; where the company is concerned only with its own interests and those of the subsidiary, the general benefits could be varied or ended at any time. There is nothing fixed about the allowance in prices; that too could at all times be dealt with as the interest of the company might dictate, and yet the contention made would be unaffected. There is nothing, in short, to require the original purpose to be maintained. If there had been no such initial purpose but the preferential treatment was decided upon immediately after the purchase would the conditions of the statute have been met? On Mr. MacAulay's argument they would not; but what would be the difference in fact?\nShould the company, to suit its interest, or the interest of the parent company of which it is a subsidiary, eliminate the preferential treatment, there would be a plain case of the purchase of stock, the income from which is non-taxable in the hands of the company, and the deduction of interest on capital used to buy which is forbidden by s. 6 (5). As it was, the annual sales of merchandise to purchasers other than the company were about $22,000,000 as against from $22,000,000 to $40,000,000 to the company. This obviously variable relation indicates the instability of the ground upon which the argument is put. As these figures show, the preference in prices could be only part of the object of the purchase; beside that, there was the interest of a share-holder in profits and the maintenance of a separate whole-sale organization with which manufacturers would deal as such. No one can foresee all the commercial, financial or other circumstances which might dictate changes. What is demonstrated is the futility of making the existence of such a fluid \"purpose\" at the moment of purchase to be the determinant of the \"use\" of the capital in the company's business.\nThe company could have purchased the assets as well as the stock of the subsidiary with or without retaining the latter as one of its operating departments or it could have brought about a merger. These modes of acquisition would have entailed consequences which may have been objects to be avoided, including the loss of wholesale prices from the manufacturers. Each mode, including that of share control, has its own characteristics and incidents which must be confined exclusively to their particular mode.\nIt is important to remember that in the absence of an express statutory allowance, interest payable on capital indebtedness is not deductible as an income expense. If a company has not the money capital to commence business, why should it be allowed to deduct the interest on borrowed money? The company setting up with its own contributed capital would, on such a principle, be entitled to interest on its capital before taxable income was reached, but the income statutes give no countenance to such a deduction. To extend the statutory deduction in the converse case would add to the anomaly and open the way for borrowed capital to become involved in a complication of remote effects that cannot be considered as having been contemplated by Parliament. What is aimed .at by the section is an employment of the borrowed funds immediately within the company's business and not one that effects its purpose in such an indirect and remote manner. The claim made on the 1949 assessment results from the modification of provisions as they appear in the Income Tax Act which in that year superseded the Income War Tax Act. Section 11(1) (c) (i) and (ii), as re-enacted by 1950, c. 40, s. 5, are the pertinent paragraphs and they are as follows:\n11. (1) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a), (b) and (h) of subsection (1) of section 12, the following amounts may be deducted in computing the income of a taxpayer for a taxation year:\n(c) an amount paid in the year or payable in respect of the year (depending upon the method regularly followed by the taxpayer in computing his income), pursuant to a legal obligation to pay interest on\n(i) borrowed money used for the purpose of earning income from a business or property (other than property the income from which would be exempt), or\n(ii) an amount payable for property acquired for the purpose of gaining or producing income therefrom or for the purpose of gaining or producing income from a business (other than property the income from which would be exempt),\nor a reasonable amount in respect thereof, whichever is the lesser.\nThe language in (i) \"used for the purpose of earning income from a business\" corresponds with that of s. 5(1) (b) of the repealed Act and to what has been said on the latter there is nothing to be added: the business of the subsidiary is not that of the company.\nThe word \"property\" is introduced in paras. (i) and (ii) but I cannot see that it can help the appellant; the language\nborrowed money used for the purpose of earning income from ... property (other than property the income from which is exempt)\nin (i) means the income produced by the exploitation of the property itself. There is nothing in this language to extend the application to an acquisition of \"power\" annexed to stock, and to the indirect and remote effects upon the company of action taken in the course of business of the subsidiary.\nIn para. (ii), which contemplates an unpaid purchase-price rather than a mortgage, where the \"property\" acquired is stock, so far as the income is the dividends received, the deduction is excluded by the last clause in brackets, and the effect of a collateral benefit has been dealt with. If the purpose is of gaining or producing income from a business, the language is limited to the business in which the property purchased is employed: beyond that, the question is the same as for the previous years.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nLOCKE J. (dissenting) :\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Exchequer Court delivered by Fournier J.[3] by which the appeal of the present appellant from a decision of the Income Tax Appeal Board[4] was dismissed. The ruling of the Income Tax Appeal Board affirmed assessments made upon the appellant under the Income War Tax Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 97, as amended, for the years 1947 and 1948 and under the Income Tax Act, 1948, e. 52, as amended, in respect of the year 1949.\nThe appellant was incorporated in the year 1929 under the provisions of the Dominion Companies Act and since that time has operated a retail chain store business in the western Provinces and in western Ontario dealing in groceries, fruit and farm produce. All of the common shares of the appellant have from the date of its incorporation been owned by Safeway Stores Incorporated, a Maryland corporation, which operates a business of the same nature in the United States.\nIn the same year Macdonalds Consolidated Limited was incorporated under the Dominion Companies Act, all of the shares of that company being owned by the American company. The principal purpose of the incorporation is stated to have been to buy and distribute groceries, produce and similar commodities to the appellant. In addition it was undoubtedly contemplated that the company would carry on a wholesale grocery business and sell to others than the appellant. The Macdonald company in the course of time acquired the assets of certain other companies engaged in the line of business which it was authorized to carry on and established a large number of warehouses for the purpose of carrying on the very extensive business which developed with the appellant and others.\nIn June 1947 the American company sold to the appellant all of the common shares of the Macdonald company for the sum of $3,500,000. The appellant obtained $3,000,000 of the amount required to pay for the shares by the sale of an issue of 3\u00bc per cent collateral trust debentures to the Bank of Montreal and the balance from part of the proceeds of the sale of an issue of its own preferred shares.\nIn preparing its income tax returns for the taxation years 1947, 1948 and 1949 the appellant sought to deduct the interest paid upon these debentures amounting in the year 1947 to $44,876.72 and in each of the other years to $97,500. These deductions were disallowed by the Minister whose decision in the matter has been upheld throughout.\nThere appears to be no dispute as to any of the facts. It was essential for the successful operation of the appellant's business that it should have a source of supply of groceries and produce for sale in its stores available in ware-houses from which its retail stores could obtain prompt service. For reasons which need not be detailed, it is necessary to purchase several varieties of merchandise of this kind in large quantities and at times to store it for consider-able periods of time. The appellant itself had no facilities for doing this. Large quantities can be purchased at lower costs and when made at certain seasons of the year savings may be made in freight and other charges. It was shown that some large suppliers of fruit, such as B.C. Tree Fruits Limited, the co-operative which sells much the greater part of the fruit raised in the Okanagan Valley, and manufacturers of sugar and of some other products of the kind dealt in by the appellant, refuse to sell to retail stores so that in order to procure such merchandise for resale it was necessary that the purchases be made by a wholesale dealer such as Macdonalds.\nThrough its control of that company, the appellant was able to direct the manner in which its operations were carried on to its own advantage, and during the years in question merchandise was purchased from it at its cost plus an additional amount calculated to be sufficient to pay the Macdonald company's costs of handling the business. During the same period the Macdonald company sold large quantities of merchandise to other persons engaged in a similar line of business but at higher prices than were paid by the appellant and this business produced substantial profits. During the years in question the sales to the appellant, omitting figures less than thousands, totalled in 1947 $22,276,000 while the sales to other dealers, who may be referred to as \"independents\", were only some $300,000 less. In 1948 sales to the appellant were $27,963,000 and to independents $21,496,000. In 1949 the figures were respectively $40,479,000 and $22,643,000.\nThe increase in the taxable income of the appellant due to its being thus enabled to buy merchandise at what was practically cost and to have the warehouse facilities of the Macdonald company available to it was estimated by the auditors of the appellant as being in the year 1947, $426,000, in 1948, $535,000 and in 1949, $774,000. The accuracy of these estimates was not questioned by the Crown. The income of the appellant in these three years upon which tax was paid amounted to $1,284,000, $1,771,000 and $2,359,000 respectively.\nThe taxable income of the Macdonald company in the years 1947, 1948 and 1949 was $726,000, $726,000 and $832,000 respectively.\nIn these years the Macdonald company paid dividends to the appellant as follows: in 1947, $240,000, being for the last half of that year, in 1948, $610,000 and in 1949, $500,000. As the income of the Macdonald company was taxable under the respective statutes, these amounts were tax-free in the hands of the appellant. The Macdonald company operated warehouses at some 28 places in western Canada and of this number all but 6 supplied merchandise to the appellant's retail stores. A computation made by the appellant's auditors indicated that the cost to the appellant of acquiring warehouses and establishing facilities similar to those of the Macdonald company from which its own stores might obtain its supplies would be something in excess of $4,200,000.\nThe Income War Tax Act applies to the income of the years 1947 and 1948.\nSection 4(n) provides that dividends paid to an incorporated company by a company incorporated in Canada, the profits of which have been taxed under the Act, with certain exceptions which do not affect the present matter, are not liable to taxation. Section 5, so far as it is relevant, reads:\n(1) \"Income\" as hereinbefore defined shall for the purpose of this Act be subject to the following exemptions and deductions:\u2014\n(b) Such reasonable rate of interest on borrowed capital used in the business to earn the income as the Minister in his discretion may allow notwithstanding the rate of interest payable by the taxpayer, but to the extent that the interest payable by the taxpayer is in excess of the amount allowed by the Minister hereunder, it shall not be allowed as a deduction and the rate of interest allowed shall not in any case exceed the rate stipulated for in the bond, debenture, mortgage, note, agreement or other similar document, whether with or without security, by virtue of which the interest is payable;\nSection 6, as amended by 1932-33, c. 41, s. 6, and 1939, c. 46, s. 8, provides in part:\n(1) In computing the amount of the profits or gains to be assessed, a deduction shall not be allowed in respect of\n(a) disbursements or expenses not wholly, exclusively and necessarily laid out or expended for the purpose of earning the income;\n(b) any outlay, loss or replacement of capital or any payment on account of capital or any depreciation, depletion or obsolescence, except as otherwise provided in this Act;\n(h) carrying charges of property the income from which is exempt, except to the extent that such carrying charges exceed the exempt income;\n(5) Expenses incurred by a corporation to earn non-taxable income shall not be allowed as a deduction in computing the income to be assessed. Where general expenses are incurred to earn both taxable and non-taxable income the Minister shall have power to apportion the said expenses.\nThe question to be determined under the Income War Tax Act is as to whether the interest paid by the appellant on the debentures was a payment of interest on borrowed capital used in the business to earn the income within s. 5(1) (b) and the further question, if this be answered in the affirmative, whether the deduction is excluded by the above-quoted provisions of s. 6.\nThe undisputed evidence shows that by acquiring the share capital of the Macdonald company the appellant was able to acquire merchandise at very substantial savings to itself which gave it an advantage in competition with other retail merchants and enabled it to increase both its business and its profits. In addition, it was enabled to obtain various natural products and certain other goods at what was substantially the cost to the Macdonald company, which it could not obtain from the suppliers direct since they would not sell to retailers. Had the appellant used the money realized by it from the sale of its debentures to build warehouses to be operated by itself, no question would have arisen as to its right to deduct a rate of interest deemed reasonable by the Minister under the provisions of s. 5(1)(b). An instance of such an allowance was considered by this Court in Stock Exchange Building Corporation Limited v. The Minister of National Revenue[5]. Such a course would, however, not have benefited the appellant and increased its taxable income to the same extent due to the circumstance that certain merchandise could not be purchased by it direct from the supplier or manufacturer for the reason stated above.\nThe argument advanced on behalf of the respondent is that while the result of the expenditure of the debenture-money may have been to obtain merchandise at virtual cost, since these benefits resulted from the purchase of all of the share capital of the Macdonald company the borrowed capital was not \"used in the business\" in the sense that it would have been had the appellant company expended it 'by building warehouses and setting up an organization such as that of the Macdonald company as part of its own business.\nSince the question is simply one as to the meaning to be assigned to the language of the statute, the fact that the appellant's taxable income was greatly increased in each of the years in question with the resulting benefit to the State in amounts much greater than the amount claimed (while of importance in considering what was the main purpose of the taxpayer in buying the shares), and the further fact that the shares were purchased from the American company which controlled the appellant, are otherwise irrelevant.\nIn my opinion there is no sound distinction to be drawn between interest paid on capital borrowed to build a ware-house and set up a buying organization to operate it and capital borrowed to purchase all of the shares in an independent company carrying on those activities if the purpose of the purchases in both cases is to earn, in whole or in part, the income of the taxpayer. Each case must be decided on its own facts and the uncontradicted evidence in the present matter is that the main purpose of the purchase of the shares was to enable the appellant to utilize the services and organization of the Macdonald company to acquire merchandise virtually at cost. While separate entities, and while the transactions between the two companies were sales and purchases, the true nature of the relations between these parties appears from the evidence to be no different than if the Macdonald company had simply acted as the purchasing agent of the appellant for a remuneration equal to its cost of operation. In my opinion, therefore, the moneys realized from the debentures sold to the Bank of Montreal were used in the business as a means of earning the income of the appellant within the meaning of s. 5(1)(b).\nThere remains the question as to whether, granting that this be so, the deduction is prohibited by the provisions of s. 6 above quoted.\nAs to s. 6(1) (a), the evidence is not contradicted that the debentures upon which the interest was paid were issued for the purpose of acquiring control of the Macdonald company for the purposes above mentioned and it is not suggested in the evidence that there was any other available means whereby the appellant could have obtained all its requirements of merchandise at such favourable prices.\nAs to s. 6(1) (b), there is no doubt that the interest paid on the debentures was a payment on account of capital within the meaning of that subsection since I think the words \"on account\" must be construed as including an out-lay such as interest paid on an obligation incurred to purchase a capital asset such as shares. This was the interpretation assigned to the expression in The Montreal Light, Heat & Power Consolidated v. The Minister of National Revenue; Montreal Coke and Manufacturing Company v. The Same[6] at p. 94 by Sir Lyman Duff with which I respectfully agree. But the subsection must be read together with s. 5(1) (b) and their meaning harmonized unless the latter subsection is to be treated as a nullity. The interest allowed by the Minister in the Stock Exchange case above mentioned was a payment on account of capital within s. 6(1) (b), but it was not suggested that the latter subsection prevented its allowance. Section 5(1) (b) refers to the rate of interest stipulated for in, inter alia, debentures and mortgages, showing that interest payable upon borrowings upon such forms of security is contemplated. In my opinion the cases to which s. 5(1) (b) applies are expressly excepted from the operation of that portion of s. 6(1) (b) to which I have referred.\nSection 6(1) (h) excludes carrying charges of property the income from which is exempt. In the absence of any explanation in the statute as to what is meant by this expression, in my opinion the meaning to be assigned to it is that it includes such charges as taxes, insurance and upkeep of real property and interest upon mortgages or charges upon such property, but does not extend to include interest payable upon moneys borrowed to purchase property which is not charged with its repayment, in this case the money borrowed to purchase the shares of the Macdonald company.\nSubsection (5) of s. 6 remains to be considered. At the time the appellant company purchased the common shares of the Macdonald company that company was conducting an extensive business with independent merchants, from which undoubtedly profits had resulted, in addition to the dealings that company had had with the appellant. In my opinion the proper inference to be drawn from the evidence that was given in this matter is that the main purpose in buying the shares was to obtain merchandise for the appellant at virtual cost and that the question as to the profits that might be made in dealing with the independents was a secondary consideration. As the evidence shows, however, the effect of the purchase has been to increase the taxable income of the appellant while at the same time entitling it to the dividends resulting from the profitable operations carried on with others.\nIn the circumstances I think there should be an apportionment as authorized by subs. (5) of s. 6, but I do not consider that should be done by this Court. The evidence adduced by the appellant as to the increased profits resulting from the arrangement was given simply as an estimate. The matter was not apparently explored on behalf of the Minister since he took the stand that no deduction at all was permissible. In these circumstances I think the proper way to deal with the matter is to set aside the judgment appealed against and refer the matter back to the Minister to make an apportionment of the expenses as authorized by the subsection.\nSomewhat different considerations apply to the appeal in respect of the year 1949 to which the provisions of the Income Tax Act apply.\nSection 11, as amended in 1949 and 1950, so far as relevant reads :\n(1) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a), (b) and (h) of subsection. (1) of section 12, the following amounts may be deducted in computing the income of a taxpayer for a taxation year:\n(c) an amount paid in the year or payable in respect of the year (depending upon the method regularly followed by the taxpayer in computing his income), pursuant to a legal obligation to pay interest on\n(i) borrowed money used for the purpose of earning income from a business or property (other than property the income from which would be exempt), or\n(ii) an amount payable for property acquired for the purpose of gaining or producing income therefrom or for the purpose of gaining or producing income from a business (other than property the income from which would be exempt),\nor a reasonable amount in respect thereof, whichever is the lesser;\nSection 12 reads in part :\n(1) In computing income, no deduction shall be made in respect of\n(a) an outlay or expense except to the extent that it was made or incurred by the taxpayer for the purpose of gaining or producing income from property or a business of the taxpayer,\n(b) an outlay, loss or replacement of capital, a payment on account of capital or an allowance in respect of depreciation, obsolescence or depletion, except as expressly permitted by this Part,\n(c) an outlay or expense to the extent that it may reasonably be regarded as having been made or incurred for the purpose of gaining or producing exempt income or in connection with property the income from which would be exempt.\nBy reason of the provisions of ss. 27 and 127(1) (n) the dividends received by the appellant from the Macdonald company did not constitute taxable income in its hands. For the reasons above stated, it is my opinion that the money borrowed upon the debentures was money used for the purpose of earning income from a business or property within the meaning of s. 11(c) (i) and s. 12(1) (a). The business or property was that of the appellant,\nSection 12(1) (b), in so far as it refers to a payment on account of capital, should, I consider, be construed in the same manner as s. 6(1) (b) of the Income War Tax Act.\nSection 12(1) (c) should, in my opinion, be construed as requiring an apportionment of the expense incurred for the interest on the debentures. As I regard the capital, as having been borrowed for the principal purpose of increasing the income of the taxpayer from its own business and as the income from that business is not exempt from taxation, the allowance is not excluded by the concluding portion of para. (c).\nIn the result, I would allow this appeal with costs throughout and refer the matter back to the Minister with a direction that the expense claimed as a deduction be apportioned in accordance with the provisions of subs. (5) of s. 6 of the Income War Tax Act in respect of the years 1947 and 1948 and of subs. (1) (c) of s. 12 of the Income Tax Act in respect of the year 1949.\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014For the reasons given by the Chief Justice and by my brother Rand I agree with their conclusion that the borrowed capital, the interest on which was claimed as a deduction; was neither \"used in the business to earn the income\" nor \"used for the purpose of earning income from a business or property (other than property the income from which would be exempt)\" within the meaning of those expressions as used in the applicable statutes, and I agree that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, LOCKE J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Aikins, MacAulay, Moffat, Dickson, Hinch & McGavin, Winnipeg.\nSolicitor for the respondent: A.

Section 13 of the Act provides that if a seller fails to make a return or remittance, or if his returns are not substantiated by his records, the Commissioner appointed under the Act \"may make an estimate of the amount of the tax collected by such person for which he has not accounted, and such estimated amount shall thereupon be deemed to be the tax collected by that person and he shall pay that amount to His Majesty\". Section 25 provides that an appointee of the Commissioner may inspect records, and subs. (2), enacted in 1953, provides that if it appears from the inspection that the Act or regulations have not been complied with, the inspector \"shall calculate the tax collected or due in such manner as the Commissioner may deem adequate and expedient, and the Commissioner shall assess the person for the amount of the tax so calculated\", subject to a right of appeal against \"the amount of the assessment\".\nAn inspection was made of the appellant company's books for the years 1951, 1952 and 1953 and as a result of this inspection the Commissioner \"assessed\" the appellant in the amount of $15,792.95. This assessment was affirmed on appeal, both by the Supreme Court and by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld (Locke and Cartwright JJ. dissenting): The judgment should be affirmed.\nPer Rand and Fauteux JJ.: In substance, the proceeding was not an action for taxes but a claim by a principal against his agent for money had and received by the latter. It was agreed that the tax had been properly collected by the appellant. Both s. 13 and s. 25 dealt solely with means of ascertaining the amount of collected taxes that had not been paid over to the Crown and s. 25 did not create a new means of proceeding against the seller for failure to collect. Subsection (2) of .s. 25 therefore created only additional procedure and it could not be successfully argued that the subsection was not applicable to transactions that took place before its enactment. As to the argument that no taxes should have been collected under the terms of the statute on sales of 15\u00a2 and 16\u00a2, this contention should be rejected on the single ground that since tax had been collected by the appellant company on such sales it could not now be heard to say that they were not recoverable by the Crown.\nPer Abbott J.: The appeal should be dismissed for the reasons delivered in the Court of Appeal. Section 25(2) of the Act imposed no new tax liability but merely provided an alternative and perhaps more effective way of compelling a seller to discharge the obligations imposed on him. The subsection was therefore procedural only and as such was intended to be retrospective in operation.\nPer Locke and Cartwright JJ., dissenting: Section 25(2) went beyond the provision of an additional or alternative method of procedure since it empowered the Commissioner to impose a substantive liability for an amount determined by his appointee. Unless there was a clear provision to that effect, such an enactment would not be construed as retrospective and s. 25(2) could therefore not be applied to taxes collected before its enactment. The fact that the appellant had availed itself of the subsection to appeal did not, in the circumstances, preclude it from raising this point at this stage.\nThe Act, so long as the rate of tax remained at 3 per cent, did not impose a tax on the buyer of an article costing either 15\u00a2 or 16\u00a2, but if a seller in fact collected tax on such a sale he would be bound to account for it and pay it to the Crown\nAppeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia [1], affirming a judgment of Wood J. dismissing an appeal from an assessment in respect of provincial sales tax. Appeal dismissed.\nC. K. Guild, Q.C., and E. E. Hickson, for the appellant.\nLee Kelley, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Rand and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by\nRand J.:\u2014This appeal comes before us on questions of law only. They arise out of provisions of the Social Services Tax Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 333, as amended and renamed by 1953, 2nd sess., c. 36. The tax created is on purchases for consumption and is payable by the purchasers. Its application here is to sales made in retail stores of the well known \"five and ten\" variety, sales with prices ranging from one cent to several dollars. In the calculation of the tax at 3 per cent. a fraction less than half a cent and that of half a cent or more is diminished or increased to the nearest cent. With the immense volume of small purchases these fractional portions become of importance and out of them arises the difficulty here. It was found impracticable by the company, in the ordinary administration of its business, to follow the practice of stores with larger sales items, of issuing with each sale a slip showing the price and the tax. Instead of that, the sale price including the tax is rung up on a cash register, not as an individual item but only in a cumulative total. Besides exempted sales at prices under 15\u00f8, other items, among them clothing and footwear, were exempted. In the result, with such a recording system, it was impossible, from the tape of the register, to make any check of the taxes collected based on the individual sales.\nWhat was devised was a roll of tickets furnished by the Province each representing one cent to be supplied at each register, and as a sale was made tickets to the amount of the tax were torn off by the sales clerk. As they were numbered consecutively, the number so destroyed in any period was easily determined. The weakness of this mode was that the correctness of the amount so shown depended upon the completeness with which the clerk matched destroyed tickets with the taxes collected. In the rush of recording these small transactions the manual act of reaching to the ticket roll and, as part of a single operation, of tearing off one or more tickets was one that could easily be overlooked or postponed. Any number could subsequently be torn off and that estimates of prior sales were from time to time used to make up for omissions is, in my opinion, unquestionable if not inevitable.\nThe collection in each case is not in dispute and the only issue is the amount. The claim is for a period of three years, 1951, 1952 and 1953. Owing to the incidence of the fractional adjustment the practical mode of relating the total tax in any period adopted is its percentage of gross sales. For example, in 1951 that average percentage in relation to merchandise sales, including food sold at the coffee bar, was 2.3201, in 1952, 2.2824, and in 1953, 2.1557. Since the tax was 3 per cent., these figures and other comparisons made by the Commissioner raised doubts that the returns from the tickets were showing the full amount of the collections and in the autumn of 1953 steps were taken to have the situation clarified. In November of that year an audit inspector began his enquiry. He made an examination of the returns for the previous months of July and August and found that the ratios of the tax to total merchandise were 2.12 per cent. and 2.007 per cent. respectively: with the elimination of the coffee bar sales, they were 2.37 per cent. and 2.326 per cent. This was followed by a visual inspection throughout the store of the classes of goods sold, prices, the routine of the clerks, etc., but owing to the approach of the Christmas season further action was deferred. It is of some significance that the ticket returns following this inspection showed changes. For example, for the weeks ending November 13 and 20 the percentages of tax to merchandise sales, excluding the coffee bar, were 2.394 and 2.293; for the weeks ending November 27, December 4, 11, 18, 24 and 31, they were 2.533, 2.508, 2.723, 2.508 and 2.373, and for January 6 and 13, 2.324 and 2.566.\nEarly in January 1954 the examination was renewed. The inspector requested a tally of all sales but, owing to the then necessities of the store, that was at the time refused. But the manager, at the inspector's request, distributed a letter addressed to the sales clerks and signed by all of them calling on them to pay the strictest attention to the ticket cancellations. On the first day after this notice, January 14, the tax percentage rose to 2.98; for the week ending January 20 it was 2.931; and for the weeks of January 27, February 3, 10, 17, 24 and March 3, the percentages were 2.931, 2.861, 2.846, 2.852, 2.841 and 2.841. This striking and sustained advance in the percentage as evidenced by the ticket cancellations stands unchallenged and that it was brought about by the inspection with its accompanying incidents is equally beyond serious dispute.\nA tally was then taken for five days during the latter part of January and the early part of February of all sales from 15\u00a2 to 25\u00a2 inclusive and of those at 49\u00a2. The former were numerous and represented the highest percentages. For example, a 15\u00a2 article carried a tax of 1\u00a2, which is 6.67 per cent. of the price. On the other hand, the tax on a 49\u00a2 article is also 1\u00a2 and the percentage is the lowest, 2.04. These actual items were suggested as being the significant items and limiting the check to them was obviously to save unnecessary inconvenience or disturbance to the ordinary course of operations in the store. No question of its adequacy as a test was raised by the management and it proceeded on the assumption that what it showed would be pertinent to the matter in controversy.\nThat the tally test is the practical means of checking the collection is evidenced by the resort to it made by the company in 1949. In that year a month-long record in the same store of non-taxable sales showed their percentage to total sales to be 15.02, and similar tests in 1951 and 1952 showed percentages close to that figure. They are to be contrasted with the average percentage of the same sales reported by the company to the Commissioner of 23.8569. In the five-day test of 1954 the percentage of tax to taxable sales was found to be 3.155. The total sales during the three year period were $2,404,048.68. Deducting 15.02 per cent. as non-taxable, the taxable sales were $2,042,960.55 Tax on this amount at the rate of 3.155 is $64,353.28 as against $54,220.38 returned by the company and $65,589.06 assessed.\nThe results of the tally, summarized, showed that the ratio of tax to merchandise, excluding the coffee bar, was 3.0408 and on this basis the claim is made. It is contended that as a test it is \"weighted\" against the company by the fact that the prices between 26\u00a2 and 48\u00a2 and from 50\u00a2 to the highest limit have been assumed to be in balance at 3 per cent., that is, that the number of fractional cents dropped is about equal to those advanced. This does not, admittedly, touch the quantity sold at any figure, but in the opinion of the Commissioner the substantial balancing at 3 per cent. can, short of a total tally over representative periods, be taken as being as nearly correct as can be obtained by any means available. No evidence of quantities was offered by the company, which rested on the ground that the absence of that evidence was fatal to the Government's claim.\nThe provisions of the Act which bear directly on such a matter are ss. 13 and 25 and they are as follows:\n13. (1) When a person having sold tangible personal property fails to make a return or remittance as required under this Act, or if his returns are not substantiated by his records, the Commissioner may make an estimate of the amount of the tax collected by such person for which he has not accounted, and such estimated amount shall thereupon be deemed to be the tax collected by that person, and he shall pay that amount to His Majesty, and the Commissioner may give notice in writing either by mailing or by serving to the vendor, his heirs, administrators, executors or assigns, or to his custodian or trustee in bankruptcy, requiring that such estimated amount shall be paid over to the Commissioner or otherwise accounted for within thirty days from the date the notice is mailed or served.\n(2) Proof that notice under subsection (1) has been given shall constitute prima facie evidence that the amount stated therein is due and owing, and the onus of proving otherwise shall rest on the person who sold the tangible personal property.\n25. [as re-enacted by 1953, 2nd sess., c. 36, s. 18] (1) Any person appointed by the Commissioner may enter at any reasonable time the business premises occupied by any person, or the premises where his records are kept, to determine whether this Act and the regulations are being and have been complied with, or to inspect, audit, and examine books of account, records, or documents, or to ascertain the quantities of tangible personal property on hand or sold by him, and the person occupying the premises shall answer all questions pertaining to these matters, and shall produce such books of account, records, or documents as may be required.\n(2) Where it appears from the inspection, audit, or examination of the books of account, records, or documents that this Act or the regulations have not been complied with, the person making the inspection, audit, or examination shall calculate the tax collected or due in such manner and form and by such procedure as the Commissioner may deem adequate and expedient, and the Commissioner shall assess the person for the amount of the tax so calculated, but the person so assessed may appeal the amount of the assessment under sections 14 and 15 of this Act.\nA considerable portion of the argument revolved around the distinctions to be made between \"estimate\" in s. 13 and \"calculation\" and \"assessment\" in s. 25; but I am unable to pay to the argument the respect I should ordinarily do. What is confused is the nature of the claim: it is taken to be an action for taxes. But it is not such an action at all: in substance, it is the simple claim by a principal against his agent for money had and received by the latter, nothing more; and it is agreed that the taxes were properly collected. In determining the amount we are at large with the statute and the long-established principles governing an agent's obligation to account.\nIt should be emphasized that the statute creates two distinct liabilities: that of the purchaser of goods to pay the tax, and that of the seller to collect and remit. Throughout the provisions these obligations are dealt with as disparate both substantively and procedurally and different remedies are provided for their enforcement.\nSection 13 deals with the recovery of collected taxes from a seller. As can be seen from the facts of this dispute, the determination of the amount after some time has elapsed from the collection will necessarily depend upon the seller's records: and if these are such as do not furnish all the essential evidence there must necessarily be something less than mathematical correctness. Here is a good example of a business, in its own interests, adopting a mode of recording transactions which prevents a strictly accurate check and which puts the Government at the risk of the performance of duty by clerks.\nTo meet that known situation, s. 13 enables the Commissioner, once on reasonable grounds he has come to the conclusion that a seller has failed to \"make a return or remittance under this Act, or if his returns are not substantiated by his records\" to make \"an estimate of the amount of the tax collected\" and that estimate is declared to be, prima facie, the amount of the collected taxes and to be due and owing, with the onus of proving \"otherwise\" placed upon the seller. It is unnecessary to point out that the seller is in possession of all the available facts, that they are his facts, and that if they can be used to falsify the estimate he is the person possessing the best, if not the only, means of doing it.\nUnder the provisions of s. 25, where it appears \"that this Act or the regulations have not been complied with\" the person making the examination shall \"calculate the tax collected or due in such manner and form and by such procedure as the Commissioner may deem adequate and expedient\". This deals likewise with collected taxes which have not been paid over to the Crown. By s. 8 the moneys are to be \"remitted to the Commissioner at the times and in the manner prescribed by the regulations\". The \"tax collected or due\" is a description of moneys so collected and not paid over in accordance with the regulations. From the language of the section, it is confined to cases of a failure to remit: it does not create a new means of proceeding against a seller for failing to collect the tax. Section 30(2) deals specifically with that liability by way of summary conviction and the clear and precise terms in which that procedure is made available against default excludes that liability from the scope of s. 25. In this view of the section, there is created only additional procedure and the objection that it is not applicable to prior transactions must be rejected. But even if the word \"due\" extends to uncollected tax the objection raised would go only to an action on such a breach and would not affect a proceeding to recover collected tax, which this is.\nThe warrant for action by the Commisioner under each section is in substance the same, that the Act has not been observed as required; and that a prima facie case against the company has been shown is, I think, beyond any reasonable doubt. The method followed in evidencing that is one deemed by the Commissioner to be \"adequate and expedient\" and in the circumstances it is one that he could use as a fair and rational means of reaching an estimate of the amount of a presumptive deficiency. The action is analogous to an accounting by an agent and the proof offered, buttressed by the onus of s. 13 and the ordinary obligation of accounting, puts the issue of law beyond doubt.\nThere was finally a challenge to the inclusion of the money collected as tax on items of 15\u00a2 and 16\u00a2. It was contended that as the percentage tax produced less than half a cent, the operation of the direction relating to fractional amounts excluded tax on these prices. Three answers are given to this contention. By s. 5(m) sales of a price of less than 15\u00a2 are exempt from the tax, which seems to imply that to the 15\u00a2 items the tax attaches; that to compute the tax \"to the nearest cent and one-half cent shall be counted as one cent\" necessarily extends to every fraction of a cent, that zero is not a \"nearest cent\", and that the minimum of 1\u00a2 is thus established: and finally that as the moneys were demanded by the seller and paid by the purchaser as taxes, to the use of the Crown, the agent cannot be heard to say that they are not recoverable by the Crown. The first and second of these answers need not be considered; that the third is sound appears from 1 Halsbury, 3rd ed. 1952, p. 187; and at this stage no distinction between an action for their recovery and these proceedings under the Act should be countenanced.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs. The judgment of Locke and Cartwright JJ. was delivered by\nCartwright J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia [2] affirming a judgment of Wood J. which in turn had affirmed, subject to the correction of an arithmetical error, a decision of the Minister of Finance of British Columbia rejecting an appeal of the appellant from an assessment purporting to have been made pursuant to the Social Services Tax Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 333, as amended, hereinafter referred to as \"the Act\", and particularly subs. (2) of s. 25 added by amendment, 1953, c. 36, s. 18, which came into force on October 17, 1953.\nThe Act provides, subject to a number of exemptions, for the collection by the vendor from the purchaser on the sale of tangible personal property of a tax based on the purchase-price of the property sold, and for the payment by the vendor of the tax so collected to the Commissioner. At the times with which we are concerned the rate of the tax was 3 per cent.\nThe following statement of facts is taken from the reasons of Coady J. A., who delivered the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal [3]:\nThe appellant operates a number of stores in the province of British Columbia. The tax to which this appeal relates was levied against store No. 17, operated by the defendant at 632 Granville Street, Vancouver, B.C.\nIn stores where invoices are made out covering all purchases and the amount of tax is shown on each invoice, the calculation of the tax received by the vendor to be remitted to the Department of Finance will cause little difficulty if correct records are maintained. The appellant company herein, however, does not in its business make out invoices but, instead, the price of the article sold, plus the tax payable, is rung up on the cash register. No separate cash register record is kept showing the amount of tax collected as distinct from the sale price of the article. That being so, a system was devised, after consultation between the appellant and the Commissioner appointed to administer the Act, whereby the Commissioner supplied to the appellant rolls of tickets serially numbered, each ticket representing one cent tax. This roll was attached to the cash register and the clerk was instructed that on each taxable sale tickets were to be torn off and delivered to the customer equal in amount to the tax collected. In this way a record of the amount of tax collected could be maintained by the company. The plan would be a satisfactory one so long as the clerks performed their part by tearing off the correct number of tickets on each taxable sale. If they failed to do so then there would be no accurate record of the tax collected and the amount remitted would consequently be less than the amount collected.\nThe commissioner under the Act, in the course of time, felt that the amount of tax remitted by the appellant did not bear a proper relation to the volume of sales. The amount remitted was over a period of time considerably less than 3 per cent. This by itself, however, would not be conclusive, since under the Act the percentage of tax collected might vary from 6.67 per cent. to 2.04 per cent. (see Ex. 28). The full amount of the tax collected by the appellant, the commissioner felt, was not being remitted for the reason that the clerks failed to tear off the tickets as instructed. It is not suggested that the appellant was not remitting the amount of tax collected shown by the number of tickets torn off by the sales clerks nor that the failure to remit was intentional. The commissioner, therefore, conducted a survey on the store premises in question and carried out certain tests and made certain investigations and checked records, with the result that the commissioner came to the conclusion that the tax collected amounted to 3.0408 per cent. of the total sales, and thereupon assessed the appellant on that basis for a three year period from 1951 to 1954.\nThe grounds of appeal to the Court of Appeal are summarized by Coady J. A. as follows [4]:\nFirst,\n\"that what was done here in making the assessment complained of was not a proper calculation pursuant to sec. 25(2) of the Act\".\nSecond,\n\"that the amount assessed includes tax collected on sales at 15 and 16 cents, and that such sales are not taxable under the Act\".\nThird,\n\"that the assessment is improper in that it assesses the appellant for a period of time prior to sec. 25(2) of the Act coming into effect\".\nI propose to deal first with the third of these grounds, and in so doing it will be convenient to consider what were the rights of the parties prior to the enactment of s. 25(2).\nUnder s. 3 of the Act every purchaser, as defined in s. 2, was required to pay a tax at the rate of 3 per cent. of the purchase-price of the property purchased unless the property was of a class exempted by s. 5. Under s. 6 the appellant was deemed to be an agent for the Minister of Finance and as such was required to levy and collect the tax imposed by s. 3. Under s. 8 the appellant was required to remit the tax collected to the Commissioner at the times and in the manner prescribed by the regulations. None of these underlying liabilities were altered by the enactment of s. 25(2).\nPrior to the enactment of 1953, 2nd sess., c. 36, the provisions for the recovery of the tax were as set out in ss. 13 to 24 of the Act. Section 13 provides:\n13. (1) When a person having sold tangible personal property fails to make a return or remittance as required under this Act, or if his returns are not substantiated by his records, the Commissioner may make an estimate of the amount of the tax collected by such person for which he has not accounted, and such estimated amount shall thereupon be deemed to be the tax collected by that person, and he shall pay that amount to His Majesty, and the Commissioner may give notice in writing either by mailing or by serving to the vendor, his heirs, administrators, executors or assigns, or to his custodian or trustee in bankruptcy, requiring that such estimated amount shall be paid over to the Commissioner or otherwise accounted for within thirty days from the date the notice is mailed or served.\n(2)Proof that notice under subsection (1) has been given shall constitute prima facie evidence that the amount stated therein is due and owing, and the onus of proving otherwise shall rest on the person who sold the tangible personal property.\nNo change has been made in this section.\nSection 14 provided:\n14. (1) If a person disputes liability for the amount stated in the notice as provided in subsection (1) of section 13, he may personally or by his agent, within thirty days after receipt of the notice, serve notice of appeal upon the Minister.\n(2) The notice of appeal shall be in writing and shall be addressed to the Minister of Finance at Victoria.\n(3) The notice shall set out clearly the reasons for the appeal and all facts relative thereto.\n(4) Upon receipt of the notice the Minister shall duly consider the matter and affirm or amend the estimate and forthwith notify the appellant of his decision.\nSection 15, by subss. (1) to (5), provides for an appeal from the decision of the Minister to a judge of the Supreme Court or to a judge of the County Court, and by subs. (6) provides:\n(6) There shall be an appeal from the decision of the Judge to the Court of Appeal upon any point of law raised upon the hearing of the appeal, and the rules governing appeals to that Court from a decision of a Judge of the Supreme Court or a Judge of a County Court, as the case may be, shall apply to appeals under this subsection.\nThe only change made in s. 15 by the 1953 amendment was the extension of the time for appealing to a judge from 30 days to 60 days.\nSections 16 to 22 inclusive of the Act have not been amended and are as follows:\n16. Any estimate made by the Commissioner under section 13 shall not be varied or disallowed because of any irregularity, informality, omission, or error on the part of any person in the observation of any directory provision up to the date of the issuing of the notice of the estimate. 17. Neither the giving of a notice of appeal by any person nor any delay in the hearing of the appeal shall in any way affect the due date, the interest or penalties, or any liability for payment provided under this Act in respect of any taxes due and payable or that have been collected on behalf of His Majesty that are the subject-matter of the appeal or in any way delay the collection of the same; but in the event of the estimate of the Commissioner being set aside or reduced on appeal, the Minister shall refund the amount or excess amount of taxes which have been paid or collected on behalf of His Majesty, and of any additional interest or penalty imposed and paid thereon.\n18. The purchaser or user shall be and remain liable for the tax imposed under this Act until the same has been collected and, in the event of failure on the part of the person selling tangible personal property to collect the tax, he shall immediately notify the Commissioner, and the purchaser or user may be sued therefor in any Court of competent jurisdiction.\n19. Every person who collects any tax under this Act shall be deemed to hold the same in trust for His Majesty and for the payment over of the same in the manner and at the time provided under this Act; and the amount shall, until paid, form a lien and charge on the entire assets of his estate in the hands of any trustee, having priority over all other claims of any person.\n20. Before taking any proceedings for the recovery of any taxes that are due and payable under this Act or that have been collected on behalf of His Majesty in the right of the Province, the Commissioner shall give notice to the taxpayer or collector of his intention to enforce payment, but failure to give the notice in any case shall not affect the validity of any proceedings taken for the recovery of taxes or moneys collected as taxes under this Act.\n21. The amount of any taxes that are due and payable under this Act or that have been collected on behalf of His Majesty in the right of the Province may be recovered by action in any Court as for a debt due to His Majesty in the right of the Province, and the Court may make an order as to the costs of such action in favour of or against His Majesty.\n22. Where default is made in the payment of any taxes that are due and payable under this Act or that have been collected on behalf of His Majesty in the right of the Province, or any part thereof, the Commissioner may issue his certificate stating the amount so due, the amount thereof remaining unpaid (including interest and penalties), and the name of the person by whom it is payable, and may file the certificate with any District Registrar of the Supreme Court, or with the Registrar of any County Court, and when so filed the certificate shall be of the same force and effect, and all proceedings may be taken thereon, as if it were a judgment of the Court for the recovery of a debt of the amount stated in the certificate against the person named therein.\nSection 23, which also has not been amended, is as follows:\n23. The powers conferred by this Act for the recovery of taxes or moneys collected as taxes, by action in Court and by filing a certificate, may be exercised separately, or concurrently, or cumulatively; and the liability of a person for the payment of any tax under this Act or the liability to remit taxes collected shall not be affected in any way by the fact that a fine or penalty has been imposed on or paid by him in respect of any contravention of this Act. It is not necessary to consider whether the claim of the respondent could have been supported under the sections quoted above without resort to subs. (2) of s. 25 for throughout the proceedings the respondent has taken the position that it is upon the last-mentioned subsection that the claim is based. In the reasons for his decision the Minister said in part:\nWhile it is not admitted that the assessment fails to comply with Section 13(1) of the Act, it is pointed out that this Section is irrelevant because the assessment was made under Section 25(2).\nand in his reasons for judgment Coady J. A. says [5]:\nIt is common ground that the assessment herein was made under sec. 25(2) of the Act.\nIn the 1948 Act s. 25 read as follows:\n25. Any person appointed by the Commissioner may enter upon the premises occupied by a vendor during ordinary hours of business or at any other reasonable time in order to verify that the tax is being duly collected and paid, or to inspect and examine the books of account, records, or documents of the vendor, or for the purpose of ascertaining the quantities of tangible personal property on hand or sold by him; and the vendor shall answer all questions pertaining to these matters and shall produce such books of account, records, or documents as may be required.\nBy 1953, 2nd sess., c. 36, s. 18, s. 25 was repealed and the following substituted therefor:\n25 (1) Any person appointed by the Commissioner may enter at any reasonable time the business premises occupied by any person, or the premises where his records are kept, to determine whether this Act and the regulations are being and have been complied with, or to inspect, audit, and examine books of account, records, or documents, or to ascertain the quantities of tangible personal property on hand or sold by him, and the person occupying the premises shall answer all questions pertaining to these matters, and shall produce such books of account, records, or documents as may be required.\n(2) Where it appears from the inspection, audit, or examination of the books of account, records, or documents that this Act or the regulations have not been complied with, the person making the inspection, audit, or examination shall calculate the tax collected or due in such manner and form and by such procedure as the Commissioner may deem adequate and expedient, and the Commissioner shall assess the person for the amount of the tax so calculated, but the person so assessed may appeal the amount of the assessment under sections 14 and 15 of this Act. By ss. 12 and 13 of the same chapter, subss. (1) and (4) of s. 14 were amended, by inserting the words which I have italicized, to read as follows:\n14. (1) If a person disputes liability for the amount stated in the notice as provided in subsection (1) of section 13, or if, he disputes an assessment made under subsection (2) of section 25, he may personally or by his agent, within sixty days after receipt of the notice or assessment, serve notice of appeal upon the Minister.\n***\n(4) Upon receipt of the notice the Minister shall duly consider the matter and affirm or amend the estimate or assessment and forthwith notify the appellant of his decision.\nIt will be observed that the Legislature distinguishes an \"estimate\" under s. 13(1) from an \"assessment\" under s.25(2); and that there is a substantial difference between the two does not appear to me to admit of doubt. The former section, under certain conditions, permits the Commissioner to make an estimate of the amount of tax actually collected by a vendor for which he has not accounted and to give notice requiring such estimated amount to be paid over to the Commissioner within 30 days. Proof that this procedure has been followed constitutes prima facie evidence that the amount stated is owing. It provides a method of making a prima facie case and shifting the burden of proof to the vendor in regard to moneys actually collected by him. It does not appear to touch the vendor's liability for failing to collect taxes which it was his duty to collect.\nSection 25(2), on the other hand, under conditions described differently from those in s. 13, empowers the appointee of the Commissioner to calculate not only the tax collected but also the tax \"due\", which expression I take to mean tax which it was the duty of the vendor to collect and which he has failed to collect, and requires the Commissioner to \"assess\" the vendor \"for the amount of the tax so calculated\".\nIf I were able to construe subs. (2) of s. 25 as merely providing an additional or alternative method of procedure whereby the Crown was enabled to prove, or to make a prima facie case as to, the amount of a liability which by the terms of the Act prior to the 1953 amendment was already imposed upon the appellant, I would agree with the view of the Courts below that it should be given retrospective effect. But I cannot so construe it. It appears to me to empower the Commissioner to impose a substantive liability for an amount determined by his appointee, upon the appellant in the event of the latter having failed to comply with the Act or the regulations. To hold that the imposition of such a liability could, in the absence of words clearly so providing, be based upon acts or omissions of the appellant prior to the date of the amendment, would, I think, be contrary to the well-settled rules for the construction of statutes.\nIn my opinion, therefore, the third ground of appeal must be upheld.\nThis makes it necessary to examine a submission which is put as follows in the factum of counsel for the respondent:\nAlternatively, it was pursuant to Section 25(2) that the appellant obtained its right of appeal to the Minister and its further right of appeal to the Supreme Court and to the Court of Appeal. Since the appellant has taken advantage of the sub-section, it is submitted, he cannot be heard to argue that the sub-section cannot be employed. The fact that he has proceeded by appeal demonstrates the converse of his argument.\nFurther, it is pointed out that the appeal is allowed only as to \"the amount of the assessment\". The appellant cannot in these proceedings attack the technical validity of the assessment.\nIt appears from the terms of the appellant's notice of appeal to the Minister that, at that stage of the proceedings, it regarded the \"assessment\" as having been made in intended compliance with s. 13 of the Act, and that it was not until the statement quoted above from the reasons of the Minister that it appeared that it purported to be made under s. 25(2). There is nothing in the reasons for judgment in the Courts below to indicate that the point now under consideration was put forward in those Courts; but, assuming that the point is open to the respondent, there appear to me to be two answers to it. First, where, as here, an enactment empowers a tribunal or official under prescribed conditions to make a decision imposing liability and gives to the person on whom such liability is imposed a right of appeal from such decision, I think it would be too narrow a construction to hold that the appeal could not be based on the ground that the decision, in fact made, was one not authorized by the enactment. Second, in one sense the appeal may be regarded as an appeal from the amount of the assessment, which covers the period from January 1, 1951, to December 31, 1953. On the assumption that s. 25(2) has no retrospective operation, it would still have been open to the Commissioner to make an assessment covering the period from October 17, 1953, to December 31, 1953, provided the conditions prescribed by the section were fulfilled, as to which I express no opinion. The respondent did not ask that the assessment be amended to cover that period.\nThe conclusion at which I have arrived as to s. 25(2) makes it unnecessary for me to deal with the other grounds on which the appeal was based; but I think it desirable to add that, in my opinion, the Act, so long as the rate was 3 per cent., did not impose a tax on the purchaser of an article costing either 15\u00a2 or 16\u00a2. The tax is imposed by s. 3, subs. (6) of which is as follows:\n(6) The tax imposed by this Act shall be calculated separately on every purchase, and shall be computed to the nearest cent, and one-half cent shall be counted as one cent, but where, on the same occasion or as part of one transaction, several items of tangible personal property are purchased, the total of the purchases shall be deemed one purchase for the purposes of this Act.\nThree per cent. of 15\u00f8 is 45\/100 of a cent and 3 per cent. of 16\u00f8 is 48\/100 of a cent, both of which amounts are less than one-half cent and are nearer to the amount, \"no cent\" or zero, than to the amount \"one cent\" or one. I can find no ambiguity in s. 3(1) or s. 3(6), and would reject the argument that a tax can be imposed on the transactions mentioned by implication from the wording of s. 5(m) reading as follows:\n5. The following classes of tangible personal property are specifically exempted from the provisions of this Act:\n***\n(m) Sales at a price of less than fifteen cents.\nIf, however, a vendor in fact collected tax on such transactions from the purchasers, I agree that he would be bound to account for it to the Commissioner as moneys paid to him to the use of the Commissioner.\nIn the result, I would allow the appeal and set aside the judgments below and the decision of the Minister, with costs throughout; but I would provide that our judgment should not prevent the Commissioner taking such steps, if any, as he may be advised, under the provisions of the Act which were in force prior to October 17, 1953, to establish the liability of the appellant arising from transactions prior to that date, and under any provisions of the Act as amended in 1953 to establish the liability of the appellant arising from transactions during the period from October 17, 1953, to December 31, 1953.\nABBOTT J.:\u2014I am in agreement with the reasons of Coady J. A. (speaking for himself, Sidney Smith and Bird JJ. A.) in the Court below and there is little that I can usefully add to them.\nThe only point raised by appellant which has given me some difficulty is as to whether or not s. 25(2) of the Social Services Tax Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 333, as amended, under which the respondent's claim was asserted, should be considered as having had retrospective effect.\nUnder the provisions of the Act, sales tax had been collected, or should have been collected, by the appellant and remitted to the provincial Finance Department. Information as to total sales and taxable sales was all information peculiarly within the knowledge of the appellant and if the method used to record tax collections was imperfect, presumably it was because the appellant preferred not to incur the expense involved in keeping more adequate records. Section 25(2), which is a familiar type of section in taxing statutes of this kind, imposed no new tax liability upon the appellant. It merely provided an alternative and perhaps more effective way of compelling appellant to discharge the obligations imposed upon it under the Act. In my opinion, therefore, the section is merely procedural and as such was intended to be retrospective in its operation.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, LOCKE and CARTWRIGHT JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Guild, Yule, Lane & Collier, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Paine, Edmonds & Co., Vancouver.\n[1] Sub nom.

Nolan J. died before the delivery of judgment.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nChattel mortgages\u2014Priorities\u2014Failure to file renewal statement\u2014Whether subsequent mortgagee is \u201cin good faith\u201d\u2014Notice\u2014Insolvency of mortgagor\u2014Sufficiency of affidavit of bona fides\u2014The Bills of Sale and Chattel Mortgages Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 36, s. 24(1), (11).\nThe defendant took a chattel mortgage on June 22, 1951, covering goods in Kingston. This mortgage was for about $5,700, but only $3,800 of this was advanced by the defendant in cash, the balance of the consideration being an existing indebtedness of the mortgagors to the defendant and a company controlled by him. The same goods had already been mortgaged to the plaintiffs under two mortgages dated and registered in 1949 but no renewal statements covering the 1949 mortgages were filed until July 30, 1951. The goods were seized by both the plaintiffs and the defendant in June 1953, and the bailiff interpleaded. The trial judge found as a fact that the defendant, at the time he advanced the $3,800 and registered his mortgage, was honestly ignorant of the existence of the plaintiffs\u2019 mortgages, and had no constructive notice of them, and this finding was affirmed on appeal. It was argued, however, that the defendant, when he took the mortgage, was aware of the fact that the mortgagors were insolvent, and that his object in taking the mortgage was to obtain security for a past-due and unsecured indebtedness, which constituted an unjust preference over the other creditors.\nHeld (Locke J. dissenting): The defendant was entitled to priority but only to the extent of the $3,800 actually advanced by him.\nThe concurrent findings as to the defendant\u2019s ignorance of the existence of the other chattel mortgages should not be disturbed but proof of lack of knowledge was not necessarily equivalent to proof of \u201cgood faith\u201d. It should be found on the evidence that the defendant knew when he took his mortgage that the mortgagors were insolvent, that the mortgage covered practically all of the mortgagors\u2019 assets, and that the purpose was to obtain an unjust preference. In these circumstances, the defendant could not be said to be \u201ca subsequent mortgagee in good faith\u201d, within the meaning of s. 24(1) and (11) of The Bills of Sale and Chattel Mortgages Act, in respect of the past-due indebtedness. In re Jukes; Ex parte Official Receiver, [1902] 2 K.B. 58 at 60, agreed with. As to the moneys actually advanced by the defendant, however, the transaction was severable and the defendant was entitled to priority. Campbell v. Patterson (1893), 21 S.C.R. 645 at 653; Hunt v. Long (1916), 35 O.L.R. 502, applied.\nWhile it was true that the defendant\u2019s affidavit of bona fides stated that the mortgagors were indebted to him in the sum mentioned in the mortgage, although in fact part of that sum was owed to a company of which the defendant was an officer, the proper inference to be drawn from the evidence was that the defendant in taking the mortgage was acting as trustee for the company as well as for himself personally, and the mortgage was consequently not vitiated by this statement in the affidavit. Light v. Hawley (1897), 29 O.R. 25, approved.\nPer Locke J., dissenting: On the pleadings, the plaintiffs were not entitled to contend that the mortgage had been taken in order to obtain a fraudulent preference, the defendant being then aware of the mortgagors\u2019 insolvency. The only issue open on the pleadings was whether the defendant had notice of the plaintiffs\u2019 mortgages when he took his own mortgage, and the finding of the Courts below was conclusive on this issue.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Wells J.[1], affirming an appeal from a report of Reynolds Co. Ct. J. Appeal allowed in part.\nW.B. Williston, Q.C., for the plaintiffs, appellants.\nA.S. Pattillo, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and Cartwright and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Wells J.1, whereby an appeal from the report of His Honour Judge Reynolds, finding that a chattel mortgage held by the respondent had priority over two chattel mortgages held by the appellants, was dismissed.\nBy a chattel mortgage dated January 3, 1949, and registered on January 4, 1949, Solly Sam Cohen, hereinafter referred to as Cohen, mortgaged the goods and chattels used by him in the dry-cleaning business known as Safeway Cleaners to the appellants for $10,000. During the year 1949 Cohen sold this business and the goods and chattels to Safeway Cleaners Limited, a company of which he was at all relevant times the chief shareholder and manager. By a chattel mortgage dated June 7, 1949, Safeway Cleaners Limited mortgaged the same goods and chattels to the appellant Hyman Rosen for $10,000. The renewal statement required by s. 24(1) of The Bills of Sale and Chattel Mortgages Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 36, hereinafter referred to as the Act, was not filed in the case of either of these mortgages until July 30, 1951. On that date, pursuant to a judge\u2019s order duly made under s. 24(11) of the Act, renewal statements were registered showing the amount owing on the mortgage of January 3, 1949, to be $10,000 with interest from January 3, 1949, and the amount owing on the mortgage of June 7, 1949, to be $8,000.\nIn the meantime, by a chattel mortgage dated June 22, 1951, and registered on June 25, 1951, Safeway Cleaners Limited and Cohen mortgaged the same goods to the respondent for $5,711.31.\nOn June 23, 1953, payments were in default under the three chattel mortgages and on that date the respondent seized the goods now in dispute. Subsequently the appellants issued distress warrants to Tice, a bailiff, who seized the same goods on their behalf. Tice interpleaded. An issue was directed in which the appellants were plaintiffs and the respondent defendant, and pleadings were ordered to be delivered.\nIn their statement of claim the appellants alleged that they were the holders of the two chattel mortgages first above referred to, that on September 10, 1953, the amount owing on the mortgage of January 3, 1949, was $10,300 and that owing on the mortgage of June 7, 1949, was $5,984.46, that they had seized the goods in question, that their mortgages were good, valid and subsisting mortgages, that the respondent had no interest in the goods covered by the mortgages, which were listed in detail in the statement of claim, or alternatively had no interest therein in priority to that of the appellants, and claimed a declaration of priority accordingly.\nIn his statement of defence the respondent denied that the mortgages held by the appellants were given in good faith, pleaded that he held a mortgage dated June 20 (sic), 1951, which mortgage had priority over those of the appellants by reason of prior registration, that he had seized the goods in question on June 23, 1953, and that the mortgages referred to in the statement of claim became invalid as against him when the appellants failed to file renewal statements as required by s. 24(1) of the Act. The appellants delivered a reply the first paragraph of which reads as follows:\nIf the Defendant holds a Chattel Mortgage dated June 20th [sic], 1951 in which Safeway Cleaners Limited and S. Cohen were Mortgagors and the Defendant was Mortgagee, the Defendant was not a subsequent purchaser or Mortgagee in good faith for valuable consideration.\nNo particulars of this allegation were demanded by the respondent.\nIn my opinion the pleadings sufficiently raised the questions of fact and law which Mr. Williston argued before us, and I did not understand counsel to contend otherwise. Mr. Williston\u2019s main submission was that the mortgage held by the respondent was obtained by him when he knew that the mortgagors were insolvent and for the purpose of obtaining an unjust preference over the other creditors and that therefore he was not \u201ca subsequent mortgagee in good faith\u201d within the meaning of those words in s. 24(1) and s. 24(11) of the Act.\nThe evidence tendered as to the financial condition of Safeway Cleaners Limited and as to the respondent\u2019s knowledge of it was obviously directed to this issue, and that the position taken before us by Mr. Williston was taken before His Honour Judge Reynolds is clear from the following discussion which occurred in the course of the cross-examination of the respondent. It should be mentioned that, at the hearing before His Honour, Mr. Nickle was counsel for the respondent and Mr. Robb for the appellants.\nMr. NICKLE: My position is based on the definition of good faith, which is exactly what it says.\nHis HONOUR: Your position, Mr. Robb, is that the Anglin mortgage gave him an undue preference over other creditors?\nMr. ROBB: My position is that the chattel mortgage was taken for the express purpose of giving him a preference over other creditors.\nHis HONOUR: And not in good faith.\nMr. ROBB: And secondly, he had notice.\nHis HONOUR: I am going to need considerable assistance from counsel in regard to what is meant by good faith.\nHis Honour does not mention the matter in his report or reasons. We were informed that the point was argued before Wells J. but no mention is made of it in his reasons and no reasons were delivered by the Court of Appeal. On conflicting evidence His Honour found that the respondent registered his mortgage and advanced the sum of $3,800, to be mentioned hereafter, in honest ignorance of the existence of the chattel mortgages held by the appellants, and Wells J. has concurred in this finding. There is no doubt that the respondent gave valuable consideration and in my opinion we ought not to interfere with the concurrent findings that at the time of taking his mortgage, he was honestly ignorant of the existence of the appellants\u2019 mortgages. The decision of this Court in The Canadian Bank of Commerce v. Munro[2], particularly the passage at p. 311, quoted in the reasons of Wells J., makes it clear that if the respondent had had knowledge of the existence of the appellants\u2019 mortgages he could not be held to be acting in good faith; but it does not follow that proof of lack of knowledge is equivalent to proof of \u201cgood faith\u201d.\nAs none of the learned judges in the Courts below discuss the questions of fact and law involved in Mr. Williston\u2019s main submission, we must endeavour to find the relevant facts from the written record. After a perusal of all the evidence and the exhibits, I see no escape from the conclusion that, at the time of registering his mortgage, the respondent knew that Safeway Cleaners Limited, the owner of the goods in question, was insolvent and that the purpose of taking the mortgage was to give him security for a past-due and unsecured indebtedness, which constituted an unjust preference over the other creditors of that company.\nI refer particularly to the following matters:\nThe principal of the mortgage, $5,711.31, was made up of $3,800 advanced by the respondent to pay off a mortgage on the goods in question held by Trenton Finance Company dated February 5, 1951, $500 rent owed to the respondent, a further amount for rent, some interest, $632.15 paid by the respondent on a note he had endorsed for Cohen, and $636.86 owed to S. Anglin Co. Limited, a company of which the respondent was an officer. The last two items were overdue and unsecured. The respondent had pressed for payment repeatedly and unsuccessfully. On June 10, 1950, the solicitors then acting for Safeway Cleaners Limited wrote to S. Anglin Co. Limited, a letter reading as follows:\nJ. Dear Sirs:\nRe: Safeway Cleaners Limited, Kingston\nThe above named client would appear to owe you the sum of $1,040.48. First, would you verify to us the amount owing to you.\nSecondly, we would like to point out that the financial position of the above named is such that were it called to pay all its obligations now it could not do so and insolvency would result. The only assets of this Limited Company are its cleaning equipment, fixtures, etc., which are all covered by liens to creditors on a preferred basis. These preferred creditors as at present indicate that they will not seize or attempt to put this Company out of business. We have also reason to believe that the large creditors of this client will not put it out of business because they have some confidence that their debts will be reduced eventually, and are presently getting the benefit of selling to this Company on cash basis, and therefore making some profit.\nHowever, there are about 25 or 30 small creditors of claims from $25 to $150 roughly, and these quite properly have been pressing. If all these persons pressed together or if the Company attempted to pay them all, insolvency would result, and none of these creditors would get anything, being unsecured and secondary in preference to preferred creditors\u2014Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board, Income Tax Authorities, landlord, etc.\nWe wish to make it clear that this Company does not wish to default and feels that under present operations all creditors can be paid over a period of time. The credit position of this Company has improved in the last year by several thousands of dollars and based on present business should improve during the coming year.\nUnder these circumstances may we have an indication from you as to whether or not you would be content \u201cnot to rock the boat\u201d because the only certain result of rocking the boat is that you will get nothing whereas if the boat is not rocked, you stand a very admirable chance of getting paid off, although it may take two years to do it.\nThe acknowledgment of this letter, dated June 13, 1950, was signed by the respondent for S. Anglin Co. Limited.\nOn August 30, 1950, the respondent signed a letter on behalf of S. Anglin Co. Limited to the solicitors for Safeway Cleaners Limited reading as follows:\nGentlemen:\u2014\nRe: Safeway Cleaners Limited, Kingston, Ontario.\nIn answer to your letter of almost three months ago, we wrote you on June 13th re the above, who now owe us a much overdue account of One Thousand Three Hundred and Thirty-four Dollars and Eighty-six cents ($1,334.86). They also owe Charles S. Anglin several months rent. In our letter we suggested that a meeting of Mr. Cohen\u2019s creditors should be called. We feel that at such a meeting a plan could be mapped out to put the business on a paying basis. If this is not done very soon, we are afraid that the business will have to go into liquidation, and in that case there will be nothing left for the ordinary creditors, nor for Mr. Cohen.\nMr. Cohen has promised the writer to come to our office next week to discuss his affairs. In the meantime, we would like to have a letter from you giving us your suggestions.\nOn November 4, 1950, a copy of the financial statement of Safeway Cleaners Limited as of September 30, 1950, was sent to S. Anglin Co. Limited. The respondent had this in his possession when he obtained his mortgage. It showed total assets, excluding goodwill, of $32,317.95 and total liabilities, excluding issued capital stock, of $50,333.30. Of the assets $24,147.34 was made up of \u201cmachinery and equipment\u201d. All, or substantially all, of this was covered by the respondent\u2019s mortgage. As to its real value the respondent gave the following evidence:\nQ. What is your value of the machinery and equipment? You have got it now. A. At the present time?\nQ. Yes. A. It is not worth too much. It\u2019s old machinery.\nQ. How much do you say it was worth? A. You mean how much when I took the mortgage?\nQ. How much would it be worth if sold? What amount would it have raised for the benefit of creditors? A. I think $5,000 would be the limit.\nThe financial statement amply supports the opinion expressed by the respondent in his letter of August 30, 1950, that in the event of liquidation there would be nothing left for ordinary creditors.\nIn cross-examination of the respondent there are the following questions and answers:\nQ. Any further explanation you want to give with respect to that, because I suggest that you took this mortgage for the express purpose of protecting the goods mentioned in the mortgage with respect to the claims of S. Anglin Ltd. and Charles Anglin personally, which were unsecured. A. Charles Anglin personally was mortgagee.\nQ. Have you got any other explanation you want to make? A. Perhaps Mr. Nickle has.\nI have been unable to find any other explanation in the record.\nHaving reached the conclusion that at the time of taking his mortgage the respondent knew that Safeway Cleaners Limited was insolvent, that the mortgage covered practically all of its tangible assets, and that the purpose was to obtain an unjust preference over other creditors of Safeway Cleaners Limited, it is necessary to consider the question of law whether, in these circumstances, the respondent can be said to be \u201ca subsequent mortgagee in good faith\u201d within the meaning of subss. (1) and (11) of s. 24 of the Act.\nThese subsections read as follows:\n24.(1) Except as provided in subsection 2 and subject to section 28 every mortgage registered in pursuance of this Act shall cease to be valid, as against the creditors of the person making the same and as against subsequent purchasers and mortgagees in good faith for valuable consideration, after the expiration of one year from the day of the registration thereof unless, within 30 days next preceding the expiration of the said term of one year, a statement (Form 1), exhibiting the interest of the mortgagee, his executors, administrators or assigns in the mortgaged property, and showing the amount still due for principal and interest thereon, and all payments made on account thereof, is registered in the proper office, as mentioned in section 21, of the county, provisional county or district in which the mortgage was registered, with an affidavit of the mortgagee that the statement is true and that the mortgage has not been kept on foot for any fraudulent purpose.\n(11) Where a statement of renewal is not duly registered within the time prescribed by this section, the judge of the county or district court may permit the same to be registered at a later date upon being satisfied by affidavit, or affidavits, that the failure to register arose from misadventure, ignorance or some other cause which constitutes a reasonable excuse, and that the parties have acted and are acting in good faith, but in such case the renewal statement shall as against creditors of the mortgagor, or as against subsequent purchasers or mortgagees in good faith for valuable consideration who have purchased or have given credit after the expiry of the mortgage but before registration be deemed to have been executed and to be effective only from the date of registration, and, for the purposes of registration of any further statement of renewal, such statement of renewal shall be deemed to have been registered upon the actual date of registration.\nIn In re Jukes; Exparte Official Receiver[3], Wright J., dealing with a case under the English Bankruptcy Act, 1883, said at p. 60:\nBut I cannot help thinking that if a creditor of a debtor takes the whole, or substantially the whole, of the property of his debtor in payment of a past debt, and knowing that there are other creditors, he cannot be said to be acting in good faith.\nI agree with the reasoning of this passage and think it applicable to the case at bar where the respondent took substantially the whole of the property of his debtor as security for payment, inter alia, of his past-due debts knowing of his debtor\u2019s insolvency. I conclude therefore that in so far as the mortgage was taken as security for past-due debts the respondent was not a subsequent mortgagee in good faith within the meaning of that expression as used in the subsections quoted.\nThe question remains whether the respondent should be held to have priority to the extent of $3,800 which he paid to discharge the mortgage held by Trenton Finance Company. No question as to the validity of this mortgage was raised in the pleadings or at the trial and I understood counsel to argue the appeal on the assumption that at the time it was paid off it was a valid and subsisting charge on the goods in question. Not without hesitation, I have reached the conclusion that this part of the transaction falls within the principle stated by Gwynne J. in Campbell v. Paterson; Mader v. S. McKinnon & Co. et al.[4], and by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario in Hunt v. Long[5], and so may be treated as severable, and that the respondent\u2019s mortgage is entitled to priority over those of the appellants to the extent only of the actual cash advanced, $3,800, and interest thereon.\nI have not overlooked Mr. Williston\u2019s argument that the respondent\u2019s mortgage is bad in toto on the ground that his affidavit of bona fides stated that the mortgagor was indebted to him in the sum mentioned in the mortgage when in fact part of that sum was owed not to the respondent personally but to S. Anglin Co. Limited. In my opinion the proper inference to be drawn from the evidence is that the respondent in taking the mortgage was acting as trustee for S. Anglin Co. Limited, as well as for himself personally. In Light v. Hawley[6], the facts were similar. A chattel mortgage to secure a debt was made to a nominee of the creditor. There was nothing on the face of the mortgage or in the affidavit of bona fides to show the fiduciary position of the mortgagee but the mortgage was held to be valid. I agree with the statement of Meredith C.J. at p. 26, that the applicable principle is \u201cthat a mortgage may be given to one who has no beneficial interest in the debt secured by it, when the mortgagee is in fact a trustee for the person to whom the debt is due\u201d. For the above reasons I would allow the appeal to the extent of declaring that the mortgage of the respondent has priority over those of the appellants to the extent of only $3,800 and interest. Success has been divided and I would direct that there be no order as to costs in this Court or in any of the Courts below.\nLOCKE J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario which dismissed the appeal of the present appellants from an order of Wells J.[7], by which their appeal from the report of His Honour Judge Reynolds, Judge of the County Court of the County of Frontenac, was dismissed.\nOn September 10, 1953, the appellants caused a seizure to be made of certain chattels in the city of Kingston under a chattel mortgage granted to them on January 3, 1949, by one Cohen. On the same date, the appellant Hyman Rosen caused a seizure to be made of the same chattels under a chattel mortgage dated June 7, 1949, granted to him by Safeway Cleaners Limited.\nThe respondent Anglin claimed possession of the said goods under a chattel mortgage dated June 20, 1951, granted to him by Safeway Cleaners Limited and the said Cohen, claiming priority over the chattel mortgages of the appellants.\nThe bailiff by whom the seizure had been made applied for an interpleader order and on this application His Honour Judge Reynolds, in his capacity as local judge of the Supreme Court, directed that the claimants proceed to the trial of an issue in which the present appellants should be plaintiffs and the respondent defendant, and directing:\nthat the question to be tried shall be whether at the time of the seizure by the said bailiff William Tice the plaintiffs were entitled to seize, the goods and chattels seized in priority to the defendant, and whether the said mortgages to the plaintiffs were in priority to the mortgage of the defendant on the goods and chattels seized.\nThe order further directed that pleadings be delivered and the appellants delivered a statement of claim in the Supreme Court of Ontario asserting their claim to the chattels under the chattel mortgages mentioned and asking for a declaration that they were entitled to seize the goods in priority to the defendant and that their chattel mortgages were entitled to priority.\nBy the statement of defence, the respondent claimed priority under his chattel mortgage and asserted that the chattel mortgages of the plaintiffs were invalid as against him by reason of their failure to file renewal statements as required by s. 24(1) of The Bills of Sale and Chattel Mortgages Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 36. By way of counterclaim the respondent asked for a declaration that his mortgage be declared to have priority and alleged that the distress by the appellants was illegal and claimed damages.\nTo the defence the appellants replied that the respondent was not a mortgagee in good faith for valuable consideration and pleaded ss. 7 and 24(1) of the said Act. The defence to the counterclaim denied that the respondent had suffered any damages. On this defence the respondent joined issue.\nBy an order of Judson J. the trial of the action was referred to His Honour Judge Reynolds. By his report he found that the respondent was a mortgagee in good faith and for valuable consideration within the meaning of s. 24(1) and, accordingly, that his mortgage was entitled to priority over that of the appellants.\nThe present appellants appealed and written reasons were given by Wells J.[8] for his order dismissing the appeal and confirming the report. The appeal taken to the Court of Appeal was dismissed without written reasons.\nThe learned County Court Judge, after referring to the facts, found in terms that the present respondent had no notice, actual or constructive, of the appellants\u2019 mortgages at the time he took his chattel mortgage and, in reaching that conclusion, accepted the respondent\u2019s evidence in preference to that given by Cohen. Mr. Justice Wells, quoting the language of the report upon this aspect of the matter, said that having himself considered the evidence he would come to the same conclusion as had Judge Reynolds. As the learned judges of the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, it is apparent that they came to the same conclusion. Section 24(1), in so far as it affects the matter, reads:\n\u2026every mortgage registered in pursuance of this Act shall cease to be valid, as against the creditors of the person making the same and as against subsequent purchasers and mortgagees in good faith for valuable consideration, after the expiration of one year from the day of the registration thereof unless, within 30 days next preceding the expiration of the said term of one year, a statement (Form 1), exhibiting the interest of the mortgagee, his executors, administrators or assigns in the mortgaged property, and showing the amount still due for principal and interest thereon, and all payments made on account thereof, is registered in the proper office.\nIn considering the question as to whether the respondent was a subsequent mortgagee in good faith, the learned County Court Judge, as shown by his report, considered the mater only from the standpoint as to whether the respondent had notice at the time he took his chattel mortgage that the mortgages to the appellants were in existence and unsatisfied.\nOn the argument before us, however, while the accuracy of the finding that the respondent did not in fact know of the existence of those mortgages was not conceded, the main attack upon the judgment was put upon a different ground, namely that, at the time the respondent\u2019s mortgage was taken, Safeway Cleaners Limited was, to the knowledge of the respondent, in insolvent circumstances, that the mortgage was taken to enable him and S. Anglin Co. Limited, a company managed by him, to obtain a preference over other creditors of that company and that, in these circumstances, he could not be said to be a mortgagee in good faith.\nWe were informed upon the argument that this question was argued before Mr. Justice Wells but no mention is made of it in the reasons for his judgment dismissing the appeal.\nIn my opinion, this issue was not properly raised in the appellants\u2019 pleadings. In reply to the statement of defence which claimed priority for the respondent\u2019s mortgage, the appellants merely asserted that the defendant was not a mortgagee in good faith for valuable consideration. Whether upon the issue to be tried, as defined in the interpleader order, the question as to whether the respondent\u2019s chattel mortgage had been taken in order to obtain a fraudulent preference over the other creditors could have been raised is, in my opinion, very debatable. The pleadings, however, did not expressly raise the point and while some evidence was admitted that, in the year preceding the taking of the respondent\u2019s mortgage, he was aware that Safeway Cleaners Limited was in financial difficulties, and counsel for the appellants said at the hearing that it had been taken for the purpose of giving him a preference over the other creditors, the matter of the financial position of the company at the time the respondent\u2019s chattel mortgage was given was not gone into in any detail as, undoubtedly, would have been done had that issue been raised.\nIt was shown that the chattel mortgage taken by the respondent was drawn by his solicitors and that, before any money was advanced, they made a search of the records in the office of the County Court and found that no chattel mortgage or renewal of a chattel mortgage had been registered within a period of 12 months prior to that time. The amount for which the respondent\u2019s chattel mortgage was taken was $5,711.31. Of this amount, however, only $3,800 represented a present advance, that amount being loaned to enable the company to pay off a prior chattel mortgage held by Trenton Finance Company. The remainder consisted of $500 rent owing by the company to Anglin and an amount owing to S. Anglin Co. Limited. Had proceedings been taken to set aside the respondent\u2019s chattel mortgage on the ground that it amounted to a fraudulent preference over the other creditors, and had it been shown that the mortgagors were insolvent at the time the mortgage was given, to Anglin\u2019s knowledge, I would expect that upon the evidence it would have been held to be a good security only for the amount of the actual cash advanced: Campbell v. Patterson; Mader v. S. Kinnon & Co. et al.[9]\nThe argument addressed to us on this aspect of the matter does not, of course, ask for a declaration that the respondent\u2019s mortgage should be held invalid as a preference, its alleged invalidity on this ground being used only as a ground for urging that the respondent was not acting in good faith in taking the mortgage. In my opinion, that question is not in issue. I may say that if it had been open, my examination of the evidence would lead me to the conclusion that it was not shown that, at the time the respondent\u2019s mortgage was taken, the mortgagors, or either of them, were in insolvent circumstances.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed in part without costs, LOCKE J. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the plaintiffs, appellants: Malcolm Robb, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Webster & Webster, Kingston.\n[1] [1956] O.W.N. 248.\n[2] [1925] S.C.R. 302, [1925] 2 D.L.R. 928.\n[3] [1902] 2 K.B. 58.\n[4] (1893), 21 S.C.R. 645 at 653.\n[5] (1916), 35 O.L.R. 502, 27 D.L.R. 337.\n[6] (1897), 29 O.R. 25.\n[7] [1956] O.W.N. 248.\n[8] [1956] O.W.N. 248.\n[9] (1893), 21.

Section 38 of the statute (which first appeared as R.S.B.C. 1897, c. 62), before an amendment made by the provincial Legislature in 1938, was identical with s. 57 of the English Matrimonial Causes Act, 1857, and permitted the remarriage of a divorced person only after the determination of an appeal or the expiration of the time for appealing. Until the enactment of the British Columbia Divorce Appeals Act, 1937 (Can.), c. 4, the Courts in British Columbia had held that there was no right of appeal. Before the expiration of the time for appealing, the petitioner went through a form of marriage with the respondent in the Province of Alberta, where the respondent was then domiciled. The parties subsequently became domiciled in British Columbia. By her petition in these proceedings, the petitioner asked that her \"purported marriage\" to the respondent be declared null and void.\nHeld (Kerwin C.J. and Locke and Abbott JJ. dissenting): The petitioner was entitled to judgment.\nPer Taschereau, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ.: The enactment of s. 38 by the Legislature of British Columbia was unnecessary since s. 57 of the English statute was still operative in British Columbia. The incapacity to marry under s. 57 formed part of the substantive law of marriage and divorce in British Columbia which, although it was dormant so long as there was no right of appeal in divorce proceedings, became effective immediately upon that right coming into existence. There being no evidence that the general law of Alberta differed in this respect from that of British Columbia, the Court should have assumed that it was the same. Accordingly, at the time of her purported marriage to the respondent, the petitioner was under disability and the marriage was invalid.\nPer Rand J.: Section 57 of the English statute was introduced into British Columbia before Confederation as a substantive measure, although it remained procedurally inefficacious until provision was made for an appeal. On that footing, the provision was now operative in British Columbia.\nPer Kerwin C.J., dissenting: The history of the legislation showed that s. 38 of the British Columbia statute was an enactment by the Legislature of that Province, and it was ultra vires as legislation respecting \"Marriage and Divorce\", within head 26 of s. 91 of the British North America Act. It was not a mere matter of procedure but one of substantive law and had no relation to the solemnization of marriage in the Province.\nPer Locke and Abbott JJ., dissenting: Section 57 of the English Act was \"from local circumstances inapplicable\" in the Colony of British Columbia and was therefore not introduced with the general body of English laws in 1867. The provincial legislation was ultra vires and there was, therefore, no impediment to the petitioner's marriage with the respondent.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia [1], affirming a judgment of Wood J. [2]. Appeal allowed.\nW. G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., and J. J. Sutherland, for the petitioner, appellant, and the Attorney-General of British Columbia. J. M. Boucher and A. K. Boucher, for the respondent.\nD. H. W. Henry, Q.C., for the Attorney General of Canada.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting):\u2014The appellant, when a spinster, was married on August 10, 1943, to Albert Robert Douglas Hellens in Alberta, where each was resident and domiciled. Some time later the husband moved to British Columbia, where he established his domicile. The appellant secured a divorce from him by a decree of the Supreme Court of British Columbia in Divorce and Matrimonial Causes, dated November 18, 1948, but not entered until November 27, 1948. On January 19, 1949, the appellant married the respondent, Andrew William Densmore, in Alberta, where he was domiciled; whether the appellant was also domiciled there is immaterial. One child, a daughter, was born to them on November 9, 1949. In 1953 they moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, where they established their domicile. In March 1955, the appellant filed a petition in the Supreme Court of British Columbia in Divorce and Matrimonial Causes asking that what she described as her \"purported marriage\" to Densmore be declared null and void and that she be given the custody of the child.\nThe matter came before Wood J. who, after notice to the Attorney-General of British Columbia, who was represented by counsel, and to the Attorney General of Caanda, who did not appear, dismissed the petition without costs [3]. An appeal by the appellant and the Attorney-General of British Columbia (as intervenant) to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia was dismissed [4], the Court ordering the appellant to pay to the respondent, Densmore, his costs of the appeal. That Court granted leave to the appellant and to the Attorney-General of British Columbia to appeal to this Court and, by my order, the Attorney General of Canada was permitted to intervene.\nThe present proceedings originated in British Columbia, while the marriage to Densmore was celebrated in Alberta, but it was not suggested that there is any difference between the relevant law of the two Provinces. If there were, it might be pointed out that since it was not pleaded that the law of Alberta applies, it should have been presumed in the Courts below that it is the same as that of British Columbia. In any event this Court requires no evidence as to what laws may be in force at any particular time in any of the Provinces of Canada and the question before us is as to the validity of the marriage in Alberta in 1949 which, in turn, depends upon the effect of the divorce in British Columbia in 1948.\nCounsel for the appellant contends that the Densmore marriage is invalid because it took place on January 19, 1949, within the time limited for appealing from judgments, orders or decrees of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, i.e., 2 months from their entry: The Court of Appeal Act, R.S.B.C. 1936, c. 57, s. 14, as amended by 1946, c. 18, s. 2. Whether the Courts in British Columbia were correct in holding in several cases decided after British Columbia entered Confederation in 1871 that there was no right of appeal in matrimonial causes to the Court of Appeal need not be considered. By the British Columbia Divorce Appeals Act, 1937, c. 4 (now R.S.C. 1952, c. 21), the Parliament of Canada provided that the Court of Appeal for British Columbia should have jurisdiction to hear and determine appeals from an order, judgment or decree of a Court of the Province or a judge thereof having jurisdiction in divorce and matrimonial causes. Section 2 of c. 11 of the statutes of British Columbia, 1938, enacting s. 8A of the Court of Appeal Act, R.S.B.C. 1936, c. 57, is to the same effect, with an added provision (subs. (2)) that: \"The practice and procedure governing appeals to the Court of Appeal from a judgment or order of the Supreme Court or a Judge thereof shall apply to appeals to the Court of Appeal in divorce and matrimonial causes.\"\nThe divorce decree of November 18, 1948, dissolved the marriage to Hellens and made such dissolution absolute, but by its terms it was \"subject to Section 38 of the Divorce and Matrimonial Causes Act, being Chapter 76 of the Revised Statutes of British Columbia\", (i.e., the Revised Statutes of 1936). The Revised Statutes of 1948 did not come into force until February 7, 1949, and therefore do not concern us. Section 38 reads as follows:\n38. When the time hereby limited for appealing against any decree dissolving a marriage shall have expired, and no appeal shall have been presented against such decree, or when any such appeal shall have been dismissed, or when in the result of any appeal any marriage shall be declared to be dissolved, but not sooner, it shall be lawful for the respective parties thereto to marry again, as if the prior marriage had been dissolved by death: Provided always that no clergyman in holy orders of the United Church of England and Ireland shall be compelled to solemnize the marriage of any person whose former marriage may have been dissolved on the ground of his or her adultery, or shall be liable to any suit, penalty, or censure for solemnizing or refusing to solemnize the marriage of any such person.\nBy c. 13, s. 3, of the 1938 statutes s. 38 was amended by striking out the word \"hereby\" in the first line.\nThe history with reference to this section is curious. It suffices to commence with s. 2 of Ordinance no. 7, dated March 6, 1867, of the Colony of British Columbia (republished as no. 70 in the Compiled Law of British Columbia, 1871):\nFrom and after the passing of this Ordinance the Civil and Criminal Laws of England as the same existed on the 19th day of November, 1858, and so far as the same are not from local circumstances inapplicable, are and shall be in force in all parts of the Colony of British Columbia.\nBy force of this ordinance the substance of the law with respect to divorce in force in British Columbia at the time of its entry into Confederation is that found in the Imperial statute \"An Act to amend the Law relating to Divorce and Matrimonial Causes in England\", 1857, c. 85, as amended by 1858, c. 108, so far as it was not from local circumstances inapplicable. British Columbia became part of Canada on May 16, 1871, and by virtue of the application to it of s. 129 of the British North America Act, 1867, the laws in force therein at that date were continued, subject, nevertheless (except with respect to such as were enacted by or existed under Acts of the Parliament of Great Britain or of the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland) to be repealed, abolished or altered by the Parliament of Canada or by the Legislature of the Province according to their respective authority. In M., falsely called S. v. S. [5], the Full Court of British Columbia held that the Supreme Court of British Columbia had jurisdiction to grant a divorce in a proper case and this view was ultimately confirmed by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Watts et al. v. Watts [6]. Nothing germane to the present discussion occurred in British Columbia after 1871, when the Province entered Confederation, until 1897, when the Revised Statutes of British Columbia appeared. In that revision is found c. 62 intituled \"An Act to amend the law relating to Divorce and Matrimonial Causes in England\" (the same title, it may be noted, as that of the Imperial Act of 1857), containing 48 sections of the Imperial Act, including s. 57, which is s. 40 in the revised statute. However incongruous this is, s. 6 of \"An Act respecting the Revised Statutes of British Columbia\", 1897 (B.C.), c. 41, provides that on a day to be named by proclamation of the Lieutenant-Governor in council, the roll containing the statutes shall \"come into force and effect as and by the designation of \"The Revised Statutes of British Columbia, 1897' to all intents as if the same were expressly embodied in and enacted by this Act to come into force and have effect on, from, and after such day\". The necessary proclamation was promulgated.\nIf the proper conclusion be that the Legislature merely inserted c. 62 in the 1897 revision as a matter of convenience, then s. 57 of the Imperial Act (and hence s. 40 of R.S.B.C. 1897, c. 62) was, because of local conditions, not in force. In fact a mere reading of the provisions of the Imperial Act and of the British Columbia statute discloses that many of them could not apply to British Columbia for various reasons, including the references to certain Courts in England which did not exist in British Columbia. Section 57 of the Imperial Act and s. 40 of c. 62 of R.S.B.C. 1897, c. 62, and s. 38 as it appeared in R.S.B.C. 1936, c. 76, before its amendment by 1938, c. 13, are the same.\nHowever, in view of s. 6 of c. 41 of the 1897 annual statutes of British Columbia, I cannot escape the conclusion that the British Columbia Legislature did enact R.S.B.C. 1897, c. 62, and it therefore becomes necessary to consider the validity of s. 40 thereof. If at that time it was beyond the competence of the Legislature it cannot affect the matter that subsequently there was a Court in the Province to which an appeal from a decree of divorce might be taken.\nIn my opinion it was ultra vires. Under head 26 of s. 91 of the British North America Act, \"Marriage and Divorce\" is within the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada. Under head 12 of s. 92, \"The Solemnization of Marriage in the Province\" is within the competence of a provincial Legislature and, under head 14, \"The Administration of Justice in the Province including the Constitution, Maintenance and Organization of Provincial Courts, both of Civil and Criminal Jurisdiction, and including Procedure in Civil Matters in those Courts\". This was not a mere matter of procedure, but one of substantive law and has no relation whatsoever to the solemnization of marriage: In re Marriage Legislation in Canada [7]; The Attorney General for Alberta and Neilson v. Underwood [8]. There is no inconsistency between the decision of the President of the Probate Division in Warter v. Warter [9] and the decision of the High Court of Australia in Miller v. Teale [10], on the one hand, and that of the Judicial Committee in Marsh v. Marsh [11], on the other. In fact the latter must be read with care in view of what was there in issue and the Australian case depends upon the constitution of that country, which differs from ours.\nThe appeal should be dismissed subject only to a variation as to costs. There should be no costs in this Court or in either of the Courts below. At the present time the child is in the actual custody of the appellant and she should be left to take what proceedings she may be advised, if any, in that connection.\nThe judgment of Taschereau, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal, brought pursuant to leave granted by the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, from a judgment of that Court [12] affirming a judgment of Wood J. [13] whereby the petition of the appellant, asking that her purported marriage to the respondent be declared null and void, was dismissed.\nThe view of the facts on which the Courts below acted may be briefly stated. On August 10, 1943, the appellant, who was then a spinster, was married in the Province of Alberta to Albert Hellens. On November 18, 1948, on her petition, a judgment was pronounced by Whittaker J. in the Supreme Court of British Columbia dissolving the lastmentioned marriage. This judgment was entered on November 27, 1948. On January 19, 1949, the appellant went through a form of marriage in Alberta with the respondent. On November 9, 1949, a daughter was born of this union. On March 10, 1955, the appellant left the respondent and has since then resided and worked in Alberta.\nThe Courts below have proceeded on the footing that, while prior to the commencement of the divorce proceedings against Hellens he and the appellant had become domiciled in British Columbia, she acquired a domicile of choice, or regained her domicile of origin, in Alberta immediately upon the granting of the divorce and so was domiciled in Alberta at the time of going through the form of marriage there with the respondent. At the commencement of the present proceedings the respondent had acquired a domicile in British Columbia.\nIt should be mentioned that counsel for the Attorney General of British Columbia stated that he made no admission as to the domicile of the appellant at the time of her marriage to Densmore, but neither he nor any other counsel asked that any of the findings of fact recited above should be varied. In dealing with the questions of law I will therefore proceed on the assumption that the facts are as stated above.\nThe time limited for appealing against the judgment dissolving the marriage of the appellant to Hellens was 2 months from the date of the entry of that judgment. The appellant's purported marriage to the respondent was therefore solemnized before the time limited for appealing against that judgment had expired, and the question is whether by reason of that fact her purported marriage to the respondent is void.\nBy the English Law Ordinance, 1867, Ordinances of British Columbia, 30 Vict., no. 7, it was enacted that from and after its passing \"the Civil and Criminal Laws of England as the same existed on the 19th day of November, 1858, and so far as the same are not from local circumstances inapplicable, are and shall be in force in all parts of the Colony of British Columbia\".\nUp to May 16, 1871, the date on which British Columbia became part of the Dominion of Canada, no legislation affecting the question before us had been passed in the colony.\nA number of decisions culminating in that of the Judicial Committee in Watts et al. v. Watts [14], have established that the Supreme Court of British Columbia has jurisdiction to entertain a petition for divorce between persons domiciled in that Province, and that the jurisdiction is derived from the Matrimonial Causes Act, 1857, 20 & 21 Vict. (Eng.), c. 85.\nUntil 1885, no Court to hear appeals had been constituted in British Columbia. In his reasons for judgment Sidney Smith J.A. reviews the decisions which have held that even after a Court with appellate jurisdiction was constituted no appeal lay from a judgment in a divorce action. I share the view of the learned justice of appeal that it is not necessary in this appeal to express an opinion as to the correctness of those decisions since the existence of the right of appeal in divorce actions has been put beyond controversy by the British Columbia Divorce Appeals Act, 1937 (Can.), c. 4 (now R.S.C. 1952, c. 21), and the Court of Appeal Act Amendment Act, 1938 (B.C.), c. 11, which was made retroactive to February 23, 1937. It appears to me to be equally unnecessary to express an opinion as to whether either of the two last-mentioned enactments was necessary.\nThe course followed by the Legislature of British Columbia in regard to the Matrimonial Causes Act, 1857, is traced in the reasons of Sidney Smith J.A. and it will be sufficient, for the purpose of understanding the grounds on which the learned justices in the Courts below based their conclusions, to point out that commencing with the revision of 1897 that Act with some sections omitted was printed in the Revised Statutes of British Columbia. In 1897 s. 57 of the English Act was printed without alteration as s. 40 of c. 62. It appeared in the same form and with the same section number in R.S.B.C. 1911, c. 67, and in R.S.B.C. 1924, c. 70. In R.S.B.C. 1936, c. 76, it appeared, still in its original form, as s. 38, reading as follows:\n38. When the time hereby limited for appealing against any decree dissolving a marriage shall have expired, and no appeal shall have been persented against such decree, or when any such appeal shall have been dismissed, or when in the result of any appeal any marriage shall be declared to be dissolved, but not sooner, it shall be lawful for the respective parties thereto to marry again, as if the prior marriage had been dissolved by death: Provided always that no clergyman in holy orders of the United Church of England and Ireland shall be compelled to solemnize the marriage of any person whose former marriage may have been dissolved on the ground of his or her adultery, or shall be liable to any suit, penalty or censure for solemnizing or refusing to solemnize the marriage of any such person.\nSection 3 of the Divorce and Matrimonial Causes Act Amendment Act, 1938 (B.C.), c. 13, reads as follows:\n3. Section 38 of said chapter 76 [i.e., c. 76 of R.S.B.C. 1936] is amended by striking out the word \"hereby\" in the first line.\nIt should be mentioned that the operative part of the formal judgment of Whittaker J., dissolving the first marriage of the appellant, is as follows:\nThis Court Doth Adjudge And Decree that the marriage had and solemnized on the 10th day of August 1943 at Grande Prairie in the Province of Alberta between your Petitioner, Emmy Gudrun Hellens and the Respondent, Albert Robert Douglas Hellens, be and the same is hereby dissolved, by reason that since the celebration thereof, the said Respondent, Albert Robert Douglas Hellens, has been guilty of adultery with the Woman Named, Olive Roller.\nAND THIS COURT DOTH ORDER AND ADJUDGE that the said Decree of Dissolution of marriage be and is hereby made absolute.\nPROVIDED THAT THIS DECREE shall be subject to Section 38 of the Divorce and Matrimonial Causes Act, being Chapter 76 of the Revised Statutes of British Columbia.\nAt the trial Wood J. was of opinion (1) that the amendment of 1938, striking out the word \"hereby\" in s. 38, created an incapacity to marry which did not previously exist and was ultra vires of the provincial Legislature as being in relation to \"Marriage and Divorce\", and (ii) alternatively, that if the amendment could be regarded as legislation in relation to the \"Solemnization of Marriage in the Province\" it would not affect a marriage solemnized in Alberta. He accordingly dismissed the petition.\nIn the Court of Appeal, O'Halloran, Davey and Coady JJ.A. were of opinion that the appeal failed. Sidney Smith and Sheppard JJ.A., dissenting, would have allowed the appeal and declared the marriage void.\nCoady J.A., with whom O'Halloran J.A. and, subject to certain observations, Davey J.A. agreed, did not find it necessary to decide whether the amendment of s. 38 in 1938 was intra vires of the Legislature. Assuming its validity, he stated that there were two views as to its effect, (i) that the decree dissolving the marriage, while restoring the parties to the status of single persons, is conditional and inconclusive until the time for appealing has expired with a consequential residual incapacity inherent in and arising from the decree itself\u2014a continuation of the incapacity which existed during the marriage and operates to prevent the parties from remarrying; and (ii) that the decree dissolving the marriage was final and complete in every respect and restored the parties to the status of single persons but that by another provision in the statute under which the decree was granted there has been enacted an impediment on remarriage separate and distinct from the divorce decree. The learned justice of appeal did not have to choose between these views as he went on to hold that there being no evidence as to the law of Alberta, the Court ought not to assume that the Courts of that Province would give effect either to the incapacity mentioned in the first view or to the impediment mentioned in the second.\nThe main ground upon which Sidney Smith J.A. proceeded was that the enactment and amendment of s. 38 by the Legislature were unnecessary as s. 57 of the Imperial Act continues to operate in British Columbia mutatis mutandis, that the incapacity to marry, until the time for appealing from a decree dissolving a marriage has expired or in the result of any appeal a marriage has been declared dissolved, forms part of the substantive law of marriage and divorce in British Columbia which, while dormant so long as there was no right of appeal, became effective immediately upon that right coming into existence. I agree with this conclusion and with the reasons for it given by the learned justice of appeal. It appears to me to follow from the reasoning of Gray and Crease JJ. in M., falsely called S. v. S. [15], and that of Martin J. in Sheppard v. Sheppard [16], approved by the Judicial Committee in Watts et al v. Watts, supra.\nThe nature and effect of the incapacity existing, under s. 57, until the time for appealing has expired was dealt with as follows by the Judge Ordinary in giving the judgment of the Court in Chichester v. Mure [17]:\nThe introduction of such a clause [i.e., a clause permitting remarriage] into divorce Bills probably caused the Legislature to make express provision as to the consequences of a decree of dissolution of marriage pronounced by the Court about to be created. If no express power to marry again had been given, it might have been argued, from the practice in divorce Bills, that no such power was conferred by the decree of the Court; and certainly, if no such power had been expressly given, and it had been enacted that it should not be lawful for the parties to marry again until a certain time had elapsed after the making of the decree, a marriage solemnized before that time would have been void, for the parties would have been thereby rendered incompetent to contract. Thus, if by the 57th section it had been enacted \"that it shall not be lawful for the respective parties to a marriage dissolved by a decree of this Court to marry again before the expiration of a certain time,\" no doubt could have existed as to the prohibitory effect of those words; it seems to us their meaning and effect must be held to be the same, although they are preceded by words making it lawful to marry after the expiration of that time.\nIn Warter v. Warter [18], Sir James Hannen, dealing with the effect of a provision in the Indian Divorce Act substantially the same as that contained in s. 57 of the Imperial Act, said at p. 155:\nMrs. Tayloe was subject to the Indian law of divorce, and she could only contract a valid second marriage by shewing that the incapacity arising from her previous marriage had been effectively removed by the proceedings taken under that law. This could not be done, as the Indian law, like our own, does not completely dissolve the tie of marriage until the lapse of a specified time after the decree. This is an integral part of the proceedings by which alone both the parties can be released from their incapacity to contract a fresh marriage. This reasoning was approved and adopted in the judgment of the majority of the High Court of Australia (Dixon C.J. and McTiernan, Fullagar and Taylor JJ.) in Miller v. Teale [19], a judgment which, in my opinion, correctly states the law, both as to the nature and effect of the incapacity to remarry pending the expiration of the time limited for appealing against a decree dissolving a marriage which results from s. 57 of the Imperial Act, and as to the recognition of that incapacity by the Courts of jurisdictions other than that in which the decree was pronounced.\nIn Brown v. Brown [20], the Court of Appeal for British Columbia was composed of the same five learned justices of appeal who heard the appeal in the present case and their reasons appear to indicate agreement with the view expressed by Sidney Smith J.A. in the case at bar as to s. 57 forming part of the substantive law of British Columbia and as to the nature of the incapacity to remarry resulting from it. If I have understood the reasons in Brown v. Brown correctly, it would appear that in the case at bar the Court of Appeal would have been unanimous in holding the appellant's marriage to the respondent void, but for the circumstances that at the time it was solemnized the appellant was domiciled, and the marriage ceremony was performed, in a jurisdiction other than British Columbia.\nIn my opinion the majority in the Court of Appeal in the case at bar erred in holding that the petition failed because of the lack of evidence as to the law of Alberta. In the absence of such evidence the British Columbia Court should proceed on the basis that in Alberta the general law, as distinguished from special statutory provisions, is the same as that of British Columbia. It is the general law which determines whether the Courts of one jurisdiction will recognize an incapacity to remarry until the lapse of a specified time forming an integral part of the proceedings of the Courts of another jurisdiction dissolving a former marriage of the parties, and I have already expressed my opinion that that general law is correctly stated in Warter v. Warter, supra, and in Miller v. Teale, supra. I refer particularly to the judgment of the majority in the lastmentioned case at p. 94:\nIn English law a restraint on remarriage so as to allow time for appealing appears to be regarded as designed to give a provisional or tentative character to the decree dissolving the marriage so that it does not yet take effect in all respects. It is regarded as ancillary to the provision of the law which for a comparatively brief time makes the decree absolute for dissolution contingently defeasible in the event of appeal. It is as if there is a residual incapacity to remarry arising out of the previous marriage and not yet removed by the process provided for dissolving it.\nAs the foreign law effecting the dissolution which alone sets the party free to marry treats the dissolution as incomplete and not yet productive of that consequence, the law by which the validity of the subsequent marriage is determined cannot disregard it. And that will be so whether the question is referred to the lex domicilii as a matter of capacity, or is governed by the lex loci celebrationis as one of the essentials to the marriage.\nIn the case at bar, the assumption that the general law of Alberta on the points which are decisive of this appeal is the same as that of British Columbia is well-founded. The law of both Provinces in these matters is, in my opinion, accurately stated in Warter v. Warter, supra, and Miller v. Teale, supra.\nI do not find it necessary to express an opinion on the questions other than those dealt with above which were discussed before us.\nFor the above reasons I would allow the appeal and direct that judgment be entered declaring that the purported marriage of the appellant to the respondent solemnized on January 19, 1949, is null and void. At the present time the child is in the actual custody of the appellant and the parties are left to take such proceedings, if any, as they may be advised in that connection. Counsel informed us that in the event of the appeal succeeding neither the appellant nor the Attorney-General of British Columbia would ask for costs. I would direct that there be no order as to the costs of any party or of the intervenants in any Court.\nRAND J.:\u2014This appeal raises a question in the law of divorce of British Columbia: it is whether a clause in a decree restraining remarriage of the parties until the conclusion of an appeal that is or might be taken is valid. In Watts et al. v. Watts [21], the Judicial Committee held that the adoption by the Province in 1858 of the law of England as it then existed embraced the substantive law of divorce as prescribed by the Matrimonial Causes Act, 1857 (Eng.), c. 85; and that it was within the jurisdiction of the provincial Supreme Court of that time to enforce it. An examination of that statute shows the special tribunals and procedures provided, and in many respects they were deeply involved with the substantive provisions. The holding stands, as I view it, for the enactment by adoption of those provisions as they are fairly to be drawn from the statute, and that the law so adopted is to be accommodated to the judicial organs administering the law generally in the Province. But the provision of the Matrimonial Causes Act which forbade remarriage pending the period within which an appeal from the special Court set up could be brought to the House of Lords was an essential incident of the decree: is the law of the latter to be held to be adopted but the annexed disability disregarded? I am unable to agree that law adopted in such a wide and general fashion is to be so interpreted.\nThe governing fact is the intention of the adopting legislature: is it to be taken to have intended to introduce only those positive provisions that at the moment could, in accordance with their precise language and by the existing juridical machinery, be carried into execution? The Province was in its infancy: divorce was unknown to its judicature; the blanket law gathered up by the enactment was, by the principle then and now applied, to be confirmed or rejected by the Courts as it was or was not adjudged to be appropriate to the social conditions of the Province, an act of judicial legislation involving adaptation. That with the increase of population and the general development of its political, social and economic life, the apparatus of justice would undergo major modifications must be attributed to the understanding of the legislators; and that with the extension of the court system after the patterns then in existence in England and the United States, such a provision originally inoperative because of the absence of an appeal Court within the Province would then become efficacious through the furnishing of procedure is, in my opinion, the sound view of what was intended to be done. It was impossible for the legislators, lacking omniscience, at that time to appreciate the particulars of such a body of law: their idea was to introduce rules of civil order and relations which the experience of England had converted into law. The Province was not at that moment contemplating a constitutional change which would take it out of its power thereafter to deal with divorce; what was intended was to infuse the life of the Province with the matured rules of conduct of an older society to which resort, present or future, could be made: to fill, as it were, the lacunae in its legal order. I see nothing incompatible with a legal system in the early stages of organization that laws be so enacted generally even though at the time the machinery for enforcement is not then in existence. The adopted restraint, for example, would be during the time of appeal as and when that should be available. If for some reason an appeal, existing in 1858, were temporarily abrogated, would the substantive rule thereupon disappear? I should say not.\nFor these reasons, I take the provision restraining remarriage pending appeal to have been introduced as a substantive measure; and that it remained procedurally inefficacious until, by provincial law, provision was made for appeal. That after Confederation a right of appeal could be given by provincial law appears to me to be unquestionable although the opposite opinion seems to have been held in the provincial Courts: the administration of justice by the Province surely extends to the final determination within the Province of the judgments of its own Courts. But in the circumstances of this case, the particular jurisdiction giving an appeal would be irrelevant to the question of adoption.\nOn that footing, the provision is now operative within the Province. I agree that it is not law relating to solemnization of marriage. I take the decree of divorce to be absolute, with a disability imposed on the parties rendering them incapable of entering into another marriage during the time prescribed: Marsh v. Marsh [22] by Lord Goddard:\nThis, of course, assumes that the decree absolute was a valid decree, and on that assumption the question admits of only one answer. It dissolved the marriage from the moment it was pronounced, and at the date when the appeal by the intervener abated it stood unreversed. The fact that neither spouse could remarry until the time for appealing had expired in no way affects the full operation of the decree. It is a judgment in rem, and unless and until a court of appeal reversed it the marriage was for all purposes at an end.\nIn Miller v. Teale [23], at pp. 93-4, language is used which is argued to treat the effect of the provision as withholding full force to the decree until disposed of in relation to appeal. The last sentence seems to state the pith of the idea: \"It is as if there is a residual incapacity to marry arising out of the previous marriage and not yet removed by the process provided for dissolving it\". I am disposed to accept the view of Lord Goddard. The conception of a \"residual incapacity\" withheld from the force of the decree seems to me to retain an incident when that to which it is annexed, the marriage, has ceased to exist.\nThat being the provincial law before Confederation, it became thereafter law as if enacted by Parliament. As paramount law, it would determine the capacity for marriage of the persons affected throughout Canada; and there could be no question of a Province not giving it recognition. Apart from questions of solemnization, with one source of law for marriage and divorce, personal capacity or incapacity is the same throughout the nation.\nI would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of Wood J., and direct a declaration that the remarriage in Alberta was a nullity. There will be no costs. At the present time the appellant has the actual custody of the child in relation to whom the parties should be left to take whatever proceedings, if any, they may be advised. The judgment of Locke and Abbott JJ. was delivered by\nLOCKE J. (dissenting):\u2014 This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia [24] by which the appeal of the present appellant from a judgment of the late Mr. Justice Wood dismissing the petition [25] was dismissed. Sidney Smith and Sheppard JJ.A., dissenting, would have allowed the appeal and granted to the petitioner the relief sought.\nThe facts proven by the evidence, in so far as it is necessary to consider them, are as follows:\nOn August 10, 1943, the appellant was married at Grande Prairie, Alberta, to A. R. D. Hellens.\nOn November 18, 1948, a decree dissolving the said marriage was granted in the Supreme Court of British Columbia at Cranbrook. The decree was entered on November 27, 1948. After declaring the marriage to be dissolved, the decree read in part:\nAND THIS COURT DOTH ORDER AND ADJUDGE that the said Decree of Dissolution of marriage be and is hereby made absolute.\nPROVIDED THAT THIS DECREE shall be subject to Section 38 of the Divorce and Matrimonial Causes Act, being Chapter 76 of the Revised Statutes of British Columbia.\nThe reference in the decree was to c. 76 of R.S.B.C. 1936. The section, as contained in the revised statutes of that year, is a replica of s. 57 of the Matrimonial Causes Act, 1857 (Eng.), c. 85. After the revision of 1936, by c. 13 of the statutes of 1938, the Legislature assumed to amend s. 38 by striking out of the first line thereof the word \"hereby\" and, as thus amended, the section, so far as it is relevant, read:\nWhen the time limited for appealing against any decree dissolving a marriage shall have expired, and no appeal shall have been presented against such decree, or when any such appeal shall have been dismissed, or when in the result of any appeal any marriage shall be declared to be dissolved, but not sooner, it shall be lawful for the respective parties thereto to marry again, as if the prior marriage had been dissolved by death.\nAt the time of the entry of the decree, the time limited for appealing from a decree of divorce in British Columbia was 2 months from the time of entry On January 19, 1949, the appellant assumed to enter into a contract of marriage with the respondent Densmore at Edmonton, Alberta, this being before the expiration of the 2-month period above mentioned. It is admitted that on January 19, 1949, both the appellant and Densmore were domiciled in Alberta.\nThe appellant's petition, after stating the facts as to the two marriages and the divorce decree, and that a child was born of the marriage to Densmore, asked for a declaration that what was described as the \"purported marriage\" be declared null and void and that the petitioner should be awarded custody of the infant child. There was no allegation that under the laws of the Province of Alberta the contract of marriage with Densmore was a nullity and no reference to the laws of that Province was made.\nThe answer filed by Densmore asserted that the petitioner and the respondent were lawfully married at Edmonton at the time stated and that the petitioner's previous marriage to Hellens had been dissolved by the decree pronounced at Cranbrook. The respondent, in addition to asking for the dismissal of the petition, claimed custody of the child and a declaration that the infant was legitimate. No reference was made to the law of Alberta. It may, however, be fairly contended for the respondent that the allegation that the parties were lawfully married at Edmonton should be construed as meaning that they were married in accordance with the laws of that Province.\nThe matter came on for hearing before the late Mr. Justice Wood and it was apparently that learned judge who considered that a constitutional question arose for determination by reason of the amendment of 1938, by which an alteration was made in s. 38 of R.S.B.C. 1936, c. 76, above mentioned. Accordingly, he directed that notice be given to the Attorneys General of the Province and of the Dominion to enable them to be heard. It should be said that no evidence had been adduced by either of the parties to the litigation as to the law of the Province of Alberta as of January 19, 1949. Upon the ground that if the amendment of 1938 created an incapacity to marry which did not previously exist it was ultra vires, while if it had to do with the solemnization of marriage in the Province it did not affect marriages in Alberta, the learned judge dismissed the petition.\nThe Attorney-General of British Columbia, as intervenant, and the present appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal. The constitutional question was argued in that Court but Coady J.A., with whom O'Halloran J.A. concurred, and Davey J.A., who were agreed that the appeal should be dismissed, did not consider it necessary to determine it, considering that the petition should be dismissed in the absence of evidence that under the laws of Alberta the marriage entered into with Densmore was a nullity. Sidney Smith J.A. was of the opinion that deleting the word \"hereby\" from the section had neither taken away nor added anything to the section and that its effect was to create an incapacity to marry during the period limited for appeal. Sheppard J.A. considered that the section as amended dealt with a matter of procedure within head 14 of s. 92 of the British North America Act and was, therefore, within the legislative jurisdiction of the Province and that its purpose was to fix the time when the decree for divorce should become operative for the purpose of removing the incapacity to remarry.\nThe disposition of these important and difficult matters necessitates a consideration of the manner in which the jurisdiction in divorce and matrimonial causes is vested in the Supreme Court of British Columbia.\nBy Ordinance No. 70, made on March 6, 1867, the Governor of British Columbia, with the advice and consent of the Legislative Council of the Colony, enacted that:\nFrom and after the passing of this Ordinance, the Civil and Criminal Laws of England, as the same existed on the 19th day of November, 1858, and so far as the same are not from local circumstances inapplicable, are and shall be in force in all parts of the Colony of British Columbia.\nBritish Columbia became part of the Dominion of Canada by an order of Her Majesty in Council made pursuant to the terms of s. 146 of the British North America Act on May 16, 1871. By virtue of s. 10 of the Terms of Union and of s. 129 of the British North America Act, the laws in force in the Province at the time of its admission were continued, subject, except with respect to such as were enacted by or existed under Acts of the Parliament of Great Britain or of the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, to be repealed, abolished or altered by the Parliament of Canada or by the Legislature of the Province according to the authority of the Parliament or of that Legislature under the Act.\nIt was decided by the Full Court of the Province in M., falsely called S. v. S. [26], that the Supreme Court of British Columbia has in that Province all the jurisdiction conferred on the Court for Divorce and Matrimonial Causes under the Matrimonial Causes Act, 1857, 20-21 Vict., c. 85, as amended by 21-22 Vict., c. 108. While this decision was not followed by Clement J. in the case of Watt v. Watt [27], the jurisdiction of the Court was affirmed in the appeal taken to the Judicial Committee from that decision: Watts et al. v. Watts [28].\nAs head 26 of s. 91 of the British North America Act vests exclusive legislative authority in the Parliament of Canada in relation to divorce and as the Province is, accordingly, excluded from that field, save as to matters of procedure, it is to the Imperial statute that one must look to determine the extent of the Court's jurisdiction. In the Colony of British Columbia, the Governor and the Legislative Council might have legislated but they did not do so, and while Parliament has by the Divorce Act, 1925, c. 41, dealt in part with the subject-matter, nothing is contained in that legislation which affects the powers of the Court under the statute of 1857 as amended.\nMuch of that statute is inapplicable to British Columbia, such as the sections setting up a Court for Divorce and Matrimonial Causes, declaring who shall be the judges of that Court, defining the jurisdiction of the Judge Ordinary, and providing for appeals to the House of Lords. Section 57, where it read:\nWhen the Time hereby limited for appealing against any Decree dissolving a Marriage shall have expired,\nhad reference to the times for appeal limited in other sections of that statute, none of which are applicable. The question as to whether an appeal might be taken from a decree granted in British Columbia was considered by the Full Court of the Province in Scott v. Scott [29], which decided that there was no appeal in such matters to the Full Court. This decision was followed in Brown v. Brown [30].\nIn 1937 Parliament enacted as c. 4 the British Columbia Divorce Appeals Act, which declared that the Court of Appeal of the Province should have jurisdiction to hear and determine appeals from any judgment or decree of a Court having jurisdiction in divorce and matrimonial causes. In the year following, by c. 11, the Legislature of the Province amended the Court of Appeal Act by adding sections which declared the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal to hear such appeals, and directed that the practice and procedure governing appeals should be the same as applied to appeals from other judgments of the Supreme Court.\nIt was in the same year that the Legislature, by c. 13, assumed to amend s. 38 of R.S.B.C., c. 76 in the manner above indicated and to repeal s. 37 of c. 76, which was s. 55 of the Matrimonial Causes Act, 1857, verbatim and dealt with appeals from the Judge Ordinary to the Full Court in England.\nIt is to be remembered that the power vested in the Court to grant decrees of divorce is conferred by the statute of 1857 as amended and by c. 41 of the statutes of Canada for 1925. The Province, as pointed out, could not legislate on this aspect of the matter, though the course that has been followed in British Columbia since 1938 would rather indicate that the Legislature has assumed that it could do so.\nFor reasons which are not clear to me, part of the Imperial statute has appeared as a numbered chapter of the revised statutes of the Province since 1897, as if it had been enacted by the Legislature.\nThe preamble to the statute (c. 41) passed on May 8, 1897, which authorized the revision of that year, recites that\nit has been found expedient to revise and consolidate a new edition of the laws of this Province, including the Statute Law of England in force in and applicable here. The revision contained, as c. 62, an Act which bore the following heading: \"An Act to amend the law relating to Divorce and Matrimonial Causes in England.\" These words were preceded by the following: \"Imperial: 20 & 21 Victoria, Chap. 85; 21 & 22 Victoria, Chap. 108.\" The entire Act was not included and the numbers of some of the sections as they appeared in the Imperial statute were changed. Section 57 appeared as s. 40.\nFollowing the revision of 1897, by c. 40 of the statutes of 1898, the revision was approved. The Act, however, contains no specific reference to c. 62.\nIt is abundantly clear that while the Act was thus given a number as if it had been passed by the Legislature, the purpose was merely to include it as one of the Imperial statutes which, to the extent that it was not from local circumstances inapplicable, was in force in the Province.\nThe same course was followed in later revisions of the statutes and the Act appeared as c. 67 of R.S.B.C. 1911, c. 70 of R.S.B.C. 1924, c. 76 of R.S.B.C. 1936, and c. 97 of R.S.B.C. 1948. In all of these revisions the heading \"An Act to amend the Law relating to Divorce and Matrimonial Causes in England\" was retained. The description of the Imperial Act, by giving the reference to the statutes of 1857 and 1858, was omitted after 1897.\nIt should be noted that s. 37 of R.S.B.C. 1936, c. 76, which the Legislature assumed to repeal in 1937, was merely a replica of s. 55 of the Imperial statute, which provided that any person dissatisfied with any decision of the Court in any matter which, according to the provisions of that Act, might be made by the Judge Ordinary alone, might, within three calendar months, appeal therefrom to the Full Court. This was one of the many sections which were inapplicable to the Colony and to the Province of British Columbia and had never been in force in either. Thus, the Legislature was assuming to repeal a section of the Imperial statute, which was, of course, beyond its powers by virtue of s. 129 of the British North America Act above referred to: Dobie v. The Temporalities Board [31].\nAs appears, however, from the revision of 1948, s. 37 was excluded as if it had been repealed. Conceivably, this may have been done simply to indicate that the section was one of those which, by their terms, were clearly inapplicable, though other sections, such as ss. 1 and 3, still appear in the Revised Statutes of 1948.\nThe action of the Legislature in 1938 in assuming to strike out the word \"hereby\" from the opening phrase of s. 38 appears to have been done on the assumption that c. 76 was a statute of the Province of British Columbia which its Legislature might amend, rather than being a reprint of an Imperial statute in force in the Province. The amendment clearly cannot be supported on that basis and appears to me to be wholly ineffective, unless s. 38 of c. 76 is to be treated as part of an Act of the Legislature of British Columbia and the section itself as one dealing, as suggested by Mr. Justice Sheppard, with the procedure in civil matters in the Courts of the Province, and thus falling under head 14 of s. 92.\nIn my opinion, this cannot be done. As the above-recited history shows, the Legislature has never assumed to legislate on the subject of divorce otherwise than to provide rules for the exercise of the jurisdiction vested in the Supreme Court by the Imperial and the Dominion statutes, and, in the exercise of the further powers given by head 14, constituted the Court where such jurisdiction may be exercised. It may perhaps be suggested that in this indirect manner the Legislature, by the statute of 1938, was simply declaring the time at which divorce decrees granted in the exercise of the jurisdiction should become effective. This might, in my opinion, have been done by an Act dealing with the matter as one of procedure in the Courts, but this is not what was done, but rather an attempt to amend the Imperial statute.\nThe question to be determined is whether s. 57 of the Matrimonial Causes Act, 1857, was, in the language of Ordinance no. 70, \"not from local circumstances inapplicable\" to the Colony of British Columbia.\nThe portion of the section to be considered, since it prohibits remarriage within the time limited for appealing, affects the marriage status of those to whom it applies and is substantive law. It is not a matter of procedure. The date as of which this question is to be determined is, in my opinion, November 19, 1858. The disability, according to s. 57, remains until the time limited for exercising the right of appeal given by that section has expired or until any such appeal shall have been dismissed. The appeal sections, as I have pointed out, were held not to be applicable and there has been no suggestion on the argument before us that Scott v. Scott, supra, and Brown v. Brown, supra, were wrongly decided. The provisions of s. 57, which depended for their efficacy on the appeal sections thus found to have been inapplicable, must, in my opinion, be held equally inapplicable.\nSidney Smith J.A. has expressed the view that whether or not the 1938 statute, which assumed to delete the word \"hereby\" from s. 38, was intra vires, that section was in force in the Province and applied to the appeal provided for by the Dominion legislation of 1938. There is, I think, some support for this view to be found in a passage from the judgment of Martin J., as he then was, in Sheppard v. Sheppard [32] at p. 503, which, in turn, refers to a passage from the judgment of Gray J. in S. v. S., supra, and of Crease J. in that case. However, as the passage relied upon indicates, the learned judges in S. v. S. were talking about \"a partially dormant or abeyant principle of jurisdiction, to become effective later on as the machinery arrived\" and their consideration was not directed to a matter such as that to be decided in this case. It may be added that while the judgment of that learned judge, Martin J., was approved by the Judicial Committee in its judgment in Watts et al. v. Watts, supra, that approval was directed to that portion of the decision which held that the Supreme Court of British Columbia had jurisdiction in divorce and not to any question such as the present one. In Brown v. Brown, which was decided by the Full Court of British Columbia the year following the decision in Sheppard v. Sheppard, it was not suggested in argument or in the judgments that what had been said by Martin J. in Sheppard's Case affected the matter.\nApplying the language quoted from the earlier cases, Sidney Smith J.A. has expressed the view that the part of the section creating the disability during the periods limited by the English sections should be regarded as having been in abeyance until the time in 1937 when the Dominion statute vested jurisdiction in the Court of Appeal to entertain such appeals, and the amendment to the Court of Appeal Act thereafter defined the manner of its exercise. Thus, while the language of the section by its very terms refers to a right of appeal which never existed in British Columbia, it would be applied mutatis mutandis from that date.\nAs to this, it is to be remembered that, from the time the Colony of British Columbia entered Confederation in 1871, the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada extended to marriage and divorce under head 26 of s. 91. The same legislature which passed the Matrimonial Causes Act, 1857, passed the British North America Act and, to give effect to the argument, it would be necessary to decide that the exclusive legislative authority in divorce matters given to Parliament by the later statute could be displaced by a provision in an earlier Act affecting marital status which had remained dormant from 1858 to 1938, but then came into force and became part of the substantive law of the Province. With the greatest respect, I think this to be unsound.\nThere was, in my opinion, no impediment to the marriage of the appellant and Densmore.\nThe question of the custody of the child should be dealt with in the Court of first instance.\nI would dismiss this appeal.\nAppeal allowed without costs, KERWIN C.J. and LOCKE and ABBOTT JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the petitioner, appellant, and for the Attorney-General of British Columbia, intervenant: Sutherland & Forbes, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Boucher & Sauer, Vancouver.\nSolicitor for the Attorney General of Canada: F.

(Suppliants) Appellants;\nand\nHer Majesty The Queen Respondent.\n1957: May 1, 2; 1957: October 1.\nPresent: Kerwin C.J. and Locke, Cartwright, Fauteux and Abbott JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nReal property\u2014Assistance to veterans\u2014Effect of conveyance of land\u2014Mines and minerals\u2014No express reservation in agreement\u2014Effect of acceptance and registration of transfer\u2014Incorrect reference to statute\u2014The Soldier Settlement Acts, 1917 (Can.), c. 21; 1919 (Can.), c. 71, s. 57\u2014The Public Lands Grants Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 224.\nLands were conveyed by the Soldier Settlement Board to the petitioners or their predecessors in title in 1919, 1920 and 1922 pursuant to agreements purporting to be made under the provisions of an order in council of February 1919 and the Soldier Settlement Act, 1917. The agreements were all made after the coming into force of the Soldier Settlement Act, 1919, which superseded both the earlier Act and the order in council. The 1917 Act contained no provision for the sale of lands to veterans, and the order in council, which did provide for such sales, made no reference to mineral rights, but the 1919 Act expressly provided in s. 57 that mines and minerals should be \"deemed to have been reserved\" from all sales and grants of land made by the Board, whether or not the deed so specified. By the petition of right, filed in 1953, the petitioners claimed the mineral rights in the lands on the basis of the original agreements or, in the alternative, under contracts alleged to have been made by them in 1949.\nHeld: The claims must fail.\nThe reference in the agreements to the 1917 Act and the order in council was rightly held by the trial judge to be a clerical mistake. In any case, there was nothing in either the order in council or the 1917 Act that conflicted with s. 57 of the 1919 Act, which must apply to all the agreements. Minerals were accordingly not included in the original grant.\nAn additional ground for rejecting the claims, in so far as they were based on the original agreements, was that in almost all cases transfers of the land, in each of which 'mineral rights were expressly reserved, had been issued, accepted and registered. In these circumstances, the rights of the settlers under the agreements merged in the transfers. Leggott v. Barrett (1883), 15 Ch. D. 306 at 309; Knight Sugar Company Limited v. The Alberta Railway and Irrigation Company, [1938] 1 All E.R. 266, applied.\nAs to the alternative claim, the facts did not establish the making of any agreement in 1949 and, although there had been statements by Ministers of the Crown that mines and minerals would be conveyed to soldier settlers who applied for them, there was no evidence of any order in council authorizing such a conveyance, which was essential under the Public Lands Grants Act. The onus was on the petitioners to show that such an order in council had been made, and they had not discharged this onus; on the contrary, the evidence established that none had been made. APPEAL from a judgment of Ritchie J. in the Exchequer Court of Canada 1, dismissing a petition of right. Appeal dismissed.\nGeorge H. Steer, Q.C., for the suppliants, appellants.\nF. J. Newson, Q.C., and P. M. Troop, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nLocke J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of Ritchie J. 2 delivered in the Exchequer Court, whereby the petition of right filed by the appellants was dismissed. The facts are reviewed at length in the reasons for judgment delivered at the trial and it is unnecessary to restate them.\nThe appellants' respective claims are based on the agreements of sale entered into by the soldier settlers with the Soldier Settlement Board in the years 1919, 1920 and 1922 and, alternatively, upon agreements claimed to have been made by the suppliants in the year 1949 with the \"Directors of Soldier Settlement\" for the sale to them of the mineral rights. These agreements, it is alleged in the petition, were made pursuant to an order in council, the date and terms of which, it is said, were unknown to them.\nThe agreements for the purchase of the various parcels of land entered into by the appellants Reese, Renton, John Lewis, Harper, Larsen, Roderick Lewis, Peter MacDonald, Nicholas, Bailey, Kerr and Stoutenberg, and by Andrew Liddle and Daniel Beaton, both of whom died prior to the commencement of the action, were all made after the date upon which the Soldier Settlement Act, 1917 (Can.), c. 21, had been repealed by the Soldier Settlement Act, 1919, (Can.), c. 71, which came into force on July 7 of that year.\nNotwithstanding this, the agreements, other than those made with Stoutenberg and John Lewis, contained, as para. 13, the following:\n13. This agreement of sale is given and received under the provisions of the Order in Council of the 11th of February, 1919, P.C. 299, and all the provisions of the said Order in Council and the Soldier Settlement Act , 1917, and any amendments now made or which may hereafter be made thereto, and of any Soldier Settlement Act of Canada hereafter passed which can or may be applicable hereto, shall apply to and form a part hereof as if actually incorporated and embodied herein and the Board and the Purchaser shall be entitled to the benefits and privileges conferred and subject to the duties and liabilities imposed by the said Order in Council, the Act and amendments thereto, or by any subsequent Act supplanting or supplementing the said Act.\nOrder in Council P.C. 299 was made on February 11, 1919, while the 1917 Act was in force, and, so far as it might be considered relevant to any issue in the action, authorized the Board to acquire suitable lands for settlement, either from the Government or from individuals or corporations, and to sell such lands to soldier settlers on terms denned with some particularity.\nThe Act of 1917 made no reference to the sale of lands or the mineral rights in lands. The 1919 Act, however, dealt with the matter of mineral rights in precise terms, s. 57 reading:\n57. From all sales and grants of land made by the Board all mines and minerals shall be and shall be deemed to have been reserved, whether or not the instrument of sale or grant so specifies, and as respects any contract or agreement made by it with respect to land it shall not be deemed to have thereby impliedly covenanted or agreed to grant, sell or convey any mines or minerals whatever.\nMr. Justice Ritchie has found that the inclusion of para. 13 was simply a clerical mistake occasioned by the fact that use was made of a form of agreement which had, by reason of the repeal of the 1917 Act, become obsolete.\nI find nothing in the order in council or in the 1917 Act which conflicts with s. 57 of the Act of 1919 and I agree with the learned trial judge that it applies to the agreements in question which were made with the individual settlers after the Act came into force. In the cases of Stoutenberg and John Lewis, whose agreements were executed respectively on May 29, 1920, and April 24, 1922, para. 13 was not included but, by a paragraph numbered 14, it was stated that the agreement was given and received under the provisions of the Soldier Settlement Act, 1919.\nWhile this finding is fatal to the claims of all of the appellants in so far as they are based upon the original agreements made with the Board, in my opinion a further complete answer to the claims other than those of William Kerr and of the estate of Daniel Beaton is that, some years prior to the institution of the action, transfers of the various parcels of land made under the provisions of the Land Titles Act, now R.S.A. 1955, c. 170, were given by the Soldier Settlement Board to the settlers and were accepted and registered and in each of them the mineral rights were expressly reserved. The rights of the settlers under the agreements, under these circumstances, in my opinion, merged in the transfers. In Leggott v. Barrett 3, James L.J. said, in part:\n\u2026 I cannot help saying that I think it is very important, according to my view of the law of contracts, both at Common Law and in Equity, that if parties have made an executory contract which is to be carried out by a deed afterwards' executed, the real completed contract between the parties is to be found in the deed, and that you have no right whatever to look at the contract, although it is recited in the deed, except for the purpose of construing the deed itself. You have no right to look at the contract either for the purpose of enlarging or diminishing or modifying the contract which is to be found in the deed itself.\nThis statement of the law was approved by the Judicial Committee in Knight Sugar Company Limited v. Alberta Railway and Irrigation Company 4.\nIn the case of Kerr, who received but did not register his transfer, and of the Beaton estate, where no transfer had been given up to the time of the commencement of the action, no question of merger arises. However, in my opinion s. 57 applies to the agreements in both of these cases.\nAs to the alternative claim\u2014the reference in the petition to the \"Directors\" was apparently intended to refer to an official described as the Director of Soldier Settlement in the form of application hereinafter mentioned.\nA document described as a \"News Release\" made by the Department of Veterans Affairs early in January 1949, was put in evidence, in which the Minister of Veterans Affairs and the Minister of Mines and Resources were quoted as having announced that veterans settled on the land under \"the Soldier Settlement Act of World War I\" who had completed or did complete their contracts were to be granted mineral rights on their property in all cases where the Soldier Settlement Board acquired those rights with title to the land. The two Ministers were also quoted as saying that the veterans would have until March 31, 1950, to make application for the mineral rights; that where title had not yet been given to a property, the mineral rights, with the surface rights, would be transferred upon settlement of the settler's indebtedness, and that where title to surface rights had already been transferred \"approval may be given to convey the title to mineral rights\".\nFollowing this announcement, correspondence ensued between the majority of the present appellants, or their solicitors, and the District Solicitor of the Soldier Settlement Board at Edmonton. It is apparent that the solicitor, Mr. L. S. Cutler, thought that an order in council had been passed authorizing the sale, of the mineral rights to the settlers, as he sent to several of them forms of an application, apparently prepared by someone on behalf of the Board, addressed to the \"District Superintendent, Soldier Settlement & Veterans' Land Act,\" which read in part:\nAs The Director of Soldier Settlement has now authority to accept from Soldier Settlers or if deceased their personal representatives, who purchased land or lands under the Soldier Settlement Act of 1919, applications for the issuance of a Grant of Title to the mines and minerals acquired with the Title to such lands, I hereby make application for the mines and minerals appurtenant to the land or lands hereinafter described which were purchased from the Soldier Settlement Board. The required fee of $25 is enclosed herewith.\nThe correspondence which ensued is set out at length in the judgment of Ritchie J. While the claims were not so pleaded, the appellants contend that these letters written by the District Solicitor constituted offers by the Crown. Even if that were so, and there is no evidence that Mr. Cutler was authorized to make any offer on the Crown's behalf, it is only in the cases of the appellant Peter MacDonald and that of the estate of the late D. W. Beaton that it can even be suggested that any agr\u00e9ment made out.\nIn the case of MacDonald, a letter was written to him by Cutler on January 20, 1949, saying that a recent order in council had provided that, soldier settlers who repaid their loans could obtain title to such mineral rights as were vested in the Director of Soldier Settlement and that it appeared from the Board's records that \"you are entitled to mineral rights as shown on the enclosed form of application\". A form of application, quoted above in part, was enclosed, and the letter asked him to complete it and return it with a fee of $25 when, it was said, a transfer conveying the mineral rights would be requested. MacDonald signed and sent the application with a cheque for $25, but the application was not accepted and, at a later date, MacDonald was advised that the mineral rights were not at any time owned by the Board. The accuracy of this statement is immaterial in these circumstances.\nThere was no evidence that an order in council had authorized the transfer of the mineral rights, and Cutler's statement that it would appear from the records that MacDonald was entitled to the rights was merely an expression of his opinion which, so far as the record shows, was inaccurate. His letter was not an offer, but rather an invitation to make an offer.\nAs to Beaton, he was informed by a letter from the District Solicitor, on February 7, 1949, that, on payment of the outstanding debt on his land, the director of Soldier Settlement would be prepared to transfer such mineral rights as were acquired by him and, alternatively, if he was unable to pay the indebtedness, the Department of Mines and Resources had been authorized, subject to the approval of the Director of Soldier Settlement, to dispose of the mineral rights by sale, provided the proceeds from such disposal were applied on Beaton's indebtedness to the Board. Beaton wrote that he was not able to pay up his indebtedness and did not want the mineral rights sold. Later he was advised that the mineral rights had not come into the possession of the Soldier Settlement Board and that it was not possible for the Board to deal with them, and there the matter rested. Clearly this correspondence discloses no agreement.\nIn one other case, that of the appellant John Lewis, a letter was written by Cutler saying that an order in council, of the nature above mentioned, had been passed and that it would appear that Lewis was entitled to mineral rights, and a form of application was sent to him. This again was an error on the part of the solicitor in so far as the letter referred to the order in council and was simply an expression of his opinion as to the settler's rights.\nThus it appears to me to be clear that, even if Cutler had been authorized to enter into a binding contract on behalf of the Crown, he did not purport to do so. It is to be remembered that by reason of s. 57 of the Act of 1919 sales of mineral rights could not be made by the Soldier Settlement Board. The Act of 1917, upon which the appellants sought to place some reliance, was an Act to authorize loans to soldier settlers and to enable them to obtain homestead entries and did not purport to authorize the sale of land. As Mr. Justice Ritchie has pointed out, in the absence of any other statutory provision, the sale of public lands may be authorized by order in council under the Public Lands Grants Act, now R.S.C. 1952, c. 224. I agree with the learned trial judge that the onus lay upon the appellants to show that such an order in council had been made and that this was not proven. On the contrary, the evidence of the witness Cunningham showed that no such order in council had been made.\nI would dismiss this appeal and with costs if they are demanded.\nAppeal dismissed with costs if demanded.\nSolicitors for the suppliants, appellants: Brownlee, Brownlee & Fryatt, Edmonton.\nSolicitor for the respondent: F.

(Defendant) Respondent.\n1957: May 15, 16; 1957: October 1.\nPresent: Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Cartwright, Fauteux and Abbott JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nCarriers\u2014Liabilities\u2014Fire on vessel\u2014Destruction of cargo\u2014Whether carrier liable\u2014The Water Carriage of Goods Act, 1936 (Can.), c. 49 (R.S.C. 1952, c. 291), s. 3 and sched., art. III(1), (2), art. IV(1), (2).\nWhile a ship belonging to the defendant company was loading in Halifax harbour, it was found that her scupper pipes were frozen and a contractor was engaged to thaw them. The contractor's employees used an acetylene torch, which set fire to cork insulation, of the existence of which the contractor had not been informed. Part of the cargo, belonging to the plaintiffs, was destroyed by the fire and the plaintiffs claimed its value. It was found as a fact that the cargo was stowed after the fire broke out but before it was discovered.\nHeld (Cartwright J. dissenting): The plaintiffs could not succeed.\nIn view of s. 3 of the Water Carriage of Goods Act, which expressly excluded any implied absolute warranty of seaworthiness, art. III(1) of the Rules under the Act must be construed as meaning that if the ship was unfit for the cargo before the loading of goods that were later lost, the carrier might escape liability by showing that it exercised due diligence in that regard. This onus had been discharged by the defendant in this case.\nFurther, the negligence or default, within the meaning of art. IV(2)(a), was that of the defendant's servants in the management of the ship rather than a want of care of the cargo. Kalamazoo Paper Company et al. v. Canadian Pacific Railway Company, [1950] S.C.R. 356, applied.\nDecisions of American Courts under the Harter Act of that country must be read with care, in view of the absolute obligation under that Act to provide a seaworthy ship.\nPer Cartwright J., dissenting: Under art. III(2)(a) and (c), the defendant was bound, before and at the beginning of the voyage, to exercise due diligence to make the ship seaworthy and to make the parts of the ship in which goods were carried fit and safe for them. It was clear on the findings of fact that the defendant stowed the plaintiffs' goods on an unseaworthy ship when the exercise of due diligence would have disclosed the fact that the ship was on fire. The carrier was responsible in law for the failure of his employees to exercise the due diligence required by the Rule. Carver, Carriage of Goods by Sea, 9th ed., p. 182, quoted with approval. The direct cause of the loss of the plaintiffs' goods was the action of the carrier's employees in stowing them in a ship which, because of the fire, was not fit and safe for their reception and carriage. The loss was not the direct result of a fire, within the meaning of art. IV(2)(b), or of the negligence of the defendant's servants in the navigation or management of the ship within art. IV(2)(a).\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Cameron J. 1 in the Exchequer Court of Canada, affirming a judgment of A. I. Smith D.J.A.2. Appeal dismissed.\nC. Russell McKenzie, Q.C., for the plaintiffs, appellants.\nL\u00e9on Lalande, Q.C., the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C. J. and Taschereau, Fauteux and Abbott JJ. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014On January 26, 1942, Canadian National Railways issued a through export bill of lading to the appellant Maxine Footwear Company Ltd., covering \"Three (3) Wooden Crates and One (1) Drum said to contain Shoe Leather and Shoe Findings\", addressed to Electric Shoe Repairing Co., the name under which the appellant J. Eric Morin carried on business at Kingston, Jamaica. The goods were carried by rail to Halifax and there loaded on the M.V. \"Maurienne\" for transportation to Jamaica. Morin assigned his interest in the bill of lading and in the goods to his co-appellant and the matter may therefore be dealt with, as it was by Mr. Justice Cameron, as if Maxine Footwear Company Ltd. were the only appellant. Mr. Justice Cameron also stated that the plea of the respondent that there was no lien de droit the parties was held by the judge of first instance, Mr. Justice Arthur I. Smith, District Judge in Admiralty, to be unfounded and that that finding was accepted by the respondent. Certainly the point was not pressed before us and I therefore disregard it.\nThe M.V. \"Maurienne\" arrived at Halifax on Saturday, January 31, 1942. On Tuesday, February 3, loading of the vessel's no. 3 hold was commenced and the loading of the vessel was completed about 8 p.m. on Friday, February 6, it being the intention that the ship should sail early the following morning. Mr. McKenzie argued that it was not shown that the appellant's goods were put on board before the commencement of the fire to be mentioned later. Mr. Lalande put it that there was no evidence that the goods were not on board at that time, although he submitted that, even if the evidence were clear on the point, then, unless the fact that there was a fire was evident, the respondent was free of liability on other grounds.\nThe appellant's goods were placed in no. 3 hold. Mr. Justice Smith stated that the loading of no. 3 hold was commenced on Tuesday, February 3, and completed on the evening of Friday, February 6. Mr. Justice Cameron found 3 that the loading of no. 3 hold commenced on Tuesday \"and the loading of the vessel was completed at about 8.00 p.m. on the evening of Friday the 6th\". It should be here explained that this action was commenced on May 11, 1943. Examinations for discovery were held in 1946. The trial commenced May 3, 1947, before Mr. Justice Cannon, who was then District Judge in Admiralty, but after the argument he became ill and died and by con-sent the evidence already taken was used before Mr. Justice Smith. Accordingly, the latter heard only the evidence of Isaac Joseph Tait to have the transcript of his previous evidence amended and some further testimony by that witness and, of course, none was heard by Mr. Justice Cameron. By consent the minutes of an investigation held by a legal adviser of the Canadian National Railways, shortly after the fire, became part of the evidence of the respondent. At that investigation the captain of the \"Maurienne\", Y. Salaun, was asked the following questions, to which he made the answers indicated:\nQ. You say you finished the loading of the cargo on Thursday in No. 3? A. At 8.00 Thursday night they had finished No. 3.\nQ. And everything was battened down? A. Yes.\nQ. It was all covered? A. Yes.\nQ. What did you have in the tween deck? A. I got shooks in the tween deck.\nQ. You had charge of the stowage of the vessel? A. The First Mate.\nQ. On Thursday what loading did you still have to do? No. 3 was finished; were any of the others finished? What about No. 1? A. It was finished a long time before. They went back to No. 4 and No. 2 the next day.\nQ. Then Thursday night No. 1 and No. 3 were completely loaded? A. Yes.\nFrancis Sim, the stowage clerk, was also examined. Under his direction the work of stowing the cargo in no. 3 hold was started on Tuesday, February 3, at 10 a.m. and finished 8.15 p.m. Friday, February 6. The stowage plan identified by Sim shows that the cargo for Kingston in no. 3 hold was put in the top, consisting of 78 sundries, 1,020 bags of salt and 250 shooks, with the bottom part containing 1,406 bundles of shooks and 3,100 bags of flour. The statements of this witness are not in conformity with that of the captain but he would know more about the stowage. Mr. McKenzie points particularly to that \u2022 part of his evidence at p. 53 of the record when he stated that he was there when the work was completed and that he made sure that no. 3 was closed. \"Sundries\" would presumably include the appellant's goods.\nUpon this record it should be held that the appellant's goods were not stowed until after the commencement of the fire, but even on that basis the appellant is not entitled to succeed. It is agreed that the Water Carriage of Goods Act, 1986 (Can.), c. 49 (now R.S.C. 1952, c. 291) applies. By s. 3 there is not to be implied in any contract for the carriage of goods by water \"any absolute undertaking by the carrier of the goods to provide a seaworthy ship\". By paras. 1 and 2 of art. III of the Rules:\n1. The carrier shall be bound, before and at the beginning of the voyage, to exercise due diligence to,\n(a) make the ship seaworthy;\n(b) properly man, equip, and supply the ship;\n(c) make the holds, refrigerating and cool chambers, and all other parts of the ship in which goods are carried, fit and safe for their reception, carriage and preservation.\n2. Subject to the provisions of Article IV, the carrier shall properly and carefully load, handle, stow, carry, keep, care for and discharge the goods carried.\nBy para. 1 of art. IV:\n1. Neither the carrier nor the ship shall be liable for loss or damage arising or resulting from unseaworthiness unless caused by want of due diligence on the part of the carrier to make the ship seaworhty, and to secure that the ship is properly manned, equipped and supplied, and to make the holds, refrigerating and cool chambers and all other parts of the ship in which goods are carried fit and safe for their reception, carriage and preservation in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article III.\nWhenever loss or damage has resulted from unseaworthiness, the burden of proving the exercise of due diligence shall be on the carrier or other person claiming exemption under this section.\nParagraph 2 of art. IV provides in part:\n2. Neither the carrier nor the ship shall be responsible for loss or damage arising or resulting from, (a) act, neglect, or default of the master, mariner, pilot or the servants of the carrier in the navigation or in the management of the ship;\n(b) fire, unless caused by the actual fault or privity of the carrier.\nIn view of s. 3 of the Act, para. 1 of art. III of the Rules must be construed as meaning that if before and at the beginning of the voyage the ship is unfit for the cargo before the commencement of the loading of the goods, for the loss of which a claim is made, the carrier may absolve itself by showing that it exercised due diligence in that regard. In my view, that onus has been met by the respondent. It appears that the scuppers connected with the galley, the toilet and the shower had become clogged with ice and at someone's direction (not Mr. Campbell, the one who was in charge at Halifax) a local firm was engaged to thaw out the scuppers. The ship was cork-insulated and that fact was not made known to the contractors. Each of the scuppers emptied on the starboard side of the ship and, after going straight in for 6 inches, turned at right angles. The contractor's employee applied the flame from an acetylene torch for about 5 minutes to each of the scuppers and I think there is no question that the fire originated by the flame from the torch igniting the cork insulation. The fire was not discovered for some time. There is also no doubt that whoever hired the contractors was negligent in not telling them of the cork insulation; that the contractor's employee was negligent in the manner in which he applied the flame; but Mr. Campbell, although inspecting the ship every day, had nothing to do with these acts of negligence nor was he derelict in his duty. Scuppers blocked by ice are common in the harbour of Halifax in the winter time. I agree with Mr. Justice Cameron 4 that \"neither the fact that the pipes were frozen nor that an acetylene torch was to be used to clear them was communicated to anyone who represented the carrier\".\nMoreover, within the meaning of para. 2(a) of art. IV, the negligence or default was that of the servants of the respondent in the management of the ship. The earlier cases are referred to in the judgments of this Court in Kalamazoo Paper Company et al. v. Canadian Pacific Railway Company; British Columbia Pulp & Paper Company v. The Same; Quatsino Navigation Company Limited v. The Same 5, and it is settled that the distinction to be drawn is one between want of care of cargo and want of care of vessel indirectly affecting the cargo. Here the frozen scuppers had nothing to do with the cargo, except incidentally and indirectly. For the reasons stated by Cameron J. the present case is distinguishable from Spencer Kellogg & Sons, Inc. v. Great Lakes Transit Corporation 6; and, in addition, decisions in the United States under the Harter Act must be read with care, in view of the absolute obligation under that Act to provide a seaworthy ship.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nCartwright J. (dissenting):\u2014The relevant facts are set out in the reasons of the Chief Justice and in those of the learned judges in the Courts below. I agree with the conclusion of the Chief Justice that the proper inference to be drawn from the evidence is that the appellant's goods were not stowed until after the commencement of the fire.\nA brief summary of the facts will be sufficient to indicate the question of law calling for decision.\nAt 3 p.m. on Friday, February 6, 1942, the \"Maurienne\" was loading general cargo at Halifax. Three of her scupper pipes were frozen but Cameron J. has found that this circumstance did not render the ship unseaworthy, that at the time mentioned she was in fact seaworthy, and that the holds and other parts of the ship in which goods were carried were fit and safe for their reception and carriage. These findings are supported by the evidence and should not be disturbed. Between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. the cork insulation of the ship was ignited. As to the cause of this Cameron J. says 7:\nBefore me, counsel for the respondent specifically admitted that the fire \"was due to the fault of an employee who had been there to thaw out the ice which was blocking the openings of a discharge line or pipe\". It might be stated here that there is no evidence that Hemeon\u2014the welder from Purdy Brothers who actually operated the acetylene torch\u2014was told anything about the cork insulation. His work was under the direct super- vision of the Fourth Officer who\u2014as well as the other ship's officers\u2014had knowledge of the cork insulation near which the thawing-out operation was conducted. I think that in view of the special risk involved, it was negligence on the part of the Fourth Officer not to adequately supervise the operation and also in his failure to make an inspection to ascertain whether the cork insulation had, in fact, been ignited. Both the Fourth Officer and Hemeon were employees the carrier and it was the negligence of one of these\u2014or of both\u2014that caused the fire. The Captain and Chief Engineer also had knowledge of the operation being carried out and of the proximity of the cork insulation thereto; it may also have been their duty to see that the operation was carried out in safety, but again, both are employees the. carrier.\nFor the purposes of this case it is sufficient to state that the evidence fully warrants the presumption that the fire was caused by the negligence of the employees of the carrier.\nThese findings also are supported by the evidence.\nThe fire started not later than 4 p.m. Following its commencement the appellant's goods were stowed and at about 8.15 p.m. all hatches were closed and battened down. The fire was not discovered until about 11 p.m. Efforts to control it were unsuccesful and on the following morning the ship was scuttled as the only means of extinguishing the fire.\nCameron J. found (i) that the thawing out of the scupper pipes with an acetylene torch was an act of the servants of the carrier, the respondent, in the management of the ship, (ii) that the fire was not caused by the actual fault or privity of the respondent, (iii) that the loss of the appellant's goods was \"the direct result of fire only\", and, (iv) that consequently the respondent was relieved from liability by art. IV, Rule 2, cls. (a) and (b) of the Water Carriage of Goods Act, 1936 (Can.), c. 49.\nIn my opinion, assuming the correctness of findings (i) and (ii), findings (iii) and (iv) do not necessarily follow.\nUnder art. III, Rule 1, cls. (a) and (c) the respondent was bound, before and at the beginning of the voyage, to exercise due diligence to make the ship seaworthy and to make the parts of the ship in which goods were carried fit and safe for their reception, carriage and preservation. No doubt up to 3 p.m. on Friday the requisite due diligence had been exercised but the duties of the carrier under the clauses mentioned are continuing and persist until the beginning of the voyage. It is clear that from some time not earlier than 3 p.m. and not later than 4 p.m., when the cork insulation had commenced to smoulder, the ship had ceased to be seaworthy and the holds had ceased to be fit and safe for the reception and carriage of goods. It is equally clear, on the findings of fact summarized above, that the respondent stowed the appellant's goods on an unseaworthy ship when the exercise of due diligence would have resulted in the discovery of the fact that the ship was on fire.\nThe carrier is responsible in law for the failure of his employees to exercise the due diligence required by art. III, Rule 1. In my opinion the effect of the authorities is correctly stated in the following passage in Carver's Carriage of Goods by Sea, 9th ed. 1952, p. 182:\n\"Due diligence\" seems to be equivalent to reasonable diligence, having regard to the circumstances known, or fairly to be expected, and to the nature of the voyage, and the cargo to be carried. It will suffice to satisfy the condition if such diligence has been exercised down to the sailing from the loading port. But the fitness of the ship at that time must be considered with reference to the cargo, and to the intended course of the voyage; and the burden is upon the shipowner to establish that there has been diligence to make her fit.\nIt is not enough to satisfy the condition that the shipowner has been personally diligent, as by employing competent men to do the work. The condition requires that diligence to make her fit shall, in fact, have been exercised, by the shipowner himself, or by those whom he employs for the purpose. The shipowner \"is responsible for any shortcomings of his agents or subordinates in making the steamer seaworthy at commencement of the voyage for the transportation of the particular cargo.\" [Per Brown Dist. J. in The Frey (1899), 92 F. 667.]\n\"The obligation to make a ship seaworthy is personal to the owners, whether or not they entrust the performance of that obligation to experts, servants or agents.\" [Per Lord Wright in Northumbrian Shipping Company Limited v. E. Timm and Son, Limited, [1939] A.C. 397 at 403, [1939] 2 All E.R. 648.] If such experts, servants or agents fail to exercise due diligence to make her seaworthy the owners are liable under Art. III, r. 1 of the Rules.\nIt is argued for the respondent, however, that, even if it is accepted that the general rule is that the carrier is responsible for loss caused by the failure of its employees to exercise the due diligence required by art. III, Rule 1, cls. (a) and (c), still, in the case at bar, the respondent escapes liability on two grounds. First it is said that the failure was an act, neglect or default of the servants of the carrier in the management of the ship and that the carrier escapes liability under art. IV, Rule 2 (a). Secondly, it is said that the result of that failure was a fire caused without the actual fault or privity of the carrier and that the carrier escapes liability under art. IV, Rule 2(b).\nI incline to the view that the duties imposed on the carrier under art. III, Rule 1, cls. (a) and (c) are paramount and that the carrier is liable for a loss caused by failure to exercise the due diligence required by that Rule even although that failure or its result could also be regarded as falling within the wording of cls. (a) and (b) of art. IV, Rule 2, but I do not find it necessary to reach a final conclusion on this question. While it may well be said that the negligent acts done in the course of thawing out the scupper pipes were acts of the servants of the carrier in the management of the ship and that the resulting fire was not caused by \"the actual fault or privity of the carrier\", and while the fire was the agency which brought about the scuttling of the ship and loss of the cargo, in my opinion, the direct cause of the loss of the appellant's goods was the action of the carrier's employees in bringing those goods to, and loading them on, a burning and unseaworthy ship the holds of which were not fit and safe for their reception and carriage. Had the due diligence required by art. III, Rule 1, been exercised this unseaworthiness would have been prevented, or, if not prevented, would have been discovered and the appellant's loss would have been avoided. The effective cause of the loss was the failure to exercise the due diligence required by art. III, Rule 1.\nFor these reasons I have reached the conclusion that the appeal succeeds. In view of my concurrence in the finding that the appellant's goods were not stowed until after the commencement of the fire I say nothing as to the position of the owners of that part of the cargo which was stowed before its commencement.\nIn its statement of defence the respondent asks a declaration that, in the event of the action succeeding, it is entitled to limit its liability, but in my view the question of its right to do so should be left to be determined in other proceedings in which all parties interested would be represented. I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgments below and direct that judgment be entered for the appellant for\" $2,801.33 with costs throughout.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, Cartwright J. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the plaintiffs, appellants: C.

The trial judge dismissed the action on the grounds that (1) the grounding occurred outside the limits of the channel; and (2) even if the grounding was inside the limits of the channel, there was no liability in law on the Crown. The suppliants appealed.\nHeld: The appeal must be dismissed.\nPer Kerwin C.J.: The trial judge's finding of fact was not supported by the evidence and it should be held that the grounding was within the channel. Nevertheless, the suppliants were not entitled to succeed, since it was essential, under ss. 3(1) and 4(2) of the Crown Liability Act, for them to show that they would have a cause of action in tort against some servant of the Crown, and this had not been done. There was no duty owing to the suppliants on the part of the Dominion Hydrographer to take soundings in the channel and in the circumstances of this case it was impossible to see any duty to the suppliants resting upon any other servant of the Crown, the breach of which duty could form the basis of a cause of action against him. Grossman et al. v. The King, [1952] 1 S.C.R. 571, distinguished. Per Rand J.: The trial judge's finding that the vessel had gone beyond the channel was correct. Even assuming that one of the buoys was outside the channel, there was nothing to show when or how it got there; nor had any circumstances been shown that could possibly lead to a cause of action against any servant of the Crown. The primary duty of Crown servants was to the Crown and there could be no personal liability unless there was established some de facto relation of reliance and responsibility as between a third person and the Crown servant. Grossman et al. v. The King, supra, explained. There was admittedly no duty owing by the Crown itself which had been violated.\nPer Locke, Cartwright and Abbott JJ.: The trial judge's finding that the grounding took place outside the channel was correct on the evidence and it was therefore unnecessary to consider the questions of law as to the liability of the Crown.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiffs from the judgment of Hyndman, Deputy Judge, in the Exchequer Court of Canada 1. Appeal dismissed.\nF. O. Gerity and Hugh W. Rowan, for the suppliants, appellants.\nPeter Wright, Q.C., and P. M. Troop, for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014On August 7, 1953, the SS. \"Grand Island\" grounded as she was approaching the Port of Little Current on Manitoulin Island by way of the East Entrance Channel, and for the damages suffered thereby, her owners and charterers asserted a claim by petition of right against the Crown. The petition came on for trial before Hyndman D.J., who declared that the suppliants were not entitled to the relief sought and ordered that Her Majesty the Queen recover her costs from them. The learned trial judge decided: (1) The grounding occurred outside the limits of the East Entrance Channel; (2) even if it were inside those limits, there was no liability in law on the Crown. If he be correct on the first point, it is admitted that the appellants must fail and the question of fact may, therefore, be considered first. [The judgement here sets out a review of the evidence and proceeds:]\nMy conclusion on all the evidence is that the \"Grand Island\" grounded in the East Entrance Channel. However, even with that finding, the appellants are unable to succeed. The learned trial judge suggested that the claim, if any, arose under s. 18(1) (c) of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 98:\n18. (1) The Exchequer Court also has exclusive original jurisdiction to hear and determine the following matters:\n* * *\n(c) every claim against the Crown arising out of any death or injury to the person or to property resulting from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment.\nThis could not be, as the Revised Statutes of 1952 did not come into force until September 15, 1953, and as of that date the clause was repealed (s. 25, subs. 3(a) of the Crown Liability Act, 1-2 Eliz. II, c. 30, which Act was assented to on May 14, 1953, and was therefore in force on and after that date). At the trial reliance was placed by the appellants upon: (1) s. 19(b) of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 34; (2) para. (a) of subs. (1) of s. 3 of the Crown Liability Act, as qualified by subs. (2) of s. 4. The claim under (1) was abandoned and we need therefore consider only (2). The relevant provisions of the Crown Liability Act are as follows:\n3. (1) The Crown is liable in tort for the damages for which, if it were a private person of full age and capacity, it would foe liable\n(a) in respect of a tort committed by a servant of the Crown, \u2026\n4. (2) No proceedings lie against the Crown by virtue of paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of section 3 in respect of any act or omission of a servant of the Crown unless the act or omission would apart from the provisions of this Act have given rise to a cause of action in tort against that servant or his personal representative.\nParliament has thus set forth in legislative form what had been held by this Court in The King v. Anthony; The King v. Thompson 2, decided under s. 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1927, as amended. The result is therefore the same as if liability had been based upon s. 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 34, which, as amended, was in the same terms as s. 18(1) (c) of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 98, referred to by the trial judge. Under the relevant terms of the Crown Liability Act the appellants must show that they would have a cause of action in tort against some servant of the Crown and this has not been done. It is true that in answer to a request from the solicitors for the appellants the Deputy Minister of Transport declined to name the officers of the Crown charged with the inspection and maintenance of the channel or the installation and maintenance of buoys to indicate the channel and with the issuance of notices to mariners, but, by consent, Frank C. G. Smith, the Dominion Hydrographer, was examined for discovery and no application was made under the Rules of the Exchequer Court for the examination of any other officer. In view of the appellants' contention that they were at least entitled to a new trial so that they might take the necessary steps for that purpose or in order to secure the names of anyone against whom, within the meaning of the Crown Liability Act, the appellants could show that they would have a cause of action in tort, I have considered the matter anxiously and have come to the conclusion that that relief should not be granted on any terms. There was no duty owing to the appellants on the part of the Dominion Hydrographer to take soundings in the East Entrance Channel and in the circumstances of this case, I am unable to envisage any possible duty to the appellants resting upon any other servant of the Crown, the breach of which could form the basis of a cause of action against him. The case of Grossman et al. v. The King 3, is distinguishable as there Nicholas, the airport maintenance foreman, was held to owe a duty to Grossman.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nRand J. [after reviewing the evidence]:\u2014It appears clear to me, as it did to Hyndman J., that, whatever the position of the buoy, the vessel had gone beyond the channel and into the shallow water.\nIt was no excuse that the drill boat was near the centre of the channel; that boat could have been moved to allow the vessel to keep to the range line as it did the next day. The master was aware of the current which made it necessary, once the boat had entered the channel, to keep a certain speed for control: and with a beam of 52 feet leaving only 56 feet on each side when on the centre-line, and a length of 486 feet, a deviation to an extent only-guessed at ran an obvious and unnecessary risk which r eventuated in its own probability.\nAssuming that the centre red buoy was outside the easterly channel line, there is nothing to show when or how it reached that position. Nor have there been shown any circumstances that could possibly lead to a cause of action against any servant of the Crown. The administration of navigation aids depends on the action by Parliament in voting money. But apart from that, the conditions under which a Crown servant can be held personally liable to a third person for failure to act in the course of duty to the Crown require that there be intended to be created, as a deduction from the facts, a direct relation between the servant and the third person. The primary duty of the Crown servants is to the Crown; and the circumstances in which the servant can, at the same time, come under a duty to a third person are extremely rare. The rule laid down in Grossman v. The King 4 is, as I interpret it, this: that the servant from the nature of his specific duty, a duty immediately related to action of the third person, is chargeable with knowledge that the latter, in his own conduct, is justifiably relying on the performance by the servant of that duty, and that the servant is chargeable with accepting the obligation toward the third person. In other words, between them a de facto relation of reliance and responsibility is contemplated. There are no such circumstances here. The government administration, as disclosed by the evidence, is of a general character, unrelated directly and immediately to any particular navigational work in these waters and with no acceptance by any of the public servants concerned of obligation toward the third person, nor any immediate reliance on the performance of individual duty related to the latter's use of a public work. Buoys are not warranted fixtures for navigation. Nothing has been shown of neglect in their original placement or of failure to discover their change of position. The \"sweeping\" and other work suggested to be done in the channel assumes a duty on the Crown, not on a servant. The placement and maintenance in position of these buoys is work under direction of a general character. As a public accommodation, their maintenance is, in relation to the individual servant, attended to only in the aspect of the duty to the employer. So far as the evidence shows, the direction and responsibility do not go beyond the departmental offices. The situation is not, then, one in which a personal liability is engaged by a Crown servant; and there being no basis for the claim against a servant, a prerequisite to a claim under s. 18(c) of the Exchequer Court Act against the Crown, the action on this ground must fail. It is not contended that a claim lies based on a duty owing by the Crown, and admittedly there is no such duty.\nI am therefore in agreement with the findings of fact and view of the law of the Court below and the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Locke and Abbott JJ. was delivered by Locke J. [after reviewing the evidence]:\u2014No attempt was made to impeach the accuracy of the soundings taken by Rowe in 1951. To supplement the evidence of the witness Smith, it may be said that if 3.2 feet be added to the figures shown in the dredged channel opposite the place where the ship admittedly grounded, the depth of water would have varied from 23 to 34 feet, so that grounding was impossible unless, indeed, there had been, unknown to anyone, some physical upheaval of the bed of the channel, which no one suggests.\nThe learned trial judge accepted the evidence of the witness Smith and came to the conclusion that the stranding was outside the dredged channel. My examination of the evidence leads me to the same conclusion and for the same reasons.\nIn these circumstances, it is unnecessary to consider the grounds upon which liability on the part of the Crown is suggested since the case fails on the facts.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs. Cartwright J.:\u2014After a careful consideration of all the evidence I find myself unable to say that the learned trial judge erred in his finding of fact that the vessel grounded outside the limits of the channel, and I therefore agree that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the suppliants, appellants: McMillan, Binch, Stuart, Berry, Dunn, Corrigan & Howland, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the respondent: F.

For this purpose it used a tug owned by it and a scow rented by it from the owners. During the course of the voyage, the scow stranded and sank and her cargo was destroyed. There was no one on board the tow at the time of the accident and it was admitted that the stranding and consequent damage were caused by the negligence of the plaintiff's servants who were in command of the tug and in charge of the navigation of the tug and tow. It was also admitted that the grounding occurred without the plaintiff's actual fault or privity. An action having been commenced by the defendant against the plaintiff for the loss, the plaintiff took these proceedings to limit its liability under s. 657(1) of the Canada Shipping Act.\nHeld: The plaintiff's liability must be computed on the basis of the combined tonnage of the tug and tow and not on the tonnage of the tug alone.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau and Cartwright JJ.: The plaintiff, as lessee of the tow, was the \"owner\" of it within the definition in s. 2(61) of the Act. The plaintiff was therefore within s. 657(1) (b) as \"owner\" of the tow and s. 657(1) (d) as \"owner\" of the tug. Robertson v. The Owners of the Ship Maple Prince et al., [1955] Ex. C.R. 225, distinguished. Since it was admitted that the loss was caused by the improper navigation of the tug and tow, it could make no difference whether the defendant had a claim in contract as well.\nPer Rand and Cartwright JJ.: It could not be successfully argued that the tow was an innocent vessel. Since both the tug and the tow were owned by the same person, the negligent navigation of the tug by the owner's servants was attributable to the navigation of the tow and rendered the latter a culpable vessel. The Ran; The Graygarth, [1922] P. 80 at 86, agreed with. Owners of the S.S. Devonshire v. Owners of the Barge Leslie et al., [1912] A.C. 634, distinguished. The word \"ship\" in s. 657(1) must be applied to the tug and tow together, as a unit. The same result would be reached if the claim of the owner was regarded as one in tort, since the tow was a guilty agency and was within the express words of s. 657(1) (b) of the Act, and the tug was equally within s. 657(1) (d).\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Sidney Smith D.J.A. in an action to limit liability under s. 657(1) of the Canada Shipping Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 29. Appeal dismissed.\nC. C. I. Merritt, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nC. K. Guild, Q.C., and F. U. Collier, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C. J. and Taschereau J. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014This is an appeal by Monarch Towing & Trading Co. Ltd., the plaintiff in an action to limit its liability under subs. (1) of s. 657 of the Canada Shipping Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 29, from a decision of Mr. Justice Sidney Smith, District Judge in Admiralty for the British Columbia Admiralty District. The judgment permitted the plaintiff to limit its liability upon payment into court of a sum computed at the rate of $38.92 per ton for each ton of the combined tonnage of the tug \"Protective\" (60.28 tons) and the scow \"Marpole 14\" (306.35 tons). The plaintiff contends that the amount should be paid on the tonnage of the tug \"Protective\" alone.\nThe action was heard upon admissions from which the following facts appear: The tug and scow were registered ships in accordance with the provisions of the Canada Shipping Act, the former being owned by the plaintiff and the latter by Marpole Towing Co. Ltd. In pursuance of a long-standing arrangement between these two companies for its rental from month to month by the plaintiff, the tug was in the exclusive possession and control of the plaintiff in the month of February 1953. By an unwritten contract between the defendant and the plaintiff, which had been in force for many years, the plaintiff provided from time to time for the carriage of the defendant's cement from Bamberton to New Westminster and Vancouver at a fixed price per ton and for that purpose used scows, manned tugs and pallet boards, as required by practice, custom, or order from time to time. In pursuance of this contract the scow \"Marpole 14\" was loaded with cement by the defendant at Bamberton and on February 18, 1953, while the tug was towing the laden scow through the Gulf of Georgia on the trip to Vancouver and New Westminster the scow stranded and sank and her cargo was destroyed by sea water. Paragraph 8 of the admssions of fact is particularly important and it reads as follows:\n8. That during the course of the said voyage, the tug \"Protective\" was under command of one James Stuart Allen, Master. There was no one aboard the \"Marpole 14\". The stranding and the consequent damage were caused by the negligence of those on board and in command of the tug \"Protective\", the servants of the Plaintiff, who were in charge of the navigation of the tug \"Protective\" and the scow \"Marpole 14\".\nAn action was commenced in the Supreme Court of British Columbia by the defendant against the plaintiff, claiming for the damage sustained by it in consequence of the stranding and the loss of the cargo. The plaintiff admits its liability for the amount claimed which is in excess of a sum computed on the combined tonnage of the tug 'and scow and the defendant admits that the loss or damage occurred without the actual fault or privity of the plaintiff. Subsection (1) of s. 657 of the Canada Shipping Act reads as follows:\n657. (1) The owners of a ship, whether registered in Canada or not, are not, in cases where all or any of the following events occur without their actual fault or privity, that is to say,\n(a) where any loss of life or personal injury is caused to any person being carried in such ship;\n(b) where any damage or loss is caused to any goods, merchandise, or other things whatsoever, on board the ship;\n(c) where any loss of life or personal injury is, by reason of the improper navigation of the ship, caused to any person carried in any other vessel; and\n(d) where any loss or damage is, by reason of the improper navigation of the ship, caused to any other vessel, or to any goods, merchandise, or other things whatsoever on board any other vessel;\nliable to damages in respect of loss of life or personal injury, either alone or together with loss or damage to vessels, goods, merchandise, or other things, to an aggregate amount exceeding seventy-two dollars and ninety- seven cents for each ton of their ship's tonnage; nor in respect of loss or damage to vessels, goods, merchandise, or other things, whether there be in addition loss of life or personal injury or not, to an aggregate amount exceeding thirty-eight dollars and ninety-two cents for each ton of the ship's tonnage.\n\"Owner\" is defined in para. (61) of s. 2 as follows:\n\"owner\" as applied to unregistered ships, means the actual owner and as applied to registered ships, means the registered owner only; for the purposes specified in section 75 it includes beneficial owner and for the purposes of Part XII it also includes the lessee or charterer of any vessel responsible for the navigation thereof; when used in relation to goods, it means every person who is for the time being entitled, either as owner or agent for the owner, to the possession of the goods, subject in the case of a lien to that lien.\nSection 657 is contained in Part XII of the Act and therefore the plaintiff, as lessee thereof, was the \"owner\" of the scow \"Marpole 14\".\nSince it is admitted that the loss was caused by the improper navigation of the tug and scow, it can make no difference whether the defendant had a claim as well in contract against the plaintiff. The limitation section applies as well in the case of a stranding as of a collision and the defendant did not argue before us, as it did in the Court below, that the limitation section is not applicable, but seeks to uphold the trial judge's determination that it must be based upon the combined tonnage of the tug and scow, or, in the alternative, on the tonnage of the scow alone. If the scow were owned by the defendant and the plaintiff's contract was to tow it laden with cement and the stranding occurred, the plaintiff would be responsible for the loss of the scow and cement; in that case the extent of the liability would be based on the tonnage of the plaintiff's \"ship\", i.e., the tug, so that the plaintiff would be better off if the agreement between it and the defendant had provided that the defendant use a scow of its own. In Robertson v. The Owners of the Ship Maple Prince et al.1, Mr. Justice Sidney Smith held that where the owners of a tug had been held liable for damages caused by a collision between its tow and a fishing vessel because of the tug's improper navigation, the tow being an \"innocent\" ship, the tug's owners were entitled to restrict their liability to the amount allowed by the Act for each ton of the tug's tonnage and not for the combined tonnage of the tug and tow. In the present case the learned trial judge distinguished his earlier decision on the ground that here, for the purposes of the limitation section, the plaintiff was the \"owner\" not only of the tug but also of the scow, and the scow was not an \"innocent\" ship, and with this I agree.\nCounsel for the plaintiff contends that, if the owners of the scow sue the owners of the tug for the loss of the scow, the owners of the tug are entitled to limit their liability on the tonnage of the tug. That may be so, but, looking at s. 657 and in view of para. 8 of the admissions, the scow, as well as the tug, being negligent, the plaintiff is \"owner\" of both tug and scow and cls. (b) and (d) of subs. (1) of s. 657 are both applicable. Under the former the plaintiff is brought in as \"owner\" of the scow and under cl. (d) as \"owner\" of the tug.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nRand J.:\u2014Mr. Merritt's case is based essentially on the ground that the barge was an innocent vessel which, in turn, is a conclusion from the fact that the actual negligence occurred on the tug. The same point was taken in The Ran; The Graygarth 2, where the claim arose out of a collision and the claimant was a stranger to the barge, not, as here, a shipper. It was held that as both ships were owned by the same person, the negligent navigation of the tug by servants of the owner was attributable to the navigation of the scow and rendered the latter a culpable vessel. As Lord Sterndale M.R. put it at p. 86:\nIn my opinion the tow is improperly navigated by the servants of the owners of the tow, although these servants may be upon the tug. It does not matter where they are. If they are the servants of the owners of the tow, and they are navigating the tow, the owners of the tow are liable for the negligence of the tow, and that is the vessel they are improperly navigating. The tug may be improperly navigated, but that does not prevent the tow being also improperly navigated.\nThe action had been brought in rem against the tow and was maintained as brought. In Owners of the S.S. Devonshire v. Owners of the Barge Leslie et al.3, urged upon us, there was no such common ownership and the improper navigation of the barge was caused by third persons with whose acts the owner of the barge was not chargeable.\nHere the owners of the tug were also the charterers of the tow, in exclusive possession of it, and the personal liability of the tug owners and charterers arises both in contract and in tort. The carriage was to be executed by barge and tug, a sea transportation that, given the loading on the scow, could not otherwise have been carried out: the two vessels operated as a single means of conveyance. The goods were carried under an unwritten contract of which the negligent stranding brought about a breach.\nThe language of s. 657 of the Canada Shipping Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 29, is: \"The owners of a ship \u2026 are not \u2026 liable to damages in respect of \u2026 goods \u2026 to an aggregate, etc.\" What, then, is a ship? I should say that the word in that context includes a mode of marine carriage universally known and exercised, that of a barge and tug, in which one total unit performs the undertaking. That was the scope given the word \"vessel\" in the phrase \"the vessel transporting merchandise or property\" appearing in s. 3 of the Ratter Act of the United States by the Supreme Court of that country in Sacramento Navigation Company v. Salz 4. There, as here, the claimant was a shipper and the result was that both the tug and tow, owned by the same person, were required to be surrendered, the mode of limitation provided by that Act.\nOn the basis of tort the same result is reached. The barge here, as in The Ran, being a guilty agency, is within the express words of s. 657(1)(b):\n(1) The owners of a ship, whether registered in Canada or not, are not, in cases where all or any of the following events occur without their actual fault or privity, that is to say,\n* * *\n(b) where any damage or loss is caused to any goods, merchandise, or other things whatsoever, on board the ship; \u2026\nThe tug, combining with the barge in bringing about the stranding, as an independent vessel is equally within cl. (d) of that subsection:\n(d) where any loss or damage is, by reason of the improper navigation of the ship, caused to any other vessel, or to any goods, merchandise, or other things whatsoever on board any other vessel; In collision each of these vessels would be liable for its participation in the negligent act, and the same general maritime law of liability for negligence as is applicable to stranding, which is a form of collision, calls for the same distributive liability. The statute assumes that underlying law and by relating damages to the tonnage of a ship and eliminating by that means a ruinous exposure of all the assets of the owner to the liability incurred, operates in tort referably to the individual ship. It applies as well where two or more are parties to the damages as where there is only one. With a common ownership of two vessels whose combined mismanagement has caused damage through collision to the goods of a shipper in one of them, the liability of the owner is related to the several fault of each of his vessels, that is, they are deemed to be two sources of liability, two distinct agencies with different servants of the same master, each giving rise to a responsibility and each coming under the limitation of s. 657: The Chartered Mercantile Bank of India, London, and China v. The Netherlands India Steam Navigation Company, Limited 5. In that case the two vessels were acting independently; but I am unable to differentiate the case where, as here, the improper navigation of both the tug and the barge results from the same human agency; they must be charged distributively with the total responsibility. This seems to have been the view of Lord Sterndale in The Ran; The Graygarth, supra, where, at p. 84, he says: \"As owners of the Graygarth [the tug] they might be liable also. \u2026\" But the suit there was in rem against the tow alone, a liability dependent on showing the tow to have been improperly navigated.\nIn either view, therefore, Smith D.J.A. was right in holding that in limitation of damages the tonnage of both the vessels must be brought into account, and the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nLocke J.:\u2014In my opinion, this appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs. Cartwright J.:\u2014I agree with the reasons of the Chief Justice and with those of my brother Rand and would accordingly dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Bull, Housser, Tupper, Ray, Guy & Merritt, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Guild, Nicholson, Yule, Schmitt, Lane & Collier, Vancouver.\n1 [1955] Ex.

The trial judge gave judgment in favour of the plaintiff on the three items, but this judgment was reversed by a majority in the Court of Appeal.\nHeld: The action must succeed, but only in part. It was proved that there were latent defects and that they appeared only in the course of operation. Only the \"garantie ordinaire de droit\" was established and as the seller did not know of the defects at the time and was not presumed by law to know them, the recourse was limited to annulment and the return of the money paid on the purchase-price.\nThe \"fins de non recevoir\" raised by the seller could not be entertained: The evidence did not show that the arrangement by which the seller gave a reduction in the price amounted to a transaction and thus put an end to the warranty; nor did it show that the monthly payments made by the purchaser were made with the intention of accepting the situation; the action, although taken nine months after the sale, was not tardy in view of the fact that the defects appeared progressively and intermittently and in view of the conduct of the parties, particularly of the seller: Lortie v. Bouchard, [1952] 1 S.C.R. 508, applied; Lambert v. Levis Automobiles Inc. and General Motors Acceptance Corporation, [1957] S.C.R. 621, referred to; the objection that the tractor was not in the same condition as it was at the time of the sale, could not be entertained, the buyer having, in the circumstances, substantially satisfied his obligation; the buyer was right in offering the tractor subject to the return of the money paid, and the fact that he also asked for damages (to which he was not entitled) did not free the seller from his obligation to offer to return the money paid if he wanted to hold the buyer to his obligation to deliver the tractor.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec 1, reversing, McDougall J. dissenting, the judgment at trial.

Goulet, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by\nFauteux J.:\u2014Aux termes d'un contrat notari\u00e9, intervenu entre les parties le 29 janvier 1951, l'appelant achetait de l'intim\u00e9, \"avec garantie ordinaire de droit\", une niveleuse usag\u00e9e et accessoires, au prix de $11,000 dont $2,000 avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9alablement pay\u00e9s, la balance de $9,000 devant \u00eatre satisfaite par versements mensuels, \u00e9gaux et cons\u00e9cutifs de $500, le premier \u00e9ch\u00e9ant le 1er mars 1951. L'appelant prit possession imm\u00e9diatement. Pr\u00e8s de 9 mois plus tard et apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9bours\u00e9, dans l'intervalle, des sommes substantielles pour r\u00e9parations, il intenta \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 une action r\u00e9dhibitoire demandant, outre l'annulation de cette vente, la restitution de $4,000, somme des versements pay\u00e9s en acompte sur le prix, et une condamnation \u00e0 un montant additionnel de $4,560.56 pour r\u00e9parations faites \u00e0 la niveleuse qu'il offrait de remettre sur paiement de ces montants r\u00e9unis.\nA la suite d'une longue enqu\u00eate, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, pour les motifs (i) qu'outre la garantie ordinaire de droit stipul\u00e9e au contrat, le vendeur avait donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'acheteur lors de la vente et de la livraison, une garantie sp\u00e9ciale \u00e0 l'effet que la niveleuse \u00e9tait en \u00e9tat de fonctionner comme si elle \u00e9tait neuve; (ii) qu'en fait, et contrairement \u00e0 cette repr\u00e9sentation et \u00e0 cette garantie, la niveleuse \u00e9tait, lors de la vente, \u00e0 la connaissance du vendeur et \u00e0 l'insu de l'acheteur, affect\u00e9e de vices cach\u00e9s justifiant en droit l'annulation de la vente, la restitution de cette partie du prix vers\u00e9e en acompte et le remboursement des sommes d\u00e9bours\u00e9es pour d\u00e9montage et remontage de la niveleuse; et (iii) que contrairement aux pr\u00e9tentions du d\u00e9fendeur, cette action r\u00e9dhibitoire avait \u00e9t\u00e9 prise avec diligence et que les autres fins de non recevoir par lui invoqu\u00e9es \u00e9taient \u00e9galement mal fond\u00e9es, donna acte de l'offre faite par le demandeur, annula la vente et condamna le d\u00e9fendeur \u00e0 la restitution des $4,000 et au paiement de $1,782.68 pour d\u00e9montage et remontage de la niveleuse.\nPort\u00e9 en appel, ce jugement fut infirm\u00e9 2; MM. les Juges St-Jacques et Rinfret d\u00e9clar\u00e8rent l'action mal fond\u00e9e, alors que M. le Juge McDougall, adoptant sur ce point une opinion contraire, fit droit \u00e0 l'appel pour limiter la condamnation p\u00e9cuniaire \u00e0 la restitution des sommes pay\u00e9es en acompte sur le prix. D'o\u00f9 le pourvoi devant cette Cour par l'acheteur Lemire.\nNature de la garantie.\nIl convient de dire imm\u00e9diatement que, contrairement aux vues du juge au proc\u00e8s, les juges de la Cour d'Appel ont unanimement conclu que le vendeur ne s'\u00e9tait oblig\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 une garantie ordinaire de droit. Le motif sur lequel ils fondent cette opinion est que m\u00eame si l\u00e9galement admise, la preuve testimoniale faite \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'une garantie sp\u00e9ciale n'a pas de force probante, est \u00e0 mon avis bien fond\u00e9. L'acheteur, sachant qu'il s'agissait d'une niveleuse usag\u00e9e, avait lui-m\u00eame, ant\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 la vente, charg\u00e9 un m\u00e9canicien d'en faire l'examen et la preuve \u00e9tablit que le vendeur s'\u00e9tait limit\u00e9 \u00e0 repr\u00e9senter qu'\u00e0 ses vues, la niveleuse pouvait rendre le service auquel elle \u00e9tait destin\u00e9e.\nLes vices cach\u00e9s.\nComme le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, M. le Juge McDougall n'h\u00e9site pas \u00e0 conclure \u00e0 leur existence, alors que les deux autres membres de la Cour, sans express\u00e9ment du moins en contester le fait, rejettent l'action en s'appuyant plut\u00f4t sur des fins de non recevoir. Sans doute et dans une certaine mesure, l'intim\u00e9 a-t-il raison de soumettre que, par la nature m\u00eame des choses, une machine usag\u00e9e ne peut \u00eatre, au m\u00eame degr\u00e9 qu'une machine neuve, exempte de certains vices, vices que l'acheteur doit anticiper et accepter. Mais, d\u00e8s l'instant qu'il appara\u00eet, comme c'est le cas en l'esp\u00e8ce, que leur gravit\u00e9 rend la chose vendue inapte au service normal qui lui est propre et auquel on la destine, donner effet \u00e0 cette soumission de l'intim\u00e9 serait virtuellement \u00e9carter la garantie ordinaire de droit stipul\u00e9e au contrat. L'ensemble de la preuve d\u00e9montre que les vices affectant cette niveleuse au moment de la vente d\u00e9passaient en \u00e9tendue et gravit\u00e9 ceux que l'acheteur d'une machine usag\u00e9e et vendue avec garantie ordinaire de droit peut \u00eatre tenu d'anticiper et accepter. Les dommages, accidentellement caus\u00e9s \u00e0 la niveleuse par l'employ\u00e9 de l'acheteur aux premiers jours des op\u00e9rations et subs\u00e9quemment r\u00e9par\u00e9s, n'expliquent pas les ennuis subis par la suite et les vices que seul, suivant toute la preuve, un d\u00e9montage, auquel fit proc\u00e9der l'acheteur au mois d'ao\u00fbt, a pu \u00e9ventuellement et compl\u00e8tement r\u00e9v\u00e9ler dans toute leur \u00e9tendue et gravit\u00e9. C'est alors qu'on constata, en particulier, qu'un grand nombre de pi\u00e8ces essentielles \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s us\u00e9es et, en raison de cette usure, fauss\u00e9es, f\u00eal\u00e9es ou cass\u00e9es, et que, de toutes fa\u00e7ons, il fallait, en vue d'obtenir une utilisation normale de la niveleuse, ouvrer ou compl\u00e8tement remplacer ces pi\u00e8ces.\nFins de non recevoir.\nEn avril 1951, les parties se rencontr\u00e8rent et l'acheteur ayant repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au vendeur qu'en raison de certains d\u00e9fauts mis \u00e0 jour, le moteur, le m\u00e9canisme d'accouplement et autres parties de la niveleuse requ\u00e9raient des r\u00e9parations co\u00fbteuses, ce dernier lui consentit une r\u00e9duction de $1,500 sur le prix. L'appelant voit dans le fait de cette r\u00e9duction une admission du bien-fond\u00e9 de ses griefs et ses vues sont \u00e9galement celles du juge au proc\u00e8s et de M. le Juge McDougall, en appel. L'intim\u00e9, d'autre part, pr\u00e9tend que cet arrangement constituait une transaction compl\u00e8te et finale au sens et avec les cons\u00e9quences indiqu\u00e9s en les arts. 1918 et suivants du Code Civil et cette pr\u00e9tention est substantiellement accept\u00e9e par les deux autres membres de la Cour d'Appel. Les extraits de la preuve cit\u00e9s au factum de l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appui de sa pr\u00e9tention \u00e9tablissent le d\u00e9saccord des parties sur la port\u00e9e de cette entente. Suivant la version de l'appelant, cette entente ne couvrait que les d\u00e9fauts connus au moment d'icelle, alors qu'au contraire, et suivant le t\u00e9moignage de l'intim\u00e9, on transigeait \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de tous les d\u00e9fauts connus ou inconnus. Cette version de l'intim\u00e9 n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e par le juge au proc\u00e8s ni par M. le Juge McDougall en appel. La pr\u00e9tention que cet arrangement mettait fin \u00e0 la garantie ordinaire de droit contre les d\u00e9fauts cach\u00e9s est incompatible avec la conduite subs\u00e9quente de l'intim\u00e9 qui, apr\u00e8s avoir fait cette r\u00e9duction pour les r\u00e9parations \u00e0 faire en regard des d\u00e9fauts alors d\u00e9nonc\u00e9s, acceptait, pr\u00e8s de quatre mois plus tard, l'invitation de l'acheteur \u00e0 venir constater par lui-m\u00eame l'\u00e9tendue et gravit\u00e9 des vices mis \u00e0 jour par le d\u00e9montage de la niveleuse. La transaction est un contrat lourd de cons\u00e9quences et celui qui l'invoque doit l'\u00e9tablir de fa\u00e7on probante, ce qui, \u00e0 mon avis, n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait en l'esp\u00e8ce.\nL'acheteur aurait \u00e9galement, suivant l'intim\u00e9, forclos son droit d'action en effectuant sans prot\u00eat les versements d'acompte sur le prix. En fait, l'acheteur a fait quatre paiements de $500 chacun, soit le premier, devenant d\u00fb, suivant le contrat, le 1er mars, et ceux \u00e9ch\u00e9ant le 1er des mois d'avril, ao\u00fbt et septembre\u2014le montant de la r\u00e9duction r\u00e9sultant de l'entente d'avril, soit $1,500, tenant lieu des versements devenant dus le 1er des mois de mai, juin et juillet. Les versements d'ao\u00fbt et septembre sont donc les seuls pertinents \u00e0 la consid\u00e9ration de cette soumission de l'intim\u00e9. Le versement \u00e9ch\u00e9ant le 1er ao\u00fbt fut pay\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 la date du d\u00e9montage de la niveleuse et, par cons\u00e9quent, dans l'ignorance des vices qui y furent expos\u00e9s; et les circonstances entourant le paiement du versement exigible le 1er septembre d\u00e9montrent clairement que ce paiement ne comportait aucune acceptation des d\u00e9fauts qu'on venait de d\u00e9couvrir. En effet, le 25 ao\u00fbt, l'acheteur \u00e9crivait au vendeur r\u00e9sidant \u00e0 Fabre, l'avisant que malgr\u00e9 toute sa bonne volont\u00e9 il lui \u00e9tait impossible d'utiliser la niveleuse \u00e0 moins d'y faire des r\u00e9parations importantes et l'invitant \u00e0 venir \u00e0 Belleterre, o\u00f9 elle se trouvait, constater lui-m\u00eame sa condition v\u00e9ritable. Le vendeur se rendit \u00e0 cette invitation quelques jours apr\u00e8s la f\u00eate du travail. C'est dans l'intervalle que l'appelant paya le versement d\u00fb le 1er septembre et ce, \u00e0 l'occasion d'une visite, qu'il fit \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 apr\u00e8s l'envoi de sa lettre, au cours de laquelle il r\u00e9it\u00e9ra les plaintes et invitation y mentionn\u00e9es. Le fait de ce paiement ne peut \u00eatre d\u00e9sassoci\u00e9 de ces protestations de l'ache- teur, de l'accord du vendeur \u00e0 en v\u00e9rifier le m\u00e9rite et du voyage qu'il fit \u00e0 Belleterre \u00e0 ces fins. L'acheteur a t\u00e9moign\u00e9, de plus, qu'il appr\u00e9hendait qu'un d\u00e9faut de faire ce versement ne soit imput\u00e9 \u00e0 une g\u00eane financi\u00e8re qu'on invoquerait subs\u00e9quemment comme motif v\u00e9ritable de ces griefs et que ses droits en seraient compromis. C'est avec raison, je crois, que le juge au proc\u00e8s a accept\u00e9 l'explication de l'acheteur et refus\u00e9 de voir dans ce paiement une intention d'accepter la situation. D'ailleurs, et apr\u00e8s avoir vu la niveleuse, au cours de cette visite \u00e0 Belleterre, le vendeur offrit une autre r\u00e9duction de $2,000 ou $2,500, somme correspondant au prix des pi\u00e8ces de remplacement. Cette r\u00e9duction offerte par le vendeur, ajout\u00e9e \u00e0 celle qu'il avait consentie en avril, abaissait le prix de vente de 40 pour cent. Le vendeur posa comme condition de cette derni\u00e8re r\u00e9duction que la balance soit pay\u00e9e comptant. Mais ceci ne change pas le fait qu'\u00e0 ses vues, aussi bien qu'\u00e0 celles de l'acheteur, le paiement du versement de septembre, pas plus que celui du moi d'ao\u00fbt, n'avait dispos\u00e9 des griefs de l'acheteur et ne pouvait constituer une renonciation de ses droits.\nL'intim\u00e9 a soumis que l'action \u00e9tait tardive. En Cour d'Appel, cette pr\u00e9tention fut accueillie par MM. les Juges St-Jacques et Rinfret, mais rejet\u00e9e par M. le Juge McDougall. Le juge au proc\u00e8s en est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la m\u00eame conclusion que ce dernier, en faisant entrer dans la consid\u00e9ration, cependant, la garantie conventionnelle dont il affirma l'existence. Sous l'ancien droit, on enseignait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement que le d\u00e9lai pour intenter l'action r\u00e9dhibitoire \u00e9tait de 6 mois \u00e0 compter de l'acte de vente. Notre Code, pas plus que le Code Napol\u00e9on, n'a retenu ce d\u00e9lai. Ce que prescrit l'art. 1530 C.C., c'est que l'action doit \u00eatre intent\u00e9e avec diligence raisonnable, suivant la nature du vice et suivant l'usage du lieu o\u00f9 la vente est faite. A d\u00e9faut d'usage constant, dit Migneault, elle doit \u00eatre form\u00e9e dans un court d\u00e9lai afin de pr\u00e9venir une foule de proc\u00e8s qui na\u00eetraient de la difficult\u00e9 de constater \u00e0 une \u00e9poque recul\u00e9e si les vices existaient au moment de la vente ou s'ils sont post\u00e9rieurs. Ce d\u00e9lai est d\u00e9termin\u00e9 par les tribunaux et il \"doit \u00eatre suffisant pour que les vices puissent, pendant qu'il court, se r\u00e9v\u00e9ler \u00e0 l'acheteur\". (Migneault, Droit Civil Canadien, tome 10, p.114). Pour d\u00e9terminer s'il y a eu diligence raisonnable, on tiendra compte des circonstances \u00e9tablies en la cause. Ainsi la manifestation progressive des vices au cours de l'utilisation de la chose vendue, aussi bien que l'attitude de l'acheteur et celle du vendeur \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, entreront-elles en consid\u00e9ration lorsqu'il y a lieu d'appr\u00e9cier le d\u00e9lai dans lequel l'acheteur intente l'action o\u00f9 ces vices sont invoqu\u00e9s, ainsi que le signale mon coll\u00e8gue, M. le Juge Taschereau, dans Lortie v. Bouchard 3, d\u00e9cision de cette Cour r\u00e9cemment comment\u00e9e dans Lambert v. L\u00e8vis Automobiles Inc. et al. and General Motors Acceptance Corporation 4.\nR\u00e9sumons les circonstances de la pr\u00e9sente cause. De la date de la vente \u00e0 celle de l'accord d'avril, la niveleuse ne put op\u00e9rer que de fa\u00e7on intermittente. Par la suite, et comme r\u00e9sultat de cet accord, le moteur en fut d\u00e9tach\u00e9 et envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9paration \u00e0 North Bay, ensuite \u00e0 Toronto, et de nouveau \u00e0 North Bay, d'o\u00f9 il ne fut retourn\u00e9 qu'en juin. Mais en raison, particuli\u00e8rement, d'une d\u00e9fectuosit\u00e9 de la pompe hydraulique, on ne put utiliser la niveleuse qu'aux premiers jours de juillet. Et, le 10 ao\u00fbt, vu les ennuis subis dans l'intervalle, on d\u00e9cida de proc\u00e9der au d\u00e9montage, avec le r\u00e9sultat d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9. Le vendeur en fut averti, vint au d\u00e9but de septembre constater la situation, fit son offre de r\u00e9duction additionnelle que l'acheteur, apr\u00e8s avoir demand\u00e9 \u00e0 y songer quelques jours, d\u00e9cida \u00e9ventuellement de refuser. D\u00e8s lors, et par la lettre de son procureur, en date du 13 septembre, il mettait le vendeur en demeure de consentir, sous 8 jours, \u00e0 l'annulation de la vente, la restitution des acomptes pay\u00e9s sur le prix et le paiement des sommes d\u00e9bours\u00e9es pour r\u00e9parations, et lui offrait au m\u00eame temps de remettre la niveleuse dont on fit le remontage. Cette mise en demeure n'eut pas de suites et l'action fut intent\u00e9e vers le milieu d'octobre. Sous toutes les circonstances et vu particuli\u00e8rement que les d\u00e9fauts cach\u00e9s se sont manifest\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on progressive, et en cela, de fa\u00e7on intermittente, en raison des interruptions d'op\u00e9rations dues \u00e0 des r\u00e9parations successives, vu la conduite des parties et particuli\u00e8rement celle du vendeur, comme M. le Juge McDougall, je suis d'avis que cette autre pr\u00e9tention ne peut \u00eatre retenue. Reste un dernier moyen. On a soumis que l'offre faite par l'acheteur au vendeur de lui remettre la niveleuse ne peut valoir et ce pour deux raisons: (i) la niveleuse n'\u00e9tait plus dans l'\u00e9tat o\u00f9 elle \u00e9tait au moment de la vente et (ii) cette offre faite au vendeur \u00e9tait subordonn\u00e9e au paiement pr\u00e9alable des acomptes pay\u00e9s sur le prix et montants d\u00e9bours\u00e9s pour r\u00e9parations.\nLa preuve et les principes pertinents \u00e0 l'appr\u00e9ciation du premier motif n'en supportent pas le bien-fond\u00e9, l'acheteur ayant, dans les circonstances, substantiellement satisfait \u00e0 la mesure de son obligation.\nLe second motif, \u00e0 mon avis, ne peut \u00eatre retenu, pour les raisons suivantes. Dans la lettre du 13 septembre mettant le vendeur en demeure de consentir \u00e0 l'annulation de la vente, l'offre est libell\u00e9e comme suit:\nM. Lemire vous offre par la pr\u00e9sente de vous remettre le tracteur en question, dont vous pourrez prendre possession \u00e0 Belleterre, sur paiement des sommes mentionn\u00e9es plus haut.\nDans sa d\u00e9claration, le demandeur r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 cette mise en demeure, r\u00e9it\u00e8re cette offre de la niveleuse, en demande acte et ajoute:\n\u2026 le d\u00e9fendeur pouvant en reprendre la possession \u00e0 Belleterre sur paiement des sommes pr\u00e9sentement r\u00e9clam\u00e9es.\nL'article 1526 C.C. donne \u00e0 l'acheteur le choix de rendre la chose et de se faire restituer le prix, ou de la garder et se faire rendre une partie du prix suivant \u00e9valuation. Dans la premi\u00e8re alternative, celle de l'action r\u00e9dhibitoire, acheteur et vendeur sont tenus \u00e0 des prestations mutuelles et concomitantes, la prestation de l'un \u00e9tant la contre-partie n\u00e9cessaire de la prestation de l'autre pour assurer que, par l'annulation de la vente, les parties soient remises dans l'\u00e9tat o\u00f9 elles \u00e9taient avant le contrat. Aussi bien, si l'acheteur doit, pour obtenir la restitution du prix, offrir la remise de la chose vendue, le vendeur doit-il, de son c\u00f4t\u00e9, pour exiger la livraison de la chose offerte, offrir la restitution du prix. La prestation de l'un conditionne la prestation de l'autre. L'intim\u00e9 avait donc raison d'assujettir la livraison de la chose offerte \u00e0 la restitution des acomptes vers\u00e9s sur le prix. Il se peut\u2014ce qui n'est pas le cas en l'esp\u00e8ce\u2014qu'aux vues du vendeur l'acheteur r\u00e9clame, \u00e0 titre d'acomptes vers\u00e9s sur le prix, un montant exc\u00e9dant celui qu'il a v\u00e9ritablement pay\u00e9. Mais le fait que sa r\u00e9clamation soit de ce chef excessive ne lib\u00e8re pas le vendeur de son obligation d'offrir la restitution de ce qu'il a re\u00e7u sur le prix s'il veut tenir l'acheteur \u00e0 son obligation de livrer la chose. Il ne s'agit pas ici d'offres unilat\u00e9rales qu'un d\u00e9biteur menac\u00e9 d'une action ou poursuivi doit faire pour se lib\u00e9rer, mais d'offres synallagmatiques auxquelles acheteur et vendeur sont tenus dans le cas d'annulation d'une vente pour vices r\u00e9dhibitoires. Et cette situation n'est pas chang\u00e9e du fait qu'un acheteur, se croyant erron\u00e9ment\u2014comme c'est ici le cas\u2014dans les circonstances pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 l'art. 1527 C.C., r\u00e9clame, en plus de la restitution du prix, le paiement de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats. A la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, et si l'on consid\u00e8re la position prise et maintenue par l'intim\u00e9 en l'affaire, ce moyen qu'il invoque comme fin de non recevoir de l'action est en fait aussi d\u00e9pourvu de sinc\u00e9rit\u00e9 qu'il est en droit d\u00e9pourvu de substance. Mis en demeure, l'intim\u00e9 n'en fait rien. Poursuivi, il combat la demande d'annulation de la vente. Comment justifier le rejet de l'action, si elle est par ailleurs justifi\u00e9e, sur l'exc\u00e8s de la r\u00e9clamation p\u00e9cuniaire de l'appelant quand l'intim\u00e9 persiste \u00e0 soutenir que dans son principe m\u00eame ce recours est totalement mal fond\u00e9. En toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence il ne peut \u00eatre donn\u00e9 effet \u00e0 ce dernier moyen.\nJe maintiendrais cet appel avec d\u00e9pens et adopterais le dispositif apparaissant aux raisons de jugement de M. le Juge McDougall.\nRand J.:\u2014I agree with the reasons and conclusions of McDougall J. in the Court of Queen's Bench 5. There is no doubt of the latent defects and they appeared only in the course of operation. A conventional warranty has not been established and as the seller did not know of the defects and is not one of that class who are presumed by law to know them, the plaintiff is limited to a return of the money paid on the purchase-price.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and restore the judgment at trial modified by reducing the amount of the judgment to $4,000. The appellant will have his costs in this Court and at the trial. The respondent will be entitled to costs in the Court of Queen's Bench.\nAppeal allowed with costs.

(1) Employees of the Government of Newfoundland in the services taken over by Canada pursuant to these Terms will be offered employment in these services or in similar Canadian services under the terms and conditions from time to time governing employment in those services, but without reduction in salary or loss of pension rights acquired by reason of service in Newfoundland.\"\nThe suppliant had been employed as a carpenter at Gander airport and upon the union becoming effective he was offered and accepted similar employment at the same airport by the Canadian Government and was paid at the rate prevailing there. By his petition of right, filed in October 1952, he claimed to be entitled to the difference between the wages paid to him and those paid to carpenters at other Canadian airports, which were higher than those paid at Gander.\nHeld: The petition must be dismissed. The suppliant had accepted the terms offered him and had no claim in contract, which was all that was set up by the petition of right.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Thorson P., of the Exchequer Court of Canada 1, dismissing a petition of right. Appeal dismissed. Edward B. Jolliffe, Q.C., for the suppliant, appellant.\nJohn A. Barron, Q.C., for the intervenant.\nW. R. Jackett, Q.C., and D. S. Maxwell, for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014The President of the Exchequer Court ordered and adjudged 2 that the appellant was not entitled to the relief sought by his petition of right and that Her Majesty the Queen recover her costs from him, but that there be no costs for or against the intervenant, Attorney General of Newfoundland. The petition of right prayed that the appellant recover from Her Majesty:\n(a) The said sum of $3,468.10;\n(b) His costs of this Action;\n(c) Such further or other relief as to this Honourable Court may seem meet.\nIt was stated by counsel for the appellant that the sum claimed should be $2,998.13. No verbal testimony was introduced at the trial of the petition, as there was an admission of facts filed, together with copies of certain orders in council and of certain Treasury Board minutes and schedules. In the view I take of the matter it is unnecessary to refer in detail to these orders in council, or minutes, or to the precise manner in which the sum of $2,998.13 is arrived at.\nBy no. 1 of the Terms of Union of Newfoundland with Canada the former was to form part of Canada and be a Province thereof on, from and after the coming into force of the Terms. By no. 50 they were agreed to, subject to being approved by the Parliament of Canada and the Government of Newfoundland and were to come into force immediately before the expiration of the 31st day of March, 1949, if His Majesty had theretofore given his assent to an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland confirming the Terms. They were approved by the Government of Newfoundland and by the Canadian Parliament by 1949, c. 1, and the British North America Act, 1949 (Imp.), c. 22, confirmed the Terms of Union.\nPrior to March 31, 1949, the appellant was employed as a carpenter at Gander airport in Newfoundland. Among the services taken over by Canada from Newfoundland, pursuant to no. 31 of the Terms of Union, was \"(d) civil aviation, including Gander Airport\". By para. 1 of the petition of right it is alleged:\nSince the first day of April, 1949, Your Suppliant has been continuously employed as a First Class Carpenter at the said Gander Airport by the Department of Transport (Air Services Branch) a Department of the Government of Canada.\nThis was admitted by the statement of defence and by para. 2 of the admissions of facts it was agreed that:\nOn or about the 1st day of April, 1949, the Suppliant was offered by and accepted employment with the Respondent as a carpenter effective April 1, 1949 \u2026\nThe petition of right was filed in October 1952, and it was alleged that there was a deficiency in the wages or salary paid the appellant from April 1, 1949, to June 30, 1952. For a certain part of this period it is claimed that he did not receive the same wages as were being paid to carpenters employed by Her Majesty at airports located at Winnipeg, Malton and Dorval, and that for a certain time he worked a 60-hour week without extra pay for overtime, while at certain other airports carpenters had a standard work week of 44 hours, with overtime pay for any time in excess of 48 hours. The terms and conditions governing the employment of carpenters differ at Canadian airports and for part of the time the rate at Mont Joli, Seven Islands and Gore Bay was less than that at Gander. In the presentation of his case the suppliant chose the terms and conditions at Dorval airport as those to which he was entitled, because it was suggested that those two airports were comparable, and it is by a comparison of what he received from April 1, 1949, to June 30, 1952, with what was being paid at Dorval, both with respect to the hourly wage and the allowance for overtime, that he computed the total amount claimed.\nAs a basis for his claim he relies upon no. 39(1) of the Terms of Union:\n39. (1) Employees of the Government of Newfoundland in the services taken over by Canada pursuant to these Terms will be offered employment in these services or in similar Canadian services under the terms and conditions from time to time governing employment in those services, but without reduction in salary or loss of pension rights acquired by reason of' service in Newfoundland.\nIf he is wrong in his construction of this provision his claim fails. I agree with the President of the Exchequer Court that this does not mean that when the appellant was offered and accepted employment as a carpenter at Gander airport he was entitled to employment there under the terms and conditions from time to time governing the employment of carpenters at Dorval airport, or any other Canadian airport. Since he was offered and accepted employment at Gander it is subject to the terms and conditions governing employment there. If he had been offered employment in a Canadian service similar to Gander it would be under the terms and conditions from time to time governing employment in such similar Canadian service. Again I agree with the President, \"those services\" is not referable only to \"similar Canadian services\", but must be read disjunctively as referable either to the services taken over or to the \"similar Canadian services\".\nThe appellant accepted the terms offered him and he has no claim in contract or otherwise. That the \"further or other relief\" claim in the petition of right does not include a claim for damages is made quite evident from a perusal of the entire petition of right and from the admissions signed on behalf of the appellant and respondent. If such a claim had been advanced, the respondent would have been in a position to plead estoppel. It is unnecessary to consider any of the other points raised on behalf of the parties.\nThe appeal fails and must be dismissed with costs to be paid by the appellant to the respondent, but there will be no costs to or against the intervenant.\nRand J.:\u2014The dispute here arises out of a claim by an employee of the former Newfoundland Government engaged as a carpenter at Gander airport. It purports to be based upon no. 39(1) of the terms of agreement under which Newfoundland entered the federal union of Canada. The clause reads:\n39. (1) Employees of the Government of Newfoundland in the services taken over by Canada pursuant to these Terms will be offered employment in these services or in similar Canadian services under the terms and conditions from time to time governing employment in those services, but without reduction in salary or loss of pension rights acquired by reason of service in Newfoundland.\nMr. Jolliffe's argument proceeded on the footing that a contract had been entered into between the people individually and collectively of Newfoundland, represented by their negotiators, and the Government of Canada, from which a right arose in the appellant enforceable against the Dominion Crown by legal proceedings. I am bound to say-that I think this view of the terms and the Act of union wholly unfounded. The so-called contract was simply an agreement, a consensus, on the terms on which the union would be acceptable to the two communities.\nThe action of the Imperial Parliament took the form of a statutory confirmation of the agreement and a declaration that, notwithstanding anything in the British North America Acts, 1867-1946, it should have the force of law. The Act was to be cited as the British North America Act, 1949 and with it the British North America Acts were to be cited with the addition \"1867-1949\". The terms thus became the statutory provisions of the union. The question, then, is one of interpretation of the provision, both of its factual content and of the nature of the right or obligation created, whether individual or governmental only.\nI find it unnecessary to examine the latter feature; I will assume that a personal right was vested in the appellant and that a specific obligation towards him on the part of the Dominion Crown was created. That obligation I interpret to be that the Government will offer employment to him and others similarly placed, on the terms mentioned; and that if he accepts the offer, the resulting employment will embody those terms. What the language of the clause means generally is that the former employees will be retained in their employment if they elect to continue in it and that they will have certain benefits secured to them. This in turn presupposes generally that the public work or undertaking will continue as before.\nThe employment of the appellant was so continued and that it was intended to comply in its contractual terms with no. 39 has not been seriously challenged. There is a constitutional obligation on the Government of Canada to observe, for example, the declaration that the wages of such an employee shall not be less than those obtaining at the time of union and that pension rights will be allowed as provided; it is to be assumed that the Government will respect that obligation; and, in the circumstances, the Crown cannot be heard to say that the offer to the appellant proposed other terms which were accepted, an act involving a waiver of the provision. That a waiver could be made by an individual employee expressly and with proper con- sideration effecting a new arrangement outside the statute can be conceded, but nothing of that sort took place. What, then, do the particulars, as applicable to the appellant, mean?\nThe language must be interpreted in the light of the situation at the time the terms were accepted. The Terms of Union by no. 31 set out in detail certain works and services in Newfoundland which would be transferred to Canada. They include \"(d) civil avation, including Gander Airport\". The property of the airfield is transferred to Canada by no. 33. Number 36 speaks of the \"works, property, or services taken over by Canada\". When, then, no. 39(1) speaks of \"services taken over by Canada pursuant to these Terms\" what are described are the actual services theretofore carried on in Newfoundland; when taken over they would be included in any general and national service of the same class. But that, for the purposes of interpreting no. 39, would not mean that continued employment in an existing Newfoundland service could take place only in one confined exclusively to that Province, that is, of a nature of which there was nothing of the same kind or under an administering department in Canada, and that the continued employment at the Gander airport was, as argued by Mr. Jolliffe, an employment \"in similar Canadian services\".\nHere the appellant did continue his work in the existing and continued service in Newfoundland, and the provision of no. 39(1) was so far respected. Nor is there any complaint that the wages have been reduced or the pension rights not recognized. The complaint is that the appellant has not been paid wages equal to those in similar airfields in other parts of Canada.\nThe employment was to be \"under the terms and conditions from time to time governing employment in those services\". This means, in the case before us, national terms and conditions applicable to work at Gander. There are terms and conditions prescribed generally for the Dominion-wide air services, and for carpenters they provide for what is known as the \"prevailing rate\" of remuneration, meaning the rate which carpenters, working generally in the district or community of the employee, are paid. It is not contended that the \"prevailing rate\" in Newfoundland has not been applied; it is urged that the appellant was given employment not in the service in which he was already employed, not in \"those services\", but in a similar Canadian service, the air service of Canada as it included Newfoundland. The point of the argument eludes me, but, accepting the contention, the result would not be affected. To be in a service under the national Government, whether national in scope or confined to one Province, means to be subject to the terms and conditions governing it as the national Government makes them; and the \"prevailing rate\" is as determinative of the appellant's right in the one case as in the other.\nThe final objection arises out of the administration of the employment. The Civil Service Act was extended to Newfoundland as of the date of the union. It is by a regulation of the Civil Service Commission that the \"prevailing rate\" measure was applied. The actual finding of that rate in the case of the appellant was not ascertained by the Commission itself. By regulation the Commission provided that the finding of such a fact by a governmental department, approved by order in council, would be accepted as proof of the fact. Mr. Jolliffe challenges this as a delegation beyond the authority of the Commission to make.\nI cannot accept this argument. A distinction must be made between prescribing the standard of remuneration and determining a fact for the purpose of applying it. The Commission having set the former can, in any case, ascertain the fact by any reasonable means available to it, and the most obvious would be a department in a position, by reason of its services, to do so. But that the appellant is not receiving the prevailing rate is not claimed and the question of delegation is irrelevant. What is sought is a rate equal to that being paid at another airport in another Province. Each airport is subject to the same standard and that its application at Gander may result in the wages being less than at other airports has no bearing on the issue.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs. There will be no costs for or against the intervenant. Locke J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Exchequer Court 3, delivered by the President, by which the petition of right of the present appellant was dismissed.\nThe suppliant was, prior to the union of Newfoundland with Canada on April 1, 1949, employed as a carpenter at Gander airport in Newfoundland and being paid at the rate of 82\u00a2 per hour. On that date Canada took over the airport from the colony and has since then operated it. On the same date the suppliant was offered and accepted employment with the respondent as a carpenter in the Public Service of Canada at the hourly rate of 86\u00bd\u00a2 and continued in such employment until June 1952, being paid at the hourly rate for carpenters prevailing at the airport from time to time throughout this period. These rates were substantially increased during the term of the employment of the suppliant, the rate paid between August 1, 1951, and June 30, 1952, being $1.30 per hour. Payment was also made for overtime worked throughout the period at rates offered to and accepted by the appellant.\nNo evidence was tendered at the trial, the case being tried on written admissions of fact, and there is nothing therein to indicate or suggest that he did not accept the offer of employment made to him without demur or qualification, or that he, at any time between April 1, 1949, and June 30, 1952, expressed dissatisfaction with his rate of pay or indicated that it was not accepted by him in full payment for his services.\nThe agreement between Newfoundland and Canada dated December 11, 1948, which defined the terms of union of that colony and the Dominion of Canada, became effective on April 1, 1949. Number 39(1) of the Terms of Union provides:\nEmployees of the Government of Newfoundland in the services taken over by Canada pursuant to these Terms will be offered employment in these services or in similar Canadian services under the terms and conditions from time to time governing employment in those services, but without reduction in salary or loss of pension rights acquired by reason of service in Newfoundland.\nUnder the terms of no. 33 the Newfoundland airport at Gander became the property of Canada. By c. 1 of the statutes of Canada for 1949 the agreement was approved. It was also confirmed by an amendment to the British North America Act (12-13 Geo. VI (Imp.), c. 22). By that amendment it was declared that the agreement should have the force of law notwithstanding anything in the British North America Acts, 1867 to 1946.\nIt was admitted that between April 1, 1949, and June 30, 1952, higher hourly rates of pay were paid to carpenters by the Crown at various airports in Canada than those paid to and accepted by the suppliant. These rates varied at different Canadian airports.\nThe petition of right asserted that:\n\u2026 by reason of the fact that he has not been paid wages or salary in accordance with the wage rates and the work-week from time to time governing employment in the Department of Transport (Air Services Branch), contrary to Subsection (1) of Section 39 of the said Terms of Union, there is due and owing to him, in respect of the period from the first day of April, 1949, to the thirtieth day of June, 1952, the sum of $3,468.10.\nThis amount was apparently arrived at by calculating the difference between the hourly rates paid to carpenters during the period at Gander and at the Dorval airport in Quebec. The concluding paragraph of the petition read:\nYour Suppliant pleads the British North America Act, 1949, and the Statutes of Canada 1949, Chapter 1, and the Terms of Union of Newfoundland with Canada, thereto attached, and in particular Sections 31 and 39 of the said Terms of Union.\nThe statement of defence asserted that the petition did not allege facts giving rise to any liability for which Her Majesty is bound, or claim relief for which a petition of right will lie, and submitted that this question of law should be determined before the trial of the issues of fact. Alternatively, it was alleged that the suppliant had been paid all the compensation which could by law be paid to him and that the Crown had complied with the terms of the article.\nThe question of law raised by what is, in effect, a demurrer should first be considered.\nThe claim, as pleaded, is for a sum of money alleged to be due to the suppliant as wages and is not a claim for damages. The only contract directly made between the suppliant and the Crown was that constituted by the offer of employment at an hourly wage rate made on April 1, 1949, and his acceptance of that offer and by his subsequent acceptance over a period of more than two years of wages at the hourly rate offered to and paid to him without demur.\nThe factum filed on behalf of the appellant, however, contends that the agreement between Newfoundland and Canada was made on behalf of the people of Newfoundland, including the suppliant, by their elected representatives, so that in effect the suppliant was a party to it and may bring an action to enforce the covenants of the Dominion. This argument, while mentioned before us, was pressed rather faintly, and with good reason, in my opinion, as I think it to be wholly untenable. The agreement, as its terms disclosed, was made between the political entity known as Newfoundland and the Dominion of Canada. The suppliant was a stranger to the contract.\nIt was, however, suggested upon the authority of the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Wigg et al. v. Attorney General for the Irish Free State 4, that the suppliant had a right of action under the agreement. In my opinion, this case has no application to the present. As is pointed out in the judgment of the Lord Chancellor at p. 679, following the treaty between the United Kingdom and the Irish Free State, by a series of enactments its provisions became part of the municipal law of the Free State and the right of the civil servants in question to receive compensation from the Free State was expressly declared. There is nothing of this nature in the present case.\nThe manner in which the suppliant's claim was pleaded is of importance in view of the nature of the defence filed. Judging by the argument advanced in the appellant's factum, the suppliant's claim was based on contract and to such a claim the defence as filed was sufficient. On the argument before us it was, however, urged for the suppliant that there was what was referred to as a \"constitutional duty\" imposed on Canada by no. 39(1). By this, no doubt, it was intended to assert that there was a statutory duty cast upon the Crown to pay wages at a higher rate than those paid to the suppliant. If there were such a duty, the remedy for a breach would be in damages and no such claim was advanced by the petition. Had the claim been framed as a claim for damages, I would assume that the Crown would have pleaded by way of defence that the suppliant was estopped by his conduct from asserting it. It can scarcely be seriously suggested that, after accepting the offer of employment on April 1, 1949, and continuing in the employ of the Crown, accepting the wages offered without objection, the suppliant could thereafter be heard to assert that he was entitled to something further by way of damages. Had he on April 1, 1949, refused the employment at the hourly rate of 86\u00bd\u00a2 and insisted on the rate being paid at Dorval or elsewhere, no doubt the result would have been that he would not have been employed. Having led his employers to believe by his conduct that the wages tendered were accepted as full payment for his services, he would be estopped from advancing an inconsistent claim.\nOn the argument before us it was contended for the respondent that, if the suppliant had any such right as was asserted, he had waived his right to enforce it. The point, however, was not open since waiver was not pleaded.\nIf the claim were to be now considered as a claim for damages for breach of a statutory duty or for a declaration of right upon the pleadings as they stand, the Crown would be deprived of its right to rely upon an estoppel by conduct and, alternatively, upon waiver, since neither was pleaded.\nIn my opinion, the objection that no cause of action is disclosed by the petition of right is well taken and the action accordingly should fail.\nIt was, no doubt, for the reason that the learned President was informed that this was regarded as a test case that he considered the claim upon its merits. On this aspect of the matter, I respectfully agree with the interpretation which has been placed on no. 39(1) in the reasons for judgment delivered at the trial.\nIn view of my conclusion upon the first question, it is unnecessary for me to consider the further contention that legal proceedings do not lie against the Crown to enforce payment of the remuneration of a servant.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs. Cartwright J.:\u2014I agree with the reasons and conclusion of the learned President 5 and would accordingly dismiss the appeal with costs. I agree that there should be no order as to the costs of the intervenant.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the suppliant, appellant: Jolliffe, Lewis & Osler, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W.

Dearing, Administratrix of the Estate of Landon Roy Burger, Deceased (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nCharles Hebert (Defendant) Respondent.\n1957: October 17; 1957: November 18.\nPresent: Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Locke, Cartwright and Abbott JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA\nMotor vehicles\u2014Negligence\u2014Statutory burden of proof\u2014Whether burden discharged by defendant\u2014Killing of pedestrian\u2014The Vehicles and Highway Traffic Act, R.S.A. 1942, c. 275, s. 94(1).\nThe defendant, driving at night on a four-lane highway, struck B, a pedestrian, and inflicted injuries as a result of which B died. In an action brought by the administratrix of B's estate, the trial judge found that both B and the defendant had been negligent and apportioned the degrees of fault one-third to B and two-thirds to the defendant. On appeal by the defendant this judgment was reversed by a majority, which held that B alone had been negligent and dismissed the action accordingly. The plaintiff appealed.\nHeld (Kerwin C.J. and Abbott J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge should be restored, subject to a modification in the award of damages. In the circumstances it could not be said that the defendant had discharged the onus placed on him by s. 94(1) of The Vehicles and Highway Traffic Act of showing that the damages did not result from his negligence. Winnipeg Electric Company v. Geel, [1932] A.C. 690 at 695-6, applied. APPEAL from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta 1, reversing a judgment of Primrose J. Appeal allowed.\nW. G. Morrow, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant.\nMarcel J. A. Lambert, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and Abbott J. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting):\u2014Omitting that part which deals with the question of damages and costs, the reasons for judgment of the trial judge read as follows:\nI find the Defendant proceeding North in the proper driving lane at a speed of 45 miles per hour and struck the Deceased Burger whom he did not see until the time of impact. The Defendant was negligent in failing to keep a proper lookout and has not satisfied the onus on him under S. 94 of the Vehicles & Highway Traffic Act. I find contributory negligence on the part of the Deceased Burger in proceeding across the highway in to the path of the Defendant's car.\nI apportion the negligence or degree of fault \u2153 to the Deceased Burger and \u2154 to the Defendant.\nNo question of credibility arises and therefore the Court of Appeal was, and this Court is, in as good a position as the trial judge to draw the proper inferences from the evidence.\nIn the statement of claim it is alleged that at the time of the occurrence the deceased was crossing the main highway from west to east and the evidence supports this allegation. After having considered the entire record I agree with the majority of the Court of Appeal that the respondent has satisfied the onus placed upon him by s. 94(1) of The Vehicles and Highway Traffic Act, R.S.A. 1942, c. 275.\nThe respondent was driving his automobile northerly in the easterly lane of a four-lane highway at a speed of about 45 miles per hour, well within the legal limit. When about 100 yards south of an intersecting secondary road, he slackened his speed and, as he was obliged by law to do, he dimmed his headlights because an automobile was approaching him from the north. The lights of that automobile \"blinded him\" so that he \"would not be able to see very much\", but it is not to be expected, and in fact would interfere with the flow of traffic, that under those circumstances the respondent should come to a stop. He was keeping a proper look-out as he was aware that \"there might be someone around\" the intersection, at the southwest corner of which was a service-station. Except for the suggestion (as to which no evidence was forthcoming) that the respondent was returning from this service-station to his oil-truck, which he had parked off the travelled portion of the four-lane highway at the north-east corner of the intersection, the oil-truck does not enter the picture and, in any event, had nothing to do with the accident. The respondent could not anticipate that the deceased would suddenly step into the path of his car.\nThis conclusion renders it unnecessary to consider the other matters discussed and the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nTaschereau J.:\u2014I am satisfied that this appeal should be dismissed, if it had been established that the pedestrian, who is represented by the appellant in the present case, had been struck at a distance of approximately 100 feet from the intersection.\nBut, as I have considerable doubts as to the exact place where the accident happened, I think that the onus, of proving that the damage did not result from the respondent's negligence, has not been discharged. (The Vehicles and Highway Traffic Act, R.S.A. 1942, c. 275, s. 94(1).)\nI would allow the appeal with costs, and restore the judgment at trial with the modification indicated in the judgment of my brother Locke.\nLocke J.:\u2014In this action, which was tried by Primrose J. without a jury, that learned judge found that the deceased Burger and the respondent had both been guilty of acts of negligence which contributed to the fatal accident and apportioned the degree of fault one-third to the deceased and two-thirds to the respondent.\nOn appeal, this judgment was reversed and the action dismissed by a majority judgment of the Court 2. Macdonald and Porter JJ.A. would have dismissed the appeal. The fact that there has been this division of opinion as to the liability of the respondent and that the onus of proving that the damage did not result from the respondent's negligence lay upon him, by virtue of s. 94(1) of The Vehicles and Highway Traffic Act, R.S.A. 1942, c. 275, indicates the necessity of a close examination both of the evidence and of the pleadings upon which the parties went to trial. The onus section reads:\nWhen any loss or damage is sustained or incurred by any person by reason of a motor vehicle in motion, the onus of proof that the loss or damage did not entirely or solely arise through the negligence or improper conduct of the owner or driver of the motor vehicle shall be upon the owner or driver of the motor vehicle.\nThe effect of the section cannot, in my opinion, be distinguished from the section of the Motor Vehicle Act of Manitoba considered by the Judicial Committee in Winnipeg Electric Company v. Geel 3, where its practical application is defined.\nThe statement of claim, which might have consisted, as pointed out in Geel's Case, merely of allegations that the deceased Burger, a pedestrian, had been struck and killed on the highway by a motor car driven by the respondent and of allegations of resulting damage, contained various counts of negligence, including that of failing to keep a proper look-out, failing to make proper use of the headlights of the car and driving at too high a rate of speed in the circumstances.\nBy the statement of defence the respondent alleged various acts of negligence on the part of Burger, including an allegation that he had run across the highway in the dark so that the respondent had no opportunity to stop his vehicle in time to avoid a collision. He further pleaded the provisions of The Vehicles and Highway Traffic Act and regulations made thereunder, without specifying what sections of the Act or parts of the regulations were relied upon. It is to be particularly noted that the respondent did not in the statement of defence claim that he had been blinded by the lights of an oncoming vehicle as an excuse for his failure to see Burger before the car struck him. In view of the terms of the onus section, if it was intended to rely upon any such ground as a defence it should have been pleaded.\nThe oral evidence as to how the accident occurred consisted of that given by the respondent and by one Fontaine who was driving with him at the time, seated to his right on the front seat. This was supplemented by evidence of marks of blood found on the pavement, from the position of which inferences of fact may be drawn. While there was a filling-station on the south-west corner of the intersection of the broad four-laned highway between Wetaskiwin and Edmonton, upon which the respondent was driving north, and a secondary road which intersected it at right angles, this was dimly lighted and, apparently, no one was there who saw Burger before the accident or witnessed the occurrence.\nIt was at about 10 o'clock on the evening of December 24, 1953, that the respondent, driving north towards Edmonton, approached the intersection in question. According to him, there was some traffic approaching from the north and, when about 100 yards distant from the intersection, he dimmed the lights of his car and saw standing off the highway on the north-east portion of the intersection a truck with its lights burning, which was later shown to be the truck driven by Burger.\nThe position of this truck is of importance. McBride J.A., with whose judgment Johnson J.A. agreed, said 4 that \"the rear of the truck was about in line with the north boundary of this local road\", which appears to me to be supported by the evidence of the photograph ex. 1. This photograph clearly shows part of the rear of the truck to be on the gravel on the north portion of the road from the east where it broadened out to join the north and south highway. The police officer Wheatley said that it was \"parked on the cross-road\".\nIt was a dark night and while s. 34(1) (a) of the Act required the motor vehicle to have headlamps providing sufficient light to make clearly visible objects on the highway at a distance of 300 feet ahead of the vehicle, Hebert did not see Burger before the car struck him. The following extracts from his examination for discovery deal with the matter:\nQ. And which part of your car came in contact with him? A. Oh, I would say the left fender and part of the hood, I would say the fender and then the hood.\nQ. And did he appear to come from the left, that is your left? A. Yes, he did. Q. No question about that, is there? A. Well, that was, I didn't see him until he was on the car.\nQ. And when you first saw him how far would you be from him if at all. If there is any distance at all? A. Well, actually the first time I did see him he was on the car.\nQ. And what happened to the body when you hit him, what happened to him? A. Well, it seemed like as if he rolled over to the back of the hood or the side, I am not quite positive.\nQ. Would that be down your left side? A. I believe it was, either over the hood or down to the back, I am not positive, but hit the hood [sic], the hood came down, I imagine he went over the back of the car.\nQ. I see, but you don't know which side? A. I couldn't say, I know that he must have fell off partways to the back of the car, I don't know for sure.\nGiving evidence in his own defence, he said that he first saw the man when he was on the car.\nAsked if he had then passed the truck he said:\nIt is quite possible, I believe I did.\nFontaine, called for the defence, said as to Burger:\nI actually didn't notice him until he was right alongside the car.\nand that:\nIt was just a split second and he was on the car.\nHe said that from this momentary glimpse he thought that Burger was running or trotting and that he was coming from the left hand side. Asked by the respondent's counsel as to where Hebert's car was at that time, he said:\nIt would be pretty nearly directly across from the truck and may be a little in front.\nQ. You mean a bit to the north? A. Yes, a bit to the north.\nOn cross-examination, however, he was asked:\nQ. Where was the truck at that time relevant to the car you were in? A. It would be on the north side.\nQ. Are you sure? Beside you or ahead of you? A. Could be ahead of us a little bit.\nFontaine said further that after the car struck the man:\n\u2026 it appeared to me like he came up on the hood and came down on the fender, that is what more or less appeared to me.\nThe mounted police officer, Wheatley, said that the truck on the north-east part of the intersection was facing north 3 feet to the east of the edge of the main highway. He described its position as being \"parked at the intersection\" which the evidence of the photographs supports.\nAt a position on the lane immediately to the east of the centre-line of the highway and 16 feet distant from the easterly limit of the highway, the police officers found a large quantity of blood. Burger's body had been removed, apparently, before the police officers arrived, and it is only a matter of inference that it was at this point that his body was lying after the impact. Constable Wheatley, who took the measurements, said that this large bloodstain was 118 feet from the intersection. Whether he meant from the centre or from the northern limit of the intersection was not stated. Some few feet to the south of it, there was another and smaller bloodstain. Hebert had stopped his car on the right side of the most easterly lane at a point described as 142 feet from the large bloodstain.\nAccording to the respondent, his vehicle was in good condition and the lights were functioning and it is to be assumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that they complied with the requirements of the Act and would make clearly visible an object at a distance of 300 feet ahead. There is no evidence as to how far they would make such an object visible when they were dimmed. In answer to a question asked by his own counsel as to whether any car had actually met him south of the service-station, he said:\nWell, I believe he did pass me, come to think of it, I am not positive but I believe he did.\nAgain, asked as to why he kept the lights dimmed, he said:\nWell, I kept them on dim for the\u2014well, just as this car passed me I had them on dim and just a short period after that is when he actually came up on my car, you see.\nAnd again:\nQ. Well, you met this car and there was a short time afterwards there was this accident? A. That is right.\nHe estimated his speed as he approached the intersection at between 40 and 45 miles per hour and, while he did not apply his brake, he said that he had taken his foot off the accelerator.\nIt is of some importance to note that not a word was said by the respondent in giving his evidence in chief to suggest that the lights of the car, which he thought he had met south of the service-station, had affected his sight in any way or had anything to do with the accident. This and the fact that it had, as pointed out, not been raised as a ground of defence would indicate that nothing of the kind had occurred and that the defendant did not rely upon anything of the kind to negative negligence on his part. However, on cross-examination, he was asked:\nQ. Now, at some distance before you passed this car you were blinded by the lights? A. Yes, I was blinded.\nAnd, in answer to a further question as to how many car-lengths before he passed the other vehicle he had experienced this blindness, he said:\nIt might have lasted two car lengths, more or less.\nThere was no evidence as to the length of the car, which was a 1946 Chevrolet. It may be assumed that it was some 15 to 17 feet. As this had been suggested for the first time in cross-examination, his own counsel re-examined him on the point, when the following appears:\nQ. Did you tell me Mr. Hebert that after having made, met this oncoming car that you kept your lights on dim because there were other vehicles coming behind? A. Yes.\nQ. And this so called blindness by the other car, you were on a four lane highway, are you not? A. Yes.\nQ. And is it a total blindness, or partially clear [sic]? A. Well, I wouldn't say total blindness but enough you wouldn't be able to see very much.\nQ. And that passes immediately you have passed the other car? A. That is right.\nMcBride J.A., who found that Burger was solely to blame for the accident, drew the inference from the evidence that he had been struck some 30 yards to the north of the intersection. Dealing with this aspect of the matter, he said that the respondent had given evidence that the point of impact was north of the oil-truck. As his evidence above quoted shows, he simply said that it was \"quite possible\" it had passed the truck and that he believed that it had. Again, it is said that the passenger Fontaine placed the point of impact at a bit to the north of the oil-truck. The passage from his evidence in which this statement appears is quoted above but the learned judge appears to have overlooked the fact that on cross-examination he had said that the truck was on the north side of the car at the time and it \"could be ahead of us a little bit\". In coming to his conclusion that the impact had been probably 30 yards north of the intersection, the learned judge said in part 5:\nThe suggestion was canvassed at trial that deceased may have been hit some distance to the south and carried north on the hood of appellant's car. There is nothing in the evidence to support this suggestion. This again is simply speculation and Constable Wheatley quite definitely disposes of it in his evidence.\nThis indicates that the evidence of the respondent, that he did not see Burger until \"he was on the car and that it seemed like as if he rolled over to the back of the hood or the side\", and that of Fontaine that Burger was on the car and that it appeared as if he came up on the hood and came down on the fender, was overlooked. As to the statement that the evidence of Constable Wheatley disposed of the suggestion, this again is not borne out by the evidence. Indeed, that Burger after being struck was carried some distance on top of the car which, admittedly, was going 35 miles an hour, was apparently the view of the counsel for the respondent at the trial, as the following passage from the cross-examination of the constable indicates:\nQ. Well now, let's suppose an automobile is driving in the right hand northbound lane, reasonably close to the parking lane and when an obstruction is struck by the left front edge, as would appear from Exhibit 4 was the case in this accident, and that pedestrian rolls up on the hood which again is suggested by Exhibit 4, again suggested by the dent and then rolls off to the side, that would place the body in which? A. The passing lane.\nQ. That is a fair suspicion [sic]? A. It is consistent with the facts.\nQ. Have you, from your experience, any idea of how far a man might be carried on the hood of a car? A. It is hard to say. It varies. Sometimes they will be thrown off immediately, sometimes off to the side, sometimes they will be carried for a considerable distance, depending on the speed and the conditions.\nExhibit 4 was a photograph of the respondent's car taken after the accident that night by the constable and shows a considerable dent on the left front side of the hood, not far distant from the radiator-cap.\nIf the respondent's evidence that he was driving at about 35 miles an hour when he reached the intersection be accepted, his car would travel approximately 52 feet in a second. The evidence being clear and uncontradicted that when the man was struck his body was on the hood or fender before falling off, the learned trial judge, in view of Fontaine's statement on cross-examination that they were to the south of the truck when the man was struck, might properly draw the inference that he had fallen off the hood or fender of the car at the point where the most southerly of the bloodstains was situate, which was apparently about 110 feet to the north of the intersection, and that it was the violence of his fall off the car that caused him to roll forward the few feet to the place where the large quantity of his blood was found. He would be carried that distance by the car in about 2 seconds.\nWhile it was no part of the appellant's obligation to prove that the respondent had by his negligence caused the collision, it is to be noted that if Burger was crossing the highway at the intersection, as the evidence clearly suggests, he was entitled to the right of way over traffic on the highway by reason of subs. 2 of s. 59 of The Vehicles and Highway Trafic Act and, accordingly, entitled to assume that a vehicle such as that of the respondent coming from the south would comply with the statutory requirement. Its terms are clear and explicit:\nThe operator of a vehicle \u2026 shall yield the right-of-way to a pedestrian crossing the roadway upon or within any crossing at an intersection.\nMcBride J.A., having reached the conclusion that the collision had taken place well to the north of the intersection, held that Burger was at fault in that subs. 4 of s. 59 requires that every pedestrian crossing a roadway at any point other than within a marked or unmarked crossing shall yield the right of way to vehicles upon the roadway. But the application of this was based on the assumption that Burger had not been carried on the car some distance from the point of impact, which appears to me to be contrary to the evidence.\nI have dealt at some length with the evidence in this case as I think it to be of importance that there should be no departure from the manner of the application of the onus section as directed by the Judicial Committee in Winnipeg Electric Company v. Geel, supra. I refer in particular to the passage from the judgment, delivered by Lord Wright, which is reported at pp. 695-6 and from which I extract the following:\nApart from the section, a plaintiff claiming damages for personal injury in a, running-down case would have to prove that he was injured, that his injury was due to the defendant's fault and the fact and extent of his loss and damage; hence, unless he succeeded in establishing all these matters, he must fail. In virtue, however, of the statute he need only establish the first and the third elements\u2014i.e., that he was injured by the defendant and the extent of his damages; as to the second, the onus is removed from his shoulders, and if he establishes the two matters in respect of which the onus still remains on him, he may close his case, because it is then for the defendant to establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the jury that the loss, damage or injury did not arise through the negligence or improper conduct of himself or his servants.\nAfter referring to some of the various manners in which this may be done, the judgment continues:\nBut the onus which the section places on the defendant is not in law a shifting or transitory onus: it cannot be displaced merely by the defendant giving some evidence that he was not negligent, if that evidence, however credible, is not sufficient reasonably to satisfy the jury that he was not negligent: the burden remains on the defendant until the very end of the case, when the question must be determined whether or not the defendant has sufficiently shown that he did not in fact cause the accident by his negligence. If, on the whole of the evidence, the defendant establishes this to the satisfaction of the jury, he will be entitled to judgment; if, however, the issue is left in doubt or the evidence is balanced and even, the defendant will be held liable in virtue of the statutory onus, whereas in that event but for the statute the plaintiff would fail, because but for the statute the onus would be on him.\nTheir Lordships further expressly approved a passage from the judgment of Turgeon J.A. in a case under similar legislation in Stanley v. National Fruit Company 6, which, after stating the fact that the section placed the onus of proof upon the defendants, said:\nThis means that the defendants must lose if no evidence of the circumstances of the accident is given at all, or if the evidence leaves the Court in a state of real doubt as to negligence or no neligence, or is so evenly balanced that the Court can come to no sure conclusion as to which of the parties to the accident is to blame.\nIn the present matter, that there was room for doubt as to the effect of the evidence would appear evident from the fact that three of the learned judges of the Supreme Court of Alberta have considered that the respondent had not discharged the statutory onus cast upon him while three have reached a different conclusion, considering that Burger was solely to blame.\nWith great respect, I think the learned judges who agreed in allowing the appeal proceeded on a misapprehension as to the effect of the evidence given by the respondent, Fontaine and Constable Wheatley, which appears to me to negative any contention that the man was struck to the north of the intersection. I am of the opinion, in agreement with the trial judge and Macdonald and Porter JJ.A., that the evidence given on behalf of the respondent failed completely to discharge the onus, as it is defined in the judgment of the Judicial Committee.\nIn view of the terms of the onus section which would impose liability upon the respondent for this fatal accident in the absence of proof that it had not been occasioned entirely or solely through his negligence, had he intended to rebut the presumption by claiming that he had been blinded by the lights of an oncoming car, Rule 150 of the Supreme Court of Alberta, which requires that every pleading shall contain the material facts on which the party claiming relies for his defence, would require such facts to be pleaded. As I have already pointed out, the respondent said nothing about this when giving his evidence in chief and Fontaine, while asked if they had met some traffic from the north, was not asked and said nothing as to the lights of any oncoming car. Had the experienced counsel who appeared for the respondent at the trial intended to raise this as a matter of defence, no doubt, in addition to pleading it, the evidence would have been directed to showing clearly where it was that the respondent had passed the southbound car, whether the lights of that car were bright or on high beam and had not been dimmed, and how far the respondent had driven after passing the other car before striking Burger. In addition, I would expect that some evidence would be given as to the field of vision afforded by the lights of the respondent's car when they were dimmed, and there was no such evidence.\nIt is, no doubt, for the reason that this did not form any part of the defence that the evidence as to where the respondent passed the southbound car is so vague. It is to be remembered that the service-station was in the southwest portion of the intersection and the question directed to him by his own counsel when giving evidence in chief was whether he had met a car south of the service-station. The vague nature of the answer which is above quoted indicated that he was not sure that he had. He was not asked in chief to say how far after this incident his car had struck Burger. On his cross-examination, when it was sug- gested to him that he had been blinded by the lights of the oncoming car, he was asked how far his car had travelled after passing the oncoming car: the vague answer to this was \"anywhere from four, five, maybe six car lengths, it is possible\" and that after being first blinded he had gone \"maybe ten car lengths or more\" before he had passed the other car. The vehicle standing at the north-east corner of the intersection was a tank-truck and the respondent might reasonably assume that it had stopped there for some purpose not unconnected with the filling-station and he admitted in evidence that he might have expected there would be someone around in the vicinity of the intersection, and a duty lay upon him by reason of the statute to afford the right of way to pedestrians crossing the highway at the intersection. Had it been open to the respondent to negative the presumption of negligence by evidence that he had been temporarily blinded in the manner suggested, and I think it was not, the evidence was totally insufficient, in my opinion, to discharge the onus. I feel sure that the reason for the lack of further evidence is that above stated.\nThe appellant did not appeal from the judgment which attributed one-third of the blame to Burger and that matter is, accordingly, not in issue. As to the award of damages other than the allowance for funeral expenses, which the appellant abandoned, I see no ground upon which the judgment at the trial should be interfered with.\nI would allow this appeal with costs and direct that the judgment at the trial, with the exception noted, be restored.\nCartwright J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta 7 setting aside the judgment of Primrose J. and dismissing the action. The appeal raises only questions of fact.\nAt about 10 p.m. on December 24, 1953, the respondent was driving north on a paved four-lane highway in the Province of Alberta when his automobile struck and killed a pedestrian, Landon Roy Burger, hereinafter referred to as \"the deceased\". The deceased was the adopted son of the appellant who is a widow. She has been appointed administratrix of his estate, to the whole of which she, as his next-of-kin, is beneficially entitled. The learned trial judge found that the respondent was negligent in failing to keep a proper look-out and had not satisfied the onus, cast upon him by s. 94(1) of The Vehicles and Highway Traffic Act, R.S.A. 1942, c. 275, of proving that the accident did not arise through his negligence. The learned judge also found the deceased negligent in proceeding across the highway into the path of the respondent's car, and apportioned the fault one-third to the deceased and two-thirds to the respondent. He assessed the damages of the appellant under The Fatal Accidents Act, R.S.A. 1942, c. 125, at $3,000 and under The Trustee Act, R.S.A. 1942, c. 215, at $3,000 plus $415 for funeral expenses. Counsel agree that the last-mentioned item of $415 should be disallowed.\nThere were no eye-witnesses of the accident other than the respondent and a passenger in his car. Under these circumstances where the respondent and his passenger gave varying estimates as to times, distances or rates of speed, it was open to the learned trial judge to accept those least favourable to the respondent, and to act upon the view that the accident happened as follows: The respondent was proceeding north in the most easterly lane of a four-lane highway and was approaching an intersecting secondary road. An oil-truck, owned by the deceased, was parked to the east of the pavement in the north-east corner of the intersection. On the south-west corner was a service-station. The respondent was aware \"that there might be someone around\". He was talking to his passenger. He was proceeding at about 40 to 45 miles per hour. When about 100 yards south of the truck he slackened his speed to 30 to 35 miles per hour and dimmed his headlights because a car was approaching from the north, the lights of which \"blinded him\". He does not say in which of the westerly lanes the other car was being driven but in re-examination describes the degree of \"blindness\" as follows:\nQ. And this so-called blindness by the other car, you were on a four lane highway, are you not? A. Yes.\nQ. And is it a total blindness, or partially clear? A. Well, I wouldn't say total blindness but enough you wouldn't be able to see very much.\nQ. And that passes immediately you have passed the other car? A. That is right. After the respondent had passed the car which caused the \"blindness\" referred to, he proceeded six car-lengths and I then struck the deceased without seeing him until the instant of the impact. He offered no explanation for his failure to see the deceased after passing the other car other than the fact that his lights were still dimmed. The night was dark but it was clear.\nUnder these circumstances, in my opinion, not only was it open to the learned trial judge to find that the respondent was not keeping a proper look-out and had failed to satisfy the onus resting upon him but he was right in so holding. On the theory of the respondent the deceased was in the act of crossing the road from west to east and from the instant that the respondent passed the other car there was nothing to obstruct his view of the deceased. Had he seen him, as I think it was his duty to do, there would have been room on the highway for the respondent to manoeuvre so as to avoid striking the deceased even if he would not have had time to bring his car to a stop.\nThe finding that the deceased was guilty of contributory negligence was not questioned. I share the view of H. J. Macdonald J.A. that the apportionment of the degrees of negligence made by the learned trial judge should not be disturbed.\nOn the question of damages, the award under The Trustee Act was not challenged but it was argued that the amount assessed under The Fatal Accidents Act was excessive and resulted in a duplication of damages. On this branch of the matter I agree with the reasons and conclusion of Macdonald J.A., concurred in by Porter J.A., and, on this point, by Ford C.J.A. As mentioned above it was conceded that the item of $270, representing two-thirds of $415, ought not to have been awarded.\nIn the result I would allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge with costs throughout, subject to the modification that the judgment should be for $4,000 instead of $4,270.\nAppeal allowed and judgment at trial restored with a modification, with costs throughout, Kerwin C.J. and Abbott J. dissenting.

Pratt v. Beamen, [1930] S.C.R. 284 at 287; Hanes et al. v. Kennedy et al., [1941] S.C.R. 384 at 387, applied.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick 1 affirming a judgment of Richard J. as to liability but increasing the amount of damages awarded. Appeal dismissed.\nJ. Paul Barry, Q.C., for the defendants, appellants.\nD. G. Rouse, for the plaintiffs, respondents.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and Fauteux J. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014At the conclusion of the argument on behalf of the appellants, and without calling upon counsel for the respondents, we were all of opinion that the appeal failed as to the question of liability; that is, we were satisfied that the accident was caused by the gross negligence of the driver of the automobile and that the respondents were neither volens nor contributorily negligent. Judgment was reserved on the appeal as to damages.\nAfter considering all the evidence and the reasons for judgment in the Courts below, I have come to the conclusion that this Court should not interfere with the awards made by the Appeal Division. No question arises as to special damages but the majority of the Appeal Division came to the conclusion that the allowances made by the trial judge for general damages were so inordinately low as to be a wholly erroneous estimate of them, referring to Nance v. British Columbia Electric Railway Company Limited 2. The matter has also been considered in this Court in Ross v. Dunstall; Ross v. Emery 3, Pratt v. Beaman 4, and Hanes et al. v. Kennedy et al.5. While in these last three cases a provincial Court of Appeal had reduced the damages awarded by the trial judge, the same principle is applicable and that is, particularly in Canada where estimates of damages may differ in the various Provinces, that this Court will not, except in very exceptional circumstances, interfere with the amounts fixed by the Court of Appeal where they differ from the damages assessed by the trial judge. Mr. Barry referred to several cases where this Court did not agree with the amounts awarded by a Court of Appeal, but in all of them exceptional circumstances were to be found. In any event, facts differ so greatly that it is impossible to say that one case is precisely like another.\nIn the Appeal Division Mr. Justice Bridges, who finally agreed in the trial judge's estimate of the damages, stated that if he had been trying the case himself he would have allowed Miss Pollard $10,000 instead of $7,000 general damages. The majority, finding that the trial judge's estimates were so low as to require correction, concluded that for general damages a proper allowance to the respondent Patricia Pollard was $15,000 and that in the case of the respondent Mary Lou Murphy the $1,200 allowed at the trial should be increased to $3,000. In view of all the evidence as to the injuries suffered by the respondents, I am not prepared to interfere with these amounts.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Taschereau and Cartwright JJ. was delivered by\nCartwright J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick 6, affirming the judgment of Richard J. as to liability but increasing the amount of general damages awarded to the respondents.\nThe respondents were both injured in an automobile accident. They were being carried gratuitously as passengers in an automobile owned by the appellant Lang and driven with his consent by the appellant Joseph and consequently under the New Brunswick statute in order to succeed in their action they had to establish that the appellant Joseph was guilty of gross negligence which caused the accident.\nIt was argued before us that the Courts below erred in finding that gross negligence had been shown and in failing to find that the respondents were guilty of contributory negligence. Both of these points were disposed of adversely to the appellants at the hearing and counsel for the respondents was called upon only upon the question of damages.\nNo question arises as to the special damages. The learned trial judge assessed the general damages of the respondent Pollard at $7,000 and those of the respondent Murphy at $1,200. The Appeal Division by a majority (McNair C.J. N.B. and Ritchie J., with Bridges J. dissenting) increased these amounts to $15,000 and $3,000 respectively.\nThe injuries suffered by the respondent Pollard are described as follows in the reasons of Ritchie J.7:\nMiss Pollard, who at the date of the mishap was about 20 years of age, suffered a comminuted fracture involving the left femur, a fracture involving the right tibia, multiple lacerations and abrasions and some degree of shock. Treatment of the left femur fracture by traction was not successful so two plates were applied to it by operative procedure on September 22, 1954, and casts placed on both legs. Miss Pollard then was kept immobilized for about 3 months. She then, because union was not too evident, was placed in another cast and for a period of about one year the cast was removed at intervals of approximately 3 months and X-rays taken which showed delays in union and so required that a cast be re-applied. In August 1955, a brace was fitted to support the leg. Then an increased deformity developed to an extent that a re-operation was necessary. From the operations there will be a permanent scar, 10 or 12 inches in length, visible when shorts or a bathing suit are worn. A laceration on the forehead required sutures. Miss Pollard's stays in the Fredericton hospital in 1954 were from September 17th to November 30th, in 1955 from January 3rd to January 6th, from February 4th to February 8th, from April 4th to April 8th, July 5th to July 9th, on September 3rd and from April 29th to May 6th. The second operation performed at Moncton required a stay in the Moncton hospital from October 23rd to November 19th. Between September 18, 1954, and November 19, 1955, Miss Pollard's stays in hospital totalled 130 days, inclusive of the date of each admission and discharge. At the time of the trial, in December 1955, movement of the knee was hardly one-third of normal and Miss Pollard was undergoing physiotherapy treatment which was expected to continue for some months. Dr. E. W. Ewart of Moncton, who performed the second operation, anticipated further recovery but expressed the opinion Miss Pollard will always have some restriction of movement in the left knee and that he would expect some degree of limp.\nTo this it should be added that the evidence indicated a probability of the necessity of further surgical treatment to Miss Pollard's knee and that, in his reasons for judgment, the learned trial judge spoke of the probability of suffering and further surgical treatment in the future.\nThe injuries to the respondent Murphy are described as follows in the reasons of Ritchie J.8:\nThe injuries sustained by Miss Murphy included a fracture of the upper end of the right tibia, which, extending into the joint, caused fluid in the joint and consequent pain on bending the knee. The fracture was aspirated three times and compression applied to prevent a reformation. Miss Murphy then was allowed to use crutches. On November 6th a leg cast was applied and the leg immobilized until December 13th when X-rays revealed the fracture was healed. No permanent disability will result from the fracture but traumatic arthritis can ensue. Traumatic arthritis means pain. Miss Murphy testified that on rainy days she suffers from aches and pains in the injured leg and in her knee. While in the hospital she was very upset and nervous, had bouts of crying and was generally quite disturbed. Her hospital terms were from September 18th to October 7th, from October 13th to October 18th, from October 21st to November 26th and on December 13th, a total of 64 days, again computed inclusively. At the trial Miss Murphy complained of a \"nervous stomach\" which she did not have before the accident, and also said she did not sleep well and had a very poor appetite. She has returned to her home in Milltown because she does not feel she could live in a boarding-house and be up part of the night with stomach sickness.\nI find nothing in the evidence or in the reasons for judgment to indicate that either the learned trial judge or the learned justices in the Appeal Division proceeded on any wrong principle or under any misapprehension as to the effect of the evidence. The difference between them was one of judgment as to what amounts should be awarded for the injuries described and their past and future effects. It is obvious that these amounts were not determinable by precise calculation. The learned justices who constituted the majority in the Appeal Division were of the opinion that the amounts assessed by the learned trial judge were much too low and substituted the amounts which they considered to be more in accordance with the severity of the injuries.\nUnder these circumstances where no error of principle and no misapprehension of any feature of the evidence is indicated I think that the rule which we should follow is that stated by Anglin J., as he then was, giving the unanimous judgment of the Court, in Pratt v. Beamen 9:\nThe second ground of appeal is that the damages allowed for pain and suffering by the trial judge, $1,500, should not have been reduced, as they were on appeal, to S500. While, if we were the first appellate court, we might have been disposed not to interfere with the assessment of these damages by the Superior Court, it is the well established practice of this court not to interfere with an amount allowed for damages, such as these, by the court of last resort in a province. That court is, as a general rule, in a much better position than we can be to determine a proper allowance having regard to local environment. It is, of course, impossible to say that the Court of King's Bench erred in principle in reducing these damages.\nThis decision was followed in the unanimous judgment of this Court, delivered by Kerwin J., as he then was, in Hanes et al. v. Kennedy et al. 10.\nThe principle appears to me to be equally applicable whether the first appellate Court has increased or decreased the general damages awarded at the trial.\nI find myself unable to say that any sufficient ground has been shown for interfering with the judgment of the Appeal Division.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nRand J.:\u2014The question in this Court of damages awarded in a provincial appeal Court modifying those given at trial is not primarily whether they are \"inordinately\" high or low, or are such as would betray this Court into an exclamatory astonishment. Assuming these tests to be appropriate to an appeal from the trial\u2014and it was to an appeal from a verdict that the language of Viscount Simon in Nance v. British Columbia Electric Railway Company Limited 11 was directed\u2014our duty is to give the judgment the Court from which the appeal is brought should have given. If it is clear that the Appeal Division here, in its initial determination that the damages allowed were too low, has not properly applied the governing principle, this Court must ordinarily restore the trial judgment; if it is not, a second question arises whether what it has done in its own assessment is itself beyond the other limit of the rule.\nI share the views of Bridges J. on the quantum which, if sitting at the trial, he would in this case have awarded. But a difficulty is raised by the ground on which Ritchie J. puts the increased award: that the amount found by the trial judge was inordinately low. However necessary or helpful it may be, danger lurks in the uncritical use of adjectives or illustrative language for the purposes of judgment. What is \"inordinate\"? It is not necessarily the equivalent of \"shocking\" and in any event these terms, particularly the latter, stressing the subjective element, tend, in their application, to vary with the sophistication of the individual mind. That application may vary also with different subject-matter: what is \"inordinate\" or \"shocking\" in negligence might be ordinary in libel.\nThe amount allowed by the Judicial Committee in Nance followed from a thorough analysis of the significant factors to be taken into account in determining the probable ultimate benefit lost to the claimant through the accident; and estimating that, in terms of money, in the light of all those factors the amount allowed by a trained and experienced judgment was proportionate to the total circumstances. That amount was what a jury could not reasonably have exceeded; but it was, I think, the proportionment, the balanced relation of the damages found to the entire factual and legal situation so analyzed, that was significant and furnished the limitations of a proper finding. The word \"unreasonable\" is a calmer word and has had a longer and a wider currency than those mentioned, and used in damages in a setting of that proportionment gives, in my opinion, more promise of consistency and relative uniformity.\nCould the majority in the Appeal Division, in the light of the framework of circumstances here, have found that the amounts allowed at trial were within the fair scope of \"unreasonably\" low? I am unable to hold they could not. Can it then be said that the new assessment is itself unreasonably high? And to this I must give a similar answer that I cannot say it is.\nThe appeal should, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the defendants, appellants: J.

Lamarre (Defendant) Respondent.\n1957: May 13, 14; 1957: December 19.\nPresent: Taschereau, Rand, Locke, Fauteux and Abbott JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nStatutes\u2014Operation\u2014Effect of legislation limiting right of appeal\u2014Jurisdiction of Court of Appeal of Quebec\u2014Expropriation\u2014Code of Civil Procedure, art. 1066k.\nThe right of appeal is a substantive right and not merely a matter of procedure, and a statute limiting an existing right of appeal has no application in an action instituted before its enactment, unless a contrary intention is expressly stated or necessarily implied. Williams et al. v. Irvine (1893), 22 S.C.R. 108; Hyde v. Lindsay (1898), 29 S.C.R. 99, applied.\n[Page109]\nSince, in enacting art. 1066k of the Code of Civil Procedure, in 1952, the Legislature did not manifest any intention to make it retroactive, the right of appeal in an expropriation case started in 1950 must be based on art. 1066k as it was enacted in 1940 by 4 Geo. VI, c. 71, s. 1.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, dismissing, for lack of jurisdiction, an appeal from a judgment homologating a decision of the Public Service Board in an expropriation matter. Appeal allowed.\nE. Brais, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant.\nF. Chauss\u00e9, the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nFauteux J.:\u2014Les faits et proc\u00e9dures conduisant \u00e0 cet appel peuvent se r\u00e9sumer comme suit:\nEn juin 1950, l'appelante, ci-apr\u00e8s \u00e9galement appel\u00e9e la Cit\u00e9, adoptait un r\u00e8glement autorisant son conseil \u00e0 acqu\u00e9rir, de gr\u00e9 \u00e0 gr\u00e9 ou par voie d'expropriation si n\u00e9cessaire, le terrain de diverses rues projet\u00e9es ou rues d\u00e9j\u00e0 ouvertes \u00e0 la circulation par les propri\u00e9taires de certaines terres subdivis\u00e9es par eux pour fins de lotissement. Suivant la loi qui la r\u00e9git, soit l'art. 608 a de la Loi des Cit\u00e9s et Villes adopt\u00e9 en 1948 par la Loi 12 Geo. VI, c. 74, art. 6, aucune indemnit\u00e9 n'est payable par la Cit\u00e9 pour l'acquisition d'un terrain que le propri\u00e9taire d'une subdivision a, suivant les plan et livre de renvoi d\u00e9pos\u00e9s au bureau d'enregistrement, destin\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9tablissement ou l'\u00e9largissement d'une rue ou ruelle. De ce chef, la Cit\u00e9 consid\u00e9ra qu'elle ne devait rien payer pour le terrain lui-m\u00eame. Quant aux am\u00e9liorations faites sur icelui, soit travaux de voirie, d'\u00e9gouttement ou autres, le conseil, ainsi qu'il appert au r\u00e8glement, fut d'avis qu'elles n'avaient aucune valeur commerciale, que le co\u00fbt en \u00e9tait inclus dans le prix des lots desservis ou charg\u00e9s \u00e0 leurs nouveaux propri\u00e9taires et que ne pouvant ni physiquement ni l\u00e9galement \u00eatre s\u00e9par\u00e9es du terrain, elles \u00e9taient, comme le terrain lui-m\u00eame, couvertes par la disposition pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e. Aussi bien et \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de ces am\u00e9liorations sp\u00e9cifia-t-on au r\u00e8glement qu'aucune indemnit\u00e9 ne serait pay\u00e9e dans le cas d'une acquisition faite de gr\u00e9 \u00e0 gr\u00e9, mais que, dans ceux o\u00f9 il serait n\u00e9cessaire de proc\u00e9der par voie\n[Page110]\nd'expropriation, le conseil, sans pr\u00e9judice au droit de faire valoir ses pr\u00e9tentions, offrirait le montant d\u00e9termin\u00e9 par son expert et paierait l'indemnit\u00e9 fix\u00e9e par l'autorit\u00e9 judiciaire.\nA la suite de ce r\u00e8glement, soit le 17 ao\u00fbt 1950, la Cit\u00e9 fit signifier \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9, l'un des propri\u00e9taires concern\u00e9s, un avis d'expropriation l'informant qu'il n'avait droit \u00e0 aucune indemnit\u00e9 pour le terrain et offrant, sans pr\u00e9judice au droit de faire valoir en justice ses pr\u00e9tentions \"et conditionnellement pour le cas seulement o\u00f9 le juge, le tribunal ou la R\u00e9gie des services publics, selon le cas, en viendrait \u00e0 la conclusion qu'il y a lieu de payer une indemnit\u00e9\", de lui payer pour ces am\u00e9liorations les indemnit\u00e9s d\u00e9termin\u00e9es quant \u00e0 chaque rue par l'\u00e9valuateur de la Cit\u00e9 et dont la somme s'\u00e9tablissait \u00e0 $3,579.50. Par lettre en date du 28 ao\u00fbt 1950, les procureurs de l'intim\u00e9 inform\u00e8rent celui de la Cit\u00e9 qu'ils avaient le m\u00eame jour comparu pour l'intim\u00e9 et que ce dernier, pour \u00e9viter une contestation, \u00e9tait dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 recevoir le montant indiqu\u00e9 dans l'avis d'expropriation. D\u00e9faut de contester fut enregistr\u00e9 et, sur motion de l'appelante, l'affaire fut r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 la R\u00e9gie par jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure. Apr\u00e8s enqu\u00eate, audition et prise en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9, le 12 mars 1952, la R\u00e9gie rendit, le 4 f\u00e9vrier 1953, une ordonnance affirmant le droit de l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 pour ses am\u00e9liorations et fixant le montant de cette indemnit\u00e9 \u00e0 celui offert par l'appelante et accept\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9. Le 2 mars 1953, la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, sur motion de l'intim\u00e9, homologuait la sentence de la R\u00e9gie et condamnait l'appelante \u00e0 payer $3,579.50 \u00e0 titre d'indemnit\u00e9 pour les am\u00e9liorations, avec, en plus, les frais d'une action de cette somme en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure.\nLe 16 mars 1953, la Cit\u00e9 appela de ce jugement. La Cour d'Appel2, consid\u00e9rant qu'en droit les dispositions de l'art. 1066k du Code de proc\u00e9dure civile limitent le droit d'appel d'un expropriant au seul cas o\u00f9 l'indemnit\u00e9 accord\u00e9e est d'au moins $1,000 sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 son offre et qu'en fait l'indemnit\u00e9 accord\u00e9e en l'esp\u00e8ce correspondait exactement au montant de l'offre faite par la Cit\u00e9, conclut qu'elle n'avait pas juridiction et rejeta l'appel. D'o\u00f9 le pourvoi devant cette Cour. La disposition sur laquelle s'est appuy\u00e9e la Cour d'Appel pour conclure \u00e0 une absence de juridiction se lit comme suit:\n1066k. Le jugement homologuant la sentence est un jugement final de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure. Il est susceptible d'appel \u00e0 la Cour du Banc de la Reine, quant \u00e0 l'expropri\u00e9, si l'indemnit\u00e9 accord\u00e9e est inf\u00e9rieure d'au moins mille dollars au montant par lui r\u00e9clam\u00e9, et, quant \u00e0 l'expropriant, si l'indemnit\u00e9 accord\u00e9e est d'au moins mille dollars sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 son offre.\nCe texte fut adopt\u00e9 par l'art. de la Loi 1-2 Eliz. II, c., sanctionn\u00e9e le d\u00e9cembre, pour remplacer celui \u00e9dict\u00e9 par l'art. de la Loi 4 Geo. VI, c. 71, santionn\u00e9e le 30 mai 1940, et statuant que:\n1066k. Le jugement homologuant la sentence est un jugement final de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure. Il est susceptible d'appel \u00e0 la Cour du Banc du Roi si le montant en litige est d'au moins cinq cents dollars.\nAinsi appert-il que le droit d'appel en mati\u00e8re d'expropriation tel qu'il existait au moment de l'introduction de la pr\u00e9sente instance, soit en ao\u00fbt 1950, fut modifi\u00e9 et restreint alors que la cause \u00e9tait en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 devant la R\u00e9gie. Et d\u00e8s lors se pr\u00e9sente la question de savoir si la Cour d'Appel devait appliquer la disposition nouvelle restreignant le droit d'appel \u00e9dict\u00e9 par la disposition ancienne, ou cette derni\u00e8re. La jurisprudence sur le point pr\u00e9cise que le droit d'appel est un droit substantif et non une simple mati\u00e8re de proc\u00e9dure et qu'une loi restreignant un droit d'appel pr\u00e9existant est, \u00e0 moins qu'une intention au contraire n'y soit manifest\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on explicite ou n\u00e9cessairement implicite, sans application \u00e0 un jugement rendu dans une instance d\u00e9j\u00e0 introduite devant le tribunal inf\u00e9rieur lors de son adoption. Cette Cour en a ainsi d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans Williams et al. v. Irvine3; Hyde v. Lindsay4. Et s'appuyant, entre autres, sur ces deux d\u00e9cisions, la Cour du Banc du Roi exprima sur le point des vues identiques dans La Cie de chemin de fer Qu\u00e9bec et Lac Saint-Jean v. Valli\u00e8res5. La L\u00e9gislature n'ayant, dans le cas qui nous occupe, manifest\u00e9 dans la loi nouvelle aucune intention d'y donner un effet r\u00e9troactif et l'introduction de l'instance, constitu\u00e9e d'apr\u00e8s l'art. 1066d par la production de l'avis d'expropriation, ayant eu lieu en ao\u00fbt 1950, il en r\u00e9sulte que c'est la loi d'alors, c'est-\u00e0-dire la loi ancienne, qui devait \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e. Dans cette situation, la Cour d'Appel avait donc juridiction\n[Page112]\npuisque ce qui \u00e9tait en litige \u00e9tait le droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 dont la mesure, d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par la Cit\u00e9 et accept\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9, \u00e9tait de $3,579.50.\nCe motif du jugement a quo doit donc \u00eatre \u00e9cart\u00e9.\nEn plus de la question de juridiction, MM. les Juges McDougall et Hyde paraissent avoir consid\u00e9r\u00e9 qu'en raison des termes de l'offre faite dans son avis d'expropriation, la Cit\u00e9 s'est li\u00e9e \u00e0 accepter comme finale la d\u00e9cision de premi\u00e8re instance sur le point de droit donnant lieu au litige et qu'en cons\u00e9quence, il ne lui \u00e9tait pas loisible de soumettre ce point \u00e0 la consid\u00e9ration de la Cour d'Appel. \u00c9tant d'avis qu'il convient de retourner le dossier \u00e0 la Cour d'Appel, rien n'est dit sur ce point aussi bien que sur le pouvoir de la Cit\u00e9 ou l'autorit\u00e9 de son procureur de prendre une telle position dans l'avis d'expropriation. Ces questions, comme toutes autres pertinentes \u00e0 la consid\u00e9ration de l'appel, restent ouvertes.\nJe maintiendrais l'appel et retournerais le dossier \u00e0 la Cour d'Appel pour audition et adjudication en l'affaire; il n'y aura pas de frais devant cette Cour et la question des frais sur le premier appel \u00e0 la Cour du Banc de la Reine sera d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par cette derni\u00e8re Cour lors du jugement \u00e0 \u00eatre rendu par elle sur la pr\u00e9sente r\u00e9f\u00e9rence.\nAppeal allowed without costs.\nAttorney for the plaintiff, appellant: E.

Marquis and Lussier, [1958] S.C.R. 20\nDate: 1957-11-18\nDame Gabrielle Robert (Petitioner) Appellant;\nand\nGerald Marquis (Plaintiff) Respondent;\nand\nAntonio Lussier Mis-en-cause.\n1957: March 21; 1957: November 18.\nPresent: Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Cartwright, Fauteux and Abbott JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nParties\u2014Death of party\u2014Appeal taken in name of deceased party\u2014Whether absolute or relative nullity\u2014Whether petition in continuance of suit receivable\u2014Code of Civil Procedure, arts. \u00ce66, 270, 1193, 1209, 1226, 1237.\nThe taking of an appeal in the name of a deceased person is not an absolute nullity but only a relative one which can be remedied by amendment. Price v. Fraser (1901), 31 S.C.R. 505, applied.\nThe appellant's husband was sued in damages and the action was contested on his behalf and in his name by the attorney for the insurance company by which he was insured. He died after the trial but before judgment condemning him was delivered. Neither the insurance company nor the attorney knew that he was dead, and, on the instructions of the insurance company, the attorney filed an appeal in the name of the deceased. After the delays for appeal had expired, the appellant (the widow and universal legatee of the deceased) filed a petition in continuance of suit. The plaintiff contested the petition and also moved to quash the appeal. The Court of Appeal granted the motion to quash and dismissed the petition in continuance. Appeals were taken from these two judgments. Held (Taschereau and Fauteux JJ. dissenting): The appeals should be allowed and the case should be remitted to the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, for decision upon the merits.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Cartwright and Abbott JJ.: The decision in Price v. Fraser, supra, was not distinguishable and, in such a case as this, this Court was bound by its own previous decision.\nPer Cartwright and Abbott JJ.: The principle laid down by this Court in Price v. Fraser, supra, was applicable to the issue in the present case. There was no difference in principle between the two cases. In both of them the appeal was taken in the name of a deceased litigant in error, which is defined as \"something incorrectly done through ignorance or inadvertence\". The taking of such an appeal being a relative nullity only, the reason for which it was taken erroneously in the name of the deceased person could not make the nullity an absolute one, incapable of being remedied by amendment. The proceeding should have been designated as a motion to amend the inscription in appeal, but as this was a matter of form and not of substance, the Court below was entitled proprio motu to deal with it as such a motion.\nPer Taschereau J., dissenting: There is no need for continuance of suit when a cause is ready for judgment, but, pursuant to art. 270 C.C.P., a suit can be continued by the heirs or representatives of a deceased person who was originally a party to it. The appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench is a new instance, and there can, therefore, be no continuance if it has been brought in the name of a person who was already dead. Article 1209 C.C.P. implies necessarily that an appeal cannot be brought in the name of a deceased person. The French authors are unanimous in their opinion that the purpose of a continuance of suit is to replace the deceased party and to continue proceedings already started; that the deceased party must have been engaged in an instance; that there has been an interruption in the proceedings, and that every summons in the name of a deceased person is null. It is a question of absolute nullity, of something non-existent, and therefore the factors of discretion or of prejudice cannot be taken into account.\nPrice v. Fraser, supra, was distinguishable on the facts and the proceedings. There, the majority judgment did not decide that a deceased person could start an instance, but merely that an error, made by inadvertence, in the name of the party, could be remedied by amendment. Nothing could justify extending the scope of that decision so as to make it say that an instance which in law has never existed could be continued.\nPer Fauteux J., dissenting: The present case was clearly distinguishable as to the facts, the proceedings and the question of law from Price v. Fraser, supra, as well as from the cases therein cited. What this Court decided in the Price case was (1) that the Court of Revision could, by amendment, correct an inscription made by inadvertence in the name of a deceased person whereas it was intended to have been made, according to the mandate received, in the name of the testamentary executors, and (2) that there had been no abuse of discretion and no prejudice. The ratio decidendi of point (1) consisted merely in the approval, expressed with some hesitation, of a jurisprudence, the application of which was, however, specifically limited to cases similar to the ones that gave rise to that jurisprudence. The declaration at p. 513 of the Price case, that an inscription in review may validly be taken in the name of a dead person, was a mere obiter dictum, since it went beyond what was necessary to the decision in that case. Charles R. Davidson & Co. v. M'Robb or Officer, [1918] A.C. 304 at 322; Quinn v. Leathem, [1901] A.C. 495 at 506, applied.\nAn appeal being a new instance, it was metaphysically impossible for a deceased person to satisfy the provisions of public order governing the right ester en justice, and the inobservance of those provisions imported nullity. If ignorance of the minority of a party to an instance did not modify the absolute character of the nullity resulting therefrom, ignorance of the death of an appellant should not have a different result. Levine v. Serling, [19143] A.C. 659; referred to. What was sought here was much more than the correction of an error, caused by mere inadvertence, in the inscription in appeal, since the vice in the proceedings here resulted from ignorance of the fact of the defendant's death.\nAPPEALS from the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, dismissing a petition in continuance of suit. Appeals allowed, Taschereau and Fauteux JJ. dissenting.\nA. Laurendeau, Q.C., for the petitioner, appellant.\nAndr\u00e9 Nadeau, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014By an order of this Court leave was granted Dame Gabrielle Robert to appeal from two judgments of the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side) of the Province of Quebec2, pronounced September 20, 1956. One of these judgments dismissed with costs an appeal to that Court of the deceased, Leopold Patenaude; the other dismissed with costs a petition en reprise d'instance of the present appellant, the widow and universal legatee of Patenaude.\nThe point is determined so far as this Court is concerned by its decision in Price v. Fraser3, where it was held that the taking of an appeal in the name of a deceased person is not an absolute nullity but is a relative one which can be remedied by amendment. That decision is not distinguishable and, in such a case as this, the Court is bound by its own previous decision. This has never been doubted. It was so held in The Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada v. Miller4. There Chief Justice Taschereau at p. 59 states: \"We were bound, I need hardly say, by that decision.\", referring to The Queen v. Grenier5. At p. 63 Girouard J. and at p. 66 Davies J. and at p. 70 Killam J. made statements to the same effect. The fact that the judgment of this Court in the Miller case was reversed by the Judicial Committee6, has no relevancy to the matter under discussion.\nIn Daoust, Lalonde & Cie. Lt\u00e9e. v. Ferland7, Chief Justice Anglin states:\nAlthough impressed by the views of Mr. Justice Howard in the Court of King's Bench, I find it impossible to follow him to his conclusions. To give effect to them here, I think, would be to exhibit a vacillation in the opinion expressed by this court on the subject of the scope and application of Art. 1301 C.C., which could not fail to be disastrous. We might as well at once forego any idea that the doctrine of stare decisis (Stuart v. Bank of Montreal (1909) 41 Can. S.C.R. 516) forms part of our jurisprudence.\nIn the reasons for judgment of Duff and Rinfret JJ., delivered by the former, it is pointed out that \"It is settled by several decisions of this court that the ambit of article 1301 is not restricted to personal obligations\". In La Corporation du Village de la Malbaie v. Boulianne8, Chief Justice Anglin in a dissenting judgment had this to say:\nWhile I fully recognize the force of the contention of the respondents that the jurisprudence of Quebec has ben very largely to the contrary of the view above expressed, and the value and significance of the judgments of the Privy Council in such cases as Webb v. Outrim [1907] A.C. 81, (and am fully prepared to stand by what I said in Gagnon v. Lemay (1918) 56 Can. S.C.R. 365, at 374 as to the wisdom and importance of this branch of the doctrine of stare decisis), we must also be careful never to forget that we are not bound by the decisions of provincial courts and that it is our business to correct the errors of those courts when it is clear to us that such errors have, in fact, existed (Bourne v. Keane [1919] A.C. 815, at 859-860).\nThe appeals should therefore be allowed with costs here and in the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side) and the case remitted to that Court so that the appeal to it may be adjudicated upon the merits.\nTaschereau J. (dissenting):\u2014Le 2 mai 1956, par jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, rendu dans le district de Bedford, L\u00e9opold Patenaude et Antonio Lussier ont \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9s conjointement et solidairement, \u00e0 payer \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 G\u00e9rald Marquis la somme de $8,217.18 comme r\u00e9sultat d'un accident d'automobile. L'un des d\u00e9fendeurs, L\u00e9opold\n[Page24]\nPatenaude, \u00e9tait d\u00e9tenteur d'une police d'assurance \u00e9mise par la Canadian Mercantile Assurance Company, contre la responsabilit\u00e9 publique.\nApr\u00e8s que le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure fut rendu, MM. Phaneuf, Turgeon et No\u00ebl qui agissaient comme procureurs pour la Compagnie d'Assurance et, par cons\u00e9quent, indirectement pour L\u00e9opold Patenaude, re\u00e7urent instructions de leur cliente la compagnie d'assurance de porter la cause en appel quant \u00e0 Patenaude et, en cons\u00e9quence, le 30 mai 1956, c'est-\u00e0-dire dans le d\u00e9lai pr\u00e9vu par le Code de proc\u00e9dure civile, une inscription en appel fut log\u00e9e au greffe de la Cour du Banc de la Reine \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. L'autre d\u00e9fendeur Antonio Lussier a aussi port\u00e9 sa cause en appel, mais ce dernier appel est \u00e9tranger au pr\u00e9sent litige.\nQuand les procureurs de la compagnie d'assurance ont produit et signifi\u00e9 leur inscription en appel au nom de L\u00e9opold Patenaude, ce dernier \u00e9tait d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 depuis le 8 avril pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent, ce que la compagnie d'assurance ignorait. Ce n'est que le 4 juin 1956, apr\u00e8s que les d\u00e9lais l\u00e9gaux pour inscrire en appel furent expir\u00e9s, que Mtre Phaneuf, qui avait re\u00e7u instructions de porter la cause en appel, a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de Patenaude.\nAu moment de son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, Patenaude \u00e9tait mari\u00e9 \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente appelante, Dame Gabrielle Robert, et cette derni\u00e8re \u00e9tait la l\u00e9gataire universelle de la succession du d\u00e9funt. Le 3 juillet de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e, l'appelante produisit devant la Cour du Banc de la Reine une demande en reprise d'instance, en vertu des dispositions des arts. 266 et 1237 du Code de proc\u00e9dure civile, et demanda dans ses conclusions de continuer l'instance devant la Cour du Banc de la Reine vu le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son \u00e9poux. Cette requ\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 combattue par l'intim\u00e9 Marquis pour le motif que l'inscription en appel au nom de Patenaude \u00e9tait invalide. A peu pr\u00e8s \u00e0 la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode, Marquis a produit devant la Cour du Banc de la Reine une motion pour faire rejeter l'appel pour la m\u00eame raison. La Cour du Banc de la Reine a rendu jugement et a rejet\u00e9 l'appel pour la raison suivante9:\nConsid\u00e9rant qu'aucune instance n'a j'aimais commenc\u00e9 ni s'est jamais form\u00e9e devant cette Court au motif que l'inscription faite au nom de l'appelant d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 d\u00e8s avant le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure \u00e9tait radicalement nulle.\n[Page25]\nElle a aussi rejet\u00e9 la requ\u00eate en reprise d'instance pour le motif suivant :\nConsid\u00e9rant que les h\u00e9ritiers de cet appelant inexistant ne peuvent continuer ou reprendre une instance qui n'a jamais pris naissance et qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise \u00e0 n\u00e9ant par l'arr\u00eat pr\u00e9cit\u00e9 de cette Cour.\nUne permission sp\u00e9ciale a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e d'appeler de ces deux jugements de la Cour du Banc de la Reine.\nLa preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que Patenaude en effet est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 le 8 avril 1956, lorsque la cause \u00e9tait en \u00e9tat devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, et que le juge au proc\u00e8s a rendu son jugement le 2 mai de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e. Il appert aussi au dossier que l'inscription en appel au nom de Patenaude a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite le 30 mai 1956, soit dans les d\u00e9lais pr\u00e9vus au Code de proc\u00e9dure civile, mais \u00e0 cette date, il y avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 pr\u00e8s de deux mois que Patenaude \u00e9tait d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9. Il n'est pas contest\u00e9 que Patenaude \u00e9tait porteur d'une police d'assurance \u00e9mise par la Canadian Mercantile Assurance Company qui, en fait, le repr\u00e9sentait dans cette cause, et qui elle-m\u00eame avait donn\u00e9 des instructions \u00e0 ses avocats, et qu'\u00e0 cette date du 30 mai, la compagnie d'assurance, pas plus que Mtre Phaneuf, n'\u00e9tait au courant du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de Patenaude. Les avocats de l'intim\u00e9 Marquis savaient que Patenaude \u00e9tait d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9. A part les deux jugements formels rendus par la Cour du Banc de la Reine, les juges de cette Cour n'ont produit aucune raison \u00e9crite au dossier.\nEn vertu des dispositions du Code de proc\u00e9dure de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, il n'y a pas lieu \u00e0 reprise d'instance lorsque la cause est en \u00e9tat, c'est-\u00e0-dire lorsque l'instruction est termin\u00e9e et que la cause a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 (arts. 266 et seq. C.P.C.). Cependant, l'instance peut \u00eatre reprise en vertu des dispositions de l'art. 270 C.P.C. par les h\u00e9ritiers ou ayants cause de la partie d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e. Il faut donc que la personne d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e ait \u00e9t\u00e9 partie \u00e0 l'instance originairement pour que cette derni\u00e8re puisse \u00eatre reprise dans le cas de d\u00e9c\u00e8s. Or l'on sait, et c'est une jurisprudence constante, que l'appel log\u00e9 devant la Cour du Banc de la Reine constitue une nouvelle instance. Ce n'est pas un simple acte de proc\u00e9dure dans une instance pendante, et pour cette raison, les repr\u00e9sentants d'un d\u00e9funt n'ont pas \u00e0 reprendre l'instance pour initier un appel. Une inscription en appel est l'\u00e9quivalent d'une nouvelle action. M\u00eame sans la formalit\u00e9 d'une substitution de procureurs, un procureur autre que celui qui occupait en premi\u00e8re instance peut instituer un appel.\nSuivant les dispositions de l'art. 1209, l'appel doit \u00eatre interjet\u00e9 dans les trente jours du jugement, et ce d\u00e9lai, nous dit l'article, est de rigueur, m\u00eame contre les mineurs, les femmes sous puissance de mari, les insens\u00e9s ou interdits, et les personnes absentes de la Province, lorsque ceux qui les repr\u00e9sentent ou doivent les assister, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment mis en cause. De plus, si la partie d\u00e9c\u00e8de avant d'appeler, le d\u00e9lai ne court contre ses h\u00e9ritiers ou repr\u00e9sentants l\u00e9gaux que du jour de son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, ce qui implique n\u00e9cessairement l'id\u00e9e que l'appel ne peut \u00eatre log\u00e9 au nom du d\u00e9funt. Sur cette question, la jurisprudence de la province de Qu\u00e9bec n'est pas tr\u00e8s riche. Le plus ancien jugement est celui de Kerby v. Ross10 en date de 1874. Le sommaire se lit ainsi:\nThat an appeal instituted in the name of a party who has died while the case was en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 in the Court below is null and void.\nThat a petition by the alleged legal representative of such deceased party, to take up the instance, cannot be allowed.\nDans cette cause, M. le Juge Loranger parlant pour les juges Ramsay et Sanborn, dit ce qui suit:\nThe principle of law is that no judicial or extra judicial proceeding can be conducted in the name of a person who is dead.\nEt plus loin:\nNow it is admitted by the learned president of the Court that an appeal is an instance nouvelle. That being the case, it is plain that this new proceeding cannot be taken out in the name of one who is dead.\nDans un autre jugement rendu la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e, soit en septembre 1874, Haggarty v. Morris and Haggarty et al.11, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 ce qui suit:\nThat after the instance has been taken up in the place of a dead appellant, it is not competent to the respondent to move to quash the writ of appeal, on the ground that it issued in the name of a person who was dead previously to the issue of the writ.\nApparemment dans cette cause, o\u00f9 le banc \u00e9tait compos\u00e9 de trois des juges qui avaient si\u00e9g\u00e9 dans la cause ci-dessus cit\u00e9e, la Cour en est venue \u00e0 la conclusion que parce qu'une requ\u00eate en reprise d'instance avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite et maintenue avant la motion pour rejet d'appel, il y avait eu acquiescement. Ce jugement \u00e9videmment ne peut nous aider dans la d\u00e9termination de la pr\u00e9sente cause, et il ne peut \u00eatre oppos\u00e9 au jugement rendu dans Kerby v. Ross. C'est d'ailleurs la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle en est venue la Cour du Banc de la Reine dans la cause de Fraser v. Price12, o\u00f9 Sir Alexandre Lacoste dit ce qui suit, en r\u00e9f\u00e9rant sans doute \u00e0 la cause de Haggarty v. Morris:\nNous ne croyons pas pouvoir faire autrement que d'appliquer la r\u00e8gle qui para\u00eet \u00eatre pour ainsi dire universellement admise en France o\u00f9 le droit est semblable au n\u00f4tre. Nous avons bien dans notre jurisprudence un pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent de notre cour qui a refus\u00e9 le rejet de l'appel apr\u00e8s une reprise d'instance par les repr\u00e9sentants l\u00e9gaux, mais c'\u00e9tait parce qu'il y avait eu acquiescement. La demande de rejet avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite apr\u00e8s une reprise d'instance accept\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e.\nCependant, le jugement de la Cour d'Appel dans cette cause de Price v. Fraser a \u00e9t\u00e9 infirm\u00e9 par cette Cour13. Sir Henry Strong, Juge en chef, et le Juge Elz\u00e9ar Taschereau \u00e9taient dissidents. Dans cette cause, il ne s'agissait pas d'une reprise d'instance, mais bien d'un amendement, et j'en discuterai ult\u00e9rieurement les divers aspects.\nLes auteurs fran\u00e7ais sont unanimes dans l'opinion que le but de la reprise d'instance est de remplacer la partie d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e et de continuer les proc\u00e9dures d\u00e9j\u00e0 commenc\u00e9es.\nComme le dit Bioche, Dictionnaire de Proc\u00e9dure, vol. 5, 5e \u00e9d. 1867, \u00e0 la page 805:\nLa reprise d'instance est l'acte par lequel l'ayant cause d'une partie reprend volontairement ou est forc\u00e9 de reprendre l'instance dans laquelle cette partie est engag\u00e9e; \u2026\nEmployant \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s les m\u00eames termes, Carr\u00e9 et Chauveau, Proc\u00e9dure Civile et Commerciale, vol. 3, 5e \u00e9d. 1880, \u00e0 la page 220 disent:\nOn peut d\u00e9finir la reprise d'instance l'acte par lequel ceux qui succ\u00e8dent aux droits et obligations d'une partie, ou qui ont, \u00e0 tout autre titre, droit et qualit\u00e9 pour la repr\u00e9senter, reprennent volontairement, ou sont forc\u00e9s de reprendre l'instance dans laquelle cette partie \u00e9tait engag\u00e9e.\nPour qu'une instance soit reprise, il faut qu'elle soit interrompue, il faut qu'il y ait un lien qui ait \u00e9t\u00e9 rompu. Ceci suppose donc qu'il faut que l'instance ait \u00e9t\u00e9 commenc\u00e9e, Glasson et Tissier \"Pr\u00e9cis de Proc\u00e9dure Civile\" vol. 2, 3e \u00e9d. 1926, page 580. Jur. Cl. Proc. Civ., arts. 342 et 343, nos 10 et 11, rapporte ce qui suit:\nPour qu'il y ait lieu \u00e0 reprise d'instance, il faut qu'il y ait une instance en cours; par suite, il n'en saurait \u00eatre question si, au moment o\u00f9 se produit l'\u00e9v\u00e9nement susceptible de produire l'interruption, l'instance n'est pas encore engag\u00e9e, ou si elle a pris fin.\nEt aussi:\nAinsi, si la partie \u00e9tait d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e au jour de l'assignation introductive d'instance, l'assignation \u00e9tait nulle et il n'y a pas lieu \u00e0 reprise d'instance; \u2026\nOn voit donc qu'il faut de toute n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 qu'une partie ait \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9e dans une instance pour que celle-ci puisse \u00eatre reprise, qu'il faut une interruption dans une proc\u00e9dure d\u00e9j\u00e0 commenc\u00e9e, et que toute assignation faite au nom d'une personne d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e est nulle.\nL'argument que cette permission de reprendre l'instance ne constitue pas un abus de discr\u00e9tion si personne ne subit de pr\u00e9judice, est \u00e0 mon sens sans valeur. Il s'agit d'une nullit\u00e9 absolue, de quelque chose d'inexistant, et dans ce cas, ni la discr\u00e9tion ni le pr\u00e9judice ne sont des facteurs dont les tribunaux sont justifi\u00e9s de tenir compte. Si comme c'est le cas, les parties ne peuvent pas consentir \u00e0 prolonger les d\u00e9lais de 30 jours pour inscrire un appel, \u00e0 plus forte raison est-il interdit de consentir \u00e0 ce qu'un d\u00e9funt forme une demande en justice, m\u00eame s'il y a ratification. L'incapacit\u00e9 vient du tribunal.\nDans la cause de Price v. Fraser14, que j'ai mentionn\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, il s'agissait d'une action pour revendiquer certains terrains, et aussi en r\u00e9clamation de dommages. L'action fut maintenue en partie par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, et les d\u00e9fendeurs log\u00e8rent un appel devant la Cour de Revision. M. Price, le d\u00e9fendeur, \u00e9tait cependant d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 durant le d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, mais l'appel fut log\u00e9 en son nom, et non pas au nom des ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires. La cause fut plac\u00e9e sur le r\u00f4le de la Cour de Revision deux mois plus tard; les intim\u00e9s pr\u00e9sent\u00e8rent une motion pour rejet d'inscription, et cette motion fut suivie, le lendemain, d'une autre motion, pour amender afin de substituer comme appelants, les noms des ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires \u00e0 celui de M. Price.\nLes deux motions furent entendues en m\u00eame temps par la Cour de Revision, et la motion pour amender fut accord\u00e9e sans frais, et la motion pour rejet d'inscription en revision fut accord\u00e9e pour les frais seulement. Subs\u00e9quemment, la Cour de Revision entendit la cause au m\u00e9rite et rejeta l'action. Il y eut un appel de log\u00e9 des trois jugements devant la Cour du Banc de la Reine, qui d\u00e9cida que la Cour de Revision n'avait pas juridiction pour amender l'inscription en revision, et que tous les jugements de cette derni\u00e8re Cour \u00e9taient invalides. La Cour Supr\u00eame maintint l'appel et remit le dossier \u00e0 la Cour du Banc de la Reine, afin qu'elle puisse adjuger sur le m\u00e9rite.\nJe crois que cette d\u00e9cision de la Cour Supr\u00eame, sur laquelle se sont particuli\u00e8rement bas\u00e9s les procureurs de l'appelant, peut \u00eatre distingu\u00e9e de la pr\u00e9sente cause. Il s'agissait en effet d'une motion pour amender, et comme le signale M. le Juge Girouard dans le jugment de la majorit\u00e9, en vertu du nouveau Code de proc\u00e9dure, le pouvoir d'une cour pour accorder un amendement a \u00e9t\u00e9 substantiellement \u00e9largi; c'est d'ailleurs ce qu'indiquent les arts. 513 et 523. M. le Juge Girouard continue en disant que ces articles sont conformes au principe que les codificateurs expliquent dans leur rapport, et que seul l'art. 522 du Code de proc\u00e9dure signale une exception au pouvoir d'amender, c'est-\u00e0-dire que la nature de l'action ne doit pas \u00eatre chang\u00e9e. Il continue \u00e0 dire que personne n'a subi de pr\u00e9judice, que les adversaires n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pris par surprise, que des affidavits ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produits \u00e0 l'effet que l'avocat des appelants, c'est-\u00e0-dire des ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires de Price, savait que M. Price \u00e9tait d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9, qu'il avait re\u00e7u instructions d'inscrire au nom des ex\u00e9cuteurs, qu'il avait re\u00e7u l'argent pour faire le d\u00e9p\u00f4t n\u00e9cessaire, et que c'est par inadvertance seulement de sa part, que l'inscription n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faite telle qu'elle aurait d\u00fb l'\u00eatre. L'avocat avait v\u00e9ritablement mandat et l'intention d'inscrire au nom des ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires, mais \u00e0 cause de sa propre erreur, ce n'est malheureusement pas ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait.\nDans le cas qui nous occupe, la situation est enti\u00e8rement diff\u00e9rente. Il ne s'agit pas d'un amendement, mais bien d'une reprise d'instance, et les textes du Code de proc\u00e9dure civile sont enti\u00e8rement diff\u00e9rents, car l'on sait qu'en vertu de l'art. 270 que j'ai signal\u00e9 d\u00e9j\u00e0, l'instance ne peut \u00eatre reprise que par les h\u00e9ritiers ou ayants cause de la partie d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e. Pour reprendre cette nouvelle instance en Cour d'Appel, il eut fallu que Patenaude, avant son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, f\u00fbt partie devant la Cour du Banc de la Reine, et qu'il f\u00fbt d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 apr\u00e8s l'inscription en appel, log\u00e9e par lui-m\u00eame.\nIl ne s'agit nullement d'un cas d'inadvertance ou d'erreur, comme dans la cause de Price v. Fraser. Dans cette derni\u00e8re, l'avocat savait que Price \u00e9tait d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9, avait l'intention d'inscrire au nom des ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires, et ce n'est que par une erreur cl\u00e9ricale que cela n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait. Dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, M. Phaneuf ignorait la mort de son client et avait donc, en cons\u00e9quence, l'id\u00e9e d'inscrire au nom du d\u00e9funt. Il n'y a aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment d'inadvertance ni d'erreur.\nLa question de savoir si l'avocat du d\u00e9funt \u00e9tait au courant de la mort de son client ou ne l'\u00e9tait pas, est d'une supr\u00eame importance. S'il le savait, comme dans la cause de Price v. Fraser, l'avocat a re\u00e7u \u00e9videmment instructions d'appeler de la part des ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires. D'un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, s'il l'ignorait, le d\u00e9funt ne peut pas lui avoir donn\u00e9 de pareilles instructions, \u00e9videmment encore moins les ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires, qu'il ne devait pas conna\u00eetre. Or, comme le dit le Juge Elz\u00e9ar Taschereau, dissident dans cette cause de Price v. Fraser, \"il ne peut y avoir de mandat d'outre tombe, de mandataire sans mandat\".\nOn voit donc que dans Price v. Fraser la majorit\u00e9 de cette Cour n'a pas d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'un d\u00e9funt peut commencer une instance, mais elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que quand, par inadvertance, il y avait erreur de nom, l'amendement \u00e9tait permis. Elle n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 au del\u00e0 de cela, et rien ne me justifie d'\u00e9tendre la port\u00e9e de ce jugement, et de lui faire dire qu'on peut reprendre une instance qui en droit n'a jamais exist\u00e9. Je suis clairement d'opinion qu'un tel principe est contraire et r\u00e9pugne \u00e0 l'\u00e9conomie de la proc\u00e9dure, \u00e0 la jurisprudence \u00e9tablie et \u00e0 l'enseignement des auteurs.\nPour toutes ces raisons, je suis d'avis de rejeter ces deux appels avec d\u00e9pens.\nCartwright J.:\u2014I agree with the reasons of the Chief Justice and those of my brother Abbott and would accordingly dispose of these appeals as proposed by the Chief Justice. Fauteux J. (dissenting):\u2014Les faits et proc\u00e9dures donnant lieu \u00e0 la question de droit soulev\u00e9e en cet appel, log\u00e9 \u00e0 l'encontre d'un jugement unanime de la Cour du Banc de la Reine15, sont relat\u00e9s en d\u00e9tail aux raisons de jugement de mon coll\u00e8gue M. le Juge Taschereau.\nComme ce dernier, et en toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour ceux qui entretiennent l'opinion contraire, je ne crois pas que ce point de droit soit, comme l'a soumis le savant procureur de l'appelant, d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9termin\u00e9, en tant que la Cour Supr\u00eame est concern\u00e9e, par la d\u00e9cision majoritaire de cette Cour dans Price v. Fraser16.\nDiff\u00e9rant la consid\u00e9ration des cons\u00e9quences juridiques en r\u00e9sultant, on notera imm\u00e9diatement que les faits et proc\u00e9dures dans Price v. Fraser, ainsi que l'observent MM. les Juges Taschereau et Abbott dans leurs raisons de jugement, sont manifestement distincts de ceux qui se pr\u00e9sentent dans la cause actuelle. Dans Price v. Fraser, cette Cour\u2014le Juge en chef Sir Henry Strong et le Juge Sir Elz\u00e9ar Taschereau \u00e9tant dissidents\u2014affirma, contrairement aux vues exprim\u00e9es en Cour d'Appel par la majorit\u00e9, mais d'accord avec l'opinion minoritaire de M. le Juge Boss\u00e9, le bien-fond\u00e9 d'un jugement de la Cour de Revision autorisant par voie d'amendement, la correction de l'inscription en appel. Cette inscription, par suite d'une inadvertance r\u00e9sultant d'un concours de circonstances, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 log\u00e9e, par les procureurs agissant comme agents des procureurs r\u00e9guliers des ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires de Price, au nom du d\u00e9funt, au lieu de l'\u00eatre au nom de ces derniers, tel que voulu par eux et leurs procureurs r\u00e9guliers. Dans l'esp\u00e8ce, on ne cherche pas \u00e0 corriger le fait d'une inadvertance et il ne s'agit pas non plus d'un amendement. En fait, aucune inadvertance n'existe puisque les procureurs, comme les assureurs de Patenaude d'ailleurs, ignorant le fait du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de ce dernier, au moment o\u00f9 l'appel \u00e9tait log\u00e9, l'ont d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment inscrit en son nom. Et c'est la nullit\u00e9\u2014absolue ou relative\u2014, il en est discut\u00e9 plus loin\u2014de cette inscription faite au nom d'un d\u00e9funt qu'on a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 corriger, et ce par voie de reprise d'instance, le tout au moment o\u00f9 le d\u00e9lai, pour l\u00e9galement constituer cette instance en appel, \u00e9tait expir\u00e9 et o\u00f9 la nullit\u00e9 de l'inscription \u00e9tait invoqu\u00e9e. Notons de plus que les faits ou les proc\u00e9dures de cette cause sont \u00e9galement distincts de ceux qui furent consid\u00e9r\u00e9s dans les trois d\u00e9cisions de la Cour d'Appel de Qu\u00e9bec cit\u00e9es, en premier lieu, par M. le Juge Girouard au jugement majoritaire de cette Cour dans Price v. Fraser.\nDans la premi\u00e8re de ces d\u00e9cisions, celle de Haggerty v. Morris and Haggerty et al.17, il s'agissait bien d'une motion pour faire casser une inscription en appel log\u00e9e au nom d'un d\u00e9funt, mais ceci dans des circonstances que nous ignorons totalement et dont la similarit\u00e9 \u00e0 celles de la pr\u00e9sente cause plut\u00f4t qu'\u00e0 celles de Price v. Fraser ne peut aucunement \u00eatre affirm\u00e9e. En droit, cette motion fut rejet\u00e9e, parce que des proc\u00e9dures en reprise d'instance avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 prises et admises avant que ne fut faite cette motion. La Cour d'Appel consid\u00e9ra que le d\u00e9faut affectant l'inscription avait \u00e9t\u00e9 couvert par ces proc\u00e9dures et qu'il n'\u00e9tait plus loisible de s'en pr\u00e9valoir. Ainsi que le signale Sir Elz\u00e9ar Taschereau dans Price v. Fraser, \u00e0 la page 508, cette d\u00e9cision de Haggerty n'indique pas si ces proc\u00e9dures en reprise d'instance avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9es ou non. Enfin, et comme l'affirm\u00e8rent, en Cour d'Appel, les procureurs des appelants dans Fraser v. Price18, les requ\u00e9rants dans la cause de Haggerty \"n'apparaissent pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 hors des d\u00e9lais de l'appel pour reprendre l'instance\" et, ont-ils ajout\u00e9, \"nous devons supposer qu'ils ont fait leurs proc\u00e9dures en temps utile\". Si telle \u00e9tait la situation, et rien ne permet d'en douter, cet acquiescement, retenu comme ratio decidendi de la d\u00e9cision dans Haggerty, avait comme objet la proc\u00e9dure faite pour l'exercice d'un droit d'appel non p\u00e9rim\u00e9, et non comme objet le droit d'appel lui-m\u00eame lequel, \u00e9tant de rigueur et attributif de juridiction, ne peut, apr\u00e8s extinction, revivre par l'accord des parties.\nLes deux autres d\u00e9cisions cit\u00e9es par M. le Juge Girouard dans Price v. Fraser, supra, soit Cl\u00e9ment v. Francis19 et Laforce v. La Ville de Sorel20, peuvent \u00eatre examin\u00e9es simultan\u00e9ment en raison de la similitude du point d\u00e9cid\u00e9 lequel, \u00e0 mon avis, n'a aucune analogie avec celui soulev\u00e9 dans l'instance qui nous occupe. Dans la premi\u00e8re, il s'agissait d'une motion pour rejeter l'appel log\u00e9 par un curateur \u00e0 un interdit sans avoir obtenu pr\u00e9alablement, et conform\u00e9ment aux exigences des arts. 306 et 343 C.C., l'autorisation du juge ou du protonotaire sur l'avis du conseil de famille. On d\u00e9cida que ce d\u00e9faut pouvait \u00eatre corrig\u00e9 par l'obtention subs\u00e9quente de cette autorisation. Dans la seconde, la motion pour rejet d'appel reposait sur l'absence d'autorisation pr\u00e9alable du tuteur pour loger l'appel, ainsi que l'exigeaient les dispositions de l'art. 306 C.C. Se basant sur le pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent de Cl\u00e9ment v. Francis, supra, on adopta la m\u00eame conclusion et les proc\u00e9dures en appel furent suspendues pour permettre l'obtention et la production de cette autorisation. Dans les deux cas, on consid\u00e9ra \u00e9videmment que l'inscription n'\u00e9tait pas de nullit\u00e9 absolue ab initio. Dans ces deux d\u00e9cisions, cependant, il ne s'agissait pas d'un appel log\u00e9, par inadvertance, au nom d'une personne d\u00e9pourvue de toute entit\u00e9 juridique, de toute existence, d'un d\u00e9funt, mais bien d'un tuteur et d'un curateur dont le droit d'appel \u00e9tait conditionn\u00e9 par l'observance de certaines formalit\u00e9s. Ajoutons que le bien-fond\u00e9 de ces d\u00e9cisions de la Cour d'Appel dans Cl\u00e9ment v. Francis, supra, et Laforce v. La Ville de Sorel, supra, est demeur\u00e9, aux vues de cette m\u00eame Cour, l'objet d'un doute s\u00e9rieux. On en trouve l'expression dans l'opinion de M. le Juge Rivard dans Morin \u00e8s-qualit\u00e9 v. Labrecque21. Dans Hamer v. Chevalier22, on a suivi ces deux d\u00e9cisions en s'appuyant d'abord sur la long\u00e9vit\u00e9 de cette jurisprudence et surtout parce qu'on consid\u00e9ra que les dispositions de l'art. 306 C.C, requ\u00e9rant l'autorisation, avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9es dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat et pour la protection du mineur et non dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat des tiers, et que la nullit\u00e9 r\u00e9sultant du d\u00e9faut de l'obtenir pr\u00e9alablement \u00e0 l'inscription en appel \u00e9tait relative et non absolue.\nLa pr\u00e9sente cause se distingue donc clairement, quant aux faits et proc\u00e9dures aussi bien qu'au point de droit en r\u00e9sultant, d'avec celle de Price v. Fraser et de ces trois causes cit\u00e9es, en premier lieu, aux raisons de cette d\u00e9cision majoritaire.\nL'examen des quatre autres causes cit\u00e9es, mais non comment\u00e9es, aux raisons de M. le Juge Girouard, \u00e0 la page 513, sugg\u00e8re les observations suivantes. Dans Le Cur\u00e9 et les Marguilliers de l'\u0152uvre et Fabrique de Sainte-Anne de Varennes v. Choquet23, il s'agissait \u00e9galement d'un d\u00e9faut d'autorisation pour appeler. Dans Sawyer v. The County of Missisquoi24, on d\u00e9cida que, sur un appel \u00e0 la Cour de Circuit d'une d\u00e9cision d'un conseil de comt\u00e9, o\u00f9 les parties avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9es en cause par ordre de la Cour, ces derni\u00e8res ne pouvaient obtenir le rejet de l'appel sur le motif que copie de l'assignation ne leur avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9e, tel que requis par l'art. 1067 du Code Municipal. Dans Varin v. Gu\u00e9rin25, on jugea que le repr\u00e9sentant de la partie d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e peut s'inscrire en revision sans au pr\u00e9alable reprendre l'instance. La Cour \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sid\u00e9e par MM. les Juges Jett\u00e9, Davidson et Pagnuelo. Il convient de retenir le consid\u00e9rant suivant pris \u00e0 la page 33:\nConsid\u00e9rant que la qualit\u00e9 de la dite Dame Elmire Varin se trouve de fait admise, que l'appel ou la revision est une instance nouvelle qui se prend au nom des repr\u00e9sentants de la partie d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e, qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire d'une reprise d'instance de sa part pour porter la cause en revision et que sa proc\u00e9dure est r\u00e9guli\u00e8re et valable.\nEnfin, dans Barrette v. Lallier26, on jugea que la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure si\u00e9geant en revision n'\u00e9tait pas une Cour d'Appel dans le sens de l'art. 306 C.C. et qu'en cons\u00e9quence, le tuteur n'\u00e9tait pas tenu d'obtenir l'autorisation y mentionn\u00e9e pour inscrire en revision.\nEn toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, je dois dire qu'\u00e0 mon avis, aucune des d\u00e9cisions de ce dernier groupe, sauf celle de Varin v. Gu\u00e9rin, ne peut avoir de port\u00e9e sur le point qui nous occupe. Et on observera que dans cette derni\u00e8re cause, on affirma pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment que l'appel, ou la revision, doit \u00eatre port\u00e9 au nom des repr\u00e9sentants de la partie d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e, et que Dame Varin, l'ex\u00e9cutrice testamentaire du d\u00e9funt, ayant log\u00e9 l'appel en son nom et en sa qualit\u00e9, n'avait pas, tel qu'on le pr\u00e9tendait, \u00e0 reprendre l'instance.\nEn somme, ce que la Cour Supr\u00eame a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans Price v. Fraser, c'est que: (i) la Cour de Revision avait juridiction pour permettre un amendement aux fins de corriger l'inscription qui, par inadvertance, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite au nom du d\u00e9funt au lieu d'\u00eatre faite, suivant le mandat re\u00e7u, au nom des ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires; (ii) il n'y avait pas eu d'abus dans l'exercice de ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire et (iii) aucune partie n'en subissait de pr\u00e9judice. La ratio decidendi du premier point (i) de la d\u00e9cision, qui est le point de substance, ne consiste vraiment que dans l'approbation, plut\u00f4t timidement exprim\u00e9e, de la jurisprudence examin\u00e9e, juris- prudence dont on a, cependant, limit\u00e9 l'application \u00e0 des cas similaires \u00e0 ceux y ayant donn\u00e9 lieu, ainsi qu'il ressort des deux extraits suivants27:\nThe opinion finally prevailed, and the jurisprudence seems to be well settled, for nearly thirty years, by numerous decisions quoted above, that a defective appeal, such as in the above cases, is not so absolutely null and void that it cannot be remedied by subsequent proceedings or conduct, and especially by an amendment.\n* * *\nI am inclined to regard the jurisprudence of Quebec as not only just and reasonable but also sound in law.\nJe crois avoir suffisamment indiqu\u00e9 les distinctions entre les faits ou les proc\u00e9dures donnant lieu \u00e0 cette jurisprudence aussi bien qu'\u00e0 la d\u00e9cision dans Price v. Fraser, d'une part, et ceux donnant lieu au point de droit soulev\u00e9 en la pr\u00e9sente cause. Au jugement majoritaire de cette Cour, on trouve \u00e9galement une r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l'art. 1193 C.P.C., dispositions applicables \u00e0 un pourvoi devant la Cour de Revision mais dont le texte a \u00e9t\u00e9 reproduit \u00e0 l'art. 1226 quant au pourvoi devant la Cour d'Appel. Quoique r\u00e9f\u00e9rant \u00e0 cet article, M. le Juge Girouard n'affirme rien de d\u00e9finitif quant \u00e0 son interpr\u00e9tation. Et la d\u00e9claration, suivant imm\u00e9diatement cette r\u00e9f\u00e9rence, \u00e0 l'effet qu'une inscription en revision peut validement \u00eatre faite au nom d'une personne d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e, constitue un dictum d\u00e9bordant, en raison de sa g\u00e9n\u00e9ralit\u00e9, ce qu'il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire de statuer en droit, pour la d\u00e9termination des faits de la cause et qui, pour cette raison particuli\u00e8rement, ne lie pas. A la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, tout ce qu'il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9cider en droit dans cette cause de Price v. Fraser, c'est qu'une inscription en revision log\u00e9e au nom d'un d\u00e9funt, par suite d'une simple inadvertance et non par suite de l'ignorance du fait du d\u00e9c\u00e8s, n'\u00e9tait pas entach\u00e9e de nullit\u00e9 absolue, mais d'une nullit\u00e9 relative susceptible d'\u00eatre corrig\u00e9e par voie d'amendement. Dans Charles R. Davidson and Company v. M'Robb or Officer28, Lord Dunedin dit:\nMy Lords, I apprehend that the dicta of noble Lords in this House, while always of great weight, are not of binding authority and to be accepted against one's own individual opinion, unless they can be shown to express a legal proposition which is a necessary step to the judgment which the House pronounces in the case. Cette d\u00e9claration g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de M. le Juge Girouard est, de plus, manifestement en conflit avec le principe de droit affirm\u00e9 au consid\u00e9rant pr\u00e9cit\u00e9 de la cause de Varin v. Gu\u00e9rin, cit\u00e9e dans ses raisons de jugement. Aussi bien ce serait, je crois, d\u00e9passer l'intention v\u00e9ritable du savant juge que de donner plein effet \u00e0 cette d\u00e9claration g\u00e9n\u00e9rale en \u00e9cartant celui r\u00e9sultant de la cause qu'il cite \u00e0 l'appui de l'approbation restrictive qu'il donne \u00e0 la jurisprudence rapport\u00e9e.\nDe plus, l'application de la maxime Ubi jus est aut vagum aut incertum, ibi maxima servitus praevalebit ou de la doctrine du stare decisis demeure toujours assujettie aux observations classiques faites \u00e0 la Chambre des Lords par l'Earl d'Halsbury L.C., dans Quinn v. Leathern29:\nNow, before discussing the case of Allen v. Flood ([1898] A.C.1) and what was decided therein, there are two observations of a general character which I wish to make, and one is to repeat what I have very often said before, that every judgment must be read as applicable to the particular facts proved, or assumed to be proved, since the generality of the expressions which may be found there are not intended to be expositions of the whole law, but governed and qualified by the particular facts of the case in which such expressions are to be found. The other is that a case is only an authority for what it actually decides. I entirely deny that it can be quoted for a proposition that may seem to follow logically from it.\nAu m\u00e9rite de la question soulev\u00e9e dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, je suis d'accord avec les raisons et la conclusion de mon coll\u00e8gue M. le Juge Taschereau, auxquelles je voudrais ajouter les consid\u00e9rations suivantes.\nL'appel constitue une nouvelle instance et il est de r\u00e8gle, dans notre droit: que, pour former une demande en justice, il faut avoir un int\u00e9r\u00eat; que personne ne peut plaider au nom d'autrui; que, pour ester en justice, en demandant ou en d\u00e9fendant, sous quelque forme que ce soit, il faut avoir, sauf le cas de dispositions sp\u00e9ciales, le libre exercice de ses droits, et que ceux qui ne l'ont pas doivent \u00eatre repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s, autoris\u00e9s ou assist\u00e9s de la mani\u00e8re que r\u00e8gle leur \u00e9tat ou leur capacit\u00e9 relative. On n'a pas \u00e0 signaler l'impossibilit\u00e9 m\u00e9taphysique pour un d\u00e9funt de satisfaire \u00e0 aucune de ces dispositions d'ordre public, dispositions dont l'inobservance emporte la nullit\u00e9. Particuli\u00e8rement, et en d\u00e9c\u00e9dant, comme le remarque M. le Juge Rivard en commentant l'art. 1226 C.P.C., dans Manuel de la Cour d'Appel, p. 280, n\u00b0 650, la partie \"a laiss\u00e9 le droit d'appeler dans sa succession et ce droit peut \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 par ses repr\u00e9sentants l\u00e9gaux, ex\u00e9cu- teurs, l\u00e9gataires ou h\u00e9ritiers, selon le cas. Ils sont cens\u00e9s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 partie au proc\u00e8s dans la personne de leur auteur.\" Dans Levine v. Serling30, d\u00e9cision post\u00e9rieure \u00e0 Price v. Fraser, et dans laquelle il s'agissait d'une action dirig\u00e9e contre un mineur alors que, suivant la loi, elle aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre contre le tuteur, le Comit\u00e9 Judiciaire du Conseil Priv\u00e9 jugea, contrairement \u00e0 ce qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 par cette Cour31, que la nullit\u00e9 en r\u00e9sultant \u00e9tait absolue et que, d\u00e8s qu'appara\u00eet la preuve du fait de la minorit\u00e9, l'instance commenc\u00e9e doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme n'ayant jamais eu d'existence. Il convient de citer les extraits suivants du jugement32:\nThey [Their Lordships] do not agree with the statement that the incapacity of minors is relative and not absolute; in their opinion, the incapacity to sue and be sued is absolute, subject only to certain expressed exceptions.\n* * *\nBut when it has once been established, as in this case, that the so-called defendant is an infant, then he ceases ab initio to be a defendant and cannot be treated by summons or order as if he were: this is not a mere question of procedure but of legal right, and is therefore not a, matter of judicial discretion but of determination on the facts. The proceedings after the infant attained his majority in this case are open to the further objection that there was then no longer any action in existence.\nAu jugement de cette Cour dans Levine v. Serling, on avait, comme on le fait en la pr\u00e9sente instance, trait\u00e9 le point comme \u00e9tant une question de pure proc\u00e9dure, ne causant aucun pr\u00e9judice, et soumis qu'aucun texte de loi n'affirmait que la nullit\u00e9 \u00e9tait absolue. Ces arguments, \u00e9galement invoqu\u00e9s par cette Cour dans Price v. Fraser, n'ont pas pr\u00e9valu devant le Comit\u00e9 Judiciaire dans cette cause de Levine v. Serling. A mon avis, ces vues du Comit\u00e9 Judiciaire sur le caract\u00e8re de la nullit\u00e9 s'appliquent a fortiori dans le cas d'une instance initiale ou d'une instance en appel dirig\u00e9e contre une partie d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e, ou log\u00e9e en son nom. L'ignorance du fait de la minorit\u00e9 n'a pas la vertu de modifier le caract\u00e8re absolu de la nullit\u00e9; et je ne vois pas, dans le cas qui nous occupe, que l'ignorance du fait du d\u00e9c\u00e8s puisse produire un r\u00e9sultat diff\u00e9rent. Qu'on puisse \u00eatre admis \u00e0 corriger le vice d'une inscription r\u00e9sultant d'une inadvertance, comme c'est le cas dans Price v. Fraser, ou d'une faute d'inattention commise aux proc\u00e9dures o\u00f9, par exemple, le chiffre 17 au lieu du chiffre 27 serait donn\u00e9 pour d\u00e9signer l'\u00e2ge de l'une des parties \u00e0 la cause, ce sont l\u00e0 des situations bien diff\u00e9rentes de celle se pr\u00e9sentant en l'esp\u00e8ce o\u00f9 le fait viciant la proc\u00e9dure ne r\u00e9sulte pas de l'inadvertance mais de l'ignorance du fait du d\u00e9c\u00e8s. Appliquer la d\u00e9cision de Price v. Fraser aux faits de cette cause serait non seulement en \u00e9tendre la port\u00e9e \u00e0 une situation qui n'entre pas dans le cadre de celles auxquelles cette Cour en a clairement limit\u00e9 la port\u00e9e et ainsi indiqu\u00e9 que la proposition de droit y affirm\u00e9e n'avait pas le caract\u00e8re absolu qu'on veut lui donner, mais serait cr\u00e9er une exception nouvelle aux dispositions d'ordre public plus haut mentionn\u00e9es.\nPour ces raisons, je rejetterais les deux appels avec d\u00e9pens.\nAbbott J.:\u2014I am of the opinion that these appeals should be allowed.\nIn my view the matter is determined by the decision of this Court in Price v. Fraser33, in which a majority of the Court held that in the Province of Quebec the taking of an appeal in the name of a deceased person is not an absolute nullity but is a relative one which can be remedied by an amendment.\nThe husband of the appelant, one Leopold Patenaude, since deceased, was sued jointly with the mis-en-cause Lussier for damages resulting from an automobile accident. The said Leopold Patenaude was insured with the Canadian Mercantile Assurance Company against public liability, and the insurance company instructed its attorney to contest the action on his behalf.\nOn May 2, 1956, judgment was rendered condemning the two defendants jointly and severally to pay to the respondent Marquis the sum of $8,217.18 with interest and costs. In the meantime, after the case had been heard on the merits but before judgment was rendered, the said Leopold Patenaude had died on April 8, 1956, a fact however which was unknown to the insurance company and to its counsel. Within the delay allowed for appeal, the insurance company instructed its counsel to appeal from the said judgment and, on May 30, 1956, after notice to the attorneys for the respondent and the mis-en-cause, an inscription in appeal was filed in the name of the said Leopold Patenaude and the insurance company furnished security that it would satisfy the condemnation and pay all costs adjudged in case the judgment appealed from was confirmed.\nAlthough the attorney for respondent knew of the death of Patenaude he made no objection at that time to the filing of the inscription in appeal or to the security furnished. It was only after the delays to appeal had expired that the attorney for the insurance company learned of Patenaude's death, and on July 3, 1956, a petition in continuance of suit was taken asking that appellant (who is the universal legatee of her husband the late Leopold Patenaude) be authorized to continue the appeal. The respondent Marquis contested the petition in continuance and also moved to quash the appeal, and on September 20, 1956, the Court of Queen's Bench rendered two judgments34, one granting the motion to quash and dismissing the appeal with costs and the other dismissing the petition in continuance with costs. The present appeals by special leave are from those two judgments.\nIt is clear from the foregoing summary of the facts that as between the late Leopold Patenaude and the Canadian Mercantile Assurance Company, it was the latter which had the ultimate interest in the outcome of the litigation.\nI think moreover it may properly be inferred in the circumstances that Patenaude had authorized his insurers to conduct the litigation in such manner as they saw fit, including the taking of an appeal from the judgment in the Court of first instance if it were deemed advisable to do so.\nAs I have said, I consider that the principle laid down by this Court in Price v. Fraser is applicable to the issue in this appeal and that appellant was entitled to ask that the inscription in appeal be amended by substituting her name as appellant in place of that of her deceased husband.\nIt is true that in Price v. Fraser by inadvertence, appeal was entered in the name of the late Senator Price although his death was in fact known to the attorneys who had been instructed to take such appeal by his legal representatives. An application to amend was allowed in order to substitute the names of the testamentary executors for that of the deceased. In my opinion, the enunciation of the legal proposition that the taking of an appeal in the name of a deceased person is a relative and not an absolute nullity was a necessary step to the judgment of the majority in that case. In the present case the appeal was not taken in the name of the deceased by inadvertence. At the time the inscription was filed, the attorney for the insurance company was ignorant of the fact that Patenaude was dead. I am unable to see any difference in principle between the two cases. In both of them appeal was taken in the name of a deceased litigant in error and error is defined in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary as \"something incorrectly done through ignorance or inadvertence\". The taking of an appeal in the name of a deceased person being a relative nullity, the reason for which such appeal has been taken erroneously in the name of the deceased person cannot change the character of the nullity to that of an absolute nullity incapable of being remedied by amendment.\nIt is also true that in the present case the proceeding taken to correct the error was entitled a petition en reprise d'instance whereas a motion to amend the inscription in appeal would have been a more appropriate designation. This, however, is a matter of form and not one of substance, and in my opinion the Court was entitled proprio motu to deal with the petition as an application to amend the inscription in appeal.\nI adopt as my own the language of Girouard J. in Price v. Fraser, when, speaking for himself, Gwynne and Davies JJ., he said:\nUnder the new Code of Procedure, which governs this case, the power of a court to amend has been greatly enlarged; it is almost unlimited. See articles 513 and 523. The commissioners, charged with its confection, observe that all the provisions contained in the above articles are in conformity with the new principle they lay down in relation to exceptions to the form, namely, that formal defects do not entail nullity unless they are not remedied. They express the opinion that article 522 furnishes the only exception upon the power to amend, viz., the nature of the action cannot be changed. I find, however, another wise limitation in article 520, viz., the opposite party must not be led into error. With these two exceptions, the power to amend is much larger than in France; it is practically as liberal as in England, the State of New York and the Province of Ontario. The commissioners have even indicated the Codes and Judicature Acts in force in these states as the source of several articles of our new code. The cardinal rule seems to prevail in the courts of these countries that in pass- ing upon applications to amend, the ends of justice should never be sacrificed to mere form or by too rigid an adherence to technical rules of practice.\nThe appeals should therefore be allowed with costs here and in the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side) and the case remitted to that Court so that the appeal to it may be adjudicated upon the merits.\nAppeals allowed with costs, Taschereau and Fauteux JJ. dissenting.\nAttorneys for the petitioner, appellant: Phaneuf & Turgeon, Montreal.\nAttorney for the plaintiff, respondent: J.

The contract provided for monthly payments by the association to K after he became 60 years of age and for payments to the beneficiary named in the contract in the event that K died before payment of the annuity had begun. The contract expressly provided that it was to be performed in the State of New York and \u201cgoverned as to its validity and effect by the laws there in force\u201d.\nK designated his wife as beneficiary in the contract but reserved the right to change the beneficiary and, by a supplementary contract, this designation was changed and the appellant herein was substituted as beneficiary. K died before attaining the age of 60. It was contended that by the operation of The Insurance Act the change of beneficiary (being a change from a preferred to an ordinary beneficiary, without the consent of the former) was invalid, and that the association, on K\u2019s death, held the insurance moneys as trustee for his widow, as preferred beneficiary, under s. 164(1) of the Act.\nHeld: The appellant was entitled to be paid as beneficiary under the contract, notwithstanding that she was not a preferred beneficiary under s. 158(2) of The Insurance Act.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Locke and Cartwright JJ.: Even assuming that the policy was one of \u201clife insurance\u201d within the statutory definitions, Part V of the Act did not apply to it.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Cartwright J.: The word \u201cdeemed\u201d in s. 134(1) of the Act (which provided, inter alia, that a contract was deemed to be made in Ontario if the insured was resident there) did not mean \u201cconclusively deemed\u201d but only \u201cdeemed until the contrary was proved\u201d. Hickey v. Stalker (1923), 53 O.L.R. 414 at 418-9, quoted with approval; statement to the contrary in In re Duperreault, [1940] 3 W.W.R. 385, disapproved. In this case the contrary was proved, and indeed admitted, and s. 134 therefore had no effect. Without applying s. 134, the contract could not be brought within any of the provisions of s. 132, defining the operation of Part V. Not only was it made and to be performed wholly in New York but it expressly provided that it was to be governed by the laws of that State.\nPer Locke J.: Sections 132 and 134 of the Act could not apply to this contract since it was not made in Ontario and none of the rights arising out of it were situated there. To hold otherwise would be to say that the Legislature of Ontario might affect civil rights of which the situs was outside the Province. Royal Bank of Canada et al. v. The King et al., [1913] A.C. 283 at 298, applied. The moneys payable under the contract were therefore not impressed with any trust in favour of the widow, and she had no claim to them.\nPer Taschereau, Rand, Locke and Abbott JJ.: The contract was not one of \u201clife insurance\u201d, and the proceeds were not \u201cinsurance moneys\u201d, either within the ordinary meaning of those terms or within the definitions in s. 1 of The Insurance Act.\nConflict of laws\u2014Proof of foreign law\u2014Presumption of similarity.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Cartwright J.: The presumption (in the absence of proof to the contrary) that foreign law is the same as that of the jurisdiction in which the action is tried relates only to the general law, and does not extend to the special provisions of particular statutes altering the common law; as to such provisions there is no presumption. Purdom et al. v. A.E. Pavey & Co. (1896), 26 S.C.R. 412 at 417, followed.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], reversing a judgment of Wilson J[2]. Appeal allowed.\nTerence Sheard, Q.C., for the defendant, appellant.\nF.A. Brewin, Q.C., and J.F. McCallum, for the plaintiff, respondent,\nD.H.W. Henry, Q.C., for the Attorney General of Canada, intervenant.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and Cartwright J. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 allowing an appeal from a judgment of Wilson J.2 and directing that judgment be entered for the respondent against the appellant for $6,147.85.\nThe facts are undisputed. On August 1, 1934, the late Everett George Kerslake, to whom I shall refer as \u201cDr. Kerslake\u201d, entered into a written contract, in which he was called \u201cthe annuitant\u201d, with Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America, hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Association\u201d, whereby, in consideration of the payment of \u201cregular monthly premiums\u201d until he should attain the age of 60 years, the Association agreed to pay him a stated sum monthly, commencing on the first day of the calendar month next following the 60th anniversary of his birth and continuing thereafter throughout his life. At the date of this contract Dr. Kerslake was resident in Toronto. The contract was numbered A13169 and contained the following provisions:\n9. Place of Contract. All premiums on this contract and all benefits herein provided, are payable at the Home Office of the Association in the City of New York. This contract is made and to be performed in the State of New York, and is to be governed as to its validity and effect by the laws there in force, with reference to which it is made. No person whosoever is authorized to represent or act for the Association in any manner outside of the State of New York.\n* * *\n12. Manner of Payment in Event of Death. In the event of the death of the Annuitant before payment of the annuity has begun as provided on the first page hereof, the Association will pay 120 equal monthly instalments of $9.83 per $1,000 of Accumulated Premiums to\nMILDRED LOUISE KERSLAKE, WIFE\nof the Annuitant, if living, as Beneficiary.\nThe right to change the Beneficiary is reserved by the Annuitant.\nIf the right to change the Beneficiary is reserved the Annuitant may from time to time change the Beneficiary by making written request to the Association, but such change shall take effect only upon the endorsement of the same hereon by the Association.\nNo oral testimony was given at the trial. The facts were stated by counsel and contract no. A13169 and contract no. S-1876, to which reference will be made later, were filed as exhibits by consent. The learned trial judge asked counsel whether he was correct in assuming \u201cthat the contract [A13169] was accepted in New York and issued from New York\u201d and counsel replied in the affirmative. The Association was not at any time licensed to transact business in the Province of Ontario.\nThe respondent is the Mildred Louise Kerslake named in the paragraph quoted above from contract A13169. She was then the lawful wife and is now the lawful widow of Dr. Kerslake. On February 17, 1949, Dr. Kerslake executed an endorsement revoking the designation of the respondent and naming as beneficiary the appellant whom he described as \u201cAlison B. Gray Friend\u201d.\nOn September 27, 1949, Dr. Kerslake obtained a decree of divorce from the respondent in the State of Idaho and on July 25, 1950, he went through a form of marriage with the appellant in the State of Connecticut. The domicile of Dr. Kerslake was at all relevant times in Ontario and it is conceded for the purposes of this action that, according to the law of Ontario, he was not validly married to the appellant.\nOn December 1, 1950, Dr. Kerslake executed a further endorsement naming the appellant as beneficiary and describing her as \u201cAlison B. Kerslake (formerly Alison B. Gray) Wife\u201d.\nBoth of the above-mentioned endorsements were signed by Dr. Kerslake at Toronto. They were duly accepted and recorded by the Association and attached to the contract.\nDr. Kerslake died on July 22, 1953, before attaining the age of 60 years. He left a will in which he named the appellant as executrix and left all his estate to her. Probate was granted to the appellant on February 5, 1954 by the Surrogate Court of the County of York.\nOn August 1, 1953, the Association issued to the appellant a contract numbered S-1876 whereby it agreed to pay her an annuity certain consisting of 36 monthly payments of $179.46. This contract contained the following provisions:\nThis supplementary contract is granted in consideration of the surrender to the Association of its original policy contract number A-13169, application of the proceeds thereof in the amount of $6,147.85 being in full satisfaction therefor and in accordance with the mode of settlement elected thereunder.\n* * *\nThe consideration for this contract and all benefits herein provided are payable at the Home Office of the Association in the City of New York. This contract is made and to be performed in the State of New York, and is to be governed as to its validity and effect by the laws there in force, with reference to which it is made.\nThe respondent\u2019s claim was put as follows: (i) under the interpretation sections of The Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 183, hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Act\u201d, contract A13169 was a contract of life insurance; (ii) it must, by virtue of s. 134 of the Act, be treated as having been made in Ontario; (iii) it was therefore subject to Part V of the Act; (iv) under s. 158(2) the respondent was a preferred beneficiary; (v) under s. 164(1), upon Dr. Kerslake designating her as beneficiary a trust was created in her favour; (vi) the designation of the appellant as beneficiary in her place was invalid and without effect; (vii) the appellant, having surrendered contract A13169 to obtain contract S-1876, holds the last-mentioned contract in trust for the respondent and is liable to account to her for the proceeds thereof.\nTo this it was answered: (i) that the respondent had no personal claim against the appellant and that if the respondent had any claim under contract A13169 (which was denied) it must be made against the Association and not against the appellant, and, alternatively, that if the respondent could have any right of action against the appellant this would arise only after she had exhausted her remedies against the Association; (ii) that the Ontario Insurance Act could not affect the rights of the parties under either contract A13169 or contract S-1876, both of which were made and to be wholly performed in the State of New York, and that to the extent that the provisions of the Act purport to affect those rights they are ultra vires of the provincial Legislature; (iii) that in any event the provisions of the Act were not applicable to contract A13169 as it was not a contract of life insurance.\nThe learned trial judge gave effect to the last-mentioned submission and dismissed the action.\nThe Court of Appeal[3] were of opinion that contract A13169 was a contract of life insurance as defined in the Act, that a trust was created in favour of the respondent when she was designated as beneficiary, that Dr. Kerslake could not deprive her of the benefits of the contract by transferring them to the appellant who was not a member of the class of preferred beneficiaries, that it was unnecessary to decide whether s. 134 of the Act was ultra vires of the Legislature as, in determining the rights of the parties, it should be assumed that the laws of the State of New York do not differ from those of Ontario, that the appellant had received from the Association money \u201cwhich in law belonged to\u201d the respondent, and that as the appellant resided within the jurisdiction of the Courts of Ontario the respondent was entitled to maintain an action against her to enforce payment of the sum of money \u201cbelonging to\u201d the respondent which the appellant \u201cwrongfully received and used for her own benefit\u201d. The argument that the respondent must first pursue her rights against the Association was rejected, but without discussion of the cases on which it was founded.\nIt is obvious, from what has been said above, that the respondent\u2019s claim depends upon her being able to maintain that the rights of the parties were governed by Part V of the Act, particularly s. 164(1).\nThe cases cited by Mr. Sheard indicate that, apart from the definitions contained in the Act, contract A13169 could not properly be described as one of life insurance, while the learned justices of appeal have concluded that it falls within the statutory definition of a contract of life insurance. I do not find it necessary to decide these points because, even on the assumption that the contract is one of life insurance, it is my opinion that Part V of the Act does not apply to it.\nNot only was the contract made and to be performed wholly in the State of New York but its terms provided that it was made with reference to and was to be governed as to its validity and effect by the laws of that State. It was in fact fully performed according to its terms in the State of New York by the issue to the appellant of contract S-1876.\nSection 132 of the Act reads in part as follows:\n132.\u2014(1) Notwithstanding any agreement, condition or stipulation to the contrary, this Part shall apply to every contract of life insurance made in the Province after the 1st day of January, 1925, and any term in any such contract inconsistent with this Part shall be null and void.\n(2) This Part shall apply to every contract of life insurance made in the Province before the 1st day of January, 1925, where the maturity of the contract had not occurred before that date.\n(3) This Part shall apply to every other contract of life insurance made after the 1st day of January, 1925, where the contract provides that this Part shall apply or that the contract shall be construed or governed by the law of the Province.\nIt is obvious that contract A13169 does not fall within the wording of any of these subsections read by themselves, but the respondent relies on s. 134(1) of the Act which provides:\n134.\u2014(1) A contract is deemed to be made in the Province, (a) if the place of residence of the insured is stated in the application or the policy to be in the Province; or\n(b) if neither the application nor the policy contains a statement as to the place of residence of the insured, but the actual place of residence of the insured is within the Province at the time of the making of the contract.\nThe question of the meaning to be given to the word \u201cdeemed\u201d when used in a statute has been considered in many decisions, a number of which are collected and discussed in the judgments delivered in the Appellate Division in Hickey v. Stalker[4], a case dealing with an Ontario statute different from the one with which we are concerned. As is pointed out by Meredith C.J.C.P., at p. 416, the word may mean \u201cdeemed conclusively\u201d or \u201cdeemed until the contrary is proved\u201d.\nAt pp. 418-9 Middleton J., as he then was, after referring to the treatment of the word in the dictionaries, continued:\nFar more important are two decisions of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. In Regina v. Freeman (1890), 22 N.S.R. 506, Townshend, J., speaking for the full Court, says (p. 513): \u201cThe word \u2018deemed\u2019 has acquired no technical or peculiar signification when used in legislation, but, like other words, must be interpreted with reference to the whole Act of which it forms a part.\u201d\nIn the second case, Rex v. Fraser (1911), 45 N.S.R. 218, the statute provided that an act which in itself might be lawful or might be unlawful \u201cshall be deemed\u201d to have been unlawful; it was argued that this meant \u201cheld conclusively\u201d or \u201cadjudged and determined.\u201d The same learned Judge, then Sir Charles Townshend, C.J., says (p. 220): \u201cI should be sorry to believe that our Legislature was capable of enacting such an unreasonable law, and I am quite confident the Legislature never contemplated anything so contrary to natural justice:\u201d and so he concludes that the true meaning to be given to the word \u201cdeemed\u201d, as here used, is that it shall be treated as \u201cprima facie evidence,\u201d \u201cheld until the contrary is proved.\u201d Graham, J., prefers this result to thinking that the Legislature had declared \u201cwhite to be black;\u201d Drysdale and Lawrence, JJ., also concurred; but Russell, J., did not agree.\nI think this modified meaning should be given to the word as found in our statute, for it will not only save the legislation from being unjust but also from being absurd. That it is the duty of the Court, in seeking the true legislative intention of an Act, which undoubtedly is the sole duty of the Court, to regard the possible consequences of alternative constructions of ambiguous expressions, has been determined in many cases.\nIn the case at bar, and in many cases which can easily be imagined, to construe the word \u201cdeemed\u201d in s. 134(1) as \u201cheld conclusively\u201d would be to impute to the Legislature the intention (i) of requiring the Court to hold to be the fact something directly contrary to the true fact, and (ii) of asserting the power to alter the terms of a contract made and to be wholly performed and in fact wholly performed in a foreign state. This result can, and in my opinion should, be avoided by construing the word to mean \u201cdeemed until the contrary is proved\u201d. In the case at bar the contrary has been proved and indeed admitted.\nI have not overlooked the fact that in In re Duperreault[5], Bigelow J. held that the words \u201cis deemed\u201d in s. 156 of The Saskatchewan Insurance Act, R.S.S. 1930, c. 101, the wording of which was identical with that of s. 134 of the Ontario Act, meant not \u201cis prima facie considered\u201d but \u201cmust be considered and held\u201d; but, with the greatest respect for the opinion of that learned judge, the practical and constitutional objections to that construction appear to me to be insurmountable.\nIt is contended that the Court of Appeal were right in presuming that the law of the State of New York was the same as that of Ontario, but the presumption relates to the general law and does not extend to the special provisions of particular statutes altering the common law. It will be sufficient to refer to one of the several authorities on this point relied upon by Mr. Sheard. In Purdom et al. v. A.E. Pavey & Co.[6], an appeal from the Court of Appeal for Ontario, Strong C.J.C., delivering the unanimous judgment of the Court, said, at p. 417: \u201cThen we cannot presume that the law of Oregon corresponds with the present state of our own statutory law.\u201d\nFor the above reasons I am of opinion that Part V of the Act does not apply to contract A13169 and that the appeal succeeds; it therefore becomes unnecessary for me to consider the submissions of counsel for the appellant other than those with which I have dealt above.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge with costs throughout. No costs should be awarded to or against the intervenant.\nTASCHEREAU J.:\u2014With the exception that I do not find it necessary to express any opinion as to the validity of s. 134 of The Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 183, I agree with my brother Locke that for the reasons stated by him this appeal should be allowed with costs throughout, and that there should be no order as to costs to or against the intervenant.\nThe judgment of Rand and Abbott JJ. was delivered by\nRAND J.:\u2014This appeal deals with an annuity contract entered into between the husband of the respondent and the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America. Payment of the annuity was to begin when the annuitant reached the age of 60 years; should he die before that time the Association was to pay 120 monthly instalments of such an amount as at the rate of 3\u00bd per cent. would return the premiums paid. The contract was made in the State of New York and according to its terms was to be subject to the law of that State. The annuitant was then residing in Ontario. The original beneficiary was the annuitant\u2019s wife. By an express provision the annuitant could change the beneficiary and in 1946 he substituted the appellant for his wife. In 1953 he died. The Association entered into a new arangement with the appellant providing for 36 monthly instalments of $179.46. The widow brought this action against the beneficiary. At trial it was dismissed but on appeal judgment was directed for the total amount of the premiums, $6,147.85, from which the beneficiary brings the case here.\nThe cause of action is argued to be supported by several sections of The Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 183. By s. 132 it is declared that every contract of life insurance made in Ontario after January 1, 1925, shall be subject to Part V of that Act, within which the sections hereafter mentioned are included. By s. 134 a contract is deemed to be made in the Province if, at the time, the insured is resident in Ontario. Section 158(2) provides for preferred beneficiaries, of whom the wife is one, and s. 164 prohibits any change to an ordinary beneficiary in such circumstances as are present here. As these provisions are confined to life insurance the initial question is whether the policy is one of that class.\nThe expression \u201cLife Insurance\u201d is defined by s. 1(36):\n\u201clife insurance\u201d means insurance whereby the insurer undertakes to pay insurance \u2018money on death, or on the happening of any contingency dependent on human life, or whereby the insurer undertakes to pay insurance money subject to the payment of premiums for a term depending on human life, but, except to the extent of double indemnity insurance, does not include insurance payable in the event of death by accident only. \u201cInsurance\u201d is also defined, s. 1(31):\n\u201cinsurance\u201d means the undertaking by one person to indemnify another person against loss or liability for loss in respect of a certain risk or peril to which the object of the insurance may be exposed, or to pay a sum of money or other thing of value upon the happening of a certain event;\nIt is seen from these definitions that the latter is considerably broader than the former, but both are used in the Court of Appeal in reaching the conclusion that the contract was one of life insurance. It seems to me to be clear, however, that the specific definition of \u201clife insurance\u201d is exclusive and it would be misleading to extend it by an interpretation given in the light of that wider definition.\nLife insurance in its characteristic forms involves, as its essence, a risk in a specified payment of money absolute from the moment the contract takes effect. That constitutes the security sought by the insured, the premiums for which in turn furnish the consideration to the insurer. There is nothing of that in this case. The repayment when death is before the age of 60 years is simply the return of the premiums to that moment paid. The only risk assumed by the Association in relation to death lies in the preservation or investment of the premiums. But that is not a life insurance risk; there is in fact no risk in the true sense whatever and the Association will retain the benefit derived over the years from the use of the premiums received.\nLaidlaw J.A.[7] quotes from the general definition the following: \u201cto pay a sum of money\u2026upon the happening of a certain event\u201d; but in the specific definition it is not the payment of \u201cmoney\u201d, it is the payment of \u201cinsurance money\u201d, on \u201cdeath or on the happening of any contingency dependent on human life\u201d; that means the payment on the risk assumed by the insurer to be liable for the amount of insurance from the beginning.\nOn the reasoning of the Court of Appeal every pension scheme with provision for repayment of the whole or part of the premiums in the event of death, would satisfy the definition of \u201cinsurance\u201d and thereupon to be treated as a life policy. I can find nothing in the Act dealing with life insurance to give support to that intention or applicability. Pension schemes are as familiar now as insurance and are approaching an almost universal item in industrial business and other economic activities. Pensions may be looked upon as the payment of postponed wages, and their amount depends, certainly in most schemes, on the length of service, the contributions made and the wages from time to time received; they are not, in the general understanding and in a true sense, looked upon as insurance. If the Legislature had any intention that the definition should extend to such contracts it would, I think, have declared so in clear terms, and I am unable to read the specific definition as embracing them. Legislation for such schemes would call for consideration of matters not relevant to insurance. The provision for the return of premiums paid is a resulting contingent incident and does not change the essential character of the contract. Nothing in the Act gives any indication of attention having been given to these different features and aspects; there is nothing referring to annuities except those which are modes of paying insurance moneys upon death.\nThis conclusion dispenses with the examination of the other questions raised, the validity of s. 134 and the right of suit against the appellant in the absence of pursuing a claim against the Association, and no view is intended to be expressed for or against either of them.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the judgment at trial with costs in the Court of Appeal and in this Court.\nLOCKE J.:\u2014The agreement made by the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America with the late E.G. Kerslake, dated August 1, 1934, obligated it to pay an annuity of such amount as the accumulated premiums at the date of the first annuity payment would purchase, in accordance with the interest rates and mortality tables designated, on the 60th anniversary of the birth of the annuitant. It further provided that, in the event of Kerslake\u2019s death before completion of the annuity payments provided for, the Association would pay 120 equal monthly instalments \u201cof such amounts as to be equivalent in value on a 3\u00bd% interest basis to the accumulated premiums at the date of death\u201d, to the named beneficiary. A term of the agreement declared that its purpose was to furnish an old age annuity benefit and that it had no cash surrender value.\nClause 9 of the general provisions forming part of the Agreement read:\nPlace of Contract. All premiums on this contract and all benefits herein provided, are payable at the Home Office of the Association in the City of New York. This contract is made and to be performed in the State of New York, and is to be governed as to its validity and effect by the laws there in force, with reference to which it is made. No person whosoever is authorized to represent or act for the Association in any manner outside of the State of New York.\nClause 12 read:\nManner of Payment in Event of Death. In the event of the death of the Annuitant before payment of the annuity has begun as provided on the first page hereof, the Association will pay 120 equal monthly instalments of $9.83 per $1,000 of accumulated premiums to\nMILDRED LOUISE KERSLAKE, WIFE\nof the Annuitant, if living, as Beneficiary.\nThe right to change the Beneficiary is reserved by the Annuitant.\nThereafter Kerslake assumed to change the named beneficiary to the appellant Alison Bruce Gray, describing her as a friend, and at a later date directed that the beneficiary be described as Alison B. Kerslake, describing her as his wife. This description was inaccurate as the contract of marriage with the respondent had not been dissolved.\nBy the statement of claim it was alleged that the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association had paid or agreed to pay \u201cthe proceeds of the said policy of insurance\u201d to the appellant.\nThe defence, as amended, denied that the Association had paid the amount alleged to the defendant but said that it had issued to her a new contract in settlement of her claim against the company under the laws of the State of New York.\nBy way of reply the respondent alleged that if this had been done\nthe new contract with the Insurance Company, numbered S. 1876 having been secured with the proceeds of a policy of insurance held in trust for the Plaintiff, is subject to the said trust and the defendant is liable to account therefor as claimed in the Statement of Claim.\nAt the trial, an agreement was put in evidence dated August 1, 1953, whereby the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America agreed, in consideration of the surrender of her rights under the contract of August 1, 1934, to pay to the appellant an annuity consisting of 36 monthly payments of $179.46 each, the first to be paid on the 1st day of each month thereafter and, in the event of her death, to be commuted and paid in one sum to persons designated by the annuitant as beneficiaries. This agreement was made at the city of New York. Subsection 31 of s. 1 of The Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 183, declares the meaning to be assigned to the word \u201cinsurance\u201d in the Act. The expression \u201cinsurance money\u201d is also defined and subs. 36 defines the words \u201clife insurance\u201d as meaning\ninsurance whereby the insurer undertakes to pay insurance money on death, or on the happening of any contingency dependent on human life, or whereby the insurer undertakes to pay insurance money subject to the payment of premiums for a term depending on human life, but, except to the extent of double indemnity insurance, does not include insurance payable in the event of death by accident only.\nPart V of the Act includes ss. 131 to 191, both inclusive. Of these the following require consideration: s. 132 which declares that, notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary, Part V applies to every contract of life insurance made in the Province after January 1, 1925, and to every contract of life insurance made in the Province before that date where the maturity of the contract has not occurred before that date, and to every other contract of insurance made after January 1, 1925, where the contract provides that it shall apply or that the contract shall be construed or governed by the law of the Province.\nSection 134(1) reads:\nA contract is deemed to be made in the Province,\n(a) if the place of residence of the insured is stated in the application or the policy to be in the Province; or\n(b) if neither the application nor the policy contains a statement as to the place of residence of the insured, but the actual place of residence of the insured is within the Province at the time of the making of the contract.\nSection 158(2) defines \u201cpreferred beneficiaries\u201d and s. 161 provides that the insured may designate the beneficiary by the contract or by a declaration, subject, inter alia, to the provisions of the Act relating to preferred beneficiaries. Section 165 provides that, notwithstanding the designation of a preferred beneficiary, the insured may subsequently exercise the powers conferred by s. 161 so as to transfer the benefits of the contract to any one or more of the class of preferred beneficiaries, to the exclusion of any or all others of the class.\nSection 164(1) reads:\nWhere the insured, in pursuance of the provisions of section 161, designates as beneficiary or beneficiaries, a member or members of the class of preferred beneficiaries, a trust is created in favour of the designated beneficiary or beneficiaries, and the insurance money, or such part thereof as is or has been apportioned to a preferred beneficiary, shall not, except as otherwise provided in this Act, be subject to the control of the insured, or of his creditors, or form part of the estate of the insured.\nIt is on the footing that the annuity contract was subject to these provisions of The Insurance Act of Ontario that the respondent advances the claim against the appellant.\nThe claim of the respondent must be sustained, if at all, on the basis that the moneys payable by the Association under the annuity contract of August 1, 1934, were, at the time of the death of Kerslake, held in trust by the Association for the respondent as a preferred beneficiary and that the moneys received by the appellant under the annuity contract of August 1, 1953, were impressed with a trust in the respondent\u2019s favour. It is stating the obvious to say that any claim that the respondent may assert against the appellant cannot be placed upon any higher ground than such claim as she might advance against the Association. If the quoted sections of The Insurance Act applied, Kerslake\u2019s attempt to change the beneficiary from the preferred beneficiary, his wife, to one who did not fall within that class, would be ineffective and, accordingly, the respondent\u2019s right against the Association might be asserted either in contract under the terms of the agreement of August 1, 1934, or in damages for breach of trust in paying to the appellant moneys held in trust for the respondent. It is only on the basis that the latter claim might be sustained that the respondent\u2019s claim can be upheld. The limit of the claim would be that portion of the accumulated moneys which had not been exhausted by the annuity payments made to Kerslake between the time when he became 60 years of age and the date of his death.\nThe appellant contends that the annuity contract dated August 1, 1934, was not a contract of life insurance and that, accordingly, Part V of The Insurance Act does not apply to it or alter or affect the obligations of the Association. A further contention is that ss. 132 and 134 of the Act do not apply in respect of the said contract, since it was not made in Ontario and none of the rights arising out of it are situated in Ontario.\nIt appears from the reasons for judgment delivered in the Court of Appeal[8] that the second of these points was raised in that Court as a contention that s. 134 was ultra vires of the Province. The Attorney General of Canada did not appear in that Court but obtained leave to intervene in this Court and we have heard counsel on his behalf. The position now taken both by counsel for the appellant and for the Attorney General is as it is stated in the next preceding paragraph.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeal found against the appellant on the first point and rejected the contention that the sections were, as the respondent asserted, ultra vires.\nWhile if the first point is decided against the respondent it is decisive of the action, I think the second point should be decided in this Court.\nThe finding of the Court of Appeal is made upon the basis that the annuity contract was a contract of life insurance to which Part V of The Insurance Act applies. The home office of the Association is in the city of New York and, while it was not proven, it may properly be presumed that it was incorporated in the United States. The contract itself was made in the State of New York and, by its terms, the obligations of the Association were to be performed there and were to be such as were imposed upon it under the laws of that State. The Association was not licensed to carry on business in Ontario at any time. The effect of the judgment is to declare that the Legislature of Ontario may, despite the existence of such facts, alter the terms of a contract of life insurance made by such an association by declaring that the person insured may not, contrary to its terms, change the beneficiary to any one other than a preferred beneficiary as defined by the Legislature, say that the liability of the Association for the insurance moneys payable on the death of the policyholder is that of a trustee for the person to whom the Act of the Legislature permits the money to be paid, and prohibit the insuring company from carrying out the obligations imposed upon it by the laws of the state where the contract was made and to be performed, in this case the State of New York.\nThe situs of the cause of action which would arise on the death of the policyholder or annuitant was clearly in the State of New York. The validity of the finding of the Court of Appeal may perhaps be tested in this manner: Should the respondent bring an action against the Association in the State of New York, where the moneys were payable, would it be an answer to the claim for the Association to say that, in accordance with the terms of the contract, it had paid the moneys to the person entitled under the laws of the State of New York, or could the respondent in such case say that these terms had been changed by an Act of the Legislature of Ontario and that the Association\u2019s liability was to be determined under the laws of that Province? It seems to me that to ask the question is to answer it.\nI agree with the contention of the appellant and the Attorney General that, even if it be assumed that the contract was one of life insurance, s. 134 and s. 132 of The Insurance Act, to the extent that it would make s. 134 applicable, do not apply. To hold otherwise would be to say that the Legislature of the Province might affect civil rights the situs of which was outside the Province. This is the argument which failed in Royal Bank of Canada et al. v. The King et al.[9], where Lord Haldane, delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee, referring to the rights of the non-resident bondholders outside the Province of Alberta which were enforceable, said at p. 298:\nTheir right was a civil right outside the province, and the Legislature of the province could not legislate validly in derogation of that right.\nIt accordingly follows that, as the moneys payable under the annuity contract were not impressed with a trust in favour of the respondent, the contention that the appellant has received moneys impressed with a trust in her favour should fail.\nCounsel for the Attorney General did not contend that the sections were ultra vires since, clearly, they do apply to contracts made within the Province and to civil rights the situs of which is within the Province. In my opinion, this aspect of the matter should be decided on that basis.\nI am further of the opinion that the annuity contract was not a contract of life insurance within the meaning of The Insurance Act and that Part V does not apply to it.\n\u201cInsurance money\u201d is defined in s. 1(33) as meaning the amount payable by an insurer under a contract and includes all benefits, surplus, profits, dividends, bonuses and annuities payable under the contract. This expression appears as part of the definition of \u201clife insurance\u201d in subs. 36 of s. 1, and the contract there referred to is a contract of life insurance. It is true that under the annuity contract in question, as in the case of the annuities which may be purchased under the Government Annuities Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 132, where the annuity provides for payments for a defined number of years, if the annuitant dies before the annuity commences or before the full amount has been paid, the part of the accumulated moneys which have thus been unexpended are paid to the personal representatives of the annuitant or to his nominees. There is express provision for this in s. 12 of the Government Annuities Act, as there is in the contract in question, and like annuity contracts are issued by great numbers of life insurance companies and annuity companies in this country. The fact, however, that part of the money may thus be repayable on death cannot transform what is simply an arrangement for the payment of annuities into a life insurance contract or the annuities into insurance money.\nAnnuities of the kind provided by the contract in question and by the Government Annuities Act have, in my opinion, nothing in common with contracts of life insurance. Their usual purpose is simply to provide, by the deposit either of a lump sum or of payments over a period of years, a sum of money sufficient, with accumulated interest, to provide an annuity to commence in one\u2019s later years, either for the life of the annuitant or for a fixed term of years. The sum repayable on death if the annuitant dies before he has reached the age when the annuity has commenced or before the stipulated number of annual payments have been made is nothing more than a refunding of moneys deposited for a defined purpose, when that purpose has wholly or partially failed owing to the death of the annuitant. It is common practice for testators to direct that moneys forming part of their estates shall be used to purchase annuities for their dependants, either for their life or for a specified term of years, and I am quite unable to understand how annuity contracts purchased for such a purpose could be classified as contracts of life insurance.\nIt may be noted in passing that by s. 26 of the Act insurers licensed for the transaction of life insurance in the Province may issue annuities but nothing in Part V refers to such contracts or the moneys payable thereunder. I would allow this appeal with costs throughout and restore the judgment at the trial. I would not award costs to or against the intervenant.\nAppeal allowed with costs throughout.\nSolicitor for the defendant, appellant: V.

This is particularly true of one who has been practising for many years and has had extensive experience in the Courts. Judges and Courts are, alike, open to criticism and if reasonable argument or expostulation is offered against any judicial act as contrary to law or the public good, no Court can or will treat that as contempt; but any act calculated to bring a Court into contempt or to lower its authority is a contempt and punishable as such. Regina v. Gray, [1900] 2 Q.B. 36 at 40, applied.\nTo say to the Court that the administration of justice will not be served if a particular member of the Court sits on an appeal that is about to be argued, without giving any reasonable explanation of the statement, constitutes a punishable contempt of the Court. APPEARANCE in answer to an order of the Court calling on a barrister to show cause why he should not be adjudged in contempt.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice (orally):\u2014In pursuance of an order of December 2, 1957, the above-named Lewis Duncan appeared to show cause why he should not be adjudged in contempt of this Court for a certain statement attributed to him on November 18, 1957. On that date Mr. Duncan appeared as counsel for the appellant in an appeal before this Court of Lahay v. Brown and when the appeal was called for hearing Mr. Duncan said:\nIn my opinion, the administration of justice would not be served by Mr. Justice Locke sitting on this appeal. It is in the interest of my client and in my personal interest that Mr. Justice Locke should withdraw.\nTo-day Mr. Duncan did not admit that he used those words, but there is no doubt in the minds of those members of the Court who were then present (leaving aside Mr. Justice Locke), and it is made quite clear by the evidence given before us to-day by Mr. W. K. Campbell and Mr. W. Boss, that he did use them. In any event, in our opinion the words which Mr. Duncan to-day asserted that he had used on the previous occasion* do not differ in substance from those set out above.\nOn November 18, upon that statement having been made, Mr. Justice Locke said: \"Why, for what reason?\", and Mr. Duncan declined to give any reason. The Chief Justice asked Mr. Duncan: \"Is that all you have to say?\", to which the reply was \"Yes\". There was then no suggestion that Mr. Justice Locke was or had been at any time concerned in the appeal of Lahay v. Brown, or that he knew either of the parties or any of the witnesses, or that there was any feeling of animosity by him against Mr. Duncan personally. Upon reconvening after a recess on November 18, the Chief Justice announced:\nThe Court has considered the unprecedented situation which has arisen. None of us knows of any reason for the remarkable statement earlier this morning and no reason has been advanced. The Court, therefore, proposes to continue.\nMr. Justice Locke then said:\nI have something to say, however. I do not know you, Mr. Duncan. I have never had anything to do with you in my life. I have no feeling of any kind towards you. I know nothing about the case we are about to hear, but, since you have chosen to take this stand, I decline to sit in this case. I withdraw.\nThe Court deemed it advisable that the parties to the appeal should not suffer in any way by reason of what had occurred and, accordingly, the hearing of the appeal was commenced and completed with another member of the Court replacing Mr. Justice Locke.\nThe objection taken by Mr. Duncan to our jurisdiction to cite him for contempt has no foundation. By the provisions of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 259, this Court is a common law and equity Court of record and its power to cite and, in proper circumstances, find a barrister guilty of contempt of Court for words uttered in its presence is beyond question. That power has been exercised for many years and it is not necessary that steps be taken immediately.\nAlthough, as has been pointed out, Mr. Duncan made no such suggestions on November 18, to-day he avers that over 30 years ago he was concerned in a certain matter; that another member of the bar took umbrage at a certain action taken by him; that later that member of the bar became a partner of Mr. Locke, as he then was, and that he, Mr. Duncan, felt that the latter, as a result of his association with the other member, had an \"antipathy\" to him, to use his own words, that he was of opinion that that antipathy was exhibited by Mr. Justice Locke in an appeal of Lacarte v. Board of Education of Toronto in 19551. It is to be observed that in that case the five members of the panel including Mr. Justice Locke were unanimous in dismissing the appeal of the appellant, for whom Mr. Duncan appeared. While he did not mention it, it should also be pointed out that in an earlier appeal, Maynard v. Maynard in 19512, in which Mr. Duncan appeared for the appellant, the Court, of which Mr. Justice Locke was a member, was unanimous in dismissing that appeal. We consider the suggestions made by Mr. Duncan this morning too preposterous to require elaboration.\nMr. Duncan says finally that in Kennedy v. The Queen, which was a motion for leave to appeal to this Court, and on which Mr. Justice Locke was one of a panel of three, he, Mr. Duncan, through an agent had failed to secure leave to appeal. He therefore considered, he said, that this was a confirmation of the feeling he had that Mr. Justice Locke was biased as regards himself. We are all of opinion that this suggestion is too trivial to require further consideration.\nThere is no doubt that a counsel owes a duty to his client, but he also has an obligation to conduct himself properly before any Court in Canada. That applies particularly to one who, like Mr. Duncan, has been practising for many years and who has had an extensive experience in the Courts of Ontario and in this Court. It has been stated by Lord Russell of Killowen C.J. in Regina v. Gray3, that judges and Courts are alike open to criticism, and if reasonable argument or expostulation is offered against any judicial act as contrary to law or the public good, no Court could or would treat that as contempt of Court. However, Lord Russell had already pointed out that any act done calculated to bring a Court into contempt or to lower its authority is a contempt of Court and belongs to that category which Lord Chancellor Hardwicke had as early as 1742 characterized as \"scandalising a Court or a judge\"4. The matter is put succintly in the 3rd edition of Halsbury, vol. 8 (1954), at p. 5:\nThe power to fine and imprison for a contempt committed in the face of the court is a necessary incident to every court of justice. It is a contempt of any court of justice to disturb and obstruct the court by insulting it in its presence and at a time when it is actually sitting \u2026 It is not from any exaggerated notion of the dignity of individuals that insults to judges are not allowed, but because there is imposed upon the court the duty of preventing brevi manu any attempt to interfere with the administration of justice. We have considered the cases cited by Mr. Duncan but we think it necessary to refer only to Cottle v. Cottle5. It was there held that it was not necessary to show that a justice of the peace was in fact biased, and there was sufficient evidence upon which the husband there in question might reasonably have formed the impression that that justice could not give the case an unbiased hearing. The case was, therefore, remitted for a new trial before a bench of which that justice was not a member. There, however, it might be pointed out that the husband took a specific objection to Mr. Browning sitting as chairman of the Bath justices. Here there was no suggestion at the time of any specific objection and it was only to-day that the matters referred to above were brought forward by Mr. Duncan and, as to these, we have already expressed our opinion that not only is there no substance to them, but the bringing forward of them at this time is a continuation and an aggravation of the contempt of Court of which we now unanimously find Mr. Duncan guilty.\nThe members of the Court now available, omitting Mr. Justice Locke, have no doubt that what was said by Mr. Duncan on November 18, 1957, was deliberate and that there is no basis in fact or law for his statements. It was calculated to bring the Court and a member thereof into contempt and to lower its authority and we so find. We, therefore, fine Mr. Duncan the sum of $2,000, to be paid to the Registrar of this Court on or before Friday, December 13, 1957. In default of payment he is to be imprisoned by the Sheriff of the County of Carleton in the common gaol of the said county, to be there confined for a period of 60 days unless the fine be sooner paid. Furthermore, unless and until he personally apologizes unreservedly in open. Court for the statements made by him on November 18 of this year he is prohibited from appearing in this Court or in chambers.\nJudgment accordingly.\n* These words were as follows:\n\"With great respect to all members of the Court I object to the proceedings before this panel while Mr. Justice Locke is a member.\n\"As I understand it, the administration of justice requires that justice be administered in fact, but also that it be so administered that it is patent to all that it is being administered.\n\"And thirdly, so long as Mr. Justice Locke remains a member of this panel I will not be satisfied nor will my client that justice is being administered.\"\n1 [1955] 5 D.L.R. 369.\n2 [1951] S.C.R. 346, [1951] 1 D.L.R. 241.\n3 [1900] 2 Q.B. 36 at 40.\n4 Re Read and Huggonson (The St. James's Evening Post Case) (1742), 2 Atk. 469, 26 E.R. 683.\n5 [1939] 2 All E.R. 535.\n",

While the repairs were under way, a fire broke out, caused by the use of an acetylene torch by the defendant's employees in close proximity to a highly inflammable cleansing fluid. This cleansing fluid had been bought by the plaintiff and left lying on the top of a tank near which the defendant's employees were working, and the defendant's officers and employees had been specially engaged to pump out this fluid but had left a quantity of it lying on the top of the tank.\nHeld: The defendant alone was responsible for the fire and the consequent damage. The evidence revealed that it was negligent in not taking the elementary precautions that a prudent man would have taken in similar circumstances. Having a wide experience in the repairing and cleansing of ships, the defendant knew or should have known that this particular fluid was inflammable. It was not the plaintiff which undertook to flush out the fluid and the ordering of this fluid for use on the ship did not constitute fault or a direct cause of the fire, particularly in view of the fact that it was to be handled and used by people who represented themselves as experts. Grobstein v. Leonard, [1943] Que. K.B. 731 at 735; Gibson & Co. et al. v. Grangemouth Dockyard Company, Ltd. (1927), 27 Lloyd, L.R. 338 at 340, 344, quoted with approval.\nAPPEALS from two judgments of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1 on appeal from a judgment of Smith J. Appeals dismissed.\nThe action was for damages resulting from a fire that originated in a manner described in the reasons for judgment. The trial judge found both parties equally at fault and awarded the plaintiff one-half of the damages assessed. Both parties appealed and the Court of Queen's Bench, holding the defendant entirely at fault, allowed the plaintiff's appeal, awarding it the full amount of the damages, and dismissed the defendant's appeal. The defendant appealed from both judgments. A. M. Watt, Q.C., and Lucien Tremblay, Q.C., for the defendant, appellant.\nR. C. Holden, Q.C., for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTaschereau J.:\u2014The respondent company, as assignee of Melan Shipping Company Limited, claims from the defendant-appellant a sum of $10,516.37. It is alleged in the declaration that on June 2, 1952, a fire occurred in the engine-room of the ship \"Anguslake\", on which the appellant company was effecting general repairs. As a result of the damages caused by the fire, the ship was detained and unable to operate for a period of 16\u00bd days, and the loss sustained was established at $10,516.37. This amount is not challenged. It is the contention of the plaintiff that the damage was caused by the fault, negligence, imprudence and want of care and of skill of the defendant company and its employees, in the performance of the work for which they were employed.\nMr. Justice Smith of the Superior Court, sitting at Montreal, reached the conclusion that the responsibility must be shared equally by both parties, and gave judgment in plaintiff's favour for $5,158.93. Both parties appealed, and the Court of Queen's Bench allowed the appeal of the present respondent, awarded the full amount claimed and dismissed the cross-appeal of J. & R. Weir, Limited. We have to deal here with the two appeals.\nBefore this Court, two points were raised. It was first argued that the ship belonged to an English firm, the Melan Shipping Company Limited, a parent company, having its head office in London, England, and that there was no relationship giving rise to an action between the two parties. But it has been shown that the English firm has been paid in full by the present respondent, which is now the assignee of all the rights of the owner of the ship. (Civil Code, arts. 1570-1582). During the argument, the Court disposed of this contention and informed Mr. Holden, counsel for respondent, that it was not necessary to hear him on this point.\nIt was also argued that the respondent did not discharge the burden of proving the negligence alleged in the declaration, that the cause of the fire was due to an inflammable degreasing fluid, purchased by the respondent, and dumped on to the tank tops by its own officers, who should have known that it was inflammable and who did know that appellant's employees would be burning there the next day. And it was further argued that the appellant in the circumstances took all reasonable precautions for the safe performance of its work.\nThe facts may be summarized as follows. While the \"Anguslake\" was laid up for general overhaul and repairs, it was decided by the respondent that the condenser and some other equipment in the engine-room should be degreased and cleaned. For that purpose, J. S. Porteous, respondent's engineer superintendent, requested the services of Magnus Chemicals Limited, which used a special degreaser called \"magnusol\". One week before the fire, Magnus Chemicals started the work, using one part of magnusol mixed with six parts of kerosene, which is an inflammable liquid. Three hundred gallons of the mixture were put into the condenser, where it was circulated for some days, and then pumped over into the feed filter tank, or hot well, where water was added by hose. The mixture was then pumped and circulated between the hot well and the feed filter, and on Sunday, June 1, it was drained out onto the tank top.\nThe defendant-appellant specially pleads that on or about Saturday, May 31, it was engaged by the plaintiff-respondent \"to drain the cleaning fluid out of the condenser and hot well into the sump in the tank top forming the bottom of the ship, whence the said fluid was to be pumped overside\". (The italics are mine.) The appellant also adds in its plea that this work was carried out on Sunday, June 1, by some of its own employees under the supervision of engineer superintendent Mr. Porteous. One of appellant's employees, Buchan, who was in charge, under Benson, of the work appellants were doing on the \"Anguslake\", said that they were there on Sunday specially to circulate the mixture and get rid of it.\nIt is in evidence that the mixture was not all pumped out on Sunday, and Benson, one of the vice-presidents of the appellant and in charge of the repairs, testified as follows:\nQ. How much did you leave in? A. Lying on the tank top would be 3 or 4 inches covering the full area down to nothing just astern of the boilers.\n(The italics are mine.) Saturday before the fire, one of the appellant's employees, Jourdain, had been burning out bolts near the tank top with an acetylene torch in the engine room, in order to remove a light steel screen bulkhead. He returned on Monday morning to continue his work. He was lying on the floor-plates which had been pushed back, leaving a space of about 8 to 10 inches between the engine-room floor and the bulkhead, and he was operating from there, his torch burning down near the tank top.\nThere can be no doubt, and it is the conclusion of the lower Courts, that it is while in the process of this operation, that the torch ignited the residue of the magnusol which was on the tank top, and which had not been completely removed the previous day.\nI do not think that appellant can escape liability. The evidence reveals that it was negligent in not taking the elementary necessary precautions that a prudent man should have taken in similar circumstances. It was indeed negligence, entailing liability, for the appellant which had been specially engaged to remove the magnusol and to pump it overside, to leave, Sunday night, lying on the tank top over the whole area, a substantial quantity of this inflammable liquid, and to allow its employee, Jourdain, Monday morning, to burn bolts with his acetylene torch in the very near vicinity. Knowing through its employees, of the presence of the fluid, the appellant should have seen that this liquid was completely removed before the burning operations were resumed.\nHaving a wide experience in the repairing and cleaning of ships, the appellant knew, or should have known, that magnusol mixed with kerosene is an inflammable liquid, exhaling an odour which Benson, the appellant's employee, detected and which naturally would arouse one's suspicions as to the dangerous nature of the material employed.\nThe learned trial judge reached the conclusion that both parties were at fault and apportioned the damages that resulted from the fire. He reached the conclusion that the defendant-appellant knew or should have known of the presence and nature of this inflammable mixture, and should not have operated the acetylene torch where it was operated without first having taken all reasonable precautions to avoid the possibility of fire. He thought, however, that the plaintiff, which selected the said degreasing compound, \"was also guilty of negligence for having failed to diligently and thoroughly clean the said tank top of the mixture, or at least warn the defendant of its presence there\".\nI entirely agree with the statement of the learned trial judge when he says that the appellant is at fault because its servants failed to take all reasonable precautions against fire, by permitting its employee to operate the acetylene torch at a place and in the manner he did without having taken all reasonable precautions. However, with respect, I do not agree with his conclusion that the plaintiff-respondent also contributed to the accident. It was not the respondent which undertook to flush off the material from the tank top, but it was the employees of the appellant who performed that work, for which they were specially engaged on the Sunday previous to the fire. If Porteous, the respondent's representative who was present at the cleaning operation, knew that some material had been left on the tank top, it was unnecessary for him to tell Benson, who was in charge of the operation, and who said that on Sunday night he left on the tank top between 3 and 4 inches of this inflammable mixture.\nIn cases of contributory negligence, the existence of a fault attributable to the victim must be examined and determined according to the same principles applied in establishing the fault of the author of a delict or of a quasi-delict. One of the main elements to be considered is a link between the fault and the resulting damage. It is imperative that the damage sustained be the direct consequence of the fault which has been committed. I see this necessary link in the conduct of the appellant's employees, but I fail to see that the fact that the respondent had ordered the magnusol on board its ship, was a direct cause of the fire, particularly in view of the fact that this mixture was to be handled and used by people representing themselves as experts in the matter. As to the alleged negligence in that the appellant was not warned of the presence of this mixture, I do not see that it is founded in law. I know of no law that compels a person to tell a third party a fact of which he is already aware, and which holds him liable in case of damages, if he fails to do so. I entirely concur in the views expressed by Mr. Justice E. M. McDougall in the case of Grobstein v. Leonard2, where he says:\nA skilled artisan who lights a fire in premises upon which he is working must be bound to know the conditions prevailing. He must assure himself of all the prerequisites to the successful and safe accomplishment of what he sets out to do. Here, admittedly, he took no precautions whatever, closed his eyes to obvious risks, and proceeded to do something to which he was not directly bound. Does it lie in his mouth to disclaim negligence merely on the statement that he did not know?\nIn Gibson & Co. et al. v. Grangemouth Dockyard Company, Ltd.3, Lord Fleming, at pp. 340, 344, expresses identical views:\nThe first question to be considered is whether the pursuers have proved that the fire was caused by sparks or particles of molten metal from the oxyacetylene machine \u2026\nIn this case the machine was used for the purpose of removing metal and not for the purpose of welding. When used for the purpose of removing or cutting away material, there are two well-recognized stages in the process. The blow-pipe of the machine has a nozzle with two orifices, an annular one and a central one within the annular. Through the annular orifice a mixture of acetylene and oxygen at a comparatively low pressure passes, which, when lighted, gives a flame with a high temperature of about 2500 deg. Fahr. This flame is applied to the metal to be removed and gives it the necessary heat. When the operator judges that this stage has been reached, he then opens the central orifice through which a supply of pure oxygen at high pressure flows. The supply of pure oxygen raises the flame to a very high temperature and causes the metal to combust and blows it away in glowing sparks \u2026\nThe defenders, however, contend that the pursuers, and in particular the shipowners, are debarred from recovering damages because they contributed by their own negligence to the happening of the fire. It was suggested that there was a duty on the shipowners to inform the defenders of the nature of the cargo that was being loaded in No. 2 hold and also to take precautions for the safety of the cargo.\nI think, however, that on the contrary it was the duty of the defenders, before they used a machine which gave off sparks, to ascertain whether there was any cargo in the vicinity of their operations which was likely to be damaged by it and to take the necessary precautions to protect it. Further, in point of fact, the man in charge of the squad and the operator knew that jute was being loaded in No. 2 hold for at least an hour or so before the fire actually took place.\n* * *\nI shall accordingly pronounce a finding that the defenders are liable for the loss and damage sustained by the pursuers in consequence of the fire which took place on the steamship Grangemouth on Apr. 24, 1925. I cannot escape the conclusion that the appellant is the only party responsible for this accident, and I would therefore dismiss both appeals with costs throughout.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nAttorneys for the defendant, appellant: Foster, Hannen, Watt, Leggat & Colby, Montreal.\nAttorneys for the plaintiff, respondent: Reward, Holden, Hutchison, Cliff, McMaster & Meighen, Montreal.\n1 [1957] Que.

This is true notwithstanding the fact that the mother has signed a consent to the adoption of the infant if, at the time she seeks the custody, the adoption has not yet been completed.

Maat et al, [1957] S.C.R. 606, applied.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, reversing a judgment of Wilson J. Appeal dismissed.\nJ.D. Pickup, Q.C., for the respondents, appellants.\nP.B.C. Pepper and H.W. Rowan, for the applicant, respondent. THE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014There is no question but that the appellants are fit and proper persons to have the custody of the child and that they would bring it up in a proper and becoming manner, giving it advantages that the child\u2019s mother may not be able to afford and continuing to extend to it that love and affection which they have shown to it up to the present time.\nI have read the entire record and have considered everything advanced by counsel on behalf of the appellants. After anxious consideration, I agree with the reasons for judgment of a unanimous Court of Appeal, to which I have nothing to add, except to mention the argument that that Court was not justified in interfering with the trial judge\u2019s discretion. Reference was made to the judgment of the Judicial Committee in McKee v. McKee[1], where it is stated at p. 360:\nFurther, it was not, and could not be, disputed that the question of custody of an infant is a matter which peculiarly lies within the discretion of the judge who hears the case and has the opportunity generally denied to an appellate tribunal of seeing the parties and investigating the infant\u2019s circumstances, and that his decision should not be disturbed unless he has clearly acted on some wrong principle or disregarded material evidence.\nThe general rule there set forth is well known and understood, but difficulties may arise in applying it, as is evidenced by the conflict of judicial opinion in the McKee case in the Ontario Courts and in this Court. Bearing in mind this rule, I have come to the conclusion that the Court of Appeal was justified, for the reasons given by it, in allowing the appeal to it.\nI would dismiss the appeal and, in accordance with the agreement of counsel, without costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.:\u2014I fully agree with the reasons of Mr. Justice Roach who delivered the unanimous opinion of the Court of Appeal[2].\nAlthough I am convinced that the appellants are proper and fit persons to care for the child, no grounds for the disqualification of the mother to his custody have been shown to my satisfaction. Having regard to the welfare of this child, and being convinced of the ability of the mother to educate and support him in proper surroundings, I do not think that her wishes should be disregarded.\nI would dismiss the appeal without costs.\nRAND J.:\u2014I agree with the reasoning and conclusion of my brother Cartwright and have only a paragraph to add.\nHere, as in the case of Hepton et al v. Maat et al[3], there is the disturbing circumstance of a concealment of the child\u2019s whereabouts notwithstanding that, within a month and a half of its being handed over to the foster parents, the welfare agency, and within six months, those parents, knew the mother was seeking its return. It must, I think, be recognized that for the period of at least one year the transferred custody is provisional; until an order of adoption is made there is no obligation on the foster parents to keep the child nor on the part of the parent or parents to acquiesce in the new relationship. The consent of the latter to adoption may, by an order of the Court, be dispensed with, but until that is done there is always the possibility of the child\u2019s return. In that situation an aggravation of the conditions that would surround that possibility is to be highly deprecated. If the provisional character of the period is fully appreciated then the breaking of any ties between the child and the persons seeking adoption will cause them much less distress. More important, however, is the possible temporary effect upon the child. It would seem to me to be obvious good sense that once the issue is raised it should be disposed of as quickly as possible. If the welfare of the child is in reality the object of the social organizations and the parties desiring to adopt, under the existing statutory provisions there will be no delay in facilitating that determination.\nLOCKE J.:\u2014In Re Baby Duffell; Martin and Martin v. Duffell[4], it was decided by this Court that the consent of an unmarried mother to the adoption of her child may be revoked by her at any time prior to the making of an adoption order under the provisions of The Adoption Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 218, and that the consent referred to in s. 3 is one which is effective as of the date of the application. In that case, our brother Cartwright stated the law in the following terms (p. 746):\nIn the present state of the law as I understand it, giving full effect to the existing legislation, the mother of an illegitimate child, who has not abandoned it, who is of good character and is able and willing to support it in satisfactory surroundings, is not to be deprived of her child merely because on a nice balancing of material and social advantages the Court is of opinion that others, who wish to do so, could provide more advantageously for its upbringing and future. The wishes of the mother must, I think, be given effect unless \u201cvery serious and important\u201d reasons require that, having regard to the child\u2019s welfare, they must be disregarded.\nIn Hepton et al. v. Maat et al.[5], a case relating to a child born in wedlock, Cartwright J. stated the law in similar terms.\nIn the interval between the disposition of these two cases, the case of McKee v. McKee[6], was decided by the Judicial Committee on an appeal taken from a judgment of this Court[7]. In that case Lord Simonds said in part (p. 365):\nIt is the law of Ontario (as it is the law of England) that the welfare and happiness of the infant is the paramount consideration in questions of custody;\u2026 To this paramount consideration all others yield.\nThis, in my opinion, states the rule in more positive terms than it was stated in the judgment of Viscount Cave in Ward v. Laverty et al.[8]\nIt must be taken that this passage from the judgment of the Judicial Committee in McKee\u2019s Case was considered by the majority of the Court in Hepton\u2019s Case and that they were of the opinion that it did not represent any change in what had been decided to be the law in Duffell\u2019s Case.\nIn the present matter the rights of the parties are, in my opinion, to be tested as of the time in February 1956 when the writ of habeas corpus was issued at the instance of the respondent. At that time the infant child was 14 months old. I have examined with care the evidence given in this case and, while of the opinion that the child would be more likely to have a successful and happy life if left in the custody of the appellants, I have come, with regret, to the con- clusion that, applying the rule as stated in the decisions of this Court in the cases of Duffell and Hepton, it has not been shown that the mother should be refused custody.\nI would, accordingly, dismiss this appeal. I would make no order as to costs.\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[9], allowing an appeal from a judgment of Wilson J.[10] and directing that the appellants deliver the infant Donald Cletus Agar into the custody of the respondent at the city of Toronto.\nCounsel for the appellants in the course of a full and able argument put forward everything that could be said in support of the appeal. Since the hearing I have had an opportunity of considering the entire record and having done so I find myself so fully in accord with the reasons of Roach J.A., who delivered the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal9, that I simply express my agreement with his reasons and conclusion.\nCounsel stated that, whatever the result of the appeal, the parties did not ask for costs. I would therefore dismiss the appeal without costs.\nAppeal dismissed without costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Fasken, Robertson, Aitchison, Pickup & Calvin, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the respondent: McMillan, Binch, Stuart, Berry, Dunn, Corrigan & Howland, Toronto.\n[1] [1951] A.C. 352, [1951] 1 All E.R. 942, [1951] 2 D.L.R. 657.\n[2] [1957] O.R. 359, 8 D.L.R.

Although it is well established by the authorities that a party relying upon allegations of fraud must plead them with precision, the rule does not go so far as to require that a plaintiff\u2019s action be dismissed if the misrepresentation on which he relies is pleaded as an oral one while the evidence at the trial proves that misrepresentation, but made in writing. If every fact necessary to make up the cause of action for deceit is pleaded, and the variance between the pleading and proof cannot have resulted in the defendant failing to call evidence that he would otherwise have adduced, or prejudiced him in any way in the conduct of his defence, the plaintiff is entitled to succeed.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], reversing a judgment of Barlow J. Appeal dismissed.\nJ.J. Robinette, Q.C., for the defendants, appellants.\nE.G. Black, Q.C., for the plaintiffs, respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1, setting aside a judgment of Barlow J. and directing judgment to be entered in favour of the respondents for damages to be assessed by the Master. Counsel agree that the amount in controversy in the appeal exceeds $2,000.\nThe action is for damages for deceit.\nOn March 18, 1954, the respondents signed an offer in writing to exchange certain properties owned by them for a summer hotel property owned by the appellants at a valuation of $35,000. The offer was accepted on March 30, 1954. The contract was carried out in due course and the respondents took possession of the hotel property on May 1, 1954. They carried on the hotel business from that date until the commencement of their action on November 14, 1954.\nThe misrepresentation relied on by the respondents was pleaded in para. 3 of the statement of claim as follows:\n3. Prior to the making of the said offer by the plaintiffs, the defendants each represented to the plaintiffs, orally, that the business done by them in the year 1953 in the Rice Lake House at Gore\u2019s Landing amounted to $16,000. This representation was made by the defendants for the purpose of inducing the plaintiffs to make an offer, was false to the knowledge of the defendants, and was relied upon by the plaintiffs and was one of the principal reasons that the plaintiffs made the said offer.\nLaidlaw J.A. delivered the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal. After a careful review of the evidence and giving full weight to the opinion of the learned trial judge as to the credibility of certain witnesses, he made findings of fact which in my opinion are correct. These may be summarized as follows:\nThe appellants employed one Anderson as their agent to find a purchaser for the hotel property. The appellant Mrs. Junkin, acting for her husband, the other appellant, as well as for herself, told Anderson that the gross revenue from the hotel business was approximately $16,000 and the net profit after paying expenses approximately $9,700. Mrs. Junkin intended that this information should be given by Anderson to prospective purchasers as an inducement to make an offer. The information was false, and Mrs. Junkin knew it was false. Anderson gave this information to the respondents in writing on March 7, 1954. The respondents relied upon it and were induced by it to make their offer to purchase. The respondents suffered damages in that the value of the hotel and equipment was less than the price which the respondents were induced by the false representation to agree to pay. It should be mentioned that there is no suggestion that Anderson knew of the falsity of the representation or was in any way a party to the fraud practised upon the respondents.\nAccepting, as I do, the findings of fact made by the Court of Appeal briefly summarized above, it would appear that the appeal must fail unless the point taken by Mr. Robinette as to the form of the pleadings is fatal to the respondents\u2019 case.\nWhile all the findings of fact set out above were supported by the evidence, the respondents both testified that they were induced to make their offer by oral representations made to them by the appellants personally on March 14, 1954, which were identical with those made in writing by Anderson. The learned trial judge found that the respondents were mistaken in this evidence and that the oral representations, if made, were made not on March 14 but on March 28, after the offer had been made. Mr. Robinette referred to several decisions in which it has been held that a party relying upon allegations of fraud must plead them with precision. In Bell v. Macklin[2], Strong C.J. said at pp. 583-4:\nIn pleading fraud parties are still, notwithstanding the laxity in pleading which seems now to some extent to be countenanced by the Judicature Act, bound to more than ordinary exactitude, (see observations of Fry J. in Redgrave v. Hurd, 20 Ch.D.1.) and if there were not more substantial grounds for maintaining the judgment under appeal it might be worth while to inquire whether a plaintiff could be entitled to relief in a case charging fraud, when his own statement on oath varies so materially from his pleading as we find it does here.\nThe observation of Fry J. to which the learned Chief Justice referred appears at 20 Ch.D. pp. 5-6. That was an action for specific performance of a contract to purchase a house. The defence was that the defendant had been induced to sign the contract by misrepresentation and there was a counterclaim for damages. Counsel for the plaintiff said in argument:\nThe defence is that the contract was induced by misrepresentation. The misrepresentations relied upon ought to be specifically stated in the pleadings\u2026 The Judicature Act has made no difference in this respect.\nand Fry J. observed:\nI do not think the Judicature Act affects such a question as this, because it is only fair play between man and man that the Plaintiff should know what is charged against him.\nIn Graham Sanson & Co. v. Ramsay[3], Masten J., as he then was, speaking for the majority of the Appellate Division, said at p. 79:\nBy our Rules (see 141 and 143) fraud is not to be alleged generally, but the particular matters constituting the fraud must be specifically alleged. These Rules should be taken to apply to every misrepresentation, whether innocent or fraudulent.\nIn Washburn v. Wright[4], Riddell J., as he then was, delivering the unanimous judgment of the Appellate Division, said at p. 144:\nThe learned Judge has found fraud, in my opinion wrongly. No fraud is charged; the itemised statement is set up by the statement of defence as a defence, and this is not met by a plea of fraud. We have recently said: \u201cIt is not too much to require any one who intends to charge another with fraud\u2026to take the responsibility of making that charge in plain terms\u201d\u2026and the person making the charge is confined to the particular fraud charged. At p. 145 the learned judge added:\nNothing further is said about fraud during the trial, and it is obvious, I think, that the question of fraud was not gone into at all.\nNotwithstanding all this, if the facts proved established fraud, we might now allow an \u2018amendment, and, if all the facts were before the Court, permit the finding of fraud to stand, or, if all the facts were not or might not be before the Court, direct a new trial.\nI have no wish to suggest any doubt as to the accuracy of any of these statements but, in my opinion, they are not applicable to the circumstances of the case at bar. The weight of the charge made by the respondents against the appellants in the case before us is that the latter tricked the former into offering $35,000 for the hotel property by the representation, false to the knowledge of the appellants, that the business done by them in the year 1953 in the hotel amounted to $16,000. Every fact necessary to make up the cause of action for deceit was pleaded and I have already indicated my agreement with the finding of Laidlaw J.A. that every such fact was proved. What is urged for the appellants is that while the respondents proved the making of the very representation pleaded their action cannot be maintained because in their pleading they stated it was made orally but by their evidence they proved it was made in writing.\nIf it appeared that this variance between the pleading and the proof could have resulted in the appellants failing to call evidence which they would otherwise have adduced, or that it prejudiced them in any way in the conduct of their defence, it might well be that the judgment could not stand and that the question whether a new trial should be ordered would arise; but, in my opinion, in the particular circumstances of this case the variance was immaterial and caused no prejudice to the defence.\nIn his reasons the learned trial judge does not refer to this question of pleading but does deal with the representation made by Anderson. He says in part:\nThe plaintiffs allege that one Anderson, whom they allege was the agent of the defendants, on the 7th March 1954 gave them a statement showing gross earnings of the hotel during 1953 of $16,000, and a net profit of about $9,700.\nHis reasons for rejecting the respondents\u2019 claim, so far as it was based on this allegation, proceed not on the form of the pleadings but on his view that the evidence did not satisfy him, (i) that the representation was false, or (ii) that Anderson was the agent of the appellants. Laidlaw J.A. took a different view of the effect of the evidence on these two points and, as already stated, I agree with his findings. The learned justice of appeal makes no mention in his reasons of the point of pleading and it is a reasonable inference that either it was not raised or he regarded it as immaterial. In my opinion, no amendment of the pleadings is now necessary.\nIt was argued that the respondents failed to prove damage but I agree with the Court of Appeal that damage was shown and that in the circumstances of this case the proper course was to direct a reference. The reasons of Laidlaw J.A. state correctly the principles to be applied in assessing the damages.\nFor the reasons given by Laidlaw J.A. and those set out above, I would dismiss the appeal with costs, with the usual provisions as to a married woman in the case of the appellant Yetta Junkin.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the defendants, appellants: H.M.

(Defendants) Respondents.\n1957: December 9; 1957: December, 19.\nPresent: Kerwin C.J. and Rand, Cartwright, Fauteux and Abbott JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA.\nAppeals\u2014Right of appeal\u2014Amount in dispute\u2014Effect of pleadings\u2014The Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 98, s. 82. The mere fact that the plaintiff in an action in the Exchequer Court for infringement of copyright claims more than $500 in damages is not sufficient to give a right of appeal to the Supreme Court. Such a pleading does not of itself establish that \"the actual amount in controversy\" in the appeal exceeds $500 within the meaning of s. 82 of the Exchequer Court Act. McNea and McNea v. The Township of Salt-fleet, [1955] S.C.R. 827, applied.\nMOTION by the respondents to quash an appeal from a judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada1. Appeal quashed.\nThe action was for infringement of copyright through the use of a reproducing machine in a tea-room in Toronto. The defendant company furnished and serviced the reproducing equipment and the individual defendants were the proprietors of the tea-room in question.\nThe plaintiff claimed declarations, injunctions and \"the sum of $525.00 damages, or such further sum as this Court may see fit to allow\". The trial judge dismissed the action with costs, and the plaintiff appealed.\nIn support of the motion to quash, the respondents filed an affidavit, parts of which are summarized in the reasons for judgment. The appellant filed an affidavit of W. S. Low, General Manager of the appellant company, containing the following paragraphs:\n2. The Plaintiff claims in this action the sum of $525 damages. No evidence was tendered at the trial in respect of the quantum of damages for the reason that in more than 120 actions for damages for infringement of copyright brought by the Appellant in the Exchequer Court of Canada, a minority of which have come to trial, damages have not been assessed at trial or on motion for judgment, but have been the subject of a reference to the Registrar or Deputy Registrar of the said Court.\n3. The Defendants in this action have continuously since the filing of the statement of claim infringed the Appellant's copyrights by continuing to perform in public music the sole right to perform which in public in Canada is the property of the Appellant, and the Defendant Company is engaged in activities similar to those carried on at the premises in question in this action in numerous locations in the City of Toronto and elsewhere, and at such locations has in a similar manner continued to infringe the Appellant's copyrights.\n* * *\n6. The Appellant, as a result of observations made by its staff and applications for licence made to it, believes that devices similar to those in question in this appeal are used for public performance of music the sole right to perform which in public in Canada is the property of the Appellant by persons in Canada who would be liable to the Appellant for fees, according to the scale approved by the Copyright Appeal Board, in sums aggregating more than $125,000 per year.\nParagraph 4 of the affidavit gave particulars of an action brought by the appellant against other defendants where \"punitive damages\" of $1,200 were awarded in respect of \"infringements much less numerous than\" those established in this action.\nG. W. Ford, Q.C., for the defendants (respondents), applicants.\nM. B. K. Gordon, Q.C., for the plaintiff (appellant), contra.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014This is a motion by the defendants to quash for want of jurisdiction an appeal lodged by the plaintiff against the judgment of the Exchequer Court2 dismissing its action. The application is supported by the affidavit of Carlton F. McInnis showing the course of the trial and stating that the evidence offered by the plaintiff indicated that from March 11, 1955 to May 3, 1956, there were ten instances of recordings being played in the Superior Tea Room of the four musical works referred to in the statement of claim. The deponent believes that as between the plaintiff and the defendants the value of the amount in dispute is far less than $500.\nAn examination of the transcript of the proceedings before the Exchequer Court shows that on the argument before Mr. Justice Cameron counsel for the plaintiff drew the Court's attention to the fact that the statement of claim asked for $525 damages, \"or such further sum as this Court may see fit to allow\", and later said:\n\u2026 we are asking for $525 damages, which award would give the Defendants the right to go, as a matter of course, to the Supreme Court of Canada, \u2026 [this] is a fair and very modest request. We have no evidence to show how much of a profit was made out of this installation.\nIn McNea and McNea v. The Township of Saltfleet3, we said:\nVery often the allegations of fact set forth in a statement of claim and the amount claimed may be sufficient to show that the amount or value of the matter in controversy in an appeal exceeds $2,000 within the meaning of s. 36 of the Supreme Court Act. It was there decided that, in the circumstances of that case as they were explained, the amount of damages asked for in the statement of claim could not be said to be any indication that the amount or value of the matter in controversy exceeded the stated sum.\nSimilarly in the present case, and notwithstanding the affidavit of Mr. Low, it cannot be said that the mere claim by the plaintiff for $525 damages, or a larger sum, is sufficient to show that the actual amount in controversy in the appeal exceeds $500 within the meaning of s. 82 of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 98. No opinion is expressed as to the damages that might be allowed if the plaintiff had succeeded.\nThe motion is, therefore, granted with costs.\nAppeal quashed.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant (respondent on the motion): Manning, Mortimer, Mundell & Bruce, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the defendants, respondents (applicants): Rogers & Rowland, Toronto.\n1 (1957), 16 Fox Pat, G. 194, 27 C.P.R. 141.\n2 (1957), 16 Fox Pat.

Subsequently, Montreal Tramways Company took over all the undertaking and rights of the Montreal Street Railway Company. By cl. 33 of the contract, it was provided that the company would pay one-half of the costs of ice and snow removal from the streets occupied by the tramway tracks; and by cl. 37, the Town had the right to expropriate the company's undertaking within its limits at the end of the 30 years, or of any subsequent 5-year period. The contract was amended in 1904 to extend the term of the franchise to 1934.\nIn 1918, a contract between the company and the City of Montreal was ratified by statute (8 Geo. V, c. 84), the company's franchise in the city of Montreal was replaced, and its term extended to 1953, but the franchise in the plaintiff municipality was not annulled. However, the right of the latter municipality to expropriate the undertaking was abrogated and given exclusively to the City of Montreal.\nUnder a statute of 1950, amended in 1951, the defendant Commission was established \"to organize, own, develop and administer a general system of public transportation for the benefit of the population of the City and of the Metropolitan District\", and the property and assets of the Montreal Tramways Company were vested in it.\nIn its action, the plaintiff municipality sought to recover one-half of the cost of snow removal for the period June 1951 to July 1952. The action was dismissed by the Superior Court and by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld (Rand and Cartwright JJ. dissenting): The appeal must be dismissed. The defendant was not bound by any conditions or obligations arising out of contracts previously in existence between the plaintiff and the Montreal Tramways Company. The statute creating the defendant Commission conferred upon it the right to operate in perpetuity a publicly-owned transportation system in the Montreal area, and that right was not made dependent upon any contractual rights theretofore existing between the Montreal Tramways Company and the various municipalities in the metropolitan area. The provisions of the preamble to the 1951 Act must be read into the City's by-law creating the Commission, even if they were not expressly enacted in it.\nPer Rand and Cartwright JJ., dissenting: The appeal should be allowed for the reasons stated by Rand J. in City of Outremont v. Montreal Transportation Commission, infra, p. 75.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, affirming the judgment of Salvas J.

Pour les raisons qu'il donne, je suis d'opinion que le pr\u00e9sent appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nJe d\u00e9sire seulement ajouter que la principale raison qui me porte \u00e0 arriver \u00e0 cette conclusion est que, m\u00eame si le contrat entre l'appelante et la Montreal Street Railway Company, devenue plus tard la Montreal Tramways Company, n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9teint et n'est pas devenu sans effet le 16 mai 1934, la loi autorisant la cr\u00e9ation de la Commission intim\u00e9e y a mis fin. L'obligation de payer le co\u00fbt de la moiti\u00e9 de l'enl\u00e8vement de la neige dans la cit\u00e9 de Westmount, n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 assum\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e, et depuis le 16 juin 1951, quand tous les droits de la Montreal Tramways Company ont \u00e9t\u00e9 acquis par l'intim\u00e9e, en vertu du statut 14 Geo. VI, c. 79, tel qu'amend\u00e9 par 14-15 Geo. VI, c. 124, l'entente pr\u00e9-existante a \u00e9t\u00e9 purg\u00e9e, quant \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e.\nLa Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, en vertu du statut de 1918, avait le droit d'exproprier le r\u00e9seau de la compagnie de tramways dans les limites de la cit\u00e9 de Westmount, et ce droit \u00e9tait ni\u00e9 \u00e0 toute autre municipalit\u00e9 y compris Westmount. Quand la Commission de Transport de Montr\u00e9al a \u00e9t\u00e9 form\u00e9e, en vertu du statut ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9, et que tout l'actif de la Montreal Tramways Company a \u00e9t\u00e9 transport\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e, il s'agissait \u00e9galement d'une expropriation, par l'op\u00e9ration de la loi, et je ne puis pas en arriver \u00e0 la conclusion que l'intim\u00e9e a plus d'obligation de payer la moiti\u00e9 du co\u00fbt de l'enl\u00e8vement de la neige, que n'en aurait eu la Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, si elle avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l'expropriation de la compagnie. Un nouvel \u00e9tat de choses a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9 en vertu duquel l'intim\u00e9e n'a que les obligations que lui impose le statut.\nThe judgment of Rand and Cartwright JJ. was delivered by\nRand J. (dissenting):\u2014The dispute in this appeal arises out of a by-law and contract granting a franchise to the predecessor in title of the respondent in terms almost identical with those considered in the appeals of the City of Outremont2, judgments in which are being delivered simultaneously with this.\nAs in the case of Outremont the grant, by s. 2 of the by-law, was of an exclusive franchise from August 1, 1892; and by s. 37 it was agreed that\n\u2026 the present arrangement or contract \u2026 shall extend over a period of 30 years from the 1st of August, 1892. At the expiration of the said term of 30 years, and at the expiration of every term of 5 years thereafter the Town shall have the right after notice\nto expropriate the property.\nSection 33 provided:\nThe Company shall, under instructions from the Town keep their track free from ice and snow and the Town may at its option remove the whole or such part of ice and snow from curb to curb, as it may see fit, from any street or part of street in which cars are running, including the snow from the roofs of houses, thrown or falling into the streets, and that removed from the sidewalks into the streets with the consent of the Town, and the Company shall be held to pay one half of the cost thereof.\nIt is under this section that the City claims against the respondent for one-half the cost of snow removal for the period June 16, 1951, to July 10, 1952; and the question is whether that claim can be maintained.\nAs in the appeals of Outremont, I construe the franchise to be indefinite in time but marked by certain terms at the end of which the City was entitled to assume ownership of the undertaking. Throughout this entire period the provisions of the by-law and the contract embodying them apply unless their force has been destroyed by subsequent legislation or they have expired according to their intent and meaning; that s. 33 by its own terms continues indefinitely with the franchise cannot be disputed. The Act 8 Geo. V., c. 84, has been examined in the Outremont appeals and, apart from the fact that the provision of the contract contained in schedule A was repealed by the legislation of 1951, there is no suggestion that it affects the question here.\nThere remain 14 Geo. VI., c 79, and 14-15 Geo. VI., c. 124. For the reasons given in the appeal of Outremont against the respondent3, that legislation has not the effect of impliedly nullifying the by-law and agreement here and the same result follows that the claim under s. 33 is well founded.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and direct judgment declaring the appellant to be entitled to recover from the respondent the amount claimed with costs throughout.\nThe judgment of Fauteux and Abbott JJ. was delivered by\nAbbott J.:\u2014For some sixty years prior to June 1951 the tramway system in the city of Montreal and the surrounding area was operated by the Montreal Tramways Company and its predecessor company, the Montreal Street Railway Company. These companies operated under various franchises granted by the City of Montreal and by certain other municipalities which included the former Town of C\u00f4te St. Antoine, now the City of Westmount. On June 16, 1951, all the property undertaking and rights of the Montreal Tramways Company were acquired by respondent under the authority of the statute 14 Geo. VI, c. 79, as amended by 14-15 Geo. VI, c. 124, and respondent has operated its tramway system in appellant's territory since the said date.\nAppellant's claim is for $20,475.55, representing one-half the cost of snow removal on certain streets in appellant's territory during the winter of 1951-52. Appellant claimed this amount under a specific provision of the franchise granted by the former Town of C\u00f4te St. Antoine under the authority of which it contends respondent is operating its tramways in the city of Westmount. The claim was submitted to the Superior Court in a stated case in accordance with the terms of art. 509 of the Code of Civil Procedure of the Province of Quebec. The present appeal is from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench4 confirming the judgment of the learned trial judge, the Honourable Mr. Justice Elie Salvas, which declared that respondent was not indebted to appellant in the amount claimed.\nThe terms and conditions of the franchise granted by the Town of C\u00f4te St. Antoine were set out in by-law 33 of the said Town, adopted August 7, 1893, and in a contract in almost identical terms between the Town and the Montreal Street Railway Company. The Town granted to the company the exclusive right; subject to specified conditions, to establish and operate lines of electric railway in particular streets in the municipality and the company undertook to establish and operate the lines of railway subject to the same conditions. The conditions to which the franchise was made subject were set out in the by-law, which contained forty-one sections, two of which, namely, s. 33 providing for payment by the company of one-half of the cost of removing ice and snow from the streets occupied by tramway tracks, and s. 37 providing for the term of the franchise, read as follows:\nSection 33. The Company shall, under instructions from the Town keep their track free from ice and snow and the Town may at its option remove the whole or such part of ice and snow from curb to curb, as it may see fit, from any street or part of street in which cars are running, including the snow from the roofs of houses, thrown or falling into the streets, and that removed from the sidewalks into the streets with the consent of the Town, and the Company shall be held to pay one half of the cost thereof.\nSection 37. It is agreed between the Town and said Company that the present arrangement or contract for the establishment and operation of the said electric railway shall extend over a period of thirty (30) years from the first of August, eighteen hundred and ninety-two (1892). At the expiration of the said term of thirty years, and at the expiration of every term of five years thereafter, the Town shall have the right after a notice of six months to the Company, to be given within the twelve months preceding the expiration of the said thirty years, and also after a like notice of six months at the end of every subsequent five years, to assume the ownership of the said railway and all its real estate, appurtenances, plant and vehicles belonging to the Company, situate in C\u00f4te St. Antoine, and necessary for the operation of its line on payment of their value to be determined by arbtirators, together with an additional ten per cent thereon, said arbitrators, to be appointed as follows. Viz: One by the Company, one by the Town, and third by a Judge of the Superior Court, sitting in and for the District of Montreal.\nThe franchise was amended and extended by by-law 144 of the Town of Westmount and by a contract between the Town and the company dated May 17, 1904. Aside from certain changes in the conditions of the original contract which are not relevant in the present appeal, the new by-law and contract extended the term of the franchise until May 17, 1934, but maintained in force the conditions set out in ss. 33 and 37 above quoted. Both by-law 33 and by-law 144, with the contracts implementing them, were ratified by the Quebec Legislature.\nUntil the passing of certain legislation in 1918, to which I shall refer in a moment, I am satisfied that under the provisions of s. 37 of the contract above quoted, in the event of the City of Westmount failing to exercise its right of expropriation on May 17, 1934, the respective rights and obligations of the parties under the contract were to continue for an indefinite period after that date, subject to termination by either party at its option in the following manner:\n(a) By the City of Westmount exercising its right of expropriation at the end of each five-year period subsequent to May 17, 1934, upon giving the notice called for in the contract;\n(b) By the tramways company, at the end of each such five-year period, failing expropriation by the City.\nThis position was changed, however, in 1918.\nOn January 28, 1918, the Montreal Tramways Company and the City of Montreal entered into a contract which was ratified by the statute 8 Geo. V, c. 84. The contract appears as Schedule A to the said Act. The company's franchise in the city of Montreal was expressly annulled and replaced, but the company's franchise in the city of Westmount was not annulled. Its conditions were modified in certain respects which are not relevant to the issue in this appeal but in addition the right of the City of Westmount to expropriate the company's undertaking within its limits was abrogated. The relevant sections of the 1918 statute (para. 8 of art. 92 and art. 95 of Schedule A) read as follows:\nArticle 92.\nParagraph 8. Expropriation.\nOn March twenty-fourth (24th) nineteen hundred and fifty-three (1953), and at the expiration of every subsequent five-years period, the City shall have the right, after six months notice given to the Company within the twelve months immediately preceding March twenty-fourth (24th) nineteen hundred and fifty-three (1953), and also after a similar notice of six months and on the same conditions at the end of each subsequent five-years period, to appropriate for itself the railway of the said company as well as the immoveables and dependencies, plant and cars belonging to it and necessary for the operation of the said railway, situate within and without the limits of the said City, by paying the value thereof, to be fixed by arbitrators, and ten per cent. (10%) over and above the estimate. Such arbitrators shall be appointed as follows: One by the City, one by the Company, and the third by a judge of the Superior Court sitting in and for the district of Montreal.\n* * *\nNo municipality other than the City shall have the right to purchase the railway system of the Company, in whole or in part.\nCONTRACTS WITH MUNICIPALITIES OUTSIDE OF THE CITY.\nArticle 95.\nAll the provisions of the contracts, compacts or agreements passed between the Company and any municipal corporation outside of the City, inconsistent with the provisions of this contract, shall be and shall remain without effect from the time of the coming into force of the present contract.\nAs I have stated, one effect of this statute was to take away from appellant the right of expropriation given to it under s. 37 of the franchise and to vest that right in the City of Montreal.\nThe City of Montreal had, of course, an obvious interest in the continued operation of the tramway system in the city of Westmount since that municipality is completely surrounded by the city of Montreal.\nIt cannot be assumed that the Legislature in granting this right of expropriation to the City of Montreal was granting an empty right. It would seem clear therefore that in passing the 1918 statute the Legislature intended that the right of the tramways company to operate in Westmount under its contract with that municipality and its obligations under that contract were to be continued until March 24, 1953, subject to termination (a) by the City of Montreal exercising its right of expropriation at that date or at the end of each five-year period thereafter, upon giving the requisite notice;\n(b) by the tramways company on March 24, 1953, or at the end of each five-year period thereafter failing expropriation by the City of Montreal.\nIt follows that up to June 11, 1951, the date upon which its assets were acquired by the Montreal Transportation Commission, the tramways company was operating in the city of Westmount in virtue of the contract of August 11, 1893 as amended, and was liable to the City for a share of the cost of snow removal as provided for in that contract. In fact as appears from the stated case the tramways company paid its share of the snow removal costs in accordance with s. 33 of by-law 33 up to the month of June 1951 when its assets were acquired by respondent but the latter has denied any liability therefor since that date.\nRespondent's liability for the amount claimed depends upon the effect to be given to the acquisition by respondent of the property and assets of the tramways company pursuant to the authority contained in the statute 14 Geo. VI, c. 79, as amended by 14-15 Geo. VI, c. 124.\nUnder the statute 14 Geo. VI, c. 79, assented to April 5, 1950, the Quebec Legislature authorized the City of Montreal by by-law to establish a corporation to be known as the Montreal Transportation Commission \"to organize, own, develop and administer a general system of public transportation for the benefit of the population of the City and of the Metropolitan District\".\nAs authorized by the said statute, the Commission was created in August 1950, by by-law 1981 of the City of Montreal. The by-law in fact recited all the relevant provisions of the statute 14 Geo. VI, c. 79, although in my opinion it was not necessary to do so in order to constitute the Commission a corporation with all the powers set forth in the statute.\nFrom the statute itself it seems clear that the Legislature conferred upon the Commission when established the right to operate in perpetuity a publicly-owned transportation system in the Montreal area, and in my opinion the right to do so was not made dependent upon any contractual rights theretofore existing between the Montreal Tramways Company and the various municipalities in the metropolitan area. This seems evident from the terms of s. 57, para. 3, as enacted by the Act 14-15 Geo. VI, c. 124, which reads as follows:\n57. Para. 3.\nIt [the Commission] may also, on its own authority, establish new lines, replace tramway lines by autobus or trolleybus lines, change their routes, and for any such purpose use any public street which it deems necessary or expedient in the territory of the city or of the metropolitan district.\nIt was argued on behalf of appellant that s. 57 as amended cannot apply to the Commission by reason of the fact that the amending provisions (which include para. 3) were not adopted by a by-law of the City but I do not think this contention is a valid one. Under the provisions of the original statute, it was declared (s. 2) that the by-law of the City creating the Commission should be \"subject to the following provisions\", and then followed ss. 3 to 61 inclusive relating to the Commission and its powers. The amending Act, 14-15 Geo. VI, c. 124, which is intituled \"An Act respecting the Montreal Transportation Commission\" was assented to on March 14, 1951. It contains the following preamble:\nWhereas by the Act 14 George VI, chapter 79, the city of Montreal was authorized to establish a commission designated under the name of \"Montreal Transportation Commission\" to organize, own, develop and administer a general system of public transportation and such Commission was created by by-law No. 1981 of the city of Montreal passed by the council on the 24th of August, 1950.\nWhereas it is necessary to amend such act in order to give additional powers to such commission to enable it to achieve the objects for which it was constituted;\n(The italics are mine.)\nIn my opinion it is quite clear therefore that on June 16, 1951, when the Montreal Transportation Commission became vested with the property and assets of the Montreal Tramways Company, s. 57 of the statute 14 Geo VI, c. 79, as amended, was applicable and the Commission had all the powers conferred under that section.\nIt is true that under the terms of s. 52, upon acquiring the assets of the tramways company, the City is declared to be the \"absolute and inalienable owner of all the property included in the expropriation as well as of all franchises, servitudes, rights of way and other rights of the company concerning the expropriated undertaking\". As Mr. Justice Martineau has pointed out in the Court below, it is not too clear just what the Legislature had in mind in using the words \"franchises, rights of way and other rights of the company\" but it might be noted in passing that under s. 37, in establishing the amount of the indemnity to be paid for the company's property, no value was to be placed upon goodwill, franchises, servitudes, rights-of-way or other rights of a similar nature. Be that as it may, it seems to me to have been the clearly expressed intention of the Legislature that the Montreal Transportation Commission when created should acquire the transportation facilities theretofore owned and operated by the Montreal Tramways Company and that it should thereafter operate them as a publicly-owned transportation system for the benefit of the population in the Montreal area by virtue of the authority conferred in the statute without regard to any limitations which might have been imposed under contracts entered into by the tramways company with the various municipalities in the area served.\nI am therefore in agreement with the unanimous view expressed in the Courts below that any contractual relationship which existed between the appellant and the Montreal Tramways Company terminated on June 16, 1951, and that since that date the Montreal Transportation Commission has operated the public transportation system in the area concerned exclusively in virtue of the authority conferred by the statute 14 Geo. VI, c. 79, as amended, and that it is not bound by any conditions or obligations arising out of contracts previously in existence between the appellant and the Montreal Tramways Company.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, Rand and Cartwright JJ. dissenting.\nAttorneys for the plaintiff, appellant: Duquet, Mackay, Weldon & Tetrault, Montreal.\nAttorney for the defendant, respondent: E.

The provisions of this contract were similar to the provisions of the contract interpreted in City of Westmount v. Montreal Transportation Commission, ante, p. 65.\nHeld (Rand and Cartwright JJ. dissenting): The claim must fail for the reasons given in the Westmount case, since the provisions of the contract and the questions of law involved were the same in both cases.\nPer Rand and Cartwright JJ., dissenting: There was nothing in the powers conferred on the City of Montreal by the statute 14 Geo. VI, c. 79, as amended, abrogating the franchises in the various municipalities and leaving the Commission to act at large. The City of Montreal replaced the Montreal Tramways Company as the owner and operator of the tramway. Western Counties Railway Company v. Windsor and Annapolis Railway Company (1882), 7 App. Cas. 178 at 188, applied. By the vesting of the property of the company in the City the latter became subject in all respects to the liabilities and obligations of the company, which thereafter were to be enforced against the Commission as its mandatary. The substitution of the lien de droit from the company to the City was required by the principles laid down in the Western Counties Railway case, supra.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, affirming the judgment of Salvas J.

Taschereau J.:\u2014For the reasons given by Mr. Justice Abbott, I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Rand and Cartwright JJ. was delivered by\nRand J. (dissenting):\u2014The issue here arises out of the contract considered in the appeal of City of Outremont v. Montreal Tramways Company2, which, entered into on March 12, 1906, embodied the provisions of by-law No. 72 of December 20, 1905. The suit was brought against the respondent as the successor in title to the tramways company under clause 37:\nThe Company shall keep its tracks free from ice and snow to a depth not exceeding eight (8) inches from the ground surface and the Town may at its option remove the whole or such part of the ice and snow from curb to curb as it may see fit from any street or part of street in which cars are running, including the snow from the tracks and from the roofs of houses thrown or falling into the streets and that removed from the sidewalks into the streets, with the consent of the Town, and the Company shall be held to pay one half of the cost thereof.\nClause 41 deals with the duration of the franchise:\nIt is agreed between the Town and the Company that the present arrangement or contract for the establishment and operation of the said electric railway shall extend over a period of thirty (30) years reckoned from the date of the contract to be based on the present By-law. At the expiration of the said term of thirty (30) years and at the expiration of every term of five (5) years thereafter the Town shall have the right, after a notice of six (6) months to the Company, to be given within the twelve (12) months preceding the expiration of the said thirty (30) years, and also after a like notice to be given six (6) months before the expiry of each subsequent period of five (5) years, to assume the ownership of the said railway and all its real estate, \u2026\nI have already construed that language to mean this; a franchise for an indefinite period, subject to expropriation of the undertaking at the end of 30 years or of each subsequent 5-year period thereafter. Clause 37 deals with a matter obviously annexed to the operation of the undertaking without limit of time.\nThe legislation of 1918, 8 Geo. V., c. 84, in what appears as a more or less standard form used in relation to this particular undertaking, supports that view; and with its relation to and effect on the contract before us, I have dealt in the other appeal. A new element is injected, however, by legislation enacted in 1950 and 1951. By 14 Geo. VI., c. 79, with amendments in 14-15 Geo. VI., c. 124, the entire tramways system serving Montreal and its environs was reorganized. Authority was given Montreal to create by by-law the respondent Commission, and to acquire by expropriation either the total capital stock of Montreal Tramways Company or its total undertaking. Acting under this authority the property has been acquired and is now being administered by the respondent.\nThe contention is made that by this legislation the respondent as the mandatary of the City has been given powers which enable it to operate the system in Outremont as well as other municipalities regardless of previous contractual arrangements or terms, in fact without any regulations whatever except what it may from time to time itself prescribe, or to which it may, in its operations, by some other law, not so far mentioned, be subject: and that the grant of such comprehensive powers is incompatible with the retention of any vestige of the original franchise. Such a, view must depend upon the authority given the Commission and the general basis, within the language of the legislation, on which the future operations were to be conducted. In examining that question a clear distinction should be made, as in the 1918 legislation, between purely transportation or operating matters and matters affecting municipal interests as such.\nIt is said by Martineau J., delivering the reasons of the Court of Queen's Bench3, that the transfer of franchises and rights mentioned in s. 52 of 1950, c. 79 must be taken to be rights of a class not clearly indicated, but not, in any case, to include those under which the previous operations were carried out. This view is based on the initial assumption that independent powers of a transcending character are vested in the Commission by which the previous franchises are superseded and the City of Montreal is given carte blanche to exercise powers which formerly the other municipalities, including the appellant, could not, even within their own bounds, exercise without specific legislative authority. The operation of a tramway affects not only the rights of a municipality but those of the public and the creation of a public nuisance in city streets, as such an unauthorized operation would be, must have legislative warrant to legalize it.\nI can find no such paramount authority in the legislation mentioned. The contrary seems envisaged by s. 52:\nFrom the day on which the arbitration, award shall be final, the city shall be absolute and inalienable owner of all the proprety included in the expropriation, as well as of all franchises, servitudes, rights of way and other rights of the Company concerning the expropriated undertaking.\nIn that provision the basic authority for the operation by the respondent is to be found; and in its absence there is nothing to furnish the substance of the terms, conditions and regulations which, it is argued, were impliedly superseded.\nA brief review of the provisions of the two enactments will make this apparent. By s. 16 of the 1951 Act, the Commission is given the status of a corporation and is authorized to acquire and to own all property and to exercise all powers necessary for the execution of the statute; by s. 17 it may acquire and administer on behalf of the city \"a public transportation system for travellers by tramways, by autobuses and other vehicles of the same type\"; s. 186 provides for the vesting of absolute ownership of the property and \"of all rights mentioned in section 52\"; s. 19 enables the expropriation of any immoveable which may be required by the general system. Among the special features is that called \"previous possession\", that is, possession prior to the acquisition of title and by s. 47 during that possession the Commission may \"exercise all franchises, servitudes, rights of way, and other rights of the Company [the Tramways Company] concerning its transportation system\"; s. 47b speaks of \"all the property moveable and immoveable and rights mentioned in section 52\"; s. 48 gives the Commission the right to the possession of all the company's books, records and documents relating to the undertaking; s. 52 has already been set out; by s. 53 all property of the Commission shall be exempt from municipal taxes; by 53a the provisions of the contract between the City of Montreal and the tramways company contained in a sched. to 8 Geo. V., c. 84 cease to apply to the undertaking upon its acquisition; s. 56 deals with rates and makes any decision of the Commission subject to revision by the Public Service Board. By s. 57 \"with the cooperation of any interested city or town\" the Commission may do whatever surface work it deems necessary to improve the conditions of transportation, including the widening of streets, the building of tunnels, grade separations at street intersections, the establishment of new lines and any other work calculated to relieve traffic congestion and provide the public with an adequate system of mass transportation, but it is not to undertake the construction of underground or elevated lines or express-ways; the Commission may also\non its own authority, establish new lines, replace tramway lines by autobus or control bus lines, change their routes, and for any such purpose use any public street which it deems necessary or expedient in the territory of the city or of the metropolitan district.\nSection 58 authorizes the City of Montreal \"and the other cities or towns in the territory served by the Commission's transportation system\" to guarantee the reimbursement of loans made by the Commission for the organization, etc., of the system. By s. 60 the Commission may, by by-law made under s. 20, which deals with expropriation, \"adopt any other provisions and ordain any other measures which may be consistent with this act, in order to assure complete and equitable execution thereof\".\nI find nothing in these powers abrogating generally the agreements regulating the franchises in the various municipalities and leaving the Commission to act at large in the manner claimed. That construction would write s. 52 and the several references to it out of the legislation. In Outremont the City of Montreal is simply the owner and operator of the tramway in replacement of the Montreal Tramways Company: and to treat this restricted language as impliedly putting an end in their entirety to these agreements, of which there are a number, touching as they do the local arrangements that have harmonized the operation of the tramways with widespread municipal administration, would be an unwarranted extension of its plain meaning. When uniformity in municipal relations was intended, it was expressly provided as in s. 53 exempting all the property taken over from \"all municipal taxes\".\nIn some respects the respondent may act without the concurrence of the appellant as under s. 57; that deals with the establishment of new lines and the rearrangement or replacement of the existing facilities, but it does not touch the terms of operations thereafter. No right, liberty, franchise or privilege of any sort or description has been suggested in the Court of Queen's Bench or in this Court that furnishes any subject-matter for the language of s. 52 other than these contracts which embody the prior franchises and in that situation I find it quite impossible to exclude either them or the terms and conditions annexed to them.\nThe principle of law which applies in such a case is well exemplified in Western Counties Railway Company v. Windsor and Annapolis Railway Company4. At p. 188 Lord Watson states it in these words:\nThe canon of construction applicable to such a statute is that it must not be deemed to take away or extinguish the right of the respondent company, unless it appear, by express words, or by plain implication, that it was the intention of the Legislature to do so. That principle was affirmed in Barrington's Case, 8 Rep. 138 a., and was recognised in the recent case of The River Wear Commissioners v. Adamson, 2 App. Cas. 743. The enunciation of the principle is, no doubt, much easier than its application. Thus far, however, the law appears to be plain\u2014that in order to take away the right it is not sufficient to shew that the thing sanctioned by the Act, if done, will of sheer physical necessity put an end to the right, it must also be shewn that the Legislature have authorized the thing to be done at all events, and irrespective of its possible interference with existing rights.\nIt is said finally that there is no lien de droit between the parties. But if the terms and conditions of the franchise embody an obligation annexed to its exercise, the transfer of the rights of the franchise by an Act of the Legislature effects a transfer as well of the correlative obligations. It cannot be imagined that where the legislation leaves in force cl. 37, and provides for the assumption of capital obligations and for the payment of operating costs, those of snow removal are excepted. By s. 53e of 1951, c. 124, in case of the expropriation of the capital stock of the company, when the total amount of the price has been paid, the Lieutenant-Governor in Council is authorized by proclamation to cancel the company's charter; and although no such provision seems to follow the expropriation of the undertaking, it cannot be inferred that the Legislature would intend the tramways company to continue under liability for a service with which it has no concern. By s. 53 \"All the Commission's revenues shall be used to meet its obligations and to operate, maintain and improve the transportation system of which it has the administration\"; and by s. 18a all claims relating, among other things, to the operation, administration or control of the property entrusted to the Commission shall be made, and proceedings for their recovery brought, against the Commission. This necessarily implies that by the vesting of the property in the City the latter became substituted in all respects to the liabilities and obligations of the tramways company, which thereafter are to be enforced against the Commission as its mandatory. Western Counties Railway v. Windsor and Annapolis Railway Company, supra, is a good example of the legislative effect of such a transfer and the substitution of the lien de droit from the Tramways Company to the City is required by the principles laid down in that case.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal, set aside the judgments below and declare that the Commission is bound by the terms of cl. 37 of the contract of 1906. The City will have its costs in all courts.\nThe judgment of Fauteux and Abbott JJ. was delivered by\nAbbott J.:\u2014Appellant's claim is for $23,781.08, representing one-half the cost of snow removal on certain streets in appellant's territory during the period from June 16, 1951, to January 20, 1953. Appellant claimed this amount under a specific provision of the franchise granted by the former Town of Outremont (now the City of Outremont) under the authority of which it contends respondent is operating its tramways in the said city.\nThe claim was submitted to the Superior Court in a stated case in accordance with the terms of art. 509 of the Code of Civil Procedure of the Province of Quebec. The present appeal is from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench5 confirming the judgment of the learned trial judge, the Honourable Mr. Justice Elie Salvas, which declared that respondent was not indebted to appellant in the amount claimed.\nThe provisions of the contract between the Town of Outremont and the Montreal Street Railway Company (now the Montreal Tramways Company) dated March 12, 1906, are similar to, although not identical with, the provisions of the contract between the said company and the City of Westmount, which was considered by this Court in the appeal of the City of Westmount v. Montreal Transportation Commission1 and which was argued before this Court immediately before the hearing of the present appeal.\nCounsel for both parties to this appeal agreed that the same questions of law are involved in the determination of both appeals and this appeal was submitted on that basis without further argument.\nFor the reasons which I have given in the appeal of the City of Westmount v. Montreal Transportation Commission1, which need not be repeated here, I would therefore dismiss the present appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, Rand and Cartwright JJ. dissenting.\nAttorneys for the plaintiff, appellant: Sauv\u00e9, Gagnon & L'Heureux, Montreal.\nAttorney for the defendant, respondent: E.

The company also held a franchise in the City of Montreal. In 1918, by a contract between the City of Montreal and the defendant, ratified by the statute 8 Geo. V, c. 84, the company's franchise in the city of Montreal was replaced and its term extended to 1953, but the franchise in the plaintiff municipality was not annulled. However, the right of the latter municipality to expropriate the undertaking of the company was abrogated and given exclusively to the City of Montreal.\nIn its action, the plaintiff municipality sought recovery of municipal taxes for the years 1936 to 1949, inclusive. The action was maintained by the Superior Court but dismissed by a majority in the Court of Appeal.\nHeld (Rand and Cartwright JJ. dissenting): The action must fail. For the reasons given in City of Westmount v. Montreal Transportation Commission, ante, p. 65, the effect of the 1918 statute was to continue in force, from 1936 until 1953, both the obligations of the company to operate its tramway system in Outremont and its corresponding rights to a franchise and tax exemption. The Court below disposed satisfactorily of the contention that (1) there was incompatibility as regards the tax-exemption provisions in the city of Montreal contract and the Outremont contract, and (2) the company was debarred from pleading the exemption because it had not taken steps at the proper time and by the proper procedure to contest its liability.\nPer Rand and Cartwright JJ., dissenting: The exemption expired with the first period of 30 years. By the validation of the contract in 1906, the Legislature made it clear that there was no intention to deal with the validation of the exemption for any period beyond that which the municipality was already specially authorized to grant, that is, 30 years. The exemption clause was severable from the remaining provisions of the contract. The abrogation of the right of expropriation in 1918 did not terminate the exemption; the language of the statute clearly indicated that the remaining provisions were to be unaffected so far at least as was necessary to maintain the franchise.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, reversing, Martineau J. dissenting, the judgment of Tyndale, Assoc.

Gagnon, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant.\nJules Deschenes, for the defendant, respondent.\nTaschereau J.:\u2014For the reasons given by Mr. Justice Abbott, I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Rand and Cartwright JJ. was delivered by\nRand J. (dissenting):\u2014The issue in this appeal depends on the interpretation to be given the language of an agreement made between the parties, the by-law preceding which, no. 72, in identical terms, was confirmed by an Act of the Legislature. The agreement provided generally for the construction and operation of a tramway line within the city of Outremont. Among the special provisions was one stipulating for exemption from general taxes. The franchise was subject to the right of expropriation of the undertaking at the end of 30 years or of any 5-year period thereafter. The question in dispute is whether the exemption expired with the first period of 30 years or continued during the operation of the undertaking until the year 1949; and it becomes necessary to examine closely the language used.\nBy s. 12 the grant was made:\nThe above-mentioned lines of railway are to be constructed and operated \u2026 and such other lines as the Company may erect, construct and operate in the Town are to be so constructed and operated \u2026 throughout the hereinafter mentioned period, in consideration of the Town granting as it now does for thirty (30) years reckoning from the said Eighth of February last past (1906) to the Montreal Street Railway Company, its representatives and assigns AN EXCLUSIVE FRANCHISE for operating Street Railways by electric power, or such other motive power as may toe agreed upon on a ground surface for passengers, freight and mails within the limits of the Town and in further consideration that the Company shall be exempt from the payment of all municipal taxes and rates which the Town may now or herafter have the power to levy upon the Company, its moveable or immoveable property or franchise: provided always that if the Company establish a power house or a car shed or a car shop or other building except waiting rooms, the same shall be subject to all municipal taxes imposed by the Town upon immoveable property; \u2026 provided that the said Town will grant to the said Company such extension of its present franchise in the said Town as will make it terminate at the same date as any extension which may be granted by the said City of Montreal to the said Railway of its franchise in said City.\nand by s. 41 the period of its continuance was specified:\nIt is agreed between the Town and the Company that the present arrangement or contract for the establishment and operation of the said electric railway shall extend over a period of Thirty (30) years reckoned from the said Eighth day of February last (1906) (the date of the Deed of Contract first above mentioned). At the expiration of the said term of Thirty (30) years and at the expiration of every term of five (5) years, thereafter the Town shall have the right, after a notice of six (6) months to the Company, to be given within the twelve (12) months preceding the expiration of the said Thirty (30) years, and also after a like notice to be given six (6) months before the expiry of each subsequent period of Five (5) years, to assume the ownership of the said railway and all its real estate, appurtenances, plant and vehicles belonging to the said Company situate in the Town of Outremont and necessary for the operation of its line, on payment of their value to be determined by Arbitrators to be appointed as follows: \u2026\nIn 1918, by 8 Geo. V., c. 84, the transportation system of the respondent, serving the city of Montreal and the surrounding municipalities was brought under the general authority, for construction, operation and maintenance purposes, of the tramways Commission. Uniformity of operation was the main objective and the arrangement was to continue until. 1953 at which time or at specified periods thereafter the City of Montreal might expropriate the entire undertaking. Items of special nature touching municipal interests other than of transportation between the company and Montreal were dealt with. Concerning matters essentially of transportation the expression \"within and without the limits of the City\" was uniformly used, but provisions for matters of municipal interest were expressly limited to Montreal; the existing arrangements on such matters between the company and outside municipalities were left untouched.\nThe duration of the new arrangement was formulated in language similar to that before us. Paragraph 8 of art. 92 of the contract, for example, provides:\nOn March 24, 1953 (the date of expiration of the first named period of 35 years) and at the expiration of every subsequent five-year period, the City shall have the right, after six (6) months' notice given to the Company \u2026 to appropriate for itself the Railway of the said Company, etc. \u2026 The purchase price shall also include all privileges, rights and franchises of the Company in any municipality wherein the said assets so acquired are situated, but the City shall not pay for the value of such privileges, rights and franchises, and shall further have the right to operate the system of tramways so purchased in any municipality wherein the same is located.\nNo municipality other than the City shall have the right to purchase the railway system of the Company in whole or in part.\nBy s. 75 of the statute it was declared that\nevery provision of any contract, agreement or arrangement entered into between the Montreal Tramways Company and any municipal corporation outside of Montreal \u2026 which may be inconsistent with the said contract of the 28th of January, 1918 shall be and remain without effect from the date of the coming into force of the said contract.\nThe confirmation of by-law no. 72 was made by 6 Ed. VIL, c. 52, in these words:\n11. Whereas by-law No. 72 of the town granting to the Montreal Street Railway Company an exclusive franchise and exemption from taxes for thirty years, was unanimously adopted by the council on the 20th December, 1905, and unanimously approved by the electors who art proprietors on the 8th January, 1906; and whereas doubts have now arisen as to the right of the town to grant such exclusive franchise and it is expedient to remove such doubts; it is enacted that the aforesaid by-law No. 72 is hereby declared legal and valid and ratified to all intents and purposes. In 1915 there was a further confirmation:\n90. By-law No. 72 of the city, granting to the Montreal Street Railway Company an exclusive franchise and exemption from taxes for thirty years, which was unanimously adopted by the council on the 30th of December, 1905, and unanimously approved by the electors who are proprietors on the 8th of January, 1906, and which has already been ratified by the act 6 Edward VII, chapter 52, section 11, (but which act is hereinafter repealed), is hereby declared legal and valid, and ratified to all intents and purposes.\nIn 1900 by 63 Vict., c. 55, s. 22, Outremont was authorized, by resolution, to\nexempt from the payment of municipal taxes, for a period not exceeding thirty (30) years, any person who carries on any industry, trade or enterprise whatsoever, as well as the land used for such industry, trade or enterprise, or agree with such person for a fixed sum of money payable annually for any period not exceeding thirty (30) years, in commutation of all municipal taxes.\nThis section was repealed in 1915 by 5 Geo. V., c. 93, s. 91. Section 518 of the Cities and Towns Act, 3 Ed. VII, c. 38, specified a limit of 20 years for the exemption from taxation of any \"industry, trade or enterprise\", reproducing in substance art. 4559 of R.S.Q. 1888. The authority of Outremont in 1905-6 was, therefore, an exception to the general law.\nThe contention made by Outremont is this: it was expressly authorized to exempt an enterprise for 30 years but not more; such a limitation is a basic principle of municipal law and in the case of the City a special indulgence of an additional 10 years over the general act was permitted. The exemption has invariably been treated strictly collateral benefit for a limited time which would be exhausted as part of the terms of any franchise or contract when its statutory period expired.\nThe by-law and the contract clearly contemplate an unbroken continuance of operations from the beginning to the termination of the franchise, an indefinite period divided into terms, a contract, in short, for a continuous franchise from its commencement to its indefinite end. If within that period a provision, on its proper interpretation, is to continue only for a limited time, the expiration of that particular time and of the provision affects nothing else; by its nature the latter simply ceases to have force as a provision, the contract becomes so far fully performed as was intended, and the remaining provisions continue as from the beginning.\nThe right of expropriation by Outremont was abrogated by the legislation of 1918 and that power transferred to Montreal; and as in the case of Montreal the option to purchase might never be exercised. The question is, then, whether the by-law is to be interpreted as providing the tax exemption for the indeterminate period of the franchise.\nThe purpose of the validation in 1906 is made clear by the recital to s. 11: \"and whereas doubts have now arisen as to the right of the town to grant such exclusive franchise and it is expedient to remove such doubts\". With that in mind as its purpose and in view of the fact that the recital mentions the exemption from taxation as being for 30 years, the Legislature by that language has made it clear that there was no intention to deal with the validation of the exemption for any period beyond that which Outremont was already authorized to grant. Neither the contract nor the by-law was annexed to the statute; and the only representation to the Legislature, so far as appears, was that contained in the recital. The exemption for 30 years being within the authority of the City did not need validation and its inclusion with the doubtful exclusiveness of the franchise cannot modify the proper construction of the by-law. So to interpret either the by-law or the clause of validation would be to attribute to the City an intention to ask for and to the Legislature an intention to grant a perpetual exemption from taxation by language that conceals rather than discloses such an intention. After the repeal of the 1900 legislation in 1915, the only power of exemption remaining to the City was that contained in the Cities and Towns Act for a period of 20 years; and that circumstance furnishes an additional consideration against such a construction either of the by-law or the validating Act.\nMr. Deschenes argues that the exemption clause is inseparably bound up with the total consideration of the contract and is not severable; and that when the by-law contemplates a continuance beyond 30 years of the franchise it has in mind a continuance of the then existing arrangement. For the reasons given, I cannot agree with this. Tax exemption is essentially a temporary benefit intended to assist enterprise in its early stages granted within a long legislative tradition of time limitation. Franchises, particularly those of such public services, may be, as here, virtually perpetual and only in extraordinary circumstances, for unique reasons and in express and unequivocal language, as in the case of works with a national interest, such as, for example, the western section of the Canadian Pacific Railway, has a perpetual exemption ever been created.\nIt was the view of Martineau J. in the Court of Queen's Bench2 that on the abrogation, in 1918, of the right of expropriation, the consideration for the franchise came to an end with the consequence that the grant thereupon terminated, and with it, the tax exemption. I am unable to attribute that effect to the legislation; the language clearly indicates that the remaining provisions were to be unaffected so far at least as was necessary to maintain the franchise: otherwise the many provisions for regulating services \"within and without the City\" would have been abortive; and I cannot construe the right of expropriation given Montreal to be of an undertaking illegally occupying the streets. Assuming that the abrogation gave some remedial right to Outremont, on well established principles, that right, even to rescission, was one the exercise of which could be waived; and that it was waived is conclusively established by this proceeding. This view of the continuance of the franchise becomes of importance to the enforcement of other terms of the contract such as that for the payment of part of the cost of snow removal.\nFor these reasons, the appeal must succeed. The judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench should be reversed and that of the trial judge restored with costs in this Court and in the Court of Queen's Bench.\nThe judgment of Fauteux and Abbott JJ. was delivered by\nAbbott J.:\u2014Appellant's claim is for $19,594.78, representing municipal taxes and assessments for the years 1936 to 1949 inclusive. Respondent denied liability on the ground that it was exempt from the payment of such taxes in virtue of the contract governing its relations with appellant. Appellant is successor to the Town of Outremont and respondent is successor to the Montreal Street Railway-Company. The terms and conditions of a franchise granted by the Town of Outremont to the Montreal Street Railway Company are set out in by-law 72 of the said Town, adopted December 20, 1905, which was ratified by the Quebec Legislature, and in a contract implementing the said by-law executed March 12, 1906.\nThe Town granted to the company for a period of thirty years terminating February 8, 1936, an exclusive franchise to establish and operate lines of electric railway in particular streets in the municipality, subject to the conditions specified in the by-law and the contract. During this period of thirty years, the company was granted two principal rights: (1) an exclusive franchise and (2) a partial exemption from municipal taxes and rates. Section 12, relating to the term of the franchise and the tax exemption, reads as follows:\nThe above-mentioned lines of railway are to be constructed and operated at the rate of one fare, and such other lines as the Company may erect, construct and operate in the Town are to be constructed and operated at the rate of one fare for the conveyance of passengers to and from points in the Town of Outremont, to and from points on the Company's Montreal System of tracks throughout the hereinafter mentioned period, in consideration of the Town granting as it now does for thirty (30) years reckoning from the said Eighth of February last past (1906) to the Montreal Street Railway Company, its representatives and assigns, AN EXCLUSIVE FRANCHISE for operating Street Railways by electric power, or such other motive power as may be agreed upon, on a ground surface for passengers, freight and mails within the limits of the Town and in further consideration that the Company shall be exempt from the payment of all municipal taxes and rates which the Town may now or hereafter have the power to levy upon the Company, its moveable or immoveable property or franchise: provided always that if the Company establish a power house or a car shed or a car shop or other building except waiting rooms, the same shall be subject to all municipal taxes imposed by the Town upon immoveable property; nevertheless in the event of the Company at any time agreeing with the City of Montreal to reduce the rate of fares at present in force in the City of Montreal, the Company binds itself to reduce the rate of fares in the Town of Outremont, to the same rate as in Montreal: provided that the said Town will grant to the said Company such extension of its present franchise in the said Town as will make it terminate at the same date as any extension which may be granted by the said City of Montreal to the said Railway of its franchise in said City.\n(The italics are mine.) It will be noted from the terms of the section which I have quoted that the tax exemption applies, generally speaking, only to that portion of the company's property and assets situated on the streets of the appellant.\nIn consideration of the exclusive franchise and of the tax exemption, the company undertook to establish and operate lines of tramway for the conveyance of passengers in the streets specified in the contract. In other words the obligation on the part of the company to establish, maintain and operate was subject to the reciprocal obligations of the Town to grant it the exclusive franchise and the tax exemption.\nOn January 28, 1918, the Montreal Tramways Company and the City of Montreal entered into a contract which was ratified by a statute of the Quebec Legislature, 8 Geo. V, c 84. The contract appears as Schedule A to the said Act. The company's franchise in the city of Montreal was expressly annulled and replaced but the company's franchise in the city of Outremont was not annulled. Its conditions were modified in certain respects, which are not relevant to the issue in this appeal, and, in addition, the right of the City of Outremont under the contract of March 12, 1906, to expropriate the company's undertaking within its limits was abrogated.\nThe relevant sections of the 1918 statute (para. 8 of art. 92 and art. 95 of Schedule A) read as follows:\nArticle 92.\nParagraph 8. Expropriation.\nOn March twenty-fourth (24th) nineteen hundred and fifty-three (1953), and at the expiration of every subsequent five-year period, the City shall have the right, after six months notice given to the Company within the twelve months immediately preceding March twenty-fourth (24th) nineteen hundred and fifty-three (1953), and also after a similar notice of six months and on the same conditions at the end of each subsequent five-years period, to appropriate for itself the railway of the said company as well as the immoveables and dependencies, plant and cars belonging to it and necessary for the operation of the said railway, situate within and without the limits of the said City, by paying the value thereof, to be fixed by arbitrators, and ten per cent. (10%) over and above the estimate. Such arbitrators shall be appointed as follows: One by the City, one by the Company, and the third by a judge of the Superior Court sitting in and for the district of Montreal.\n* * *\nNo municipality other than the City shall have the right to purchase the railway system of the Company, in whole or in part. CONTRACTS WITH MUNICIPALITIES OUTSIDE OF THE CITY.\nArticle 95.\nAll the provisions of the contracts, compacts or agreements passed between the Company and any municipal corporation outside of the City, inconsistent with the provisions of this contract, shall be and shall remain without effect from the time of the coming into force of the present contract.\nOne effect of this statute was, therefore, to take away from appellant the right of expropriation given to it under the franchise and to vest that right in the City of Montreal.\nAlthough not identical, the provisions of the contract between the Town of Outremont and respondent are similar to those of the contract which has just been considered by this Court in the appeal of City of Westmount v. Montreal Transportation Commission3. For the reasons which I have given in that appeal, which need not be repeated here, I am of opinion that in passing the 1918 statute, 8 Geo. V, c. 84, the Quebec Legislature intended that the reciprocal rights and obligations of the tramways company and the City of Outremont under the contract of March 12, 1906, were to be continued until March 24, 1953, except to the extent that such rights and obligations may have been modified by the said statute. The effect of the statute was therefore to continue in force from February 8, 1936, until March 24, 1953, both the obligation of the respondent to operate its tramway system in Outremont and its corresponding rights to a franchise and tax exemption.\nThe points raised by appellant (a) that there is incompatibility as regards the tax exemption provisions in the city of Montreal contract and the Outremont contract and (b) that respondent was debarred from pleading its tax exemption because no steps were taken at the proper time and by the proper procedure to contest its liability, have been satisfactorily disposed of, in my opinion, by the Court below.\nFor the reasons which I have given and also for those expressed by Bissonette and Gagn\u00e9 JJ., with which I am in respectful agreement, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.

In the circumstances, the fact that he was driving at a speed of 10 to 12 miles an hour was not sufficient to discharge that onus.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, reversing the judgment of Rh\u00e9aume J. Appeal allowed, Rand J. dissenting. Bernard Desjarlais, for the plaintiffs, appellants.\nFran\u00e7ois Mercier, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau, Locke, Fauteux and Abbott JJ. was delivered by\nFauteux J.:\u2014Le 4 mai 1953, vers les quatre heures et demie de l'apr\u00e8s-midi, le fils des appelants, Guy B\u00e9dard, un gar\u00e7onnet de cinq ans, fut renvers\u00e9 sur la chauss\u00e9e de la rue St-Philippe \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, par un v\u00e9hicule automobile conduit par l'intim\u00e9 et lui appartenant. L'enfant en fut gri\u00e8vement bless\u00e9. Les appelants, ses tuteurs conjoints, ont poursuivi l'intim\u00e9 et obtenu contre lui, en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, un jugement le tenant responsable et le condamnant \u00e0 payer, \u00e0 titre de dommages, une somme totale de $3,926.30.\nPort\u00e9 en appel2, ce jugement fut infirm\u00e9 et l'action fut renvoy\u00e9e. D'o\u00f9 le pourvoi devant cette Cour o\u00f9 seule la question de responsabilit\u00e9 est soulev\u00e9e.\nLes faits:\u2014A la date de l'accident, la circulation des v\u00e9hicules, sur la rue St-Philippe, n'\u00e9tait permise que dans une direction nord-sud. L'accident s'est produit dans une zone scolaire, entre deux intersections, vis-\u00e0-vis une \u00e9picerie sise du c\u00f4t\u00e9 ouest et en face de laquelle se trouvait stationn\u00e9e, en bordure du trottoir, une camionnette dont l'avant pointait au sud. Venant du nord, l'intim\u00e9 proc\u00e9dait vers le sud, au centre de la rue, \u00e0 une vitesse de 10 \u00e0 12 milles \u00e0 l'heure, et allait d\u00e9passer la camionnette lorsqu'il aper\u00e7ut, \u00e0 4 ou 5 pieds devant lui, l'enfant surgissant, en courant, de l'avant de la camionnette. L'intim\u00e9 appliqua imm\u00e9diatement les freins et arr\u00eata, dit-il, son v\u00e9hicule dans une distance correspondant \u00e0 la longueur des marques laiss\u00e9es sur le pav\u00e9 par l'op\u00e9ration du freinage et qu'il estime \u00eatre de 3 pieds; mais l'enfant avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 frapp\u00e9 par le c\u00f4t\u00e9 gauche du pare-choc avant de son v\u00e9hicule.\nCe r\u00e9cit, qu'a donn\u00e9 l'intim\u00e9, sur la conduite de l'enfant \u00e0 l'instant m\u00eame o\u00f9 l'accident s'est produit est confirm\u00e9 par la preuve et, plus particuli\u00e8rement, par deux t\u00e9moins, Dugas p\u00e8re et fils, dont le d\u00e9sint\u00e9ressement est affirm\u00e9 par les deux parties. Ces derniers, qui cet apr\u00e8s-midi l\u00e0 prenaient un bain de soleil sur une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 sise du c\u00f4t\u00e9 est et en face de l'\u00e9picerie, ajoutent que pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment \u00e0 l'instant de l'accident, l'enfant jouait pr\u00e8s de l'\u00e9picerie avec d'autres compagnons et ils l'ont vu tour \u00e0 tour sur le trottoir et dans la rue. Dugas fils pr\u00e9cise que c'est du trottoir que l'enfant est parti en courant pour traverser la rue lorsque l'accident s'est produit.\nIl est \u00e9vident qu'\u00e0 l'instant m\u00eame o\u00f9, dans cette course du trottoir \u00e0 la rue, l'enfant passa \u00e0 l'avant de la camionnette, il n'\u00e9tait pas visible pour l'intim\u00e9 qui en approchait \u00e0 l'arri\u00e8re. Mais, \u00e0 moins de recourir aux conjectures, il est impossible, d'apr\u00e8s la preuve, d'affirmer qu'avant cet instant-l\u00e0, et alors que, d'une part, l'enfant jouait sur le trottoir, et que, d'autre part, l'intim\u00e9 venait du nord \u00e0 une vitesse de 10 \u00e0 12 milles \u00e0 l'heure et parcourait ainsi de 14 \u00e0 17 pieds \u00e0 la seconde, qu'\u00e0 aucun temps et que d'aucun point de son parcours, l'intim\u00e9 ne pouvait voir l'enfant sur le trottoir. Sur cette question, il y a carence de preuve. En effet, il semble bien que les Dugas avaient une vue directe sur la partie lat\u00e9rale gauche de la camionnette et ne pouvaient cons\u00e9quemment, de l'endroit o\u00f9 ils \u00e9taient, voir ce qui se passait sur le trottoir, entre ce v\u00e9hicule et l'\u00e9picerie. Ils ne paraissent pas, non plus, avoir observ\u00e9 la venue de l'automobile de l'intim\u00e9 avant qu'il ne proc\u00e9d\u00e2t \u00e0 doubler la camionnette; de toutes fa\u00e7ons, leurs t\u00e9moignages n'apportent aucune assistance sur le point. Et quant \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9, qui pouvait voir ce qui se passait sur le trottoir, au moins durant quelque temps avant d'arriver \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 de la camionnette, il n'a pas regard\u00e9 et n'a pu affirmer s'il s'y trouvait des adultes ou des enfants. Voici d'ailleurs l'extrait de son t\u00e9moignage sur le point :\nD.\u2014Connaissez-vous bien cette rue St-Philippe \u00e0 l'endroit de l'accident? R.\u2014Je la connais comme l'avoir travers\u00e9e assez souvent.\nD.\u2014Vous avez un neveu, l\u00e0, monsieur Jett\u00e9 qui demeure l\u00e0? R.\u2014Oui, monsieur.\nD.\u2014Est-ce que vous le visitiez? R.\u2014De temps en temps, monsieur.\nD.\u2014Vous saviez qu'\u00e0 cet endroit-l\u00e0 il y avait une \u00e9cole et que c'\u00e9tait une zone scolaire? R.\u2014Oui, monsieur.\nD.\u2014Vous saviez qu'il y avait deux rues-intersections? R.\u2014Oui, monsieur.\nD.\u2014Est-ce que vous saviez que c'\u00e9tait une rue bien passante o\u00f9 les enfants jouent dans la rue? R.\u2014Oui, monsieur.\nD.\u2014Vous saviez tout cela. Aviez-vous vu le jeune B\u00e9dard avant d'arriver \u00e0 l'endroit de l'accident? R.\u2014Non, monsieur.\nD.\u2014Vous ne l'aviez pas vu sur la rue? R.\u2014Non.\nD.\u2014Avez-vous vu des enfants sur le trottoir? R.\u2014Je n'ai pas remarqu\u00e9 s'il y avait des enfants ou des grandes personnes, j'\u00e9tais tellement intentionn\u00e9 de regarder en avant de moi, je n'ai pas regard\u00e9 sur le trottoir.\nD.\u2014Avez-vous regard\u00e9 devant vous sur le trottoir? R.\u2014Non, je n'ai pas regard\u00e9.\nD.\u2014Vous ne regardiez pas sur le trottoir? R.\u2014Non, je ne regardais pas, ce n'est pas ma mani\u00e8re quand je conduis, je regarde en avant.\nD.\u2014Malgr\u00e9 que vous saviez que c'\u00e9tait une zone scolaire? R.\u2014Oui.\nD.\u2014Saviez-vous que c'\u00e9tait la sortie des \u00e9coles? R.\u2014Oui, c'\u00e9tait dans les quatre heures et quart (4.15).\nD.\u2014Vous saviez que c'\u00e9tait \u00e0 la sortie de l'\u00e9cole? R.\u2014Oui.\nD.\u2014En aucun moment avant l'accident, vous n'avez regard\u00e9 sur le trottoir ni \u00e0 gauche ni \u00e0 droite? R.\u2014Non.\nEn droit, cette omission de l'intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 retenue, tant par le juge de premi\u00e8re instance que par les juges de la Cour d'Appel3, comme constituant une faute. Ces derniers, cependant, ont exprim\u00e9 l'avis que cette faute n'a pas contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'accident car, et c'est l\u00e0 la raison de la d\u00e9cision, m\u00eame si l'intim\u00e9 avait vu l'enfant sur le trottoir, on ne pouvait lui demander de proc\u00e9der avec plus de soin qu'il ne l'a fait.\nLes dispositions du para. 2 de l'art. 53 de la Loi des v\u00e9hicules automobiles, S.R.Q. 1941, c. 142, sont claires:\n53. 2. Quand un v\u00e9hicule automobile cause une perte ou un dommage \u00e0 quelque personne dans un chemin public, le fardeau de la preuve que cette perte ou ce dommage n'est pas d\u00fb \u00e0 la n\u00e9gligence ou \u00e0 la conduite r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible du propri\u00e9taire ou de la personne qui conduit ce v\u00e9hicule automobile, incombe au propri\u00e9taire ou \u00e0 la personne qui conduit le v\u00e9hicule automobile.\nLa preuve, comme d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9, \u00e9tablit que l'enfant jouait avec d'autres enfants dans le voisinage de l'\u00e9picerie et de la camionnette et que c'est du trottoir qu'il est parti en courant pour aller dans la rue. Dans ces circonstances et pour prouver que le dommage n'est pas d\u00fb \u00e0 sa n\u00e9gligence ou \u00e0 sa conduite r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible, l'intim\u00e9 devait montrer que la preuve \u00e9tablit (i) qu'en aucun temps utile, avant l'instant o\u00f9 l'enfant passa en courant \u00e0 l'avant de la camionnette, cet enfant ne pouvait \u00eatre visible pour lui s'il avait regard\u00e9 sur le trottoir avant d'arriver \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 de la camionnette; (ii) ou que si, au contraire, l'enfant \u00e9tait visible, il n'aurait pu, s'il l'avait vu, \u00e9viter l'accident, en faisant entrer dans ses pr\u00e9visions les imprudences possibles des enfants et en adoptant \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard toute la prudence raisonnable command\u00e9e par la situation qui s'offrait \u00e0 lui. De tous les t\u00e9moins, l'intim\u00e9 est le seul qui, en raison de sa position sur la rue, aurait pu \u00e9tablir le premier point. S'il avait regard\u00e9 sur le trottoir, il eut \u00e9t\u00e9 facile pour lui d'affirmer au proc\u00e8s, si vraiment tel \u00e9tait le cas, qu'en aucun temps utile l'enfant n'\u00e9tait visible. N'ayant pas regard\u00e9, il n'a pu, par sa faute, \u00e9tablir cette premi\u00e8re proposition qui l'aurait exon\u00e9r\u00e9.\nPour la m\u00eame raison et par suite de la m\u00eame faute, il ne peut, sans faire appel aux conjectures, alors que c'est lui qui a le fardeau de la preuve, \u00e9tablir la seconde proposition. Nous ne pouvons que sp\u00e9culer sur la situation qui s'offrait \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 et cette situation constitue la donn\u00e9e principale pour appr\u00e9cier la conduite de l'intim\u00e9 dans les circonstances. De quel point du trottoir l'enfant est-il parti pour aller courir et aller passer en avant de la camionnette? Ses agissements \u00e9taient-ils tels que, les observant, l'intim\u00e9 devait n\u00e9cessairement appr\u00e9hender l'imprudence qu'il a commise? Sur ces points, et d'apr\u00e8s la preuve faite, toutes les conjectures sont possibles. Et, \u00e0 moins d'admettre, ce qui est impossible, que dans de telles circonstances, l'automobiliste qui ferme les yeux sur ce qui se passe sur le trottoir doit n\u00e9cessairement \u00eatre exon\u00e9r\u00e9 s'il conduit \u00e0 une vitesse de 10 \u00e0 12 milles \u00e0 l'heure, la question de savoir s'il a repouss\u00e9 la pr\u00e9somption \u00e9dict\u00e9e contre lui, ne peut recevoir une r\u00e9ponse affirmative. Une vitesse de 10 \u00e0 12 milles \u00e0 l'heure est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, mais non n\u00e9cessairement en regard de tous les dangers possibles que l'automobiliste peut \u00eatre l\u00e9galement tenu d'anticiper, une vitesse prudente. Dans chaque cas, les circonstances essentielles \u00e0 l'appr\u00e9ciation et d\u00e9termination de la question doivent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es et, pour cette raison, il appartient \u00e0 celui qui doit se lib\u00e9rer de la pr\u00e9somption de faute, comme c'est le cas de l'intim\u00e9, de voir \u00e0 ce que ces circonstances apparaissent dans la preuve. Autrement, la disposition du para. 2 de l'art. 53 devient d\u00e9nu\u00e9e de son sens aussi bien que de sa raison d'\u00eatre.\nJe maintiendrais l'appel, r\u00e9tablirais le dispositif du jugement de premi\u00e8re instance, avec d\u00e9pens de toutes les Cours. Rand J. (dissenting):\u2014This appeal has given me anxious consideration, but after a careful examination of the evidence I am unable to say that the Court of Queen's Bench4 is wrong in the view taken by it of the facts and the resulting conclusion.\nThose facts are extremely simple. The automobile\u2014a taxi\u2014was proceeding southerly on St. Philippe, a one way street in Montreal of a width ordinarily accommodating three lanes of traffic. It had passed approximately 20 feet beyond Tourville and was within 50 feet of St. Philom\u00e8ne, both cross streets ending at St. Philippe, when the young child aged 5 years suddenly ran out into its path. A small low panel delivery truck facing southerly was parked along the curb of the right hand or westerly sidewalk and the child had run into the street about 2 or 3 feet in front or southerly of the truck in an angular direction toward the northeast. This is evident from the following evidence given by an independent witness who saw the accident from across the street:\nD.\u2014Apr\u00e8s l'accident, comment se trouvait le camion par rapport au taxi, comment se trouvaient-ils plac\u00e9s, l'un \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de l'autre ou en avant ou en arri\u00e8re?\nR.\u2014Non, il y avait une petite distance entre le camion et le taxi et, maintenant, le taxi \u00e9tait \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s \u00e0 la fin du camion.\nD.\u2014Il \u00e9tait au sud?\nR.\u2014Oui, le taxi \u00e9tait au nord avant d'arriver au camion, parce que l'enfant est arriv\u00e9, il a couru juste sur le taxi, l'enfant traversait en biais.\nD.\u2014Il n'a pas travers\u00e9 en ligne droite?\nR.\u2014Non, il n'a pas travers\u00e9 en ligne droite, c'est pour cela que le taxi se trouvait un petit peu en arri\u00e8re du camion.\nThat evidence is not seriously challenged and from it the direction of the child is seen to have been toward the oncoming taxi. The speed of the latter was not greater than 12 miles an hour; the horn had been sounded for Tourville street; it was moving along the centre of St. Philippe and 3 to 4 feet to the left of the truck. It was brought to a stop within 3 or 4 feet after the application of the brakes and its front was then at least no farther south than on a line with the front of the truck: Gauthier says, \"Ma voiture par rapport au devant du camion \u00e9tait pratiquement en ligne droite avec le camion\". A school stands on the south-east corner of Tourville and St. Philippe and the accident happened between 4.15 and 4.30 in the afternoon near the time when the students are let out. The young child was not at school but was playing with one or two other children behind the side of the truck on the westerly sidewalk 100 feet or more northerly from his home on the same side of St. Philippe.\nThe taxi-driver was well acquainted with the special circumstances of the place and quite evidently was driving with a full appreciation of them. He admitted frankly that he had not looked for children on the westerly sidewalk who might be playing there but in the place where the child was playing, it cannot be said that if he had looked he could have seen him. The two cross streets are only from 75 to 100 feet apart and he had passed the immediate school area, from which it does not appear that any children were then coming or had come out, although before the child had been taken off to the hospital some had gathered around the scene.\nThat the taxi had stopped within 4 to 6 feet after the sudden appearance of the child; that the latter was picked up 2 or 3 feet from and to the left of the front end of the car; that the car had reached to only the front or even less than that of the truck; and considering that the child was running at an angle towards the taxi; on these facts, so far from being satisfied that the Court of Queen's Bench was wrong, I am disposed to agree with its finding.\nIf those circumstances are not sufficient to meet the statutory onus by affirmatively showing reasonable care on the part of the driver it would be difficult to say how liability for that class of accident can be avoided. The law cannot be stretched so as to create a virtual insurance against injuries to children. It is, no doubt, a hard case that a young child should have, as here, the hearing in one ear seriously and probably permanently impaired. But so long as children are allowed to play on busy streets, that risk is inherent in that part of their upbringing. The existing law does not put the burden of an absolute avoidance of them on automobile drivers; and while one's natural sympathies are with the child and altogether too many irresponsible drivers are tolerated on the streets, in this case, which alone we must consider, and as the evidence compels me to accept, there was nothing of misconduct.\nThe appeal must, then, be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs, Rand J. dissenting.\nAttorneys for the plaintiffs, appellants: Desjarlais & Ouellette, Montreal.\nAttorneys for the defendant, respondent: Brais, Campbell, Mercier & Leduc, Montreal.\n1 [1957] Que.

In such an action, a- condemnation to pay a sum of money can only be made when the action has been transformed into a contestation of accounts. Cousineau et al. v. Cousineau et al., [1949] S.C.R. 694; Racine v. Barry, [1957] S.C.R. 92, referred to.\nHusband and wife\u2015Separate as to property\u2015Wife's property administered by husband\u2015Liability to account\u2015Nullity of discharge given by wife\u2015Civil Code, arts. 1265, 1425, 1918.\nThe plaintiff, a married woman separate as to property, whose husband had undertaken, in the marriage contract, to provide alone for the family expenses, asked her husband, through her attorney, for an accounting of his administration, as curator and mandatary, of assets, including immoveables, which had been donated to them as joint property after their marriage. Following this demand, the parties signed two documents. By the first one, the husband undertook to pay his wife $150 as a monthly alimentary pension. By the second, made the following day, the wife acknowledged receipt of a sum of money in settlement of all claims which she might have under her marriage contract and by reason of his administration of her assets and gave him a final release and discharge of any claims she might have against him; she further agreed that certain immoveables, still jointly owned by the parties, should be administered by the husband and the net revenue divided equally every six months.\nAn action, based on the first document, was instituted by the wife to recover arrears on the monthly allowance. The action was dismissed by the trial judge on the ground, inter alia, that the document, having had the effect of altering the marriage covenants of the parties, was a violation of art. 1265 C.C., and, therefore, null. There was no appeal from that judgment.\nSubsequently, the wife instituted the present action for an accounting in which she asked that the second document be set aside and that her husband be ordered to account, and in default to pay the sum of $25,000. The action was dismissed by the trial judge but maintained by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed in part; the husband should render an account within 90 days, and in default the wife might proceed to have one made up, but the alternative condemnation should be struck out.\nBoth documents being part of the same transaction, the annulment of the first had the effect of annulling the second. Consequently, the husband must render an account since he had the administration, as curator and mandatary, of assets of his wife.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, reversing the judgment of Montpetit J. Appeal allowed in part.\nC. A. Geoffrion, for the defendant, appellant.\nJohn Ahern, Q.C., for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTaschereau J.:\u2015La demanderesse-intim\u00e9e all\u00e8gue dans sa d\u00e9claration, telle qu'amend\u00e9e, qu'elle a \u00e9pous\u00e9 le d\u00e9fendeur le 26 octobre 1910, sous le r\u00e9gime de la s\u00e9paration de biens, et qu'en vertu du contrat de mariage intervenu, le d\u00e9fendeur s'obligeait seul aux frais de m\u00e9nage, d'entretien et de pension de la future \u00e9pouse, ainsi que de tous les enfants \u00e0 na\u00eetre de ce mariage. A ce contrat de mariage sont intervenus Joseph Brisebois et Dame Philom\u00e8ne Latour, qui ont fait donation \u00e0 leur fille adoptive, ainsi qu'au d\u00e9fendeur-appelant, de certains biens ainsi d\u00e9crits:\n(a) un lot de terre situ\u00e9 en la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al ayant front sur la rue St-Laurent, connu et d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant la moiti\u00e9 du lot 1138 de la subdivision officielle du lot primitif 11 aux plan et livre de renvois officiels du village incorpor\u00e9 de la C\u00f4te St-Louis; (b) deux lots de terre situ\u00e9s \u00e0 Cartierville, \u00e9tant les subdivisions 49 et SO du lot 86 aux plan et livre de renvois officiels de la paroisse de St-Laurent;\n(c) un lot de terre situ\u00e9 \u00e0 Cartierville, connu et d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant la partie nord de la subdivision num\u00e9ro 48 du lot primitif num\u00e9ro 86 aux plan et livre de renvois officiels de ladite paroisse de St-Laurent;\n(d) un lot situ\u00e9 sur la rue St-Denis \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, connu et d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme partie sud du lot 394 de la subdivision officielle du lot primitif num\u00e9ro 8 aux plan et livre de renvois officiels du village incorpor\u00e9 de la C\u00f4te St-Louis;\nCes propri\u00e9t\u00e9s avaient une valeur globale de $11,300.\nQuelques ann\u00e9es apr\u00e8s, soit en avril 1913, par acte pass\u00e9 devant Me J. B. Latour, notaire, ces propri\u00e9t\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9troc\u00e9d\u00e9es par les \u00e9poux Chartrand auxdits Joseph Brisebois et Dame Philom\u00e8ne Latour, et le m\u00eame jour, devant le m\u00eame notaire, par acte de donation entre vifs, lesdits Joseph Brisebois et Dame Philom\u00e8ne Latour ont fait de nouveau donation \u00e0 la demanderesse et au d\u00e9fendeur chacun pour une moiti\u00e9 des biens mentionn\u00e9s aux paragraphes (a), (b), (c) et (d) (sauf un lot situ\u00e9 sur la rue St-Denis), ainsi que d'un piano se trouvant dans le domicile des donataires, et d'une somme de $200 en argent. Comme l'intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait mineure, le d\u00e9fendeur agissait comme son curateur.\nIl est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que le d\u00e9fendeur-appelant a toujours administr\u00e9 seul la part des biens de la demanderesse, les a vendus, \u00e9chang\u00e9s et a investi le produit de ces transactions dans d'autres propri\u00e9t\u00e9s, dans des commerces, a transport\u00e9 certaines de ces propri\u00e9t\u00e9s au nom de certains enfants des deux parties, et a fait enregistrer au nom de l'intim\u00e9e la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 portant le num\u00e9ro 6728 rue St-Denis \u00e0 Montreal.\nEn octobre 1946, l'intim\u00e9e, par l'entremise de Me Meunier, avocat, a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appelant un compte de l'administration des biens qu'il avait g\u00e9r\u00e9s pour elle, et en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette demande, le demandeur sugg\u00e9ra que dans le but de mettre la famille d'accord et d'\u00e9viter des frais consid\u00e9rables, il vendrait une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 situ\u00e9e sur la rue St-Laurent et une autre situ\u00e9e sur la rue Clarke, et diviserait le produit net de ces ventes avec l'intim\u00e9e sur remise r\u00e9ciproque d'une quittance finale.\nLa demanderesse-intim\u00e9e, sans s'engager \u00e0 donner une quittance, approuva la suggestion de la vente des deux propri\u00e9t\u00e9s ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9es, et la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la rue St-Laurent fut en cons\u00e9quence vendue au cours du mois d'avril 1947, mais il est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que la part revenant \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e comme produit de cette vente, qui \u00e9tait de $5,494.58, ne lui fut pas remise \u00e0 la date o\u00f9 l'appelant l'a re\u00e7ue, et qu'il garda cette somme jusqu'au 3 septembre 1947.\nEntre la date de ladite vente, soit depuis le mois d'avril 1947 jusqu'au 3 septembre de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e, la demanderesse-intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend que l'appelant tenta d'obtenir une quittance de la demanderesse, sans lui rendre aucun compte de son administration, disant qu'il ne remettrait pas la somme de $5,494.58 \u00e0 moins d'obtenir une quitttance, et sans avoir l'obligation de fournir une reddition de comptes.\nEn plus, comme partie du r\u00e8glement propos\u00e9, il offrit de payer \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e une somme de $150 par mois comme pension alimentaire pour elle et ses enfants, et aussi comme r\u00e8glement de toute solde qui pourrait \u00eatre due \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e, comme cons\u00e9quence de l'administration des biens par l'appelant. L'intim\u00e9e aurait enfin consenti \u00e0 transiger avec l'appelant de la fa\u00e7on suivante, afin d'en arriver \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement final.\nLes parties devaient se donner une quittance mutuelle; la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la rue St-Denis et les meubles qui la garnissaient, enregistr\u00e9e au nom de la demanderesse, devaient lui rester; la moiti\u00e9 du produit de la vente de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la rue St-Laurent, soit la somme de $5,494.58, devait \u00eatre pay\u00e9e \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e; les revenus de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 portant les num\u00e9ros civiques 6481 \u00e0 6485 de la rue Clarke et 20 \u00e0 28 rue Beaubien est, devaient \u00eatre partag\u00e9s en parts \u00e9gales \u00e0 tous les six mois; et enfin, l'appelant devait signer un engagement par lequel il s'obligeait de payer \u00e0 la demanderesse la somme de $150 par mois.\nLa demanderesse-intim\u00e9e all\u00e8gue que cet arrangement fut ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 en partie par le d\u00e9fendeur-appelant, mais qu'il a fait d\u00e9faut de verser la somme de $150 par mois au mois de mars 1948, et qu'il ne remit pas, depuis le 3 septembre 1947, \u00e0 la demanderesse sa part compl\u00e8te dans les revenus nets de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 situ\u00e9e sur la rue Clarke, coin de la rue Beaubien.\nLa demanderesse-intim\u00e9e dut alors se pourvoir en justice pour faire condamner son mari \u00e0 lui payer la somme de $150 par mois qu'il s'\u00e9tait engag\u00e9 \u00e0 payer, mais cette action fut rejet\u00e9e le 29 mars 1949 avec d\u00e9pens, parce que la Cour a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 l'engagement du d\u00e9fendeur, en date du 3 septembre 1947, de payer ainsi la somme de $150 par mois comme nul, en violation de l'art. 1265 C.C., comme constituant un changement aux relations matrimoniales des parties.\nL'intim\u00e9e soutient que sans cet engagement du 3 septembre 1947, elle n'aurait jamais sign\u00e9 la quittance en faveur de l'appelant, que d'ailleurs elle ne l'a sign\u00e9e que par esprit de sacrifice, dans le but d'\u00e9tablir la paix dans la famille pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des parties et de leurs enfants. Il est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 en outre que l'appelant a fait d\u00e9faut de s'en tenir aux engagements qu'il avait pris le 3 septembre 1947, qu'il a abandonn\u00e9 l'intim\u00e9e, et ne lui a pas fourni un seul sou depuis le mois de f\u00e9vrier 1948.\nDurant treize ans, le d\u00e9fendeur aurait fait commerce et y aurait tenu un restaurant pendant deux ans o\u00f9 l'intim\u00e9e a travaill\u00e9, et il ne lui a rien pay\u00e9 comme salaire ou part de profits, et c'est la pr\u00e9tention de l'intim\u00e9e que la quittance du 4 septembre 1947, est nulle comme constituant un changement aux conditions matrimoniales des parties.\nL'appelant serait aujourd'hui propri\u00e9taire d'immeubles d'une valeur exc\u00e9dant $50,000. Il admet que la demanderesse est propri\u00e9taire de la moiti\u00e9 de la valeur de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 situ\u00e9e au coin des rues Clarke et Beaubien. Il lui a pay\u00e9 la moiti\u00e9 de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 situ\u00e9e sur la rue St-Laurent, soit $5,494.58, et il a fait enregistrer au nom de la demanderesse-intim\u00e9e la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la rue St-Denis qui vaut au plus $15,000.\nL'intim\u00e9e all\u00e8gue qu'elle n'a pas re\u00e7u sa part du capital et des revenus administr\u00e9s par l'appelant, qu'elle n'a jamais re\u00e7u de compte de cette administration, et elle demande l'annulation de la quittance donn\u00e9e par elle le 4 septembre 1947, une reddition de comptes d\u00e9taill\u00e9e et affirm\u00e9e sous serment de la gestion de l'appelant comme curateur et subs\u00e9quemment comme mandataire depuis sa majorit\u00e9, et \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de se conformer dans le d\u00e9lai voulu, elle demande une condamnation personnelle contre l'appelant d'une somme de $25,000, pour tenir lieu de reliquat en outre des int\u00e9r\u00eats, et sans pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 ses droits de r\u00e9clamer les objets qui peuvent lui appartenir.\nL'honorable Juge Montpetit si\u00e9geant \u00e0 la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, a rejet\u00e9 cette action en reddition de comptes le 20 avril 1953, chaque partie payant ses frais, mais la Cour du Banc de la Reine2, le 10 juillet 1956, a unanimement cass\u00e9 ce jugement; a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 nulle la quittance sign\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e en faveur de l'appelant le 4 septembre 1947; a ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appelant de rendre \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e un compte 'd\u00e9taill\u00e9 et affirm\u00e9 sous serment de sa gestion comme curateur, et subs\u00e9quemment comme mandataire, et au cas de d\u00e9faut par l'appelant de se conformer \u00e0 cette ordonnance, tel que prescrit, soit dans les 90 jours, de payer \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e la somme de $19,305.42 pour tenir lieu du reliquat de compte, avec int\u00e9r\u00eats de la mise en demeure, soit du 17 octobre 1946, avec les d\u00e9pens.\nIl ne fait aucun doute que l'appelant Chartrand a administr\u00e9 les biens de son \u00e9pouse intim\u00e9e, d'abord comme curateur jusqu'\u00e0 la fin de l'\u00e9mancipation, et apr\u00e8s la majorit\u00e9 en sa qualit\u00e9 de mandataire. Il a eu en mains des biens substantiels, et en vertu de la loi, qu'il s'agisse de sa qualit\u00e9 de curateur ou de sa qualit\u00e9 de mandataire, il doit rendre compte. Mais il refuse, et oppose \u00e0 la demande, la quittance du 4 septembre 1947, qui se lit ainsi:\nPROVINCE DE QU\u00c9BEC\nDISTRICT DE MONTR\u00c9AL COUR SUP\u00c9RIEURE\nNo. 248641\nDAME ANGELINA TREMBLAY-CHARTRAND\nREQU\u00c9RANTE\n\u2015vs\u2015\nFREDERIC CHARTRAND\nINTIM\u00c9\nLa requ\u00e9rante reconna\u00eet par les pr\u00e9sentes avoir re\u00e7u ce jour, de l'intim\u00e9, par ch\u00e8que de ses procureurs, la somme de cinq mille quatre cent quatre-vingt-quatorze dollars et cinquante-huit sous ($5,494.58), en r\u00e8glement complet et final de toute r\u00e9clamation qui pourrait lui r\u00e9sulter en vertu de son contrat de mariage, ainsi que de tout reliquat de compte qui pourrait lui \u00eatre d\u00fb par ledit intim\u00e9, par suite de l'administration et de la gestion des biens de la requ\u00e9rante.\nLa requ\u00e9rante reconna\u00eet avoir re\u00e7u une reddition de comptes verbale de son mari et lui donne par les pr\u00e9sentes quittance compl\u00e8te, g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et finale de toute r\u00e9clamation qu'elle pourrait avoir contre lui, en raison de son administration et de sa gestion d'affaires.\nIl est convenu qu'\u00e0 compter du premier mai mil neuf cent quarante-sept (1er mai 1947), les revenus de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 portant les num\u00e9ros civiques 6481-6485 Clarke et 20-28 Beaubien est, seront partag\u00e9s en parts \u00e9gales, \u00e0 tous les six mois, \u00e0 compter du premier novembre prochain, d\u00e9duction faite des d\u00e9penses qui auront \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9es durant les six mois, l'intim\u00e9 devant s'occuper de l'administration de ladite propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nSign\u00e9 \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, ce 4 septembre 1947\n(Sign\u00e9) ANGELINA TREMBLAY CHARTRAND\nT\u00e9moin:\n(Sign\u00e9) J. A. MEUNIER\nREN\u00c9 DURANLEAU\nCette quittance faisait suite \u00e0 un engagement sign\u00e9 par l'appelant le 3 septembre de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e, par lequel l'appelant s'engageait \u00e0 payer $150 mensuellement \u00e0 son \u00e9pouse afin, dit-il, de ramener la paix dans son foyer, et l'une des conditions \u00e9tait que l'intim\u00e9e devait avoir \u00e0 sa charge tous les comptes de la maison, et en un mot s'occuper du budget familial.\nComme l'ont dit le juge de premi\u00e8re instance et M. le Juge Bissonnette, \u00e9crivant le jugement de la Cour du Banc de la Reine3, ces deux documents ne font qu'un seul et m\u00eame contrat. Il s'agit d'une transaction en vertu de laquelle les parties ont voulu pr\u00e9venir une contestation \u00e0 na\u00eetre, au moyen de concessions et de r\u00e9serves faites par les deux parties (1918 C.C.).\nDans son action, l'intim\u00e9e invoque la nullit\u00e9 de la quittance et all\u00e8gue que son mari, comme cons\u00e9quence de menaces, lui a extorqu\u00e9 sa signature, et qu'il discontinua au bout de quelques mois, soit en mars 1948, de payer la somme mensuelle de $150. L'intim\u00e9e institua donc des proc\u00e9dures judiciaires pour faire condamner l'appelant actuel \u00e0 lui payer la somme de $150 par mois qu'il s'\u00e9tait engag\u00e9 \u00e0 payer, mais cette action fut rejet\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens, et il fut d\u00e9clar\u00e9 par la Cour que l'engagement de l'appelant en date du 3 septembre 1947 de payer \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e cette somme de $150 mensuellement \u00e9tait nul en violation de l'art. 1265 C.C. En vertu de cet article, en effet, il ne peut \u00eatre fait aux conventions matrimoniales contenues au contrat aucun changement pas m\u00eame par don mutuel d'usufruit, lequel est aboli.\nM. le Juge Caron, qui a rendu jugement dans cette cause, en est venu \u00e0 la conclusion que cet \u00e9crit du 3 septembre \u00e9tait nul, comme contraire \u00e0 l'art. 1265 C.C., qu'il ne peut affecter en rien les obligations du mari envers sa femme, vu que tous deux restent toujours soumis \u00e0 l'obligation de nourrir, d'entretenir et d'\u00e9lever leurs enfants, ainsi qu'\u00e0 celle de se donner mutuellement secours et assistance, d'apr\u00e8s les arts. 165 et 173 C.C., et qu'une semblable action ne peut \u00eatre institu\u00e9e lorsque les \u00e9poux font vie commune. Sans me prononcer sur la valeur juridique de ce jugement, il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9 en appel, et il constitue chose jug\u00e9e. Il s'ensuit logiquement que si cet \u00e9crit du 3 septembre 1947, en vertu duquel le mari s'est engag\u00e9 \u00e0 payer \u00e0 son \u00e9pouse la somme de $150 par mois, est nul, et comme il ne constitue qu'un seul et m\u00eame contrat avec la quittance du 4 septembre, cette derni\u00e8re se trouve \u00e9galement inexistante, et l'appelant doit rendre compte de son administration. Il est \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire, en effet, que la reddition de comptes est due par ceux qui administrent les biens d'autrui \u00e0 quelque titre que ce soit. Ainsi doivent des comptes, tout mandataire ou g\u00e9rant, tuteur, h\u00e9ritier b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire, curateur, ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire, s\u00e9questre, associ\u00e9, fiduciaire, etc. etc., et l'une des conditions essentielles pour qu'une telle personne soit comptable, est qu'elle ait eu l'administration des biens de l'oyant-compte.\nJe voudrais cependant signaler que je ne comprends pas cette pratique dans une action en reddition de comptes, de demander que le d\u00e9fendeur qui a administr\u00e9 les biens soit, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de rendre compte, oblig\u00e9 de payer un reliquat. Je sais que cela peut arriver, \u00e0 cause d'une jurisprudence constante \u00e0 cet effet, lorsque les parties ont transform\u00e9 l'action en reddition de comptes, en un v\u00e9ritable d\u00e9bat de comptes. Mais lorsque le d\u00e9fendeur refuse de rendre compte, pour le motif qu'en droit il n'en doit pas, ou qu'il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 obtenu une quittance, comme dans le cas actuel, il me semble impossible de condamner ce d\u00e9fendeur au paiement d'un reliquat \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de reddition, avant qu'il ne soit prononc\u00e9 sur le droit \u00e0 la reddition, que les comptes aient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablis, et qu'un reliquat soit d\u00fb par le rendant-compte. L'action, dans le cas qui nous occupe, n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 transform\u00e9e en d\u00e9bat de comptes, et je crois, en cons\u00e9quence, que l'appelant ne peut pas \u00eatre condamn\u00e9 au reliquat de $19,305.42. Cousineau et al. v. Cousineau et al.4; Racine v. Barry5. Le Code de proc\u00e9dure est bien pr\u00e9cis \u00e0 ce sujet, et l'art. 566 C.P. nous dit que tout jugement qui ordonne une reddition de comptes doit porter un d\u00e9lai pour ce faire, et c'est dans ce d\u00e9lai que le rendant compte doit le rendre nominativement \u00e0 la personne qui y a droit; il doit le produire au greffe dans le temps fix\u00e9, avec les pi\u00e8ces justificatives. L'oyant-compte doit en prendre connaissance et produire ses d\u00e9bats de comptes, et si le d\u00e9fendeur n\u00e9glige de rendre compte, le demandeur lui-m\u00eame peut proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l'\u00e9tablir \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re apport\u00e9e aux arts. 568 et 578, et c'est alors que l'on peut voir s'il existe ou non un reliquat.\nJe comprends difficilement l'argument que sur une action en reddition de comptes, il faut condamner le d\u00e9fendeur \u00e0 un reliquat, parce qu'autrement, le jugement ordonnant cette reddition serait inefficace, n'\u00e9tant pas susceptible d'ex\u00e9cution. Si, \u00e0 l'expiration du d\u00e9lai imparti, le compte n'est pas rendu, c'est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment l'art. 578 C.P. qui r\u00e8gle le cas, et qui permet au demandeur de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 \u00e9tablir les comptes, et \u00e0 faire d\u00e9clarer que le reliquat existe.\nDe plus, il est plus que probable que le montant du reliquat \u00e9tabli par la Cour d'Appel6 est inexact, car on ne semble pas avoir tenu compte de l'art. 1425 du Code Civil qui se lit ainsi:\nLorsque la femme s\u00e9par\u00e9e a laiss\u00e9 la jouissance de ses biens \u00e0 son mari, celui-ci n'est tenu, soit sur la demande que sa femme peut lui faire, soit \u00e0 la dissolution du mariage, qu'\u00e0 la repr\u00e9sentation des fruits existants, et il n'est point comptable de ceux qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consomm\u00e9s jusqu'alors.\nDans le pr\u00e9sent cas, il s'agit \u00e9videmment d'un mandat tacite, et, comme le dit Mignault, vol. 6, p. 402, cette disposition se justifie par les relations intimes qui existent entre les parties, et par le fait que la femme, laissant \u00e0 son mari une administration qu'elle pourrait lui enlever, indique qu'elle approuve l'usage que le mari fait des revenus qu'il per\u00e7oit. En effet, la femme peut toujours reprendre, quand elle le d\u00e9sire, l'administration de ses biens. Si elle laisse administrer le mari, il est juste que celui-ci, \u00e0 la dissolution du mariage, ou plus t\u00f4t sur la r\u00e9vocation de ce mandat tacite, ne doive rendre \u00e0 sa femme que les fruits existants. La loi suppose avec raison que s'il existe des fruits, le mari doit en rendre compte, mais au contraire, s'ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consomm\u00e9s, il y a pr\u00e9somption qu'ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9s dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat du m\u00e9nage, et le mari n'en est pas comptable.\nJe suis donc d'opinion que le pr\u00e9sent appel doit \u00eatre maintenu en partie avec la modification ci-dessus. L'appelant devra donc rendre compte \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de sa gestion comme curateur et subs\u00e9quemment comme mandataire de l'intim\u00e9e, dans les 90 jours du jugement \u00e0 intervenir, mais sans \u00eatre tenu au paiement de la somme de $19,305.42 \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de rendre ce compte. Dans ce cas, il appartiendra \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e, suivant les dispositions de l'art. 578 du Code de proc\u00e9dure civile, de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l'\u00e9tablissement des comptes, tel que pr\u00e9vu aux arts. 568 et suivants.\nL'intim\u00e9e aura droit \u00e0 ses frais en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et en Cour du Banc de la Reine, mais il n'y aura pas d'ordonnance quant aux frais devant cette Cour.\nAppeal allowed in part without costs.\nAttorney for the defendant, appellant: P.
